Witten is an American neuroscientist and Associate Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience within the Princeton Neuroscience Institute at Princeton University in New Jersey. Witten studies the midbrain dopaminergic reward circuitry, with a focus on the striatal neural circuit mechanisms driving reward learning and decision making. == Early life and education == Witten grew up in Princeton, New Jersey, where her parents were both professors at Princeton University. Her father, Edward Witten, was a theoretical physicist and professor of mathematics at Princeton University, and her mother, Chiara Nappi was a professor of physics. Witten attended Princeton High School in her hometown and then stayed close to home attending Princeton University for her undergraduate education. Witten's sister, Daniela Witten, was also a high achieving student, and pursued an undergraduate degree in Math and Biology at Stanford University. At Princeton, Witten majored in physics, but it was during her undergraduate degree that she became fascinated by biology, specifically neuroscience. During her first year at Princeton, Witten worked as a research assistant in the lab of Lee Merrill Silver, studying molecular biology and genetics. Later in her undergraduate degree, Witten joined the lab of Michael J. Berry, where she conducted research towards her undergraduate thesis in computational neuroscience. Her undergraduate honors thesis was titled ‚ÄúTesting for Metabolic Efficiency in the Neural Code of the Retina‚Äù and was awarded by the department of physics. Witten graduated from Princeton with an A.B. in Physics in 2002. Inspired by her undergraduate research experiences, Witten pursued her graduate education in neuroscience at Stanford University in 2003. Under the mentorship of Eric Knudsen, Witten explored the neurobiological mechanisms of attention and strategies of information processing in the central nervous system of owls. === Sensory Information Processing in Barn Owls === Prediction is a fundamental neural computation performed by the brain to mediate appropriate behavioral responses to changing and uncertain environments. In Witten's early graduate work, she explored how a specific neural circuit in the barn owl predicts the location of motion auditory stimuli. The optical tectum is an area of the barn owl brain that helps to orient an owls gaze towards an auditory stimulus, and this is enabled by neurons encoding information from the auditory system to make a topographic map of auditory space. Witten wanted to understand how this topographic map changes when auditory stimuli are moving. She found that auditory receptive fields both sharpen and shift with stimulus position, showing that auditory fields make predictive shifts to track the location of auditory stimuli. Witten then became interested in exploring how the brain detects a singular object when it must integrate a variety of sensory stimuli and information from various channels. Using a Hebbian Plasticity model, Witten proposed that the synaptic plasticity underlying object detection and representation in the brain results from the difference in spatial representations of one type of input relative to that of another. She found that the amount of plasticity for each channel of sensory input depended on the strength and the width of the receptive field for that channel. With stronger inputs guiding plasticity, this could account for the development and maintenance of aligned sensory representations in the brain. === Using Optogenetics to Dissect Reward Circuits === After defending her PhD in 2008, Witten stayed at Stanford to conduct her postdoctoral studies in the lab of Karl Deisseroth. Under Deisseroth's mentorship, Witten learned how to use optogenetic technologies to dissect genetically defined cell types within neural circuits, and Witten's particular interest was cholinergic neurons in the brain's reward circuitry. In a first author paper in Science, published in 2010, Witten dissected the role of cholinergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens which, although they make up only 1% of the local neurons, play significant roles in modulating circuitry and driving behavior. She further found that these cholinergic interneurons were activated by cocaine administration, yet silencing them lead to increased medium spiny neuron activity in the NaC and prevented cocaine conditioning in mice. Witten's finding highlighted the critical role such a small population of neurons can play in mediating behavioral outcomes. Since inhibition of cholinergic interneurons in the striatum ameliorated drug-induced conditioning, Witten and Deisseroth filed a patent for the use of optogenetic technologies in cholinergic interneurons in the NAc or striatum. They proposed to first use the technology to better understand reward behaviors and addiction in rodent models, and later to target specific neural circuits in the treatment of addiction disorders in humans through the administration of opsin encoding polynucleotides into the striatum. Through optical or electrical stimulation, this technology would enable temporally-precise treatment strategies for those suffering from addiction. Witten then wanted to apply optogenetics to rat models to explore neural reward circuitry, so she created Th::Cre and Chat::Cre driver lines in rats. With these novel driver lines, Witten injected viruses to express Cre-dependent opsins in the rat brain to clarify the causal relationship between dopamine neuron firing and positive reinforcement in her novel rate driver lines. Witten did confirm that stimulating Ventral Tegmental Area Dopamine neurons in Th::Cre rats did produce intracranial self- stimulation which highlighted the power of her tool for dissecting specific neural circuits in rats using optogenetics, which was previously not possible. Witten continued to explore cholinergic circuits in the striatum and the role of dopamine neurons in driving reward behaviors throughout her time in the Deisseroth Lab and became co-author on many papers during her four-year tenure in the lab. == Career and research == After a successful postdoctoral experience in the Deisseroth Lab, Witten was recruited to Princeton University, her alma mater, in 2012 to become an Assistant Professor in of Psychology and Neuroscience within the Princeton Neuroscience Institute and Department of Psychology. Witten started her lab at Princeton and was dedicated to exploring the neural circuits driving reward learning and decision making in rodent models. Through the use of techniques like optogenetics, rodent behavior, electrophysiology, imaging, and computational modeling, Witten and her team are able to discover novel mechanisms by which striatal and other reward circuitry drive behaviors. In 2018, Ilana was promoted to Associate Professor and granted tenure at Princeton University. In addition to her role as a principal investigator, Witten is a member of the committee for PNI graduate student admissions, a member of committee to select URMs for PNI summer program, a member of the committee for redesigning the graduate student curriculum, as well as many other committee roles to support her Princeton neuroscience community. Witten also teaches many classes at Princeton and is a member of BRAIN CoGS (Circuits of Cognitive Systems), a 7-lab NIH funded project to understand how working memory function underlies decision making. === Dissecting Reward Circuitry === In 2016, Witten and her team at Princeton published a paper looking at the distinct functions of different populations of midbrain dopamine neurons defined by their striatal target region. They found that dopamine neurons that project to the ventral striatum have stronger responses to reward consumption and reward predicting cues where as the dopamine neurons that project to the dorsomedial striatum respond robustly to contralateral choices. Though both subpopulations displayed reward-prediction error, Witten's findings show that distinct dopamine terminal input locations support specialization of function in the striatum. Continuing to study striatal neurons implicated in reward learning, Witten returned to findings from her postdoctoral work on cholinergic striatal interneurons to probe the connection between their activity profiles, synaptic plasticity, and reward learning. Witten and her team found that activity of cholinergic neurons regulates extinction learned cocaine-context associations. Further, cholinergic neurons mediate a sustained reduction in presynaptic glutamatergic input into the medium spiny neurons of the striatum. This work highlighted, for the first time, the modulatory role of cholinergic interneurons in the striatum. === Circuits Encoding Social and Spatial Information === Since social interaction is intrinsically rewarding, Witten became interested in shaping part of her research program around understanding social information processing within the dopaminergic reward system. In 2017, Witten and her team explored a unique subset of prelimbic (PL) cortical neurons implicated in social behavior that project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), amygdala, and ventral tegmental area. Interestingly, activation of the PL-NAc projection lead to decreased social preference, so Witten and her team sought to understand what information this projection was conveying. They found that it conveyed both spatial and social information that allowed the formation of social-spatial associations to guide social behavior. === Diverse Dopamine Neuron Encoding === Witten and her colleagues then dissecting the dopaminergic neurons in the VTA more rigorously. Though these neurons are canonically associated with reward circuitry, they have been implicated in various other behavioral variables, so Witten was interested in looking at their ability to encode reward, reward predicting cues, reward history, spatial position, kinematics, and behavioral choice. Through in vivo calcium imaging, Witten and her team found functional clusters of VTA DA neurons associated with both reward associated and non-reward associated variables, and these neurons were also spatially clustered within the VTA. == Awards and honors == * 2017 Daniel X Freedman Prize for Exceptional Basic Research * 2017-2022 NYSCF-Robertson Neuroscience Investigator Award * 2017-2022 Simons Collaboration on the Global Brain Investigator * 2017-2022 Co-PI on BRAIN Initiative U19 * 2015-2019 NIH R01 (from NIMH) 2015 PNI Innovation Award * 2014-2016 McKnight Scholars Award in Neuroscience * 2014-2017 Co-PI on BRAIN Initiative U01 * 2014-2015 NARSAD Young Investigator Award * 2014 Award from Essig and Enright ‚Äô82 Innovation Fund * 2013-2017 Pew Scholarship in the Biomedical Sciences * 2013-2015 Alfred P.

The project was initially announced during the 2018 Victorian State Election by the State Government. It includes the electrification of two currently existing regional lines to Melton and Wyndham Vale, as well as Fast Rail to Geelong, and other network capacity upgrades. The project will allow for much higher capacity on the Western Corridor. The electrification to Melton is part of Stage 3 of the PTV Network Development Plan. $100 million is being invested in detailed planning and design work, to deliver the full separation of regional and metro services on the Geelong and Ballarat lines. Staging of the works part of the plan are being done alongside the business case for the Melbourne Airport Rail Link. ==History== The Western Rail Plan was originally announced by the Andrews Labor government just over a month before the 2018 Victorian state election, as a part of many rail projects announced through that campaign. However, one aspect of the plan, High Speed Rail to Geelong, was proposed by the Victorian Liberals on 3 October 2018, around two weeks before the Andrews Government announced the Western Rail Plan. Plans for electrification were originally put forward by PTV in the 2012 Network Development Plan, which suggested that the line should be electrified to Melton within the next 15 years. Wyndham Vale electrification was at Stage 4, which meant the project would take place within 20 years, but it was eventually added into stage 3 in the revised plan. There was a joint push for electrification conducted by councils along the Melton railway line in May 2018, around 6 months before the 2018 Victorian state election.This push involved 6 local councils along the Ballarat Line, being Brimbank, Melton, Moorabool, Ballarat, Ararat and Pyrenees. They called for electrification, 12 peak hour (electric) trains from Melton and services every 20 minutes off peak by 2026, and for 10 car trains and trains every 10 minutes at all non peak times by 2030. A publication by the City of Brimbank warned that if these measures were not put in place, there would be chronic overcrowding. ==Project Description== ===Melton Electrification=== Part of the line between Melton and Deer Park was duplicated, as part of the Regional Rail Revival Project, which provisioned for future services and electrification. Electrification of the Ballarat rail line to Melton would potentially triple its carrying capacity, and will allow up to 1500 people to travel on a single train. The Melton line will also be quadruplicated as part of the electrification in order to separate regional and metropolitan services. Three level crossings located in Deer Park and Ardeer are going to be removed to allow for a higher frequency for trains to run on the line. There are plans for a proposed train station at Mt.Atkinson, as well as a train station servicing the Paynes Road Precinct. ===Wyndham Vale Electrification=== The line to Wyndham Vale connecting to Geelong was originally built as part of the Regional Rail Link Project, with the two new stations Wyndham Vale and Tarneit opening on 21 June 2015. Since the opening of these two stations there has been patronage growth of 131%. There are provisions for several proposed stations at Truganina, Sayers Road, Davis Road and Black Forest Road. Like the Melton electrification, there will be quadruplication of the line, in order to separate regional and metropolitan services. A link between Wyndham Vale and Werribee is also being considered as part of the project, with the potential for that link to become part of the Suburban Rail Loop. ===High Speed Rail to Geelong=== The proposal for high-speed rail to Geelong came not too soon after the completion of the Regional Rail Link Project, in which the line to Geelong via Wyndham Vale and Tarneit was originally created. Early investigations as a part of the project will focus on more frequent and more reliable regional services, dedicated rolling stock capable of speeds around 250-300km/h, more than anything currently operating in Victoria, and a new transport superhub at Sunshine to facilitate better integration of rail services. The high speed rail would enable a 32 minute journey between Geelong and Melbourne. Daniel Bowen, spokesman for the Public Transport Users Association, said the high- speed train project would boost regional development, and relieve overcrowding and delays on citybound trains from the west. Daniel Andrews' government gave $50 million to develop the business case. The federal government has also promised to provide $2 billion, provided the Andrews Government matches that investment. ==Analysis and Criticism== The primary aim of the project is to deal with the significant demand on the growing western corridor, which for the last decade has been growing exponentially, particularly upon completion of the Regional Rail Link, which provided a route into the City for growing outer Western suburbs such as Tarneit and Wyndham Vale, having previously had little to no public transport options at all. It aims to solve this issue by electrifying the lines to Melton and Wyndham Vale in order to take pressure off crowded regional trains, as well as high speed rail to Geelong in order to cut down travel times between the growing Geelong and the CBD. The project has been welcomed by local councils along the lines affected by this project, as well as major transport thinktanks such as the Rail Futures Institute and the PTUA. However, the project has been criticised for its slowness, with some saying the projected 2032 completion date was too long. There has also been worries displayed by Geelong and Wyndham councils that they will be underserved if the new suburban services have to share tracks with trains as part of the Melbourne Airport rail link. Some are also concerned that the growing community of Bacchus Marsh will not be served by the electrification. Rail Futures Institute president John Hearsch said electrification beyond Melton would be necessary to meet the growing populations of Ballarat and Bacchus Marsh. ==See also== *Melbourne Airport Rail Link - Being done alongside Western Rail Plan ==References== Category:Proposed railway lines in Australia Category:Railway lines in Melbourne * Category:Public transport in Melbourne ","title":"Western Rail Plan"},{"id":"63754529","text":"Nemesio ‚ÄúTotoy‚Äù S.

He was the founder of the Salesian Oblates of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, a female religious institute of pontifical right. Due to accusations that were proved false many years after, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith condemned Mgr. Cognata to be dismissed of his condition of Bishop on 20 December 1939. Monsignor Giuseppe Cognata in Easter 1962 was reinstated by Pope John XXIII in the Episcopate, after the true came out. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith announced on 17 February 2020 that Pope Francis has given consent to open the Cause of Beatification of Mons. Giuseppe Cognata, S.D.B. == Life == Giuseppe Cognata was born in Agrigento on 14 October 1885 in an important family of his region with great Catholic tradition, especially from his mother. === Priesthood === At 12 years old, Giuseppe entered the Saint Basil Salesian School of Randazzo in Sicily and also applied for a vocational following as a priest among the order of Don Bosco, among a bitter opposition from his father and grandfather. He made perpetual profession as a religious man on 5 May 1908 in Saint Gregory of Catania in front of the Rector Major of the Salesians, Blessed Michael Rua. The following year, on 29 August 1909, he received priestly ordination in Acireale. He had already successfully achieved a double degree in literature and philosophy and therefore began to work as a professor and assistant. From Sicily, he was then transferred to other Salesian houses in the Veneto and Marche regions. During the First World War, as many religious young men, Giuseppe was recruited as a soldier in Palermo, Trapani, Padua and precisely in Trapani in a military guise, where he laid the first foundations of the Salesian work which he was called to direct a few years later, after the war. He distinguished himself in various apostolic activities, becoming \\"all things to all\\", always tireless, ready for every instance, always mild and smiling. He raised a church dedicated to Mary Help of Christians almost out of nowhere, dedicated himself with zeal and commitment to the school and the oratory (youth centre). From Trapani he was then called to direct the college of Randazzo, then that of Gualdo Tadino in Umbria, and finally he was director of the \\"Sacro Cuore\\" in Rome, where today is the Main Salesian headquarters. === Bishop === On 16 March 1933 Pope Pius XI appointed him bishop of Bova, a particularly poor and disadvantaged Calabrian diocese: a real \\"mission\\" on Italian soil, on a human, civil, cultural, religious and spiritual level. It was in fact made up mainly of small towns, lost in the mountains, devoid of roads, water, bread, school and priests. Now the diocese is united in perpetuity with that of Reggio Calabria. He received episcopal ordination the following 23 April in the basilica of the Sacred Heart in via Marsala in Rome from Cardinal August Hlond, metropolitan archbishop of Gniezno and Pozna≈Ñ, co- consecrating the bishop of Sutri and Nepi Luigi Maria Olivares and the titular bishop of Farsalo and auxiliary of Palermo Romolo Genuardi. Through steep paths and mule tracks, Monsignor Cognata, who had chosen the Pauline expression \\"Caritas Christi, urget nos\\" as his episcopal motto, wanted in perfect missionary style to visit and comfort not only all the villages of the diocese, but also groups of poor families. scattered here and there in the most remote and inaccessible places, in the mountains of Bova or in the valleys of Amendolea. He committed himself on the purely human and social field but above all he worked on the spiritual level with courage and charity, with trust in the unfailing help of Providence. Man of faith and prayer, open to the breath of the Spirit of God, he created a pious society of generous young women, willing to work with courage and joy, in the smallest, most remote, most abandoned centres. Thus was born the Congregation of the Oblate Salesian Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Bova Marina on 8 December 1933. The new institute, raised by Providence in the wake of the Salesian spirit, with a specifically pastoral and missionary purpose in aid of the local Church, developed in a few years with a rich flowering of vocations, spreading not only in the two dioceses of Bova and Reggio Calabria, but also in other areas of Calabria, Sicily and Lazio. === Accusation and Restoration === In 1940 the Congregation of the Holy Office condemned Monsignor Cognata to the removal from episcopal dignity following a trial. The charges were initially not revealed and it was only recently discovered that he was falsely accused of molesting three nuns. He therefore had to resign as bishop of Bova. He went far, precisely to a Salesian community in Castello di Godego, living for long years in silence and solitude, separated from his spiritual daughters. He lived in various Salesian communities, especially in Northern Italy, carrying out the service of confessor and spiritual guide. The order of the Oblate Salesians of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, despite its great poverty, continued to grow and expand. Monsignor Giuseppe Cognata, in Easter 1962, was reinstated in the episcopate by Pope John XXIII. He thus participated in the second, third and fourth sessions of Vatican II by the will of Pope Paul VI. On 6 August 1963 he was appointed titular bishop of Farsalo. On 29 January 1972 he had the joy of knowing his institute decorated with the decree of praise by the Holy See, with which he became an institute of pontifical right. === Death and Cause of Beatification === Mgr. Cognata died on 22 July 1972, the same year that his founded Institute was recognised by the Holy See. He passed away Pellaro di Reggio Calabria, the initial seat of the missionary activity of the Oblates. His remains rest in the generalate of the Oblate Sisters in Tivoli. On 18 April 2020 the Congregation for the Causes of Saints announced that Pope Francis accepted the name of Mgr.

In a typical ABS concept, the selling company forms a target audience, then divides it into narrow segments to offline selling. ==History== Emerged in the mid-2010s as a further development of account-based marketing (ABM) strategy, hyper-segmented sales are considered one of the youngest strategies. However, according to research and consulting company Gartner, from 2020 ABS will be the basis of sales for most technology vendors, and the volume of this market will exceed $5 billion per year. The ABS concept was developed for use in the B2B industry, where an average of 6.8 people make purchasing decisions. ABS increases sales volumes by involving all key persons in the transaction, offering them targeted presentation content that takes into account only their business interests. ==Differences from account-based marketing== Broad industry marketing is not targeted enough to attract the right segment of the target audience. The account-based marketing (ABM) strategy is managed by the marketing department and has a number of limitations. For example, corporate transactions often involve several decision makers, and presentation materials must be prepared for each of them. Contact provided by ABM strategy does not guarantee the continuation of business negotiations. Implementation of ABM strategy provides for lead generation in offline sales, ABS strategy provides for transformation of leads into sales. ABS strategy implies teamwork of all departments involved in sales of goods or services, primarily sales and marketing departments, as well as corporate coaches and top management. Instead of traditional scenario and template work, ABS departments adapt their activities to specific microsegments of the target audience, focusing on personalized interaction with multiple stakeholders. This is not a quantitative approach, but a qualitative one, which considers each microsegment of the target audience as a market. ABS takes into account the microsegments that have been identified by ABM and develops them to generate income. With this strategy, an individual approach is developed that takes into account the interests and pain points of the decision maker. ABS is considered a tool to bridge the gap between marketing and sales departments. Since ABS strategy involves going beyond the initial sales, it is used to scale up companies and increase sales volumes. ==See also== *Customer relationship management *Account-based marketing == References == Category:Sales Category:Marketing ","title":"Account-based selling"},{"id":"63754688","text":"thumb Saint Mary‚Äôs College of Catbalogan, formerly known as Sacred Heart College, is a private catholic school run by the RVM (Religious of the Virgin Mary) sisters.

In subsequent years, \\"Kushibiki and Arai organized Japanese villages and tea gardens at the Atlanta Cotton States Exposition (1895), Atlantic City (1896-1900), the Buffalo Pan-American Exposition (1901), the South Carolina Inter-State and West Indian Exposition at Charleston (1902), Coney Island‚Äôs Luna Park (opened May 1903), the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis (1904), the Alaska‚ÄìYukon‚ÄìPacific Exposition in Seattle (1909) and the Panama‚ÄìCalifornia Exposition at San Diego‚Äôs Balboa Park (1915),\\"Edward Marx, Yone Noguchi: The Stream of Fate (Santa Barbara, Botchan Books, 2019), I: 323. along with the San Francisco Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition (1915) and Japan‚ÄìBritish Exhibition (1910). ==Chicago, Atlanta, Nashville, Omaha== Chicago (1893) Omaha (1898) Aside from the names and dates of expositions in which they participated, there are few descriptions of what sorts of work Kushibiki and Arai actually did at the expositions they organized, but it can be surmised that they operated as independent entrepreneurial managers or contractors in a style somewhat reminiscent of Professor Risley and his so- called Imperial Japanese Troupe, or Tannaker Buhicrosan's Japanese Village at Knightsbridge, London. Kushibiki worked well with both American and Japanese associates, with excellent collaboration skills and little need for recognition. It was five years before they received any attention in the American press, but five years after that, Kushibiki was declared \\"undisputedly the best Japanese showman in America.\\" For the Atlanta Cotton States and International Exposition, September to December 1895, Japanese commissioner M. Fujisawa requested and received a place off the Midway for a \\"high class\\" attraction.Theda Perdue, Race and the Atlanta Cotton States Exposition of 1895 (Athens: U of Georgia Press, 2010), 123-4. Japan was winning the Sino-Japanese War and hoped for international recognition. But the stratagem failed. \\"The Japanese Village, though located in another part of the park, may be considered a part of the anthropological display of the Midway group,\\" wrote a local historian.Walter Gerald Cooper, The Cotton States and International Exposition and South, Illustrated (Atlanta: Illustrator Company, 1896), 90-1.https://archive.org/details/cottonstatesint00coop/page/90/mode/2up Although the Japanese exhibits at the 1897 Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition at Nashville were omitted from its official guidebook, they were at least spared the indignity of the racist depiction of the Chinese Village with its \\"queer creatures that are almost savages\\" and theater of \\"crude acting and dancing.\\"The Official guide to the Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition and City of Nashville (Nashville: Marshall & Bruce, 1897), 90.https://archive.org/details/officialguidete00tenn/page/90/mode/2up/ Nor could Kushibiki attract much attention on the Midway at the Omaha Exposition in 1898, where \\"the German Village, the Streets of Cairo, the Temple of Palmistry, the Japanese Tea-Garden, and a hundred others, offer their various tempting delights.\\"The Omaha Exposition,\\" Self Culture 8:3 (Nov. 1898): 262. ==Atlantic City, gardens, nurseries, and landscaping== Atlantic City (1896) Morris Arboretum In addition to their exposition work during this period, Kushibiki and Arai also ran a Japanese tea garden and nursery in Atlantic City.\\"Kushibiki, the Japanese Barnum, Will Import Nippon Art for the World's Fair,\\" St. Louis Republic, 7 June 1903, I:8, states it ran \\"from 1895 to 1900.\\" \\"The Story of Atlantic City's Japanese Merchants ,\\" The Oriental Economic Review 1:3 (10 Dec. 1910): 52-3, states that it was opened \\"in 1896 with a capital of approximately $3,000,\\" and closed in 1902. In 1902 it was replaced by Arthur Irwin's bicycle racing track. And they took on private landscaping commissions. In 1899 they were hired to construct a fernery (now part of the Morris Arboretum) for wealthy Philadelphia siblings John and Lydia Morris. \\"To create the distinctive subterranean grotto ambiance, Morris hired Japanese garden makers Kushibiki and Arai to arrange one hundred tons of local Wissahickon schist into rockery formations resembling a cave or mountain cliff accented by delicate waterfalls, a flowing stream bed, and a goldfish pond. Once the plants took hold on the rocky surfaces, entering the fernery felt like a journey through a personal terrarium.\\" The garden contained \\"about one thousand ferns, representing 523 different varieties,\\" and was considered \\"one of the finest displays of filmy ferns (Hymenophyllaceae) in cultivation.\\"Anne S. Cunningham, Crystal Palaces: Garden Conservatories of the United States (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton Architectural Press, 2000), 49-50. ==Arai's films and the Kawakami tour== Kawakami Otojiro and Sadayakko In 1896 Kushibiki and Arai returned to Japan, to recruit talent for current and future projects, and bringing along two of what would be Japan's first motion picture projectors. Arai had \\"bought two Vitascopes and a dozen films\\" from the Edison Company and began screening in early February in Asakusa.Daw-Ming Lee, \\"How Cinema Arrived and Stayed in Taiwan,\\" Early Cinema in Asia, ed. Nick Deocampo (Bloomington: Indiana UP, 2017), 131. In March Arai arranged screenings at the Kawakami-za in Kanda, a modern Western-style theater opened the previous year by actor- playwright Kawakami Otojir≈ç. Kawakami's meeting with Kushibiki at the event would have far-reaching effects. \\"Kushibiki,\\" according to Joseph Anderson, \\"had been looking for his next Japanese novelty. He proposed a tour to Kawakami that would 'introduce the New Theatre to American ladies and gentlemen.'\\" Kawakami hoped to travel to Paris to perform with his troupe at the 1900 Paris Exposition. \\"At the very least, such a trip could help pay Kawakami's expenses for getting to the exhibition in Paris.\\"Joseph L. Anderson, Enter a Samurai: Kawakami Otojir≈ç and Japanese Theatre in the West, 2 v. (Tucson: Wheatmark, 2011), 1:84. In February 1899, Kushibiki visited the Kobe hospital where Kawakami was convalescing after an illness. On March 1, the Miyako Shimbun, a Kyoto newspaper, reported that Kawakami planned to leave in 20 days with his wife Sadayakko, niece Tsuru, and an 18-member troupe.Miyako Shimbun, quoted in Anderson, Enter a Samurai, I:40. Before their departure, Kushibiki \\"left suddenly for San Francisco ahead of the Kawakami company with the explanation that he was called back early because his Atlantic City enterprise was in trouble and he was not feeling well.\\"Anderson, Enter a Samurai, I: 44. The Kawakami troupe arrived in San Francisco on May 21 to find that \\"Kushibiki was not there to take care of them as he promised. He had had a major loss in his business and could no longer afford to sponsor them. So he handed them over to a Japanese lawyer named Kosaku Mitsuse, who became their manager.\\"Lesley Downer, Madame Sadayakko: The Geisha who Bewitched the West (New York: Gotham Books, 2003), 102. They were also surprised to find that Kushibiki had featured Sadayakko as the troupe's main attraction. \\"There was no getting out of it, concluded Yakko. She was going to have to be an actress.\\"Downer, Madame Sadayakko, 94. Kushibiki's choice of manager proved disastrous: within weeks Mitsuse had driven the troupe into bankruptcy through mismanagement and outright theft. But their eventual success was largely the result of Kushibiki's promotion of Sadayakko as actress. By the time they returned to Japan she was recognized as a major international star. ==New York== In 1901, Kushibiki organized \\"Fair Japan\\" at the Buffalo, New York Pan-American Exposition that ran from May to November. On the morning of July 27, running to catch a moving trolley car to the Exposition grounds, he had a tragic mishap. Slipping, his left leg caught under the wheels, and had to be amputated just below the knee. The Buffalo Evening News, reporting the story, described Kushibiki as \\"one of the best known among the Pan-American concessionaires.\\" When gangrene set in, a second operation was performed. \\"At first it was thought he stood but small chance of recovery,\\" but \\"a strong constitution pulled him through.\\" At the end of August he was still hospitalized; \\"his partner, Mr. Arai, has had charge of the Japanese village, and a monster benefit has been prepared in behalf of Kushibiki.\\" Finally, on September 26, Kushibiki, making his first appearance at the Exposition since the accident, \\"hobbled through the Midway on crutches. In spite of his misfortune he was as philosophic and debonnaire as ever.\\"Buffalo Evening News, 24 Aug., 27 Aug., 30 Aug. 26 Sept. 1901, reprinted in Doing the Pan, ed. Susan J. Eck (accessed 25 Apr. 2020) https://panam1901.org/midway/fair_japan/kushibiki_july27.htm Pan-American Exposition - The Midway, Looking North.jpg Pan-American Exposition - A Scene in Fair Japan.jpg Pan-American Exposition - Fair Japan and Geisha Girls.jpg Kushibiki had little time to lose in organizing his next \\"Fair Japan\\" in Charleston for the South Carolina Inter-State and West Indian Exposition, set to open on December 1, 1901. \\"A Japanese rock garden, complete with Bonsai trees, waterfalls, and bridges, was recreated inside the Fair Japan concession. A typical tea house with quaint booths was attended by geisha girls. There was also a theatre where actors, jugglers, and tumblers entertained fairgoers. Price of admission was 15¬¢; admission to the theatre was 15¬¢ extra.\\"Anthony Chibarro, The Charleston Exposition (Charleston: Arcadia Publishing, 2001), 75. The exposition continued until June 20, 1902. Luna Park, Coney Island, 1903 F.W. Vanderbilt's Tea Room Kushibiki had at least three New York projects underway in the summer of 1903. The first was a Japanese Village and Japanese Gardens for Luna Park, an amusement park on Coney Island whose feature attraction was A Trip to the Moon, a popular ride debuted at the Buffalo Exposition two years earlier. The second was a \\"Japan by Night\\" installation and concession for the rooftop garden at Madison Square Garden, created to accompany a Japanese-themed play, Otoyo. Japanese writer Yone Noguchi worked as a curio-seller, ‚Äúdoing a pretty good business, selling things between 7 and 12 dollars a night,‚Äù and stayed through the summer, as it was ‚Äúawfully jolly to do such a thing upon the roof full of fresh air and music.‚ÄùMarx, Yone Noguchi, I:324. Kushibiki's third New York project was a set of Japanese-style buildings for railroad millionaire Frederick William Vanderbilt's summer camp in the Adirondacks at Upper St. Regis Lake. ==St. Louis and Portland== St. Louis (1904) Kushibiki's major project for 1904 was the Louisiana Purchase Exposition held in St. Louis from April 30 to December 1, 1904. The St. Louis Exposition received unprecedented support from the Japanese government: $400,000, plus $50,000 from the Japanese colonial government of Formosa, and over $250,000 in Japanese commercial and regional government investments. A large garden featured a replica of Kyoto's famous Kinkakuji.Hajime Hoshi, Handbook of Japan and Japanese Exhibits at World's Fair (St. Louis: Hajime Hoshi, 1904), 112.https://archive.org/details/handbookjapanan00unkngoog/page/n118/mode/2up In another part of the grounds was \\"Fair Japan on the 'Pike' ... a private concession controlled by the Fair Japan Company, which was organized by Y. Kushibiki, S. Arai, and several prominent business men of St. Louis.\\" Visitors passed through a large Ni≈çmon-style gate, said to be a \\"reproduction of the famous portal at Nikko,\\" built at a cost of $25,000.Hoshi, Handbook of Japan and Japanese Exhibits at World's Fair, 125.https://archive.org/details/handbookjapanan00unkngoog/page/n130/mode/2up Hoshi also claimed the original gate had been \\"erected about 300 years ago ... in the Province of Hidachi by Lord Satake Giobu-Tayu in memory of his father.\\" The exposition would prove to be especially important because the Russo- Japanese War, which began on February 8, 1904, remained in progress through the whole of the exposition. In April, Kushibiki announced that thirty geisha had embarked from Yokohama and were expected to arrive about April 25.\\"Geisha Girls on Way,\\" St. Louis Republic, 9 Apr. 1904, 13.https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84020274/1904-04-09/ed-1/seq-13/ Japanese Pavilion and Gardens at the 1904 World's Fair.jpg Japanese Restaurant in Fair Japan on the Pike at the 1904 World's Fair, 25 June 1904.jpg Japanese Ensemble (Japanese Reservation) (1904 World's Fair).jpg Kushibiki's popularity in St. Louis was mentioned in the local press both before and during the exposition.

Twenty-six members of the Japan Commission at the St. Louis exposition‚Äîa president, vice-president, eleven commissioners, six experts, three secretaries, and four attaches (for the most part, government officials, diplomats, and experts with academic credentials)‚Äîare named in the exposition's Official Directory, but Kushibiki and Arai are not among them.Official directory of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, World's Fair, Saint Louis, 1904, (St. Louis: Woodward & Tiernan, 1904), 61-2.https://archive.org/details/officialdirector00loui/page/60/mode/2up/ But at his next exposition‚Äîthe Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition held in Portland, Oregon the following year‚ÄîKushibiki was appointed as one of Japan's three Commissioners. In an unusual honor, he was also appointed Second Vice- President of the Executive Commissioners' Association, making him the only non-American member of the exposition's executive committee.Official Directory of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition (Portland, 1905), 40, 41.https://archive.org/details/officialdirector00lewi/page/38/mode/2up/ By the time the exposition opened on June 1, just days after the Japanese navy destroyed the remains of the Russian fleet in the Tsushima Straits, Japan was celebrating imminent victory in the Russo-Japanese War. ==Jamestown, Jacksonville, and Seattle== Seattle (1909) Arai Saburo was not among the Portland commissioners. In 1904, he had become interested in Texas rice production after the Southern Pacific Railroad and the Houston Chamber of Commerce invited Japanese farmers to the region. During the St. Louis Expo, he visited Houston, the center of the rice industry. \\"His report was favorable, and there was divided among the Japanese colony at St. Louis a rice plantation in Matagorda county, Tex., covering 8,000 acres.\\"\\"Mme.

Arai moved to El Campo, grew oranges and figs, and moved again to Alvin and Genoa. His Genoa nursery proved successful, and he remained in the business for decades.Thomas K. Walls, The Japanese Texans (San Antonio: University of Texas Institute of Texan Cultures at San Antonio, 1987), 124-27. In January 1906 Kushibiki could be found in Venice, California organizing fireworks and \\"installing an extensive exhibit of the art goods of Japan.\\"Los Angeles Herald, 11 Jan. 1906, 7. The following year, he was in Virginia, serving as Commissioner General of the Japanese exhibit at the Jamestown Exposition. By January of 1908 he had moved the Jamestown Japanese exhibits to Jacksonville for the Florida International Exposition, where he held the prestigious position of Director General. The 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in Seattle had been originally planned for 1907 but postponed to avoid conflicting with the Jamestown Exposition. The exposition ran from June 1 to October 16. The extensive Japanese architecture at the Expo included a Japanese torii gate design at the south entrance with totem pole style pillars with illuminated eyes.

The Exhibition, which ran from 14 May to 29 October 1910, was run by Imre Kiralfy's Exhibition Company, but as Ayako Hotta-Lister writes, After the exhibition ended, Kushibiki went to Paris. The Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© franco-japonaise de Paris describes one garden party he organized for the Franco-Japanese Society on 10 May 1912, with jujitsu, koto and violin music, art, acrobatics, bonseki and refreshments. (Due to insufficient time, the final tea ceremony had to be omitted).Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© franco- japonaise de Paris (June 1912): 127-28.https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k9682760s/f147.image ==San Francisco== San Francisco (1915) Two California cities, San Diego and San Francisco, proposed expositions celebrating the 1914 opening of the Panama Canal. San Francisco, a much larger city, won federal and state support, but San Diego pushed on by raising private funding. The resulting similarly-titled Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition and Panama‚ÄìCalifornia Exposition ran simultaneously for most of 1915. Kushibiki helped organize the San Francisco Exposition, assisted by a $50,000 subsidy from the Japanese Government.\\"Japan Beautiful,\\" 344. The Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition took place in what is now San Francisco's Marina District. Most of its buildings and grounds, including Kushibiki's Japanese installations, were subsequently dismantled, among them, replicas of the Great Buddha of Kamakura and the Kinkakuji temple at Kyoto. But several structures, including a pagoda and a temple gate, were moved to the Japanese Tea Garden in Golden Gate Park created for the California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894, which still remains in operation. ==American legacy== The impact of the work of Kushibiki and Arai on American perceptions of Japan was enormous. Hundreds of millions of people visited the expositions they organized. Parts of some of the buildings and gardens organized by Kushibiki and Arai are still in existence, though most have been lost due to age, fire, war, vandalism, and changing tastes. The gardens and tea-houses at Jackson Park, Chicago, Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, Golden Gate Park, San Francisco still bear traces of their work.

Returning to Japan, he reversed his usual strategy and sought to bring exotic American attractions such as aviators and famous baseball players to Japan. His success was limited. He served as manager for air shows by aviators Art Smith and Katherine Stinson in 1916-17. But a plan to bring Babe Ruth and the New York Giants to Japan in 1920 did not happen. Nor did a planned American tour for popular naniwabushi singer Yoshida Naramaru in 1917. In 1920, the Japan Chronicle reported that \\"a man giving his name as Kushibiki Yumindo\\" was in talks with the city of Osaka about \\"a grand pleasure ground to be called the 'American Park.'\\" The editor concluded that \\"the report seems rather doubtful so far as its plans are concerned.\\"\\"Local Recreations,\\" Japan Weekly Chronicle, 23 Sept. 1920.

His brother Arthur became a landscape painter; his sister Ann Mary became a portrait painter, and married the archaeologist Charles Thomas Newton. Walter was sent in 1843 with his brother Arthur to Westminster School, and from an early age showed a fondness for art. In 1852 he entered the Civil Service, and was for thirty- three years an officer in the education department. Meanwhile, he took a lively interest in varied branches of art. In 1857, with his friend Charles Eastlake, he started the making of art furniture. In 1865 he made a vigorous effort to resuscitate the almost forgotten craft of art needlework and embroidery, for skill in which he earned medals in South Kensington and much encouragement from John Ruskin. His leisure was chiefly devoted to landscape painting in water-colours. Fifty of his water-colours were exhibited in 1874 at Agnew's Gallery in Bond Street. The most popular of his works, Our Boys, circulated widely in an engraving. He made illustrations for Lord Houghton's poem Good Night and Good Morning in 1859; he illustrated The Golden Calendar (c.1864) and The Order for Morning and Evening Prayer (1873). ===Dudley Gallery Art Society=== In 1865 Severn instituted the Dudley Gallery Art Society. The Old Water Colour Society had lately rejected his brother Arthur when he applied for membership. The Institute of Painters in Water Colours also seemed to Severn too exclusive. He accordingly called a meeting of fifty artists at his brother's house, when Tom Taylor, art critic of The Times, took the chair, and the Dudley Gallery Art Society was the outcome. Exhibitions were held annually at the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly until its demolition in 1909, when they were continued in the new building erected on the site of the hall. The artists who sent pictures included Albert and Henry Moore, George Dunlop Leslie, Edward Burne-Jones, and George Frederic Watts. The merit of the Dudley Society's exhibitions led the Institute of Painters in Water Colours in 1883 to elect several of its members en bloc, including Severn's brother Arthur, but not himself. Severn was elected president of the Dudley Society in 1883, and held office until his death on 22 September 1904 at Earl's Court Square. ==Family== He married in 1866 Mary Dalrymple, daughter of Sir Charles Dalrymple Fergusson, 5th Baronet, and they had five sons and one daughter. Their son Claud Severn became a colonial administrator. ==References== Attribution * ==External links== * A Stag Hunt (1858) by Walter Severn at the Royal Collection Trust Category:1830 births Category:1904 deaths Category:People educated at Westminster School, London Category:19th-century English painters Category:English watercolourists Category:19th-century British civil servants ","title":"Walter Severn"},{"id":"63754830","text":"Solon is the surname of: * Camille Solon (1877‚Äì1960), British muralist and ceramist, son of Marc-Louis Solon * Ewen Solon (1917‚Äì1985), New Zealand-born actor * John Solon (1842‚Äì1921), American politician * Jose Solon (), Filipino politician * Laura Solon (born 1979), English screenwriter, comedian and actress * L√©on-Victor Solon (1873‚Äì1957), English painter, ceramist and graphic artist, son of Marc-Louis Solon * Lorin Solon (1892‚Äì1967), American college football player * Marc-Louis Solon (1835‚Äì1913), French porcelain artist * Sam Solon (1931‚Äì2001), American politician * Sheila Solon (born c. 1959), American politician * Steve Solon, Filipino politician first elected Governor of the province of Sarangani in 2013 * Thomas F.

Witnesses nearby reported that the aircraft trailed smoke before plummeting onto the ground. The aircraft crashed and bursted into flames at the privately owned Agojo Resort in Pansol, Calamba, Laguna near the foothills of Mount Makiling, killing all nine occupants aboard and injuring two others on the ground. Among the dead were a patient being transported and his wife. Debris from the aircraft landed in separate locations of the subdivision.

Wameyo was born in Kenya and migrated to Australia with her family in 2006, when she was seven years old. She has performed at Laneway and Groovin' the Moo festivals, and was a featured artist with Triple J Unearthed. She is signed with the independent record label created by her mentor, Gabriel Akon, aka DyspOra, Playback 808. After being nominated in the Best New Artist and Best World Music categories at the 2018 South Australian Music Awards, Waneyo won people's choice Best Hip Hop. Lady Leshurr, Masego and the Hilltop Hoods have shown interest in her music, and she has also played alongside Adrian Eagle and Printz Board. Her work is informed by her strong belief in God, and she sees her talent as a gift from God. Although she does not feel her African roots to be a huge influence on her music, the response to her music in Kenya was enthusiastic when Akon took samples to the country. Her first single, \\"Intuition\\" was released in early 2018. This was followed by \\"Outcast\\" (November 2019) and \\"Pastor\\" (February 2020), which will feature on an EP later in the year. \\"Outcast\\" tells a personal story, largely based on the experience of growing up as an African in Australia, and the effect that racism has had on her and her peers. Both singles received positive reviews. It also explores the concept of \\"home\\" for African Australians. She spent some time travelling over the northern winter in 2019‚Äì2020, in Europe, the US and Kenya, during which she had a break from songwriting. Her 2020 single, \\"Pastor\\" uses an upbeat rhythm to explore feelings of anger, as she explores identity and belonging from the point of view of her parents, migrating to Australia. She was studying full-time at university as of 2019, and also singing in her church. ==References== Category:Australian hip hop musicians Category:Australian women Category:Kenyan emigrants to Australia Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Elsy Wameyo"},{"id":"63755009","text":"Mari Hamada Live Tour 2016 \\"Mission\\" is a live video by Japanese singer/songwriter Mari Hamada, released on February 22, 2017 by Meldac/Tokuma Japan.

He became the patriarch of the Bristol branch of the family; he was a merchant and slave trader. *James DeWolf (1764 ‚Äì 1837), son of Mark Anthony DeWolf. He was one of the richest men of his time, making the majority of his fortune in the slave trade. * General George W. DeWolf (1778 ‚Äì 1844), a grandson of Mark Anthony DeWolf. He was a slave trader and the original owner of Linden Place. *Capt. John DeWolf (1779 ‚Äì 1872), a grandson of Mark Anthony DeWolf through his son Simon DeWolf. He was also known as John DeWolf II and \\"Norwest John\\". After many years exploring the coast of Alaska and the Northwest on the board of the ship Juno, he crossed the Pacific Ocean, then Siberia all way to St. Petersburg, Russia, by land, becoming the first American who crossed Asia. He captured this 1804‚Äì1807 expedition in his 1861 book A Voyage to the North Pacific and a Journey through Siberia More Than Half a Century Ago. *Mark Antony De Wolfe Howe (1808 ‚Äì 1895), a great-grandson of Mark Anthony DeWolf through Abigail (DeWolf) Ingraham (1755 - 1833), one of Mark Anthony's daughters. He was an Episcopal priest and later first Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Central Pennsylvania, the present-day Episcopal Diocese of Bethlehem. *Theodora Goujaud DeWolf Colt (1820-1901), a daughter of George DeWolf. She was a published poet. She is credited with restoring Linden Place into one of the most famous mansions in New England. She was mother of LeBaron Bradford Colt and Samuel P. Colt. *Charles DeWolf Brownell (1822 ‚Äì 1909), son of Lucia Emilia DeWolf Brownell, granddaughter of Mark Anthony DeWolf. He was an American painter, best known for his landscape views. *Mark Antony De Wolfe Howe Jr. (1864 ‚Äì 1960), one of the sixteen children of Mark Antony De Wolfe Howe.

He served as a surgeon at the rank of Lieutenant Commander in U.S. Navy.The Military Surgeon, Vol. XXXVI, No. 2, February 1915 *Charles Dana Gibson (1867 ‚Äì 1944) was an American illustrator. === Legacy === DeWolf avenue in Bristol, Rhode Island is named after the DeWolfs. In total, the Bristol DeWolfs are believed to have transported more than 11,000 slaves to the United States before the African slave trade was banned in 1808. == DeWolfs of Nova Scotia == In 1761, three of Balthazar DeWolf's descendants, Simeon, Nathan and Jehiel DeWolf, with households amounting to 19 persons immigrated to Horton Township, Nova Scotia, to settle in the Grand Pre area. Evelyn M. Salisbury's genealogy published in 1892 identified the three men as cousins and it also appeared in A. W. H. Eaton's, History of Kings County, despite Eaton's efforts to change some parts of Salisbury's genealogy. In 1991 the publication of Dophs and De Wolfs by Carol Stark Maginnis after extensive research of original sources, reviewing the correspondence between Rev. Eaton and Mrs. Stainsbury, and examining the research of the Lyme Study Group, concluded the men were three sons of Benjamin DeWolf Sr. (born in October 1695), who was a son of Steven and grandson of Balthazar. This matches Eaton's original belief the Nova Scotia family were descendants of Steven DeWolf, which had been disregarded in Salisbury's work, and which he then unfortunately copied in his own books. === Notable members === *Nathan DeWolf (1720 ‚Äì 29 March 1789) was born in Saybrook, Connecticut.

He was the fifth child of Elisha DeWolf. *Thomas Andrew Strange DeWolf (1795 ‚Äì 1878) was a merchant and political figure in Nova Scotia.

Arthur Wentworth Hamilton Eaton (1849 ‚Äì 1937) was a Protestant Episcopal clergyman, educator and scholar. *Vice Admiral Harry DeWolf CBE, DSO, DSC, CD (1903 ‚Äì 2000) was a Canadian naval officer who was famous as the first commander of HMCS Haida during the Second World War. *James DeWolfe (b. 1949) is a former political figure in Nova Scotia. He represented Pictou East in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1998 to 2006 as a Progressive Conservative. === Legacy === Wolfville, Nova Scotia was renamed after the DeWolf family. Elisha DeWolf, Jr. was the postmaster of the community when the postal district name became official on August 13, 1830 replacing prior names including Mud Creek and Upper Horton. It was suggested the change was out of respect for his namesake father, Elisha DeWolf. == Other DeWolfs == * Delos DeWolf (1811 ‚Äì 1882), a prominent citizen of Oswego, New York, United States, a politician and a banker. * Calvin DeWolf (1815 ‚Äì 1899), a prominent lawyer and the first secretary of the Illinois chapter of the American Anti-Slavery Society. *Joseph N.

The bay's shoreline consists mostly of pebble beaches and sparse grey mangroves. In the 2000s the bay was used for the farming of yellowtail kingfish until their closure circa 2011 in response to high levels of fish mortality. Understanding of the environmental impacts of yellowtail kingfish farming is limited. As of 2020, fish farming has not returned to Fitzgerald Bay, but aquaculture zones remain in place. == Nomenclature == Fitzgerald bay is named after a former South Australian parliamentarian and member for Port Pirie, John Christopher Fitzgerald who reportedly held strong faith for a prosperous future for the upper Spencer Gulf built on the back of iron ore mining. Prior to 1937, the bay was known by the informal name, Backy's Bay. According to old Port Augusta residents, the bay was originally named Becky's Bay by Mr McCarthy (father of Alf McCarthy) whose father was Port Augusta's first pilot and harbormaster. \\"Becky\\" was a nickname derived from Rebecca, the first name of McCarthy senior's wife. == Fish farming == Fish farming in Fitzgerald Bay began in the late 1990s at pilot scale with yellowtail kingfish, Seriola lalandi. Production increased over the next decade, then de-stocking occurred between 2009 and 2011. The bay's aquaculture were totally abandoned in 2012. In 2017, Clean Seas was aiming to restart their operations in Fitzgerald Bay and increase their production quota to 4200 tonnes from their prior quota of 2400 tonnes. While operational, fish farming became the upper Spencer Gulf's larger nutrient pollution source. == Giant Australian cuttlefish breeding aggregations == The Giant Australian cuttlefish, Sepia apama, forms mass breeding aggregations in the Upper Spencer Gulf, most notably to the southwest of Point Lowly (outside of Fitzgerald Bay). Smaller aggregations occur within Fitzgerald Bay at the northern end (Backy Point) and the southern end (to the north and south of the Point Lowly North Marina). == Historic industrial proposals == Between 1937 and 1939 the site was considered for a prospective naval shipbuilding yard. One of the site's disadvantages was a lack of power supply and Whyalla was chosen instead. In 1952, Fitzgerald Bay was chosen as a prospective site for the first nuclear power plant in the Southern hemisphere, and discussion of the prospect continued until 1954. The proposal was never formalised, though uranium-bearing ore was mined in South Australia at Radium Hill and refined at Port Pirie during the 1950s and early 1960s. Then Premier Thomas Playford described the bay as \\"very well protected and (it) has deep water close in shore. It would be close to transmission lines and it appeared to me to have every qualification necessary for the site of such a plant.\\" == References == Category:Spencer Gulf Category:Bays of South Australia ","title":"Fitzgerald Bay"},{"id":"63755063","text":"Samar's 2nd congressional district is one of the two congressional districts of the Philippines in the province of Samar.

They are sometimes referred to as bicycle barometers, but the term is misleading because it indicates the measurement of pressure. Most counting stations only consist of a sensor (and the internal computing device) and some use a display to show the total number of cyclists of the day and the current year. There are counting stations all over the world in over hundreds of cities, for example in Manchester, Zagreb, or in Portland. The first bicycle counting station was installed in Odense, Denmark, in 2002. == Persuasive Aspects == Bicycle counters are mainly being installed to assist city planning with reliable data on the development of bicycle usage. Bicycle counting stations are said to raise awareness for cycling as a mode of transportation, encourage more people to use their bicycles and give cyclists acknowledgement. There has been no representative study on the impact of bicycle counters on citizens or by-passers, but some early empirical clues that urban visualizations can \\"become appropriate communication media for sharing, discussing, and co- producing socially relevant data\\". To increase visibility, bicycle counters are mostly installed at positions with high traffic volume and visibility to a range of road users. They have been called urban visualizations and fulfill certain criteria of ambient intelligence, such as being embedded, context- aware and adaptive. Bicycle counting stations can be described as persuasive technology. > \\"Through sensing technology, a display can act as a tool that increases the > capability to capture a behavior (e.g., measuring residential energy > consumption, bicycle use, etc.); through its visual imagery, it can function > as a medium that provides useful information, such as behavioral statistics > or cause-and-effect relationships; and through its networking ability, it > can become a social actor, encouraging community-based feedback and social > interaction\\". == Technical Setup == A bicycle counter in Mannheim with pneumatic hoses to detect the number of cyclists. Narrowed passage at the Tisza Cycleway in Hungary with cameras to count cyclists. Burlington.alt= Different techniques are used for detection of bicycles, such as built in induction loops, pneumatic hoses, infrared sensing or cameras. Different setups provide different advantages such as more precise counting, battery life, reduced costs or differentiation between different road users such as cyclists, pedestrians or cars. Pneumatic tube setups are said to have an accuracy of 80%, manufacturers state a 90% accuracy for induction loops == Data == Unlike manual counting or other bicycle related interventions or citizen science, where citizens manually put in data, bicycle counting stations automatically generate citizen related data. Automatic counting systems are said to be cheaper than manual counting by people. Because of the use of communication technology in the urban context, bicycle counters can be counted as smart city technology, urban informatics or urban computing. Most of the actors who install bicycle counters, provide the number of cyclists as open data. == Criticism == There has been criticism on the precision of the counting and on the cost of bicycle counters as a waste of tax money (14000-31000‚Ç¨). == See also == Different cities, such as Bonn or Lahti mentioned cyclists that are a round number of counting (like number 100.000).

Initially raised as an infantry battalion of the East Yorkshire Regiment, it transferred to the Royal Artillery in 1942. It served as the LAA component of 46th Division in the Tunisian Campaign, at the Salerno landings, and through the Italian Campaign until it was disbanded in 1945. ==8th Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment== ::For the World War I equivalent, see 8th (Service) Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment The unit was originally formed in May 1940 as 50th (Holding) Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment, as part of the rapid expansion of the Army with wartime conscripts. On 9 October 1940 it was redesignated 8th Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment and it joined 217th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home) when that was formed on 20 October 1940.Frederick, p. 182.Joslen, p. 380. 'Home' brigades had a purely static coast defence role. 217th served in Northumbrian Area, then from 12 March 1941 became part of the Durham and North Riding County Division, deployed around Teesside.Joslen, p. 223.Collier, Map 20. During 1941 the battalions progressively left the brigade, mainly to be converted to other roles such as armour or light anti- aircraft (LAA). 8th East Yorkshires was the last remaining unit in the brigade when it left on 24 November 1941. The battalion then briefly served with 224th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home) until 15 December 1941.Joslen, p. 387. ==Anti-Aircraft conversion== The battalion was retrained as an LAA unit and officially transferred to the Royal Artillery on 1 January 1942 as 115th LAA Regiment, with 377, 378 and 379 LAA Batteries.Frederick, pp. 805, 838.Farndale, Annexes K & M. Anti-Aircraft Command was responsible for AA defence of the UK, and 115th LAA Rgt was initially included in its order of battle, but it was deleted on 23 February 1942 and joined 46th Division the following day.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/80.Joslen, pp. 75‚Äì6. 46th Division's formation sign 46th Division was a 'Second Line' formation of the Territorial Army (TA) formed just before the outbreak of war. Its virtually untrained infantry had briefly served in the Battle of France before being evacuated from Dunkirk. Lessons from that campaign and the early fighting in the Western Desert had been learned, and now every infantry division was to have its own air defence unit, equipped with 48 (later 54) towed Bofors 40 mm guns to protect against ground-attack aircraft such as the Luftwaffe 's feared Stuka. The plan was to equip one battery in each divisional LAA regiment with self-propelled guns on truck chassis, but few of these were available until later in the war.Joslen, p. 130‚Äì2.Routledge, pp. 133‚Äì4, 184. When 115th LAA Rgt joined, the division was training with XII Corps in South East England. However, in August 1942 it was transferred to First Army, which was preparing for the Allied landings in North Africa (Operation Torch).Collier, Map, 27. ==Tunisia== Bofors gun and crew in action near Tunis, May 1943. The Torch landings began on 8 November 1942, and First Army's units and formations were progressively fed into the fighting. 46th Division's 139th Brigade sailed on 24 December, accompanied by 379 LAA Bty; the rest of the division embarked on 6 January 1943 and landed on 17 January, by which time the focus of the campaign was in Tunisia. By midnight on 13/14 February, the division was in the line, holding the sector nearest the coast.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, p. 284. During the hurried reorganisation caused by the Battle of Kasserine Pass the division's brigades were split up, each with attached artillery units. When the Axis launched Operation Ochsenkopf on 26 February the main weight fell on 139th Bde on the coast, which was forced back from a number of positions over the next month. Harder fighting came against 128th Bde in the Hunt's Gap area. The division counter-attacked on 29 March and had regained all its positions by 1 April.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 326‚Äì8, 389. Moving and deploying AA guns in the rough country with underpowered gun tractors was difficult but necessary as units in the forward areas were subjected to regular dive-bombing and ground attacks. Ammunition expenditure by the LAA batteries was high, and supply was sometimes erratic. With greater experience of 'snap' actions against fast low-flying aircraft, Bofors gun units increasingly abandoned using the Kerrison Predictor in favour of the simple 'Stiffkey Stick' deflection sight.Routledge, pp. 182-4. After Eighth Army's victory at Wadi Akarit, 128th Bde was part of the force sent by First Army to cut the retreat of the Axis forces, even though Army HQ did not consider it completely ready for battle. As a preliminary to the main attack on the Fondouk Pass, it was tasked with capturing and holding crossings over Wadi Marguellil and then the high ground beyond, which it successfully achieved on 7/8 April.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 379‚Äì82. First Army began its final offensive on Tunis (Operation Vulcan) on 22 April. 46th Division attacked with strong artillery and tank support towards some hills near Sebkret el Kourzia in an effort to crack open the position for the armour to pass through. In the event the armoured formations had five days' hard fighting before they could get through. Axis air attacks were maintained until 25 April, doing considerable damage, but tailed off thereafter.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 434‚Äì6, 440‚Äì1.Routledge, pp 184‚Äì5. By early May the Axis forces were crumbling, and a final thrust (Operation Strike) took the First Army into Tunis on 7 May; the Axis forces surrendered on 13 May.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 448‚Äì57.Routledge, pp 185‚Äì6. At the end of the campaign 115th LAA Rgt claimed 58 enemy aircraft destroyed for the expenditure of 22,748 rounds (some of the rounds fired would have been against ground targets).Routledge, p. 187. ==Italy== ===Salerno=== 46th Division was assigned to Force 141 (later 15th Army Group) for the Allied invasion of Sicily but was not employed.Molony, Vol V, pp. 7‚Äì8. Instead it was used to carry out the assault landing at Salerno on the Italian mainland (Operation Avalanche) on 9 September. The division concentrated at Bizerte from its training areas in mid-August. The division was to land a brigade on beaches at the northern (left hand) end of the landing area. The beaches would be secured by specialist 'Beach Bricks' including heavy and light AA batteries, and the infantry division's own LAA batteries would then assist with beach defence as they arrived, paying particular attention to exit routes and assembly areas. In 46th Division's sector this worked reasonably well: although the invasion convoy was bombed during the preceding night and the leading infantry and Beach Brick troops landed under shellfire and into immediate firefights, the AA guns got ashore and long-range P-38 Lightning fighters kept off most Luftwaffe air attacks by day. By 23.00 46th Division was landing in waves and no counter-attack had yet developed. However, a week-long battle for Salerno and its hinterland developed, with more and more reinforcements squeezing onto the beaches, and the Luftwaffe concentrating its attacks on the beaches and shipping. Finally, on 16 September the Germans withdrew and 46th Division swung northwards towards Naples.Molony, Vol V, pp. 259‚Äì60, 274, 278‚Äì80, 284‚Äì7, 292, 318, 331.Routledge, pp. 270‚Äì3. ===Naples to the Garigliano=== 46th Division fought its way through the high ground north of Salerno, and then the armour drove across the Plain of Naples to the city itself on 1 October.Molony, Vol V, pp. 337‚Äì44. Next the force moved up for the assault crossing of the Volturno. The division's attack on the night of 12/13 October was almost unopposed except in one sector, and it had two brigade bridgeheads by nightfall on 13 October. However, this was partly because the Germans had chosen to defend the wide marshy area across the river, and meanwhile their aircraft were very active in attempting to deny the other crossings and to disrupt the bridging operations, with frequent attacks using Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 Fighter-bombers.Molony, Vol V, pp. 438, 443‚Äì4.Routledge, p. 283. Bofors gun of 379 Bty, 115 LAA Rgt, in Italy, 7 January 1944. After the Volturno, the Luftwaffe was rarely seen and AA engagements became uncommon as 46th Division worked its way up the coastal plain past Monte Camino to the German Winter Line.Routledge, p. 281.Molony, Vol V, pp. 445‚Äì6, 450. The division's next major operation was a failed assault crossing of the Garigliano on the night of 19/20 January 1944 intended to assist II US Corps crossing of the Rapido (part of the attacks on Monte Cassino).Molony, Vol V, pp. 616‚Äì7. Afterwards the division was involved in hill fighting between 26 January and 9 February, taking Monte Furlito and Monte Purgatorio but failing at Monte Faito. The attacks were then called off in rain, sleet and snow.Molony, Vol V, pp. 634‚Äì6. ===Rest and retraining=== In early 1944 Allied Armies in Italy (AAI) instituted a procedure of shipping exhausted British formations (without their equipment) to Middle East Command for rest and retraining. The first of these was 46th Division, which embarked on 16 March, arriving in Egypt on 22 March and moving up into Palestine at the end of the month. Rested and reinforced, the division retraced its journey in June, landing back in Italy on 3 July and taking over 5th Division's guns and vehicles. However, because of AAI's increasing manpower shortage, many of the infantry reinforcements were former AA gunners who had been redeployed. Even divisional LAA units like 115th LAA Rgt had to give up one troop per battery, reducing the number of guns from 54 to 36 guns. This was made possible by the near total air supremacy now enjoyed by the Allies in Italy.Molony, Vol VI, Pt I, pp. 13, 423, 448‚Äì9.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, p. 231.Routledge, p. 278. Meanwhile, the lack of AA targets meant that the Bofors guns could be used for other purposes. They were incorporated into ground defence fireplans, and were also used to harass known enemy machine guns or mortar posts, or to engage buildings and bunkers. A useful role was to fire on fixed lines to mark boundaries in an advance, the troops being able to watch the lines of tracer. Some infantry commanders requested their LAA units to 'brown' an area from which an attack seemed imminent.Routledge, p. 280. ===Gothic Line=== On its return 46th Division joined Eighth Army on the east side of Italy to take part in breaching the Gothic Line (Operation Olive). The initial operations starting on 26 August began well, with 46th Division taking the Montegridolfo village complex on 31 August and then continuing its advance to the Conca and Morciano. It then moved to clear the Croce‚ÄìGemmano high ground to protect Eighth Army's flank as it advanced on Coriano, but here the division ran into stiff opposition in the Battle of Gemmano. Only on 17 September were the Germans cleared out of their defences and Eighth Army able to close up to the next line of defences, the Rimini Line. This was taken at a rush by 21 September.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 128‚Äì30, 225, 238, 243‚Äì4, 249‚Äì51, 266‚Äì9, 277‚Äì80, 288‚Äì96. Eighth Army continued its advance, struggling as much with bad weather and swollen rivers as with stubborn enemy opposition. 46th Division was now due for a rest, having been in almost continuous operations for two months, and it was relieved in mid-October, though it was back in the line on 31 October.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 352‚Äì4, 400, 406‚Äì7, 409, 427. ==Disbandment== By now the continuing manpower crisis and the near-total absence of the Luftwaffe meant that deeper cuts were made in AA provision. In November 1944 the British infantry divisions in Italy lost their LAA regiments, with 115th LAA Rgt leaving 46th Division on 8 November. It was then disbanded on 8 January 1945 and its personnel drafted to other roles. ==Footnotes== ==Notes== ==References== * Basil Collier, History of the Second World War, United Kingdom Military Series: The Defence of the United Kingdom, London: HM Stationery Office, 1957/Uckfield: Naval & Military, 2004 . * Gen Sir Martin Farndale, History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery: The Years of Defeat: Europe and North Africa, 1939‚Äì1941, Woolwich: Royal Artillery Institution, 1988/London: Brasseys, 1996, . * J.B.M.

The Maratha army commanded by Sambhaji and Hambirrao Mohite attacked and plundered the city for three days. The Marathas got a huge loot and returned to Raigad by evading Mughal forces. == Background == Sambhaji ascended to throne after the death of his father Shivaji in 1680. He was crowned on 16 January 1681 at the Raigad Fort. His coronation ceremony was attended by more than 50,000 people. A large amount of money was spent on the function, and Sambhaji wanted to replenish his depleted treasury. The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb had finished his campaign in Rajputana and was preparing for a full-scale invasion of the Deccan Plateau. Sambhaji knew that the Maratha Empire was heading into a sustained conflict against the overwhelmingly larger Mughal Empire. He wanted to fill the Maratha treasury before the arrival of Aurangzeb in Deccan. Sambhaji also wanted to gain a psychological edge over his opponent Aurangzeb by scoring the first victory. == Maratha Plan == Sambhaji called a strategic meeting of his advisors and senior generals at Raigad, just after his coronation. Sambhaji and Maratha generals decided to attack and plunder Burhanpur as it was an important trading center and a very rich city. The Raigad to Burhanpur was more than 500 kilometres. The city was heavily fortified and guarded by a force of 8,000. Sambhaji had got the news that Bahadurkhan Kokaltash, the Subedar of Burhanpur was going to Aurangabad for his nephew's wedding with a girl from the royal family of Abul Hasan Qutb Shah. Bahadurkhan took a force 3,000 with him for the wedding. Hence Burhanpur was left with an army of 5,000 under Bahadurkhan's deputy Kakar Khan. Sambhaji and his generals decided to further bifurcate the force at Burhanpur by feigning a move to attack Surat, forcing the Mughals at Burhanpur to send reinforcement to Surat, which had been sacked by Shivaji twice before. == Sacking of Burhanpur == Hambirrao Mohite reached the forests near Burhanpur with a 15,000 strong cavalry force. Kakar Khan gathered civilian forces and decided to attack Hambirrao at midnight. As he came out of the city gates, Sambhaji himself attacked from the old trenches with a cavalry force of 4,000. Sambhaji's force routed the ill-prepared Mughal garrison. Sambhaji then left 200-300 soldiers at the main city gate and left for Bahadurpura, the richest suburb of the city. Sambhaji started to loot the houses of the richest merchants which were shown to him by his spies. Hambirrao's force soon joined Sambhaji and the combined Maratha force started looting the city. Hambirrao then sealed the city's entrances to ensure that the word of the attack doesn't spread out. Marathas looted the city consecutively for three days. Marathas earned a loot estimated to be around 2 crore rupees. The Marathas also captured the city fort and arrested Kakar Khan. Bahadurkhan got the news and immediately left Aurangabad with a large army to save Burhanpur. When Marathas heard this they immediately fled the city, as they were far away from Maratha territory. == Withdrawal of Maratha forces == Sambhaji left Burhanpur and started marching towards Raigad. Bahadurkhan left Aurangabad with a force of around 20,000 to seize the loot back from the Marathas. Sambhaji divided his forces into three parts. There were two routes to reach Raigad, a shorter one via Dharangaon-Chopda, and a longer one via Erandol. Bahadurkhan was waiting for Sambhaji's forces at the first route. Sambhaji's first division under Mulla Kazi Haider disguised as envoys took this route. Bahadurkhan arrested them all but they convinced him that Sambhaji would choose the longer route to avoid his forces. After some time the second division of Maratha force consisting of 3,000 soldiers passed via the same route without any loot. Bahadurkhan did not attack them as he was concerned with securing the loot. Bahadurkhan was convinced after seeing this force that Sambhaji has opted for the longer route and left for Erandol. Three hours after Bahadurkhan had left the first route, the entire remaining Maratha army took the loot via the same Dharangaon-Chopda route towards the Maratha stronghold of Salher. And the Marathas reached Raigad shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, Bahadurkhan had left Aurangabad hastily with a large army leaving only few soldiers in Aurangabad. Seeing this opportunity a Maratha sardar named Suryaji Jakhde attacked Aurangabad with a force of 7,000 via Paithan. Bahadurkhan immediately rushed to Aurangabad via Fardapur and Suryaji Jakhde had to retreat from the city. == Assassination attempt on Sambhaji == Aurangzeb had stationed a few of his elite horsemen, Ahadi, in every important Mughal city. Their job was to locate and kill the leader of enemy forces in case of an attack. When Sambhaji left Burhanpur for Raigad, five Ahadi horsemen from Burhanpur started to chase the returning Maratha army. Sambhaji went to Vani with a small force to visit Saptashringi temple, and was attacked, but survived the fight. == References == * Category:Military history of India Category:Wars involving India Category:17th-century conflicts Category:Wars involving the Mughal Empire Category:17th century in India Category:Conflicts in 1681 Category:Battles fought by Marathas under Sambhaji ","title":"Sacking of Burhanpur (1681)"},{"id":"63755307","text":"Arthur Ridding (16 January 1827 ‚Äì 4 September 1876) was an English first-class cricketer, educator and librarian.

Following a short period of training it went to the Western Front with other Kitchener battalions and endured a disastrous initiation at the Battle of Loos. It was then transferred to the experienced 3rd Division and fought with it on the Somme, at Arras and Ypres. After heavy casualties the battalion was disbanded early in 1918. ==Recruitment and training== Alfred Leete's recruitment poster for Kitchener's Army. On 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular British Army, and the newly-appointed Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1', and was quickly followed by 'K2' and 'K3' as a flood of volunteers poured into the recruiting offices and were formed into 'Service' battalions at the regimental depots. The East Yorkshire Regiment formed its third such battalion, the 8th (Service) Battalion, on 22 September at Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, from a draft of recruits sent from the depot at Victoria Barracks, Beverley.Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 2 & 8; Appendix I.Frederick, p. 182.James, p. 59.Wyrall, p. 24.East Yorkshires at Long, Long Trail. 21st Division's insignia. The new battalion was assigned to 62nd Brigade in 21st Division, the senior K3 division, formed from units raised in North East England, which was assembling around Tring in Hertfordshire. The men started out in billets, but the division soon moved under canvas at Halton Park. Throughout October drafts arrived from Beverley until on 4 November the battalion reached a strength of 25 officers and 1092 other ranks under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel L.C. Fryer. Mud and rain brought a return to billets for the winter, with 8th East Yorkshires housed in Wendover, Aston Clinton and Weston Turville.Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 103‚Äì9.21st Division at Long, Long Trail.Edmonds, 1915, Vol II, pp. 293‚Äì4. == Service in France == Huts had been built at Halton by the time the division returned there in May 1915, and training continued. Towards the end of June the first service rifles arrived and the men began their musketry courses. This was completed by 9 August, when the infantry began moving to Witley Camp in Surrey. Although its training was still woefully inadequate (the K1 and K2 units had taken all the best instructors and staff officers), the division soon received orders to join the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front, and advance parties left at the beginning of September. 8th East Yorkshires crossed to Boulogne on 8‚Äì9 September under the command of Lt-Col B.I. Way (North Staffordshire Regiment). By 13 September 21st Division was concentrated west of St Omer with 8th EYR billeted in Moulle. Final training took place, in route marching, bomb- throwing, sniping, and machine-gun practice, culminating in an attack on practice trenches. Less than two weeks after arrival it was thrown into a major attack at the Battle of Loos, without the men ever having visited the frontline trenches.Wyrall, pp. 81‚Äì2. ===Loos=== The battlefield of Loos. The move south to Loos was achieved by a series of night marches beginning on 20/21 September, arriving at N≈ìux-les-Mines at 23.00 on 24 September, when the men bivouacked in open fields in heavy rain. The British attack was launched at 06.30 the following morning, and at 11.15 62nd Bde was ordered up to a concentration area north of Mazingarbe. Before the men had time to eat, orders arrived for the brigade to go up to support 15th (Scottish) Division, which was believed to have captured Hill 70. The brigadier selected 8th EYR and 10th Green Howards for this task. Without time for reconnaissance all he could do was point out Hill 70 on the map and tell the battalion commanders: 'We do not know what has happened on Hill 70. You must go and find out: if the Germans hold it, attack them; if our people are there, support them; if no-one is there, dig in'. As the inexperienced battalions set out (still accompanied by their transport) they were instructed by a military policeman that according to trench routine they must open out, with intervals between sections. Spacing out the columns took time, and it was 16.30 before they crossed the old front line and headed for Loos. Shortly afterwards they came in full view of German artillery, which practically destroyed the battalion transport. Instead of going through the village of Loos and north of the Loos Crassier spoil heap, the 8th Yorkshires, followed by 10th Green Howards, passed on the south side, bumping into 1/20th Londons of 47th (1/2nd London) Division, which was holding part of the German positions. The CO of 1/20th Londons tried to stop the advance, but the two Yorkshire battalions carried on in extended lines towards Chalk Pit Copse, well south of Hill 70. A few minutes later they came under intense machine gun fire from the German-held part of the copse, 8th EYR and the leading companies of 10th Green Howards sustaining heavy casualties. In the confusion and gathering darkness some troops trying to retrace their steps and go through Loos were mistaken for attackers and fired upon by the rear companies of 10th Green Howards. It was 19.30 before Lt-Col Way and the CO of the Green Howards were able to restore order. 8th East Yorkshires, together with the remnants of the 1/19th Londons, dug in, continuing the line of 1/20th Londons over the Crassier into the outskirts of Loos village. Two companies dug communication trenches back towards the old front line, and cleared German stragglers out of Loos.Cherry, pp. 175‚Äì6.Edmonds, 1915, Vol II, pp. 296‚Äì8.Wyrall, pp. 82‚Äì5. The attack on Hill 70 was renewed next morning after an hour-long bombardment. The main attack was made by 15th (S) Division, with 62nd Bde in support. As the bombardment ended Lt-Col Way led C and D Companies (about 120 men) with a few of the Londons and a few Northumberland Fusiliers towards Hill 70. The mist suddenly cleared and they were clearly visible to the German outposts on the hill. Although some men reached the enemy trenches the lines 'withered away' (in the words of the Official History) and flanking fire forced them to retreat. The Crassier then came under shellfire, and snipers and machine guns caused steady casualties. While A and B Companies maintained their position on the Crassier until relieved the following afternoon, Lt-Col Way (who had been wounded) ordered the remainder back to the cover of the village and the support trenches where they joined 1/23rd Londons and were shelled all night. At 16.30 on 27 September the battalion went into bivouacs at Sailly-Labourse when a roll-call revealed that the battalion had lost 7 officers killed or missing and 12 wounded, 154 other ranks killed or missing and 133 wounded. Next day the battalion entrained for Liettres where it began refitting.Cherry, pp. 194‚Äì9.Edmonds, 1915, Vol II, pp. 310‚Äì4, 342.Wyrall, pp. 85‚Äì6. 3rd Division's WWI insignia. In October 21st Division went to the Armenti√®res sector, where it received training in trench warfare. The BEF now instituted a policy of exchanging units between divisions to even up training levels between formations. Each of 21st Division's brigades exchanged one of its battalions with a Regular Army brigade, and on 16 November 8th EYR transferred to 8th Bde in 3rd Division. 3rd Division was composed of Regular units that had been fighting since the early days of the war. Many of the officers and men in the ranks of 3rd Division by now were replacements with no more experience than the East Yorkshires, but the staffs and support units were very experienced, and the battalion could expect its future operations to be better planned and executed. The brigade sent the battalion's companies one by one into the front line for two days each to gain experience of trench routine. It finally took responsibility for holding its own sector (near Voormezeele in the Ypres Salient) on 29 December.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 49‚Äì55.3rd Division at Log, Long trail.Wyrall, pp. 124‚Äì5. ===Ypres Salient=== The St Eloi craters, visible in an aerial photograph taken on 1 April 1916. In early 1916 the 8th EYR, temporarily commanded by Acting Lt-Col F.B. Brewis, took its turn in the trenches near St Eloi. On 2 March part of 3rd Division made a successful attack on The Bluff and 8th Bde relieved the attackers on the night of 3/4 March. 8th East Yorkshires took over flooded trenches in terrible condition, in a snowstorm, and had to deal with two German counter-attacks. By 6 March the effective strength of the battalion had been reduced by 55 per cent as a result of Trench foot and exposure.Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, pp. 170‚Äì2. On the morning of 27 March the Royal Engineers exploded six mines under the German positions at The Mound near St Eloi and 3rd Division's 9th Bde attacked the craters. 8th Brigade was also in the line, with 8th EYR (under Lt-Col Way once more) alongside the attacking battalions. Despite the overall success, the Germans remained in possession of two of the craters and the battalion was involved in several days of shellfire and bombing attacks among the shattered trenches. After the 8th EYR were relieved by 31st Canadian Battalion on 3/4 April, the battalion's Lewis gun teams remained in the line for another week to help the Canadians, losing a number of casualties and having spent 18 consecutive days in the waterlogged positions.Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, pp. 180‚Äì6.Wyrall, pp. 131‚Äì3. ===Somme=== 8th East Yorkshires spent the following weeks alternating between resting, training, and spells in the line near Dickebusch, while preparations went on further south for that summer's 'Big Push' (the Battle of the Somme). The battalion entrained for the Somme on the day the offensive began, 1 July. It went into brigade reserve when 3rd Division took over the Caterpillar Wood sector near Montauban, providing carrying parties and night patrols. After the disasters of the first day, 3rd Division in conjunction with three others was to make a daring night assembly and dawn attack on 13/14 July (the Battle of Bazentin Ridge). The Brigade Intelligence Officer had placed a screen of picquets and scouts out in No man's land within of the enemy line and the assaulting troops slowly moved up in the hours of darkness to a sunken lane just short of this line. They then moved forwards 15 yards every 15 minutes until they were on their jumping-off tapes about from the enemy by 03.15; 8th EYR was on the right of 8th Bde's line, with half of 1st Royal Fusiliers in support. At 03.20 a sudden intense bombardment was placed on the German barbed wire and trenches and five minutes later the whole attacking line of four divisions advanced behind a Creeping barrage. Along most of the line the German resistance was feeble; unfortunately the wire in front of 8th Bde was hardly touched, there were just a few breaks in the first belt and none in the second. Two platoons of the 8th EYR managed to get through on the right, the remainder had to shelter in shell holes in front of the wire or retire to the sunken road. Lieutenant-Colonel Way was wounded in the wire and Maj Brewis came up to take temporary command once more. Later a bombing party from 2nd Royal Scots came down from the left and cleared the Germans out of the trench in front of the battalion, but of the two platoons that had penetrated, no more was heard. In what was largely a successful British attack, the battalion had suffered severely, with 8 officers killed and 11 wounded, 81 other ranks killed, 218 wounded, and 141 missing, over half the initial strength of the battalion. Even when the battalion took over the opposing trenches they were heavily shelled with high explosive (HE) and gas until they were relieved on 20/21 July.Miles, 1916, Vol II, pp. 71‚Äì2, 78‚Äì80.Wyrall, pp. 149‚Äì52. The success of 14 July left the British with an awkward salient south of Delville Wood, which was the scene of six more weeks' bitter fighting (the Battle of Delville Wood). On 23 July 8th Bde held this salient round Waterlot Farm while the rest of the division attacked Delville Wood. The brigade's contribution to the attack was to send out two strong bombing parties from 7th King's Shropshire Light Infantry (KSLI), supported by a company of 8th EYR, trying to clear along the railway towards Guillemont station and widen the salient. They made little progress and fell back to Waterlot Farm, their attack having been disrupted by another division falling back from an attack on Guillemont. 8th East Yorkshires' companies were now down to a strength of 40‚Äì50 each, but a draft of 320 reinforcements (from the Green Howards and the York and Lancaster Regiment) arrived that day. When relieved on 25 July the battalion consisted of 20 officers and 570 other ranks.Miles, 1916, Vol II, pp. 139‚Äì40; Sketch 17.Wyrall, pp. 154‚Äì6. 3rd Division went back into the line for a new attack on Guillemont on 17 August. Next day 8th EYR was loaned to 9th Bde for an attack during which the battalion bombers and B Company gained a footing in the German trenches but had to retire when the battalions on either side failed to get in. When it left the line on 20 August the battalion had suffered a further 6 officers wounded, 34 other ranks killed, 31 wounded and 46 missing. At the end of the month 8th EYR was holding trenches in the Hulluch sector and between 21 September and 5 October 3rd Division underwent training before moving back to the Somme.Wyrall, p. 176.Miles, 1916, Vol II, pp. 191‚Äì2. The last phase of the Somme offensive was the Battle of the Ancre on 13 November, a final attempt to secure better ground and observation points for the winter. 3rd Division's task was to repeat the attack on the village of Serre that had failed on the first day of the offensive, though this time it would be supported by twice as many guns. 8th Brigade attacked on the right with 8th EYR in the second line. The attacking battalions struggled through mud that was at times waist-deep, and got left behind by their protective creeping barrage. In the second line 8th EYR had the furthest to go, across of broken trench bridges and shell-torn ground before they reached the front. As they filed forwards, the German counter-barrage caught D Company coming up the rear. The battalion then followed the leading wave. Both waves struggled through gaps in the wire and across the German front line. Parties of all four battalions of 8th Bde reached the German support line, but could not maintain themselves there; others got mixed up in the confusion at the German front line. The whole mass of men was tumbled back to where they started. Zero hour had been at 05.45; by 06.30 it was clear at Brigade HQ that the battle was over. In the words of the Official History: 'the troops of the 3rd Division ... lost the battle in the mud'. 8th East Yorkshires had lost 2 officers killed and 3 wounded, 23 other ranks killed, 177 wounded and 30 missing.Horsfall & Cave, pp. 77‚Äì88.Miles, 1916, Vol II, pp. 478‚Äì9, 497‚Äì8.Wyrall, pp. 176‚Äì7, 179‚Äì81, 184. ===Arras=== British infantry using trench bridges to cross assembly trenches as they move up in support of the initial assault at Arras on 9 April. 3rd Division moved to the Arras sector in February 1917 and the 8th EYR (now commanded by Lt-Col J.N. de la Perrelle) spent several tours in the St Sauveur trenches before a short period of training for the forthcoming Arras Offensive. The battalion went into the Auckland Caves under Arras on 7 April before moving up into their assembly trenches at 02.00 on 9 April, ready for Zero hour for the First Battle of the Scarpe. In 3rd Division, 76th Bde was to capture the German first line, 9th Bde the second and 8th Bde the third or Brown Line. The attack began at 05.30 with a 'hurricane bombardment' by guns, mortars and machine guns, and 8th Bde moved out of their assembly trenches at 10.40 in order to pass through 9th Bde at Zero plus 6 hours (11.30). 8th East Yorkshires formed the brigade's second wave. At first all went well, and dozens of prisoners were taken, but after a while 8th EYR got caught up with the wave in front, and then the whole line was held up by machine gun crossfire short of the Brown Line. A second attempt was made at 19.00 and casualties mounted. The Germans made no counter-attack, so the brigade was ordered to launch a fresh attack on the Brown Line at 08.15 next morning, later put off until 12.00. The barrage came down at 11.45, all four battalions advanced in line, and this time the enemy fled, the whole Brown Line being captured by 12.30. The battalions held this line for two more days in snowy weather until the division was relieved in the early hours of 14 April.Falls, 1917, Vol I, pp. 216‚Äì7, 248.Wyrall, pp. 205‚Äì8. During the Second Battle of the Scarpe (23‚Äì25 April) 8th Bde was moved up in support of 15th (S) Division and did not join the attack.Wyrall, pp. 209, 211. Again, on 28 April, although the 8th EYR 'stood to' to support 12th (Eastern) Division at the Battle of Arleux, it was not engaged, though it suffered a number of casualties from shellfire both before and after the attack.Wyrall, pp. 213‚Äì4. The Third Battle of the Scarpe on 3 May was another matter: 3rd Division had been in the line for 10 days, although the divisional commander had managed to keep 8th and 9th Bdes relatively fresh before they took over the front line trenches on 1 May. Despite attacking before dawn there was no surprise and just before Zero (03.45) the enemy guns deluged the division's front with HE and gas shells, so the men had to wear their respirators while forming up. When it attacked, 8th Brigade fell into confusion in the darkness, partly because the enemy had pushed parties of riflemen out into shell holes in No man's land where they were missed by the barrage. 8th East Yorkshires in the second wave quickly ran into 1st Royal Scots Fusiliers (RSF) in front, who were completely held up. By the end of the day the brigade held a series of outposts in No man's land. Despite its heavy casualties ‚Äì 6 officers killed (including the Padre), one wounded, 35 other ranks killed, 161 wounded and 39 missing ‚Äì 8th EYR had to take over the line during the night from the even more shattered 1st RSF. Although the battalion was ordered to reorganise to continue the operations, both sides spent 4 May collecting wounded under Red Cross flags. The battalion spent the night of 4/5 May working on outposts and trenches.Falls, 1917, Vol I, p. 439.Wyrall, pp. 215‚Äì8. Although 8th EYR was later awarded the Battle honour for the Capture of Roeux that ended the Arras offensive on 13‚Äì4 May, it did not actually take part in the fighting.Wyrall, pp. 223, 226. ===Polygon Wood=== British troops (believed to be the 8th East Yorkshires) moving up during the Ypres Offensive. During the summer of 1917 the 8th EYR was engaged in trench warfare, first on the Arras front, later on the Somme, while the Third Ypres Offensive raged further north. On 4 September 3rd Division moved to the Ypres Salient for intensive training to join in the fighting. They were in Corps Reserve during the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge (20‚Äì25 September) and then participated in the Battle of Polygon Wood. On the evening of 25 September Lt-Col de la Perrelle led 8th EYR up to their assembly positions in warm sunny weather. Zero hour was 05.50 on 26 September and 8th Bde was on the left of 8th Bde's attack on Zonnebeke. There was a morning mist and the troops had to steer by compass bearings over the devastated ground; they then found that despite the dry weather the Zonnebeke stream (not expected to be much of an obstacle) was swollen into a wide marsh. To get round the inundation the battalion had to move to the flank, opening up a gap to the 2nd Royal Scots on their right. Nevertheless, and despite resistance from a number of pillboxes, the battalion was on its objective (the Red Line) by 07.00, having captured a number of prisoners, while four Corporals had each captured a machine gun single-handed. The 1st RSF and 7th KSLI now leapfrogged past the 8th EYR and 2nd Royal Scots to advance towards the second objective (the Blue Line) by 10.00 (they did not quite achieve the final objective, Hill 40). The inevitable counter-attacks then began: the first was easily repulsed, the second, at 18.00, drove the leading troops back a little, but the ground was recovered. Now followed three terrible days holding the captured positions under incessant shellfire. On 27 September the Germans placed a barrage behind the frontline troops to isolate them and massed for an attack, but the SOS call to the divisional artillery broke it up. On the evening of 29 September the battalion was relieved. Its total casualties during the battle were unrecorded, but included the Padre killed.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, pp. 288-92.Wyrall, pp. 235‚Äì9. Zonnebeke, painted by Sir William Orpen in 1918. After the relief, 8th EYR left the Ypres Salient and travelled south, reaching Beugn√¢tre by 13 October, where it underwent two weeks' training. It then returned to the line in the Noreuil sector. 3rd Division did not take part in the BEF's final effort of 1917, the Battle of Cambrai, but it did carry out a subsidiary attack at Bullecourt on the opening day of the offensive (20 November). The battalion was in Brigade Support, and although 8th Brigade itself was kept 'standing to' throughout the day it was not engaged. The rest of the winter was spent trench-holding.Wyrall, p. 252. ==Disbandment== By early 1918 the BEF was experiencing a severe manpower crisis. The solution was to disband one battalion in each brigade and distribute the men to other units. As a 'New Army' battalion in a predominantly Regular Army division, 8th EYR was inevitably selected for disbandment. On 17 February it was amalgamated with 12th West Yorkshire Regiment of 9th Bde to form 10th Entrenching Battalion. Entrenching battalions were used for digging defences until their men were needed as reinforcements. The 10th Battalion was broken up before the end of the year, probably drafted to reinforce units shattered in the German Spring Offensive.Wyrall, pp. 258‚Äì9.'Entrenching Battalions', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494/1. During its service, 8th EYR had lost 706 other ranks dead Wyrall, Appendix I. A new 8th Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment, was formed in 1940, initially as 50th (Holding) Bn; it later converted into 115th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, and served with 46th Division in the Tunisian and Italian Campaigns. ==Footnotes== ==Notes== ==References== * Maj A.F.

The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. == Timeline == Although there were no suspected and confirmed cases in Tibet at the time, an Autonomous Region leadership group was established on January 27, with the Secretary of the Party Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the chairman of the Autonomous Region as the group leaders, to respond to the novel coronavirus pneumonia. At the same time, Tibet declared a Level II major public health emergency response. Starting on the same day, all tourist sites in Tibet were temporarily closed, and all persons entering Tibet were required to be quarantined for 14 days in designated places. On 29 January, Tibet escalated its major public health emergency response level to Level I. On 29 January, Tibet reported its first suspected cases, a person from Suizhou, Hubei, who took a train from Wuchang railway station to Lhasa on 22‚Äì24 January. On 30 January, the case was confirmed. On 12 February, the patient was discharged after recovery from the Third People's Hospital of Tibet Autonomous Region. Thus, the number of active confirmed and suspected cases in Tibet decreased to zero. == See also == * COVID-19 pandemic in Bhutan * COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China * COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal == References == == External links == * Ë•øËóèËá™Ê≤ªÂå∫Âç´ÁîüÂÅ•Â∫∑ÂßîÂëò‰ºö Tibet Tibet Category:Health in Tibet Category:History of Tibet ","title":"COVID-19 pandemic in Tibet"},{"id":"63755632","text":"Al-Sahul region Al-Sa·∏•≈´l () is both a town and a wadi located between the city of Ibb and al-Makhadir District in Ibb Governorate, Yemen.

In the Afrikaans language it is known as knikkopsuikerbossie or ondersteboknopprotea. ==Taxonomy== Protea pendula was first described by Robert Brown in his 1810 treatise On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. The holotype is an exsiccata collection made by Francis Masson in the early 1770s in an unspecified location in South Africa. There is an isotype in the herbarium assembled by William Forsyth, which is now held at Kew. The species was collected again in 1831 by Karl Ludwig Philipp Zeyher (accompanied by Christian Friedrich Ecklon) in the Witzenberg Mountains to the east of the town of Tulbagh. ==Description== This plant grows as an erect shrub up to three metres tall. The younger branches are softly hirsute, eventually becoming glabrous with age. The leaves are glaucous, distinctly veined beneath, in length, and approximately 0.5cm in width. They are shaped narrowly-oblanceolate, ending in an acute apex with a mucronate tip. Young leaves are covered in a very minute, loose pubescence, but become glabrous as they get older. The flowers are bourne on a specialised inflorescence, a flower head or pseudanthium. The flower head is sessile, in length, and around in diameter. The flower heads are dropping, opening downwards. It is monoecious, with both sexes occurring in each flower. The inflorescences are produced in the late autumn to winter, mostly in May to June, extending to August. There are seven to eight series of involucral bracts. The outer bracts are often coloured a dull, mealy red, are shaped ovate to subacuminate (somewhat pointy), with an obtuse apex, and covered in silky-pubescent or tomentose hairs on their lower halves. Their margins are membranous and ciliate (fringed with hairs). The inner bracts longer than the actual flowers and are shaped obtuse, in-curved at their tops, slightly concave and covered in minute pubescent hairs on their outsides. The petals and sepals of the flowers are fused into a 19mm long perianth-sheath. This sheath is dilated, having three keels and three veins at its base, and reddish, pilose hairs on the outside of the very top of the sheath, where it has a 5mm long lip with the underside covered in a few, stiff, setose (bristly) hairs of a reddish colour. The lip is three-toothed, with each tooth almost equal in length, 0.7mm. All of the stamens are fertile. The anthers are linear and 2.6mm long. The apical glands are ovate and somewhat less than 0.3mm in length. The ovary is oblong and covered in long, reddish-brown hairs. The style is glabrous, compressed, curved to falcate in shape and some 21.2mm long. It is obliquely dilated above the ovary, then gradually tapering. The stigma is 3.2mm long, thread-like in shape, obtuse, and almost imperceptibly becomes the style. ===Similar species=== It is similar to Protea effusa, as well as P. sulphurea, from which it differs by having narrower leaves with more distinct venation. It is also somewhat similar to P. witzenbergiana, differing in that species having long, foliaceous, leaf-like, outer involucral bracts. ==Distribution== Protea pendula is endemic to the Western Cape province of South Africa. It occurs in isolated, scattered populations from the Cedarberg Mountains, such as on the Wolfberg, to the Koue Bokkeveld Mountains, such as on the Waboomsberg. ==Ecology== The adult plants are killed by wildfires, but the seeds can survive such an event. The flowers are pollinated by birds. The fruits are numerous, studding the base of the dried, old flower head, which itself remains attached to the plant after senescence. The seeds are retained in the fruits for a few years, until they are eventually dispersed by the wind. ===Habitat=== It exclusively grows in a fynbos habitat, in a range of between 1,000 to 2,000 metres in altitude. Within such lands it grows in arid, rocky areas, and on krantzes (crags or cliffs). ==Gallery== File:Protea pendula tonyrebelo inat10814904a.jpgProtea pendula bush File:Protea pendula tonyrebelo inat10874384b.jpgProtea pendula File:Protea pendula tonyrebelo inat10874494b.jpgProtea pendula File:Protea pendula tonyrebelo inat10874494d.jpgProtea pendula File:Protea pendula tonyrebelo inat10814904b.jpgProtea pendula leaves File:Protea pendula tonyrebelo inat10874384d.jpgFlower of Protea pendula File:Protea pendula tonyrebelo inat10874384a.jpgFlower of Protea pendula File:Protea pendula tonyrebelo inat10874384c.jpgFlower of Protea pendula File:Protea pendula tonyrebelo inat10874494c.jpgFlower of Protea pendula File:Protea pendula tonyrebelo inat10814904d.jpgProtea pendula flower File:Protea pendula tonyrebelo inat10814904e.jpgProtea pendula flower File:Protea pendula tonyrebelo inat10814904c.jpgProtea pendula seedhead ==Conservation== The rate of change in population is believed to be stable. The conservation status this species was first assessed as 'least concern' by the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) in 2009. In 2019 another group of authors re-assessed it for SANBI as 'least concern' again. ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== * pendula Category:Flora of the Cape Provinces ","title":"Protea pendula"},{"id":"63755877","text":"Vasili Oshchepkov This is a list of notable Sambo practitioners. == Founders == *Vasili Oshchepkov (January 7, 1893 - October 10, 1938) was a researcher of different types of national wrestling and martial arts.

BKHS) is the most recent of the six non- partisan foundations commemorating politicians in Germany. It was established on 1 January 2017 by the German Bundestag to ‚Äúpreserve the memory of Helmut Schmidt‚Äôs political work for the freedom and unity of the German people, for European freedom and unification and for understanding and reconciliation among nations‚Äù. Within the framework of its political education work, it is also tasked with conveying to young people in particular those topics that exercised Schmidt as a politician and journalist. The foundation has its headquarters in central Hamburg and a branch office in Schmidt's former home in the Langenhorn district of the city, where the private Helmut Schmidt Archives are also located. == Organisation == Headquarters of the foundation in central Hamburg (Kattrepel 10) The BKHS is a foundation in public law under direct federal government control. It is funded by grants from the federal budget and is subject to legal supervision by the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media (BKM). The bodies of the foundation are the Board of Trustees, whose members are appointed for a period of five years by the Federal President, and the Management Board appointed by the Trustees. The Board of Trustees currently comprises Peer Steinbr√ºck (Chair), Susanne Schmidt (Deputy Chair), Dirk Fischer, Johannes Kahrs, Giovanni di Lorenzo and Sandra Maischberger. The historian Meik Woyke has been Chairman of the Management Board and Managing Director since 1 July 2019. Further, honorary members of the board are Hans-Gerhard Husung and Bernd Neuendorf. From 2017 to 2019, Stefan Herms and Knut Nevermann managed the foundation's business as honorary board members. == Tasks == Participants at a BKHS conference in the atrium of the Hamburg State and University Library in January 2020 According to the law establishing it, the foundation shall # make a contribution to the understanding of contemporary history and the continued development of the Federal Republic of Germany and # to the reappraisal, presentation and further development of Germany's responsibilities in foreign, security and economic policy in a European and global setting. # It shall also contribute to deepening and broadening knowledge of 21st century geopolitical and economic challenges in Europe and the world. In addition to the historical work, there are three sub-programmes: ‚ÄúEuropean and International Politics‚Äù, ‚ÄúGlobal Markets and Social Justice‚Äù and ‚ÄúDemocracy and Society‚Äù. They take up thematic impulses in Helmut Schmidt's life and address current political issues. A particular focus is on the future of transatlantic relations: In this regard, the foundation has already staged several symposiums and, in cooperation with the German Marshall Fund, established a high-ranking commission of experts charged with making recommendations by the autumn of 2020. This \\"Transatlantic Task Force\\" includes European and US experts such as Catherine Ashton, Cecilia Malmstr√∂m, Will Hurd, Elissa Slotkin, Henrik Enderlein, or Michael Froman. It is chaired by President of the German Marshall Fund Karen Donfried and German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger. The foundation works closely with the private Helmut and Loki Schmidt Foundation (HLS), established in 1992, and also on archive matters with the Friedrich Ebert Foundation and the German Federal Archives. == Locations == === Helmut Schmidt Forum === At its headquarters in central Hamburg, the foundation maintains the Helmut Schmidt Forum, where exhibitions and guided tours are offered as well as regular readings, lectures and discussions. On 7 December 2018, the first exhibition, ‚Äú100 years in 100 days‚Äù opened, showing one image for each year of the former Chancellor's life, including some previously unpublished photographs, up until the end of March 2020. After a break for alterations, a new permanent exhibition will be shown here from 10 November 2020 onwards. === House in Langenhorn === Schmidt's house in Langenhorn, viewed from the street In December 1961, Helmut and Loki Schmidt and their daughter Susanne moved into a house in the Langenhorn district of Hamburg. Here, Helmut Schmidt played host to friends, politicians and artists. His guests included Val√©ry Giscard d‚ÄôEstaing, Henry Kissinger, Juan Carlos I of Spain, Leonid Brezhnev, Oskar Kokoschka and the members of the ‚ÄúFriday Society‚Äù that Schmidt founded. After Schmidt's death on 10 November 2015, the private Helmut and Loki Schmidt Foundation (HLS), established back in 1992, inherited the property from the couple with the task of preserving it as an authentic historical site. Due to space constraints, guided tours here are only possible to a limited extent. They are offered exclusively through the BKHS. === Helmut Schmidt Archives === Annexe for the Helmut Schmidt Archives in Langenhorn Also in Langenhorn are the Helmut Schmidt Archives that house the private papers of Helmut and Loki Schmidt and their close friend Karl Wilhelm Berkhan. They comprise more than 3,500 individual documents, 284 photo albums and a comprehensive library. Schmidt had already had a small library built in 1978, and in 1992 the couple acquired the semi-detached house next door to house the archives. In 2006/7 a further annexe was added. Since then the bequests have been housed in a separate storeroom. The archives also belong to the private Helmut and Loki Schmidt Foundation. BKHS staff work to index and record the bequests stored here, thus creating the conditions for their public use. == References == == External links == * Bundeskanzler-Helmut-Schmidt-Stiftung * Helmut und Loki Schmidt- Stiftung Category:Foundations based in Germany Category:Charities based in Germany Category:Political and economic think tanks based in Germany Category:Organisations based in Hamburg ","title":"Federal Chancellor Helmut Schmidt Foundation"},{"id":"63755960","text":"Allianz Technology Trust () is a large British investment trust dedicated to investments in technology companies.

It has long straight branches that are initially hairy and are covered in leaves pressed against them. These leaves are small, overlapping, lance-shaped, scharply pointed, have a regular row of hairs along the margins, and 3-5 veins are visible on the outward facing surface. It has initially greenish yellow, later reddish brown flowers, each of which consists of a tube of about long with 4 lance-shaped, pointed sepal lobes and 4 yellow alternating petal-like scales. It flowers between October and February. It can be found in the southwest of the Western Cape province of South Africa. It is sometimes called cross capespray in English. == Taxonomy == This species was first described as Struthiola tetralepis by Rudolf Schlechter in 1900, based on a plant he collected himself at Franschhoek. He distinguished two varieties, S. tetralepis var. tetralepis and S. tetralepis var. glabricaulis. Charles Henry Wright in 1915 considered the varieties insufficiently characterised and regarded S. tetralepis var. glabricaulis a synonym of S. tetralepis. == Description == Struthiola tetralepis is a willowy, single- stemmed shrublet of up to high with branches that initially have a layer of soft hairs pressed to their surface, but the hairs are lost with age. The leaves are in pairs opposing each other, initially pressed against the branches, but less so further down, overlapping each other, with the blade directly attached to the branche without a leaf stalk. They are lance-shaped, generally long and wide, somewhat depressed along the main vein, increasingly pointed towards the tip, with a row of hairs pressed to the surface along its rim when young, with 3 to 5 stripes visible along the length of the outward facing surface. The flowers are seated in the axils of the leaves over a considerable length towards the tip of the branches, an inflorescence type called a spike. The two bracteoles are set opposite each other at the base of the flower, awl-shaped, about long, with a regular row of hairs along the margin and a blunt tip ending in a tuft of hairs. The calyx is initially greenish yellow, later fading to brownish red, with at its base a cylindrical tube of about long that is covered on the outside with soft hairs pressed against its surface and at its top 4 lance-shaped, protracted, pointed lobes of long and wide, hairless but the outer 2 with a tuft of hairs at the tips. Four yellow, fleshy, petal-like scales are implanted above and alternating with the sepal lobes, and are surrounded by stiff hairs longer than the scales. About below the mouth of the tube sits on whorl of four seated stamens, that have a whitish wart at their tips. The ovary is egg-shaped, hairless and about 1.5 mm long, and is topped by a style of about long and ends in a brush-like stigma. === Differences with related species === Struthiola has its flowers arranged in long spikes and every flower contains 4 anthers, whereas Gnidia differs from it in having its flowers in short spikes, solitary or more often in heads and anthers in 2 whorls of 4 or 5 each. Both Lachnaea, Passerina and a few Gnidia-species lack scales on the calyx tubes. Both S. striata and S. tetralepis have four petal-like scales implanted at the opening of the calyx tube, while the many dozens of remaining Struthiola species have eight or twelve scales. S. striata is a roundish shrub of up to 1.5 m high with cream, soft yellow or pinkish flowers ending in oval sepal lobes of 1‚Äì2 mm long and 1.5‚Äì2.5 mm wide, and a reddish wart on the tip of the anthers, S. tetralepis is a single stemmed shrublet of up to high that has initially greenish yellow, later brownish red flowers with lance-shaped sepal lobes of long and wide, and a white wart on the anthers. == Distribution, ecology and conservation == Struthiola tetralepis is only known to grow on shale bands in the Hottentots Holland Mountains between Villiersdorp and Franschhoek in a vegetation type known as Cape Wineland Shale Fynbos. The continued survival of this species is considered to be of least concern because its populations are stable. == References == Struthiola tetralepis Category:Flora of South Africa ","title":"Struthiola tetralepis"},{"id":"63755980","text":"Abdur Rahman Fakir is a Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami politician and the former Member of Parliament of Bogra-6. ==Career== Fakir was elected to parliament from Bogra-6 as a Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami candidate in 1986. ==References== Category:Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami politicians Category:Living people Category:3rd Jatiya Sangsad members Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Abdur Rahman Fakir"},{"id":"63755990","text":"Quirinus Henricus Franciscus \\"Quirin\\" Vrehen (born 25 February 1932) is a Dutch physicist.

According to composer and theorist Denis Smalley, it describes the \\"projection and the spreading of sound in an acoustic space for a group of listeners\\" during a concert. These concerts can be seen as acoustic recitals without performers, where sound is exclusively generated by loudspeakers. In many cases, the sound diffusion is performed by the composer themselves, whose task it is to integrate and interpret the music within the concert space.Emmerson, Simon (2007).\\"Living Electronic Music\\", Aldershot, Hants: Ashgate. The practice was originally formulated by composer Pierre Henry and based on the diffusion of a stereo signal to multiple loudspeakers using a special mixing desk. Differing from the spatial sound approach adopted by Stockhausen and others, the loudspeaker orchestra consisted of a diverse range of speakers, specifically chosen for their diverse tonal characteristics. The aim of the diffusion is to ‚Äúexaggerate the dynamic, spectral and spatial content of the musical material already present in the work.‚Äù The technical limitations of magnetic tape (such as tape noise or limited spectral range) required the intervention of an engineer in the systems‚Äô early history. These technical considerations would eventually include the diffusion process. The first formalized system based on this approach was the Acousmonium of the Groupe de Recherches Musicales (GRM), the collective founded by Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Henry in 1958. Modern diffusion practice also tries to articulate musical material by playing different passages through different sounding pairs of speakers. Composers generally do not provide a score or notation that determines how the diffusion should be done precisely. It is up to the diffusion engineer to perform the piece in such a way that the musical content is adequately interpreted as well as adjusted to the specific loudspeaker arrangement and acoustics of the respective concert hall. == See also == * Birmingham ElectroAcoustic Sound Theatre * Musique concr√®te * Sound engineering * Sound art * Sound collage == References == Category:Electronic music ","title":"Sound diffusion"},{"id":"63756042","text":"The 1908‚Äì09 Bradford City A.F.C. season was the sixth in the club's history.

Several cultural institutions had their support to constitute themselves, among which the Geographic and Historical Institute of Bahia. Rodrigues Lima also spread public works throughout the state, especially those to combat the effects of droughts (many of them existing to date), and by the internalization of quality education. In Salvador he carries out several works, aiming to modernize and beautify the Capital: the most beautiful square in the city, Campo Grande, a tourist attraction that honors the heroes of Bahian Independence, is the work of his government. == Tributes == Largo da Vit√≥ria, in Salvador, bears a bust in his honor.

Yale was one of the few teams to have officially existed during the war but, despite that advantage, the Elis still had a great deal of difficulty in the spring semester.

Events usually take place in a carnival-like format with many booths from different companies, performers from various disability organisations in Singapore, as well as the marching of contingents. The event has been held each year in Singapore from 2013 to 2015 at Speakers Corner in Hong Lim Park, as well as the Fountain of Wealth in Suntec City since 2016 on a Saturday in October or November. The 2019 event was held on 2 November. ==History== The Purple Parade was first conceived as an event for the inclusion of people with special needs back in 2013, with 40 organisations and the Central Singapore Community Development Council coming together to commemorate the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which falls on 3 December every year. In previous years, various organisations celebrated that in small groups, rendering the approach ineffective and without impact. In order to promote the event, a social media movement led by Denise Phua, along with several parliamentarians (including Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong and then Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Lawrence Wong) was started to get support for the event. The first event was eventually held on 30 November 2013. The colour purple symbolises royalty, with the square logo representing a call for equality for those with special needs in all areas of society. Since then, a total of seven Purple Parade events have been held in Singapore, occurring annually on Saturdays in October or November. ==Events== Each event took place on a Saturday. It was held at Speakers' Corner in Hong Lim Park from 2013 to 2015, and at the Fountain of Wealth in Suntec City from 2016 to 2019. ===The Purple Parade 2013=== The Purple Parade 2013 was held on 30 November, the first such parade. Despite rainy weather, the event attracted a turnout of 4,000 people and pledges that formed a large square at Hong Lim Park. A carnival was organised as part of the event to showcase talents of those with special needs, as well as several performances that were held too. The success of this event prompted organisers to make the event a yearly affair, with more initiatives to support the community. ===The Purple Parade 2014=== The Purple Parade 2014 was held on 15 November in Hong Lim Park, attracting a total of 5,000 participants. There were 85 organisations participating in the event as compared to 38 the previous year, as well as more carnival booths too. A record was set in the Singapore Book of Records for the largest group of people with purple hair, which numbered to 300 eventually. ===The Purple Parade 2015=== The Purple Parade 2015 was held on 31 October in Hong Lim Park, attracting a total of 7,000 participants and 106 organisations. Among them include Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong and Ho Ching, who came to support the special needs community. One of the main highlights is to don purple spectacles, which eventually came up to 3,000 participants. This symbolises the act of being open to those with special needs. The event also showcased The Purple Symphony's first public event, an inclusive orchestra made up of musicians with and without special needs. Besides the event, a MRT train on the North South line was decorated in purple with seven people who have special needs to bring awareness to commuters. ===The Purple Parade 2016=== For the first time, The Purple Parade 2016 was held on 5 November at the Fountain of Wealth in Suntec City, attracting a turnout of 10,000 participants. Among them include then Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore Tharman Shanmugaratnam (who is now Senior Minister). Several people at the event donned purple top hats made up of cardboard. This time round, there was a sign language interpreter on stage to allow those with hearing impairments to follow the event seamlessly. Towards 7pm, 16 landmarks in Singapore were lit up in purple to support the cause, including the Esplanade, Marina Bay Sands, Clemenceau Bridge and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, which started from 29 October. ===The Purple Parade 2017=== The Purple Parade 2017 was held on 28 October at the Fountain of Wealth in Suntec City, attracting a turnout of 10,000 participants. Among them include President of Singapore Halimah Yacob. In addition, 21 buildings and bridges were lit up from 21 October to 4 November in support of the cause. ===The Purple Parade 2018=== The Purple Parade 2018 was held on 27 October at the Fountain of Wealth in Suntec City, attracting 10,000 participants and 200 organisations. Among them include Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing. In addition, a record 26 buildings and bridges were lighted up in purple from 15 to 28 October, including places outside the city centre. ===The Purple Parade 2019=== The Purple Parade 2019 was held on 2 November at the Fountain of Wealth in Suntec City, attracting 10,000 participants and 200 organisations. Among them include Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore Heng Swee Keat. For the first time, dialogues were organised between members of the special needs community and the general public to share their stories. It is hoped that this initiative will promote inclusion. In addition, about 30 buildings and bridges across Singapore were lighted up from 26 October to 10 November. ==Impact== Since the event's inception in 2013, the turnout of participants has become larger over the years with the largest being 10,000 so far. The increased turnout reflects increased awareness and support for the special needs community in Singapore. However, several advocates have called for more on inclusion to be done, whether in social settings, when teaching children about inclusiveness, making workplaces friendly, among other factors. This comes as several incidents surfaced in the past involving those with special needs being ill-treated by members of the public. This could be due to ignorance, prejudice, non- acceptance or just nastiness, according to Denise Phua. Others have also called for more dialogues to understand viewpoints from the special needs community and change biases. ==See also== * List of disability organisations in Singapore * List of social service agencies in Singapore ==References== ==External links== *The Purple Parade Category:2013 establishments in Singapore Category:Disability in Singapore Category:Disability organisations based in Singapore Category:Human rights in Singapore Category:Recurring events established in 2013 ","title":"The Purple Parade"},{"id":"63756310","text":"Lee Il-gyu (Lee Il-kyu, born 16 September 1940) is a South Korean equestrian.

Malaria accounts for 40 percent of outpatient consultations and 25 percent of all hospital admissions. Malaria places an enormous economic strain on Benin‚Äôs development. The World Bank estimates that households in Benin spend approximately one quarter of their annual income on the prevention and treatment of malaria. Benin's long-term goal is to reduce the burden of malaria in order to improve national socio- economic development. Large-scale implementation of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) and intermittent preventive treatment for pregnant women (IPTp) began in Benin in 2007 and has progressed rapidly. Rapid diagnostic tests, ACTs, and IPTp are being used in public health facilities nationwide and are being introduced into registered private clinics. More than 6 million long-lasting insecticide-treated nets have been distributed through mass and continuous distribution channels. Community health workers serve at the peripheral level of the national health system and are trained in malaria treatment and high-impact interventions. A recent national study found that 70 percent of all antimalarial sales take place in the private sector. Benin has shown significant improvements in several key malaria indicators, such as net ownership and usage and uptake of IPTp. Malaria is endemic to Benin, and while transmission is stable, it is influenced by several factors, including vector species, geography, climate, and hydrography. The primary malaria vector in Benin is Anopheles gambiae s.s., but secondary vectors are also important to transmission.

The source of the River Wye is west of Buxton on Axe Edge Moor. One main channel runs underground through Poole's Cavern. The river flows though Buxton Pavilion Gardens and then along a culvert under the town centre. After leaving the flat area of central Buxton, the Wye Valley becomes distinct as a gorge running east for before the valley broadens at Ashford-in- the Water. The A6 road from Buxton to Bakewell follows the Wye Valley for most of its path. The Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midland Junction Railway used to run through the valley. It was built to link Manchester through the Peak District to London and operated from the 1860s to 1968. == Geology == Limestone crags beside the River Wye The White Peak area of the Peak District is named after the limestone plateau landscape of the 'Derbyshire Dome' anticline. The plateau is generally between 200m and 300m above sea level. The Carboniferous limestone rocks of all the dales in the White Peak were formed 350 million years ago from the shells and sediments of a tropical sea. These deposits were compressed into rocks which over time were uplifted and folded into a dome. Erosion of the younger sandstones exposed the limestone strata below. The landscape of dales was then sculpted by the melt water from the last Ice Age 20,000 years ago. == Dales == Beyond Buxton the Wye Valley is known as a series of dales, which are gorges with numerous side valley gorges. === Ashwood Dale === Cowdale quarry lime kilns in Ashwood Dale After leaving Ashwood Park (in Mill Dale) in Buxton, the river enters the steep-sided Ashwood Dale. Here Joseph Mallard William Turner sketched Lovers' Leap and its waterfall in about 1831. The story of Lovers' Leap is that an eloping couple managed to leap across the chasm on horseback on their way to get married at Peak Forest church, evading their pursuing parents. The narrow dry gorge of Cunning Dale joins from the north. The short steep Cow Dale and Kidtor Dale are next to each other on the opposite side to Cunning Dale. The remains of Cowdale quarry's 19th-century buildings and lime kilns are high up on the south slope. The site is a Scheduled Monument. === Wye Dale === View of Deep Dale from Thirst House cave The dry valley of Woo Dale joins Wye Dale from the north. 'Woo Dale Limestone' is quarried at Tarmac's Tunstead Quarry (the largest limestone quarry in the UK) between Woo Dale and Great Rocks Dale. Topley Pike limestone quarry is on the south side of the Wye Valley opposite Woo Dale and close to the hamlet of King Sterndale. Deep Dale also joins the main valley from the south. Thirst House Cave in Deep Dale is 58m long and in the late 19th-century a bear's skull and Roman artefacts were discovered there. The Peak District Boundary Walk route comes down Deep Dale and along Wye Dale before heading north at Chee Dale. === Chee Dale === Stepping stones in Chee Dale The Monsal Trail bridleway runs for from Topley Pike Junction (at the head of Chee Dale) past Bakewell to Rowsley, along the disused Midland Railway line. It passes through Upper Chee Dale and then enters the two tunnels through Chee Tor hill to Miller's Dale. 'Chee Tor Limestone' is a bed of particularly fine limestone. The crags of carboniferous limestone in Upper Chee Dale and of Chee Tor cliff in Lower Chee Dale have extensive rock climbing routes. Flag Dale joins the valley from the north at Chee Tor. The village of Wormhill is nearby on the north side of the valley. Blackwell Dale is on the south side before Miller's Dale. === Miller's Dale === Cressbrook Mill by the River Wye Miller's Dale's main landmarks are the twin railway viaducts, built in 1866 and 1905 to carry 4 lines. Millers Dale railway station was once a large and busy goods and passenger station. It is now a main visitor centre for the Monsal Trail. Monk's Dale (named after the monastic grange set up there by Lenton Priory) on the north side is a secluded steep valley. The Limestone Way footpath crosses Miller's Dale and runs up and parallel to Monk's Dale. Tideswell Dale is further downstream on the north side. Ravenstor cliff at the foot of Tideswell Dale is popular with rock climbers. Beyond Tideswell Dale is Litton Mill, a cotton spinning mill dating back to 1782 and notorious for its harsh child labour conditions. The Wye Valley is known as Water-cum-Jolly Dale where Cressbrook Dale joins it from the north. Another cotton mill Cressbrook Mill was built in 1815 and dominates the view by the river. The Wye Valley then becomes Upperdale with Hay Dale on the north side before the river reaches Monsal Head. === Monsal Dale === Sheepwash Bridge at Ashford in the Water The Monsal Trail passes over the Monsal Headstone viaduct which was built in 1863 by the Midland Railway over the River Wye. It is long and up to high. Fin Cop hill overlooks Monsal Dale and its Iron Age hillfort is a Scheduled Monument. The A6 road runs down Taddington Dale to follow the riverside again, where Deep Dale converges with the valley on the south side. Kirk Dale lies on the south side at Ashford-in- the-Water. Beyond Ashford-in-the-Water the valley broadens and the River Wye flows into the River Derwent past Bakewell at Rowsley. == Nature == The Wye Valley Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) runs for over east of Buxton. It covers Cunning Dale, Woo Dale, Wye Dale, Chee Dale, Tideswell Dale, Monsal Dale and Taddington Wood. These dales contain ancient ash and wych elm woodland, with areas of yew and rock whitebeam trees. The valley is habitat for an abundance of wildflowers. Dippers are often seen darting low above the river and bobbing on rocks in the river. Deep Dale and Topley Pike is a protected nature reserve (looked after by the Derbyshire Wildlife Trust) and is also a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Chee Dale, Miller's Dale quarry and Priestcliffe Lees in Miller's Dale are protected nature reserves, which are overseen by the Derbyshire Wildlife Trust. Monk's Dale and Cressbrook Dale are part of the Derbyshire Dales National Nature Reserve managed by Natural England. Monk's Dale and Cressbook Dale are also each a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). They are especially important for the lichens growing on the limestone outcrops. == References == Category:Valleys of the Peak District Category:Valleys of Derbyshire Category:Derbyshire Dales Category:Buxton Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Derbyshire ","title":"Wye Valley, Derbyshire"},{"id":"63756498","text":"30th Anniversary Mari Hamada Live Tour -Special- is a live video by Japanese singer/songwriter Mari Hamada, released on January 7, 2015, by Meldac/Tokuma Japan.

It is native to Tropical and Sub-tropical Asia, Wallacea, New Guinea and Queensland on the Australian continent and New Caledonia. ==Description== Usually growing as a liana, sometimes a climbing shrub or a shrub, it can grow 5-10 tall or in length, at times the stems can be up to 22cm in diameter. It is one of the only Mallotus species to grow as a liana. Bark is dark brownish grey. Branchlets, petioles and inflorescences are dull yellowish-brown. The blaze (longitudinal cut of the bark) is finely layered, with an odour of green peas (Pisum sativum). The simple and broad leaves are slightly peltate. Flowers are yellowish. It flowers in China from March to May, and fruits from June to September. The species can be distinguished from other Mallotus species, by its being a climber and that its upper leaf surface have more than 2 marginal extrafloral nectaries, and that its fruits are (1-or) 2- or 3-locular. A molecular phylogeny study has M. repandus as a sister species of M. phillippensis (Lam.) Muell.Arg. The indumentum/hairs on the leaves of the plant are simple and multicellular, a trait only found amongst the Mallotus genera in the closely related M. philippensis. ==Habitat== The climber/shrub grows locally scattered in the understorey of primary to secondary forest, and in disturbed sites and scrub. It can be found at forest edges, mangrove swamp edges, road and river sides, ridges, steep slopes and dry ground. It is able to grow on various soil types, including those derived from limestone and granite, on sandy loam and rocky soils. It occurs from sea level to 1500m altitude. It generally flowers and fruits throughout the year. Grows in both lowland and upland rain forest in Queensland, at elevations from near sea level to 750m. In Southeast Asia, the liana/shrub occurs in secondary vegetation formations or on the edges of dense forests. In China it is found in thickets, forest and their fringes, hills and mountain valleys below 100m. The plant is sometimes harmed by infestation with the parasite plant Cuscuta japonica (Japanese dodder). It provides food for the moth Acrocercops zopherandra. It is one of three Mallotus species that host the fungus Cercospora malloti. ==Distribution== New Caledonia, Queensland (where it is found in Cape York Peninsula, the northeast and the southeast. but not coastal central Queensland), New Guinea, Lesser Sunda Islands, Maluku, Sulawesi, Jawa, Borneo, Philippines, Taiwan, North- central, Southeast and South-central Zhongguo/China (including Guangxi, Hainan, Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, southern Shanxi, southern Gansu, Hubei, Sichuan, southern Jiangxi, Hunan, Guizhou and Yunnan), Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Sumatera, Andaman Islands, Nicobar Islands, Myanmar, Bangladesh, India (including Tripura, Assam, Sikkim, West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala}, East Himalaya, Nepal, Sri Lanka. While widespread, it is absent in certain areas, such as Borneo. ==Common names== Names for M. repandus include: climbing mallotus (Australia); waithied (Lifou); wananugapok (Waskuk)]; toho (Wagu); ngontoen (New Guinea); nono nuifmetan ((Dawan); bina (Rote); keterakaba, ikur wase, rowe (Lesser Sunda Islands); katjoe-kilang, merangan, sindukan, toekal takal (Jawa/Java); panu√°lan (Tagalog); adgao, ambao, tagbanua, tapin (Philippines); Áü≥Â≤©Êû´, shi yan feng (Chinese); ma-pawp-kua (Lao); chumpu pr√©i, champou prei, mtehs barang (Khmer); ‡πÇ‡∏Ñ‡∏Ñ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏ô, makai krapap, krapok krapoi, kurapia, makai khruea, makai k√ªae, mapop khruea, naeo nam, pho khan, yiao maeo, yiao maeo thao (Thai); ku-ko-mu-ya (Malay); ngahlaing-bo, taw-thidin-nww (Myanmar); akoos (Hindi); kanda-veltoo (Teling, India); watta- tali (India). ==Uses== On the island of Rote, eastern Indonesia, the wood of this plant, bina, is one of two used to make the bars for meko ai (xylophone whose bars are made of wood), it is also recorded in an origin myth for this musical instrument.

Lew (born 1983) is a career government administrator currently serving as the Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Transportation.

Prior to heading the Colorado Department of Transportation, Lew worked from April 2017 to January 2019 as the Chief Operating Officer of the Rhode Island Department of Transportation. Before her appointment to Rhode Island's Department of Transportation, Lew worked for eight years in the Obama Administration. The federal government positions she held were Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Department of Transportation, Assistant Secretary for Budget and Programs, U.S. Department of Transportation, Senior Adviser, U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and Policy Adviser, White House Domestic Policy Council. Lew's first position after she completed her graduate degree was at the Brookings Institution, where she served as Policy Analyst and Research and Policy Assistant in the organization's Metropolitan Policy Program from 2007-2009. ==Criticism== In Colorado, Lew has been criticized for focusing too much on non-highway transportation projects such as bike lanes, large buses, walking paths, light rail, and electric vehicles, with insufficient emphasis placed on roads and highways. Some have questioned Lew's qualifications for the position, for she was hired for the job at age 35 with no experience in construction management or engineering. Indeed, one report states that Colorado Governor Jared Polis appointed Lew to head the Colorado Department of Transportation as a personal favor to Michelle Obama. Under Lew's leadership, CDOT has been criticized for adding only expensive toll lanes in highway-widening projects. These so-called Lexus lanes are paid for with tax dollars but only benefit the wealthy who can afford the tolls.. One analysis says that \\"Lew's plan is to make driving in Colorado so painful that many average Coloradoans will abandon their cars in favor of a public transit alternative.\\" ==References== ==External links== * *CDOT bio Category:State cabinet secretaries of Colorado Category:United States Department of Transportation officials Category:Harvard College alumni Category:Northwestern University alumni ","title":"Shoshana Lew"},{"id":"63756774","text":"Greenwich Town hall is a municipal building on Royal Hill, Greenwich, London. It is a Grade II listed building. ==History== The old town hall in Greenwich High Road The building was commissioned to replace the old town hall in Greenwich High Road which had served as the headquarters for the Greenwich District Board of Works before becoming the home of the Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich in 1900. After the old town hall had become inadequate for the council's needs, civic leaders decided to build a new town hall: the site chosen for the new building had previously been occupied by the old Greenwich Theatre.The Era 29 May 1864, p 10 New Greenwich Theatre The foundation stone for the new building was laid by the mayor, Councillor Harold Gibbons, on 18 June 1938.Dedication stone of the north east elevation The new building was designed by Clifford Culpin in the Art Deco style, built by William Moss & Sons and was completed in 1939. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage with eleven bays facing onto Royal Hill; the central section had a doorway on the ground floor and there was a window on the first floor with the borough coat of arms above; there was a smaller window on the second floor. A high tower was erected to the north east of the main block facing onto Greenwich High Road. The principal rooms in the complex included the council chamber itself. At the foot of the tower was a doorway with a canopy showing the signs of the zodiac to a design by Carter & Co. The south east wing of the building contained an assembly hall known as the Borough Hall. Sir Nikolaus Pevsner wrote that Greenwich Town Hall, which shows the influence of Hilversum Town Hall in the Netherlands, was \\"the only town hall of any London borough to represent the style of our time adequately\\". The building remained the headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich until the borough was merged with the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich to form the London Borough of Greenwich, with its new local seat of government at Woolwich Town Hall, in 1965. After the town hall ceased to be the local seat of government, it was extensively altered to create floors in the area of the council chamber in 1974. Renamed Meridian House, to reflect the fact that the prime meridian goes through Greenwich, it became the home of GSM London at that time. Meanwhile, the Borough Hall was used as a concert venue: the rock band Squeeze gave their first performance there in 1975, as commemorated by a blue plaque on the side of the building. The Borough Hall went on to become the home of Greenwich Dance from 1993 until the organisation moved out in 2018. ==References== Category:Government buildings completed in 1939 Category:City and town halls in London Category:Grade II listed buildings in the Royal Borough of Greenwich Category:Grade II listed government buildings ","title":"Greenwich Town Hall, London"},{"id":"63756798","text":"In 2018 a series of clashes occurred in the Central African Republic town of Batangafo between Anti-balaka and Ex-S√©l√©ka militias. == Timeline of events == * 31 October: Anti-balaka fighters stabbed motorcyclist from Kabo who delivered vaccines to hospital.

It was released in March 2019 and featured on the soundtrack of the 2019 Hindi film Kesari, starring Akshay Kumar and Parineeti Chopra, who later sang the female version. The aim of the song was to reflect a dying soldier's last thoughts in the film's final scene. Nominated for best lyrics at the Filmfare Award in February 2020, the award went to another song. Muntashir's disappointment was relayed in a tweet, making headlines in the press in India that month. On 24 April 2020, with an image of a doctor embracing a map of India, a reprise of the song was released as a tribute to healthcare workers, police and other essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. ==Kesari (2019)== \\"Teri Mitti\\" is a patriotic Hindi song which features as a tribute to soldiers on the soundtrack of the 2019 film Kesari, based on the Battle of Saragarhi, which took place in 1897. It was released on 15 March 2019, a week before the launch of the film. The lyrics were written by Manoj Muntashir, the music composed by Arko Pravo Mukherjee and it was sung by B Praak. According to Mukherjee, also referred to as Arko, they studied the film's scenes prior to first composing the music. Subsequently, Muntashir explained how he filled the composition with words. He later recalled that the aim was to reflect a dying soldier's last thoughts. In writing the lyrics he said in the same dialogue that he kept in mind a reference to Kaifi Azmi's words in \\"Kar chale hum fida\\", the sentiments of which Anurag Singh, Kesari's director, intended to re-create. The song plays at the end of the film, in the scene of the final battle. Mukherjee, having previously been responsible for romantic songs, said it was the \\"most emotional\\" song he had composed. Following its release, he reported that \\"Twitter, Instagram were flooded for all three of us. Even Karan Johar was teary-eyed after listening to the song.‚Äù The song played high on Indian charts during early 2019. By 22 July 2019, the song video crossed the 100-million views mark on YouTube. In February 2020, the song made headlines in the press in India when following its nomination for the 2020 Filmfare Award for best lyrics, the award went to someone else. When Muntashir subsequently tweeted his disappointment at the decision, which he said made both himself and millions of Indians cry, he gained support from fans and other lyricists including Neelesh Mishra and Neha Bhasin. The message he tweeted contained a verse from the song itself and a pledge not to attend future award ceremonies; > Dear Awards, even if I try all my life...I won't be able to write a better > line than 'Tu Kahti Thee Tera Chaand Hoon Main Aur Chaand Humesha Rahta > Hai'. You failed to honor the words which made millions of Indians cry and > care for their motherland. It would be a great disrespect to my art if I > still continue caring for you. So here I bid you a final good bye. I > officially announce- I won't attend any award show till I breathe my last. > Alvida. In response, Major Gaurav Arya stated that the lyrics reflected the thoughts and feelings of soldiers. Following the awards, a surge of Indians were reported to have been searching for \\"Teri Mitti\\" on Google. ==Female version (2019)== After the film's lead actress Parineeti Chopra was discovered to be constantly humming the theme tune to the film during its promotions, a proposal from the producer, Azeem, led to the making of \\"Teri Mitti\\" in her voice. Accompanied by a video consisting of clips from the film, it took a total of four hours, according to Chopra. This female version was released on 17 April 2019, and was the second of her recordings, the first being Maana Ke Hum Yaar Nahin from the film Meri Pyaari Bindu. ==Reprise (2020)== On 23 April 2020, Kumar announced that the original song had inspired a reprise version, in light of recent incidents towards healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in India and lockdown in India. The new version, Mukherjee later confirmed, was Kumar's planned tribute to doctors and healthcare workers. On the same day, director Karan Johar released a teaser to the song, attaching a message that read: \\"they are fighting to keep us safe and for that, we are forever grateful. A tribute from our hearts to theirs.\\" The tribute-version was produced with the collaboration of Johar's Dharma Productions and Zee Studios. Muntashir, Mukherjee and Praak returned to write the lyrics, compose the music and perform the song, respectively, and Kumar contributed with a performance in the video. On 24 April, the video was shared by Kumar on Twitter, with the caption \\" #TeriMitti Tribute ‚Äì an ode to our heroes in white, out now.\\" Different from the original version in Kesari, the lyrics continue on with \\"Sarhad pe jo wardi khaki thi, ab uska rang safed hua.\\", translating to \\"the uniform at borders that was khaki, is white now\\". The video features images and videos of events captured during the pandemic. After showing footage of attacks on medical staff, the last clip depicts Kumar with the final saying. Upon its release, actor Hrithik Roshan responded by describing it as \\"heartfelt\\". With an image of a doctor embracing a map of India, India.com described it as \\"magic [that] will leave you teary eyed.\\" On 28 April 2020, the video of the tribute version reached eight million views on YouTube. One police officer in Delhi reacted by reproducing his own version. On 28 April, India Today reported that his video \\"went viral\\" and was shared several hundred times shortly after being posted on Facebook. On 29 April, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police recreated their own Teri Mitti-tribute version. With several lines substituted by their officers, their accompanying video included clips of ration distributions to difficult-to-reach areas and women stitching masks. == References == == External links == * * * Category:2020 songs Category:Hindi songs Category:2019 songs Category:Songs written for films Category:Hindi film songs Category:Songs written by Arko Pravo Mukherjee Category:Songs with lyrics by Manoj Muntashir ","title":"Teri Mitti"},{"id":"63756951","text":"Jong Myong-do () is a North Korean politician and fleet admiral.

She was a dancer with Kansas City Ballet before moving to North Carolina to serve as both artistic and executive director of Greensboro Ballet. She served as the director of the ballet from 1980 until 2019, choreographing and staging over twenty-five original works. == Biography == Mayfield grew up in Des Moines, Iowa. She began training in ballet when she was seven years old. She attended the Conservatory of Music and Dance at the University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City before transferring to the National Ballet School of Washington. She left school to pursue a dance career in New York City after the National Ballet School fell under financial hardship. After an unsuccessful few years in New York, Mayfield returned to Des Moines and began working as a dance teacher and choreographer at a ballet school opened by one of her childhood ballet teachers. She taught at the school for two years before moving to Kansas City, Missouri where she earned a degree in ballet and joined the company at Kansas City Ballet as a member of the corps de ballet. While dancing in the ballet, she also worked as an arts administrator for the city of Kansas City, Kansas, across the Missouri River. In 1980 she moved from Kansas City to Greensboro, North Carolina to take up the role of artistic director and executive director of Greensboro Ballet, then a struggling ballet company known as Greensboro Civic Ballet Theatre. Within her first month as a director, Mayfield choreographed a short ballet to premier as part of the ballet's inuagural season. With only $200 in funding in 1981, she staged the company's first The Nutcracker in a local church's recreation room, profiting $1,500. The following year, she moved the company's home performance space to the World War Memorial Stadium and, later, the Carolina Theatre of Greensboro. Mayfield married John Dennis, a former ballet dancer with the Dallas Ballet, in 1993. They met when Dennis moved to Greensboro and began teaching at the ballet in 1986. In 1986 Mayfield obtained an accreditation for Greensboro Ballet as a ballet school from the Southeast Regional Ballet Association. In 1995 she separated the ballet into two programs, a classical ballet school and a small professional company. In 1992 she was honored as an \\"outstanding North Carolina dance teacher\\" by the North Carolina School of the Arts. In February 1999 she debuted her original ballet, Doors, with Greensboro Ballet at the North Carolina School of the Arts. Maryfield also choreographed Mutcracker, a parody ballet based on The Nutckracker that incorporated dogs in the performance. Mayfield choreographed and staged over twenty-five original works for Greensboro Ballet. In June 2002 Mayfield spoke out in opposition to the Greensboro Cultural Center requiring fees to non-profit arts organizations. In 2015 Mayfield graduated from the Guilford Nonprofit Consortium's Executive Director Academy. She was a recipient of the Betty Cone Medal of the Arts Award in 2007. In November 2019 Mayfield and Dennis left Greensboro Ballet. Mayfield was succeeded by ballet mistress and company member Jessica Fry McAlister as artistic director and by Jennifer Savage Gentry as executive director. Company member Nina Bass Munda succeeded Dennis as school director. In January 2020 Mayfield and Dennis filed a lawsuit against Greensboro Ballet. == References == Category:Living people Category:1946 births Category:20th-century American dancers Category:20th- century ballet dancers Category:American arts administrators Category:American art directors Category:American ballerinas Category:American women choreographers Category:American choreographers Category:Artistic directors Category:Ballet choreographers Category:Dance in North Carolina Category:Dance teachers Category:Dancers from Iowa Category:People from Des Moines, Iowa Category:University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City alumni Category:Women arts administrators ","title":"Maryhelen Mayfield"},{"id":"63757047","text":"Siddhartha Chib is a statistician and econometrician and Professor of Econometrics and Statistics at Washington University in St. Louis.

He served in the Indian Ocean under Suffren during the War of American Independence. Tromelin Island is named after him. == Biography == Born to Marie-Fran√ßoise Le Diouguel de Penanru and Jacques Boudin de Tromelin, Tromelin-Lanuguy joined the Navy as a Garde-Marine in Brest on 12 january 1766. He served in Bayonne and Saint-Malo. From 1 November 1767 to 27 January 1768, he served on the 32-gun frigate Sensible, under Captain du Chaffault, for a cruise to the Caribbean. Sick, he was disembarked at Saint-Domingue and returned to Brest on a merchantman. He then served as first officer on the cutter L√©zard, under his older brother Tromelin-Launay, departing Lorient in October 1772 to arrive at Isle de France (Mauritius) in June 1773. He was promoted to Ensign on 1 October 1773. === Dauphine === Tromelin-Lanuguy then served as first officer on Dauphine, taking part in Kerguelen's second expedition. After the return of the ships to Madagascar, he took command of Dauphine on 14 June 1774. On 29 November 1776, Dauphine rescued 7 women and an 8-month child, sole survivors of 160 slaves abandoned by the crew of a slave ship wrecked on \\"Isle aux Sables\\" (now Tromelin Island) on 27 September 1761, some 15 years earlier. In August 1778, Tromelin-Lanuguy was appointed to the 22-gun fluyt Pintade, bound for France. He left Isle de France on 28 December 1778 and arrived at Lorient on 2 July 1779. On the way, he repelled an attack from a British privateer, which earned him the Cross of the Order of Saint Louis and a promotion to Lieutenant. === War of American Independence === During the War of American Independence, Tromelin-Lanuguy served in the Indian Ocean in a squadron under Rear-Admiral Thomas d'Estienne d'Orves. He was commanding the corvette Sylphide when the squadron departed Isle de France on 7 December 1781. On 9 February 1782, Estienne d'Orves died and Suffren assumed command of the squadron. He re- appointed his captains and gave Tromelin-Lanuguy command of the corvette Subtile. In March 1782, in the wake of the Battle of Sadras, Suffren transferred Tromelin-Lanuguy to Pourvoyeuse, replacing Lieutenant de Ruyter. Tromelin-Lanuguy took part in the Battle of Providien on 12 April 1782. In April 1782, Tromelin-Lanuguy escorted prizes captured by Bellone to Tharangambadi, and from there sailed to Malaca to procure supplies and spare parts. On his journey back, he encountered five East Indiamen, resulting in the Action of 10 September 1782 after which he withdrew. Upon his return, Tromelin-Lanuguy suffered the scorn of Suffren, who blamed him for failing to press his attack on the East Indiamen. Suffren repeatedly accused Tromelin- Lanuguy oh \\"disgracing the flag\\", but when he offered to resign, Suffren refused. Tromelin-Lanuguy briefly commanded the 64-gun Saint-Michel from 18 May 1783 to 25 July, before returning to Pourvoyeuse. === Interwar === On 12 January 1784, Tromelin-Lanuguy married Marie Charlotte Julie Martin. That year, he took command of Osterley. He was promoted to Major de vaisseau on 1 May 1786. === French Revolution === In 1790, Tromelin-Lanuguy requested a leave of absence from the Navy. He was then reported by a priest loyal to the Republic, and imprisoned. A friend convinced Jeanbon Saint-Andr√© to have him freed, and Tromelin-Lanuguy resigned from the Navy. He then requested permission to leave for Isle de France, but actually emigrated to join the Arm√©e des Princes. The French Republic listed him as an √©migr√© and his property was seized. Tromelin-Lanuguy returned to France in 1797 before going to Copenhagen and embarking on the Danish East Indiaman Norge. He died aboard on 4 December 1798. == See also == * Bernard-Marie Boudin de Tromelin (1735 ‚Äî 1815), brother to Tromelin-Lanuguy * Maurice Boudin de Tromelin de Launay (1740 ‚Äî 1825), brother to Tromelin-Lanuguy == Sources and references == Notes References Bibliography * * Category:French Navy officers ","title":"Jacques Marie Boudin de Tromelin de La Nuguy"},{"id":"63757178","text":"Hollin Well and Annesley (Also spelt Hollinwell and Annesley) railway station is a former station on the Great Central Railway on the section from Nottingham Victoria to Sheffield Victoria.

Instituted in 2017, the Committee was originally chaired by Beata Szyd≈Ço, the previous prime minister and incumbent deputy prime minister.

In the 2019 European Parliamentary Election, the United Right put up Szyd≈Ço's candidacy. The feputy prime minister obtained a seat, which resulted in the relinquishment of her ministerial offices on June 3.

Another amendment introduced to the Prime Minister's regulation did not rescind Piotr Gli≈Ñski's presidency over the advisory body, either. ==Purposes and composition== The main purpose of the Social Committee of the Council of Ministers is initiation, supervision, and coordination of any governmental projects supposed to improve the situation of Polish families prior to their submission to the Sejm. The Prime Minister's regulation also obligates the body to conduct analyses and assessments as regards the above, as well as execute any other missions commissioned by the Head of Government.

The Philippine Super Liga (PSL) and the Premier Volleyball League (PVL). The scheduling of both leagues has hampered the program of the Philippines national team and a merger of the two leagues has been proposed to remedy the issue. Two methods has been proposed; either through a \\"unified calendar\\" or adjustment of the two league's scheduling to deal with scheduling conflict, or an outright merger of the two leagues. ==Background== The top women's volleyball leagues in the Philippines are the Philippine Super Liga (PSL) and the Premier Volleyball League (PVL). Scheduling of both leagues, accounting for both match days and training, has often clashed with each other causing player availability issues for the Philippine national team. An example of the two league affecting the national team program was in the 2019 Southeast Asian Games where the women's national team did not medal while the men's national team clinched a silver medal finish. The men's national team does not experience scheduling conflicts as the women's. The two leagues has agreed in principle to initiate a merger of the two leagues as September 2019. However formal talks were suspended due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. There are at least two proposed methods on how a merger would be implented. One is for the two leagues to come up with a \\"unified calendar\\", or a synchronized scheduling which would make all players competing in the two leagues available for the Philippine national league within a certain time window. This could be a prelude to an outright merger of the PSL and PVL into one unified league. ===Unity Cup=== As a lead up to a potential merger, the PSL and PVL plan to organize a tournament featuring sides from both leagues called the Unity Cup. Planning of the tournament started as early as December 2019. Planning for the tournament was stalled due to the Luzon enhanced community quarantine imposed in March 2020 due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Being discussed is the number of teams to participate. The PSL proposes a 16-team tournament with eight teams each from the two leagues participating while the PVL proposed a smaller 8-team tournament. ==References== Category:Sports-related mergers Category:Volleyball in the Philippines merger merger ","title":"PSL‚ÄìPVL merger"},{"id":"63757334","text":"Sega Bass Fishing 2 is a video game developed by WOW Entertainment and published by Sega for the Dreamcast.

Built by quarry manager and Washington State Legislator Charles Roth and named after his wife, Lottie, the building is clad in the famous Chuckanut Sandstone from his Bellingham Bay Quarry that would be used in countless building projects across the region. Completed in 1891, it was one of the last large commissions of noted Northwest architect Elmer H. Fisher and his only project in Whatcom County. While initially built as an office/retail building in anticipation of the commercial expansion of the town of Whatcom, it was converted entirely to Apartments by 1918 when commercial development moved in the opposite direction towards New Whatcom, which after 1903 became the new city of Bellingham's downtown. Still strictly serving as a residential building to the current day, the Lottie Roth Block was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 1978. ==History== Charles Independence Roth was born in Peoria, Illinois on July 4, 1860 (the source of his middle name). First practicing as a lawyer, he was admitted to the bar in 1881 and arrived in Washington Territory in 1883, settling immediately in what was then known as Whatcom where he was elected probate judge in 1884. The following year he married Charlotte \\"Lottie\\" T. Roeder, the daughter of the pioneer Captain Henry Roeder, the first permanent white settler in Whatcom County and founder of the Chuckanut Quarry which would become famous for its Chuckanut sandstone. Roth soon became manager of the quarry and within a few more years would become co-owner. Following the Great Seattle Fire in June of 1889 (among many other fires that ravaged Washington's major cities that Summer), Roth's sandstone became very high in demand, earning him a small fortune which in turn was invested into real estate around Whatcom County, including the future site of the Roth Block. One of Roth's biggest clients was architect Elmer H. Fisher who was at the forefront of rebuilding downtown Seattle and whose Romanesque Revival designs called for heavy use of his sandstone. In 1890 Roth commissioned Fisher to design a 3 story commercial and office building for one of his properties in Whatcom at the Northeast corner of Holly and G Streets, at the northern fringe of the business district. It was to be clad in his quarry's sandstone on the West and South elevations as a form of advertising. Construction began in the Summer of 1890. Several other large buildings of similar composition using Roth's sandstone were being constructed around Bellingham at the time, including the Pike Block at Holly & Elk Streets and the Whatcom County Courthouse, both of which would be demolished in the mid-20th century. In February 1891, just as the Roth Block was being completed, Whatcom merged with the adjacent New Whatcom and the focus of commercial development soon shifted to the higher, more level townsite leaving the Roth Block even more isolated as the surrounding area began to transition to more industrial uses. While still being able to retain some retail on the ground floor, the building's upper floors soon transitioned from offices to Hotel rooms and then to apartments. In 1918, the building was permanently converted to Apartments. A floor was added by splitting the retail level into two and filling in the storefronts with smaller windows and more sandstone. A single shop was retained on the lower level corner. == See also == List of Registered Historic Places in Washington == References == Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Washington (state) Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1890 Category:Buildings and structures in Bellingham, Washington Category:National Register of Historic Places in Whatcom County, Washington Category:Romanesque Revival architecture in Washington (state) ","title":"Lottie Roth Block"},{"id":"63757775","text":" ","title":"Making"},{"id":"63757777","text":"Kozhipporu is an Indian Malayalam-language Family Drama film written and directed by Jinoy Janardhanan and Jibit George, and starred Indrans, Pauly Valsan, Anjali Nair, Jolly Chirayath, Veena Nandakumar, Jinoy Janardhanan, Navajith Narayanan, Sohan Seenulal and Praveen TJ.

The College was founded in 1656 by Giuseppe Ghislieri and was meant to host 24 boys of the decayed pontifical nobility for free during high school. Placed under the protection of the duke Salviati, the college was closed in 1928. The building which hosted the college, possibly work of Carlo Maderno, was demolished in the 1930s. Its fa√ßade on Via Giulia and some decorations have survived, incorporated in the structure of the Liceo classico Virgilio, built on the same site between 1936 and 1939 after a design by Marcello Piacentini. ==Location== The building was located in Rome, in the Regola Rione, about halfway down via Giulia (at the n. 38),Borghi (2015), p. 43 in an area devastated by the demolitions started in 1938 for the construction of a road between Ponte Mazzini and Corso Vittorio Emanuele, never built because of the war. To the south it bordered with vicolo dello struzzo. ==History== In 1656 Giuseppe Ghislieri (1570‚Äì1656), a renowned physician and member of the family to which Pope Pius V (r. 1566‚Äì1572) had belonged, on his deathbed destined all his goods to the foundation of this institution.Baronio (1697), p. 246Pietrangeli (1979), p. 22 In 1670, after being housed in various locations (at the Botteghe Oscure in front of Santo Stanislao dei Polacchi, in Via della Stamperia by Palazzo Pamphilj and at Via della Lupa), the Collegio moved to its final seat at via Giulia, in a 16th century palace possibly designed by Carlo Maderno. The institution was administered by four guardiani of the Archconfraternity of the Sancta Sanctorum by the holy stairs,Baronio (1697), p. 247 and was placed under the protection of the noble Florentine family of the Salviati. When the Salviati family died out in 1794, protectors became several cardinals, including Francesco Carafa della Spina di Traetto and Joseph Fesch, uncle of Napoleon and resident not far away, at Palazzo Falconieri in Via Giulia. In 1839 the third-born son of the prince Borghese took the name of the Salviati, thus regaining the protectorate of the college. The institution was closed in 1928 because of financial difficulties. Through the proceeds of the liquidation, however, annual scholarships were instituted which allowed to continue the college mission. Between 1936 and 1939 the building was almost completely demolished to make way for the Liceo classico Virgilio, a controversial work by Marcello Piacentini. ==Organization== The boarding school housed for five years 24 young people (later increased to 38) from fallen noble families of the Papal State. Later, the school was opened to young boys of each class. At the time of admission the students had to be not older than 18 years and were lodged for a maximum of five years.Borghi (2015), p. 44 Of these, six were hosted free of charge: five of them were designated one each by as many noble families, and the sixth by the Roman people. The students attended the subjects of their choice at the Collegio Romano without any obligation to join the ecclesiastical career, even though they had to wear a long black dress under their knees and a black cassock, and they had to attend daily mass and often take the sacraments.Borghi (2015), p. 45 The boys were housed in three dormitories, intended for the younger, the older and the middle ones. The wake up call took place at 5:30 a.m., and after having washed with cold water and followed the lessons at the Collegio Romano, they continued their study in the premises of Via Giulia. After the recreation they had to study until the evening for three hours and a quarter. The discipline was very hard, and for every little lack the students were forced to suffer penances and punishments, such the so called piatto rovesciato (), that is being at lunch with the overturned dish in silence, therefore fasting. ==Architecture and Decoration== The relief portraying the Holy Family placed above the entrance portal The building, according to some sources, was a 16th century work by Carlo Maderno. It was structured on two floors with a mezzanine on the ground floor, and had a front of ten windows with an portal asymmetrical with respect to the fa√ßade. Pietrangeli (1979), p. 24 The edifice was almost completely demolished at the end of the 1930s for the construction of the Liceo classico Virgilio. What remained of the old building, including the facade along Via Giulia, was incorporated into the high school building: in particular, at the number 38 of Via Giulia has been remained in place the ancient and imposing portal, surmounted by a curvilinear broken tympanum adorned by a relief representing the Holy Family. Below this, it is placed the coat of arms of the House of Ghislieri, surrounded by the following inscription in a cartouche: ==Notable Alumni== * Mario Mattei (1792‚Äì1870), Italian Cardinal * Guido Baccelli (1830‚Äì1916), Italian physician, professor and statesman Borghi (2015), passim ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:Rome R.

On each of the second to fourth abdominal segments there is a pair of yellow patches, which usually merge to form bandages. On the last tergite there is another yellow spot in the middle, in the males it is whitish coloured. The tips of the antennae (biology) are yellow-brown. == Occurrence == The species is widespread in Central Europe and is common in places. It lives near the nesting places of its hosts, especially on old wooden posts. The flight period is from March/April to July. == Way of life == The wasp parasitizes bees of the genera Heriades, Osmia and Anthophora. The females are often found near the nest openings of bees in dead wood or hollow stalks. An egg is laid anywhere in an unsealed brood cell of bees, filled with pollen and nectar. The wasp larva hatching from it first sucks out the bee egg and then feeds on the supplies. In some years the wasp populations are so large that they can significantly decimate the bees. == Sources == *Heiko Bellmann: Bienen, Wespen, Ameisen. Hautfl√ºgler Mitteleuropas.

L'espionne de Guillaume (Wilhelm's Spy) is a 1916 French spy film directed by Henri Pouctal, starring Claude M√©relle, Gaston Michel and Julien Cl√©ment. It is about an amateur detective unmasking a group of German spies in France on the eve of World War I. The scenario of the film is based on the novel L'espionne de Guillaume by Arthur Bern√®de.Review, synopsis and link to watch the film: ==Plot== On the eve of World War I, three undercover German spies in France are sabotaging the work of an explosive factory in Bar le Duc and are trying to steal the secret formula of a new explosive. The ringleader, Emma Luckner, nicknamed The Spy of Wilhelm, has direct access to Kaiser Wilhelm II, and often disguises as a widow. She is assisted by Colonel von Reitzer, undercover as Gerfaut, foreman at the explosive factory, and Captain Ulrich von Herfeld, undercover as Marois, one of the richest owners of Bar-le-Duc. Engineer Vallier, the deputy director of the factory and Yvonne, the daughter of the factory's director Mr. Richard, are in love but Mr. Richard has promised her hand to Marois. In Paris, detective Chantecoq is given the mission to find out who is sabotaging the work of the factory. Chantecoq starts his investigations in Bar le Duc disguised as a peasant. The same evening Gerfaut, after having bombed the factory sends an anonymous note to Richard asking him to meet him at a chapel in ruins. There he offers him money for the formula. Richard, outraged attacks him and is shot dead by accomplices of Gerfaut. Later, Chantecoq finds Richard's body hidden near the ruined chapel. Following Richard's murder, Gerfaut goes to Paris, disguised as Richard, to meet inventor Aubry in order to get the explosive formula. Rather than giving to him, Aubry proposes to go with him to Bar le Duc and start together the production. Before the train journey takes place, Aubry is warned by Chantecoq that Richard is dead and that he has met an imposter. They agree that Chantecoq will disguise as Aubry and travel with the fake Richard to try to confound him. Emma disguised as a widow takes place in the same compartment as Gerfaut and Chantecoq and together the two spies overpower him. They are very happy to discover that Aubry is in fact their worst enemy Chantecoq and they ship him to Germany in a trunk. Meanwhile, in Bar le Duc, the police has found Richard's body. Gerfaut tells the police that Vallier was the murderer and organises a demonstration of workers accusing Gerfaut. The police finds in Vallier's office documents proving his contacts with a foreign power. Despite his protests that the documents are fake, he his arrested for murder and high treason. In Germany, Chantecoq is presented to the Crown Prince who is convinced he will be able to convince him to give the explosive formula to the Germans. Chantecoq pretends he agrees but Emma does not believe him and tries to have him poisoned. Chantecoq let his guard eat the food presented to him and they both die. He complains to the Crown Prince who has Emma sent back to France. There, together with Gerfaut and Marois, they force open Aubry's safe to steal the formula. But Aubry had booby-trapped the safe causing Marois to be killed and Gerfaut and Emma arrested. Chantecoq is invited to have lunch with the Crown Prince on the terrasse of one his castles overlooking a lake separating Germany from Switzerland. Chantecoq knocks out his host with a bottle and escapes on a rowboat. He first exults over his easy escape but is rapidly disillusioned when the Prince's men start shooting at him and chase him with a speed boat. Just before being caught, Chantecoq jumps into the water. In Paris, at Vallier's criminal trial, Gerfaut renews his accusations. Aubry tries to defend Vallier, convinced that a plot is preventing Chantecoq from demonstrating his innocence. Chantecoq finally appears, greeted by the crowd and Vallier is acquitted. In an epilogue, Chantecoq is sitting in a garden with his friends and a flashback shows how he managed to arrive in Switzerland. ==Production and Reception== The film was shot in France during the second year of World War I, during the Battle of Verdun. The location of the action is Bar le Duc was highly symbolic given that Verdun was nearly surrounded by the Germans and the only road connecting it to the rest of France was the road to Bar le Duc, which was the place where supplies and men were concentrated before being sent to the front. Some sources indicate that Abel Gance was Pouctal's location manager for this film. Cin√© pour tous, mars 1923, quoted by Roger Icart. Abel Gance ou le Prom√©th√©e foudroy√©.

Unlike germline mutations, which can be passed on to the descendants of an organism, somatic mutations are not usually transmitted to descendants. This distinction is blurred in plants, which lack a dedicated germline, and in those animals that can reproduce asexually through mechanisms such as budding, as in members of the cnidarian genus Hydra. While somatic mutations are not passed down to an organism's offspring, somatic mutations will be present in all descendants of a cell within the same organism. Many cancers are the result of accumulated somatic mutations. == Fraction of cells affected == The term somatic is generally used in biology to refer to the cells of the body in contrast to the reproductive (germline) cells, which usually give rise to the egg or sperm. For example, in mammals, somatic cells make up all the internal organs, skin, bones, blood and connective tissue. There are approximately 220 types of somatic cells in the human body. In most animals, separation of germ cells from somatic cells (germline development) occurs during early stages of development. Once this segregation has occurred in the embryo, any mutation outside of the germline cells can not passed down to an organism's offspring. However, somatic mutations are passed down to the all the progeny of a mutated cell within the same organism. A major section of an organism therefore might carry the same mutation, especially if that mutation occurs at earlier stages of development. Somatic mutations that occur later in an organisms life can be hard to detect, as they may affect only a single cell; improvements in single cell sequencing are therefore an important tool for the study of somatic mutation. Both the nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA of a cell can accumulate mutations; somatic mitochondrial mutations have been implicated in development of some neurodegenerative diseases. === Exceptions to inheritance === Hydra oligactis with two buds. Reproduction by budding is an exception the rule that somatic mutations can not be inherited. The definition of a somatic mutation as any mutation that cannot be passed down to offspring is useful in animals that have a dedicated germline to produce reproductive cells. However, it is of little value in understanding the inheritance of somatic mutation in multicellular organisms that do not designate germ cells in early development. Plants and basal animals such as sponges and corals do not have a germline; instead they generate gametes from pluripotent stem cells in adult somatic tissues. In flowering plants, for example, germ cells can arise from adult somatic cells in the floral meristem. Other animals without a designated germ line include tunicates and flatworms. This distinction is also blurred in organisms that can reproduce asexually, without production of gametes. For instance, animals in the cnidarian genus Hydra can reproduce asexually through the mechanism of budding (they can also reproduce sexually). In hydra, a new bud develops directly from somatic cells of the parent hydra. A mutation present in the tissue that give rise to the daughter organism would be passed down to that offspring. Many plants naturally reproduce through vegetative reproduction - growth of a new plant from a fragment of the parent plant - propagating somatic mutations without the step of seed production. Humans artificially induce vegetative reproduction via grafting and stem cuttings. == Causes == UV light can damage DNA by causing pyrimidine dimers. Adjacent bases bond with each other, instead of across the ‚Äúladder‚Äù. The distorted DNA molecule does not function properly. Mutation can result if mistakes occur in DNA repair or replication. As with germline mutations, mutations in somatic cells may arise due to endogenous factors, including errors during DNA replication and repair, and exposure to reactive oxygen species produced by normal cellular processes. Mutations can also be induced by contact with mutagens, which can increase the rate of mutation. Most mutagens act by causing DNA damage - alterations in DNA structure such as pyrimidine dimers, or breakage of one or both DNA strands. DNA repair processes can remove DNA damages that would, otherwise, upon DNA replication, cause mutation. Mutation results from damage when mistakes in the mechanism of DNA repair causes a change in nucleotide sequence, or if replication occurs before repair is complete. Mutagens can be physical, such as radiation from UV rays and X-rays, or chemical - molecules that interact directly with DNA - such as metabolites of benzo[a]pyrene, a potent carcinogen found in tobacco smoke. Mutagens associated with cancers are often studied to learn about cancer and its prevention. == Mutation frequency == Research suggests that the frequency of mutations is generally higher in somatic cells than in cells of the germline; furthermore, there are differences in the types of mutation seen in the germ and in the soma. There is variation in mutation frequency between different somatic tissues within the same organism and between species. Milholland et al. (2017) examined the mutation rate of dermal fibroblasts (a type of somatic cell) and germline cells in humans and in mice. They measured the rate of single nucleotide variants (SNVs), most of which are a consequence of replication error. Both in terms of mutational load (total mutations present in a cell) and mutation rate per cell division (new mutations with each mitosis), somatic mutation rates were more than ten times that of the germline, in humans and in mice. In humans, mutation load in fibroblasts was over twenty times greater than germline (2.8 √ó 10-7 compared with 1.2 √ó 10-8 mutations per base pair). Adjusted for differences in the estimated number of cell divisions, the fibroblast mutation rate was about 80 times greater than the germ (respectively, 2.66 √ó 10-9 vs. 3.3 √ó 10-11 mutations per base pair per mitosis). The disparity in mutation rate between the germline and somatic tissues likely reflects the greater importance of genetic integrity in the germline than in the soma. Variation in mutation frequency may be due to differences in rates of DNA damage or to differences in the DNA repair process as a result of elevated levels of DNA repair enzymes. === Somatic hypermutation === As a part of the adaptive immune response, antibody- producing B cells experience a mutation rate many times higher than the normal rate of mutation. The mutation rate in antigen-binding coding sequences of the immunoglobulin genes is up to 1,000,000 times higher than in cell lines outside the lymphoid system. A major step in affinity maturation, somatic hypermutation helps B cells produce antibodies with greater antigen affinity. == Disease == Somatic mutations accumulate within an organism's cells as it ages and with each round of cell division; the role of somatic mutations in the development of cancer is well established, and is implicated in the biology of aging. Mutations in neuronal stem cells (especially during neurogenesis) and in post-mitotic neurons lead to genomic heterogeneity of neurons - referred to as \\"somatic brain mosaicism\\". The accumulation of age- related mutations in neurons may be linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, but the association is unproven. The majority of central-nervous system cells in the adult are post-mitotic, and adult mutations might affect only a single neuron. Unlike in cancer, where mutations result in clonal proliferation, detrimental somatic mutations might contribute to neurodegenerative disease by cell death. Accurate assessment of somatic mutation burden in neurons therefore remains difficult to assess. === Role in carcinogenesis === If a mutation occur in a somatic cell of an organism, it will be present in all descendants of this cell within the same organism. The accumulation of certain mutations over generations of somatic cells is part of the process of malignant transformation, from normal cell to cancer cell. Cells with heterozygous loss-of-function mutations (one good copy of a gene and one mutated copy) may function normally with the unmutated copy until the good copy has been spontaneously somatically mutated. This kind of mutation happens often in living organisms, but it is difficult to measure the rate. Measuring this rate is important in predicting the rate at which people may develop cancer. == See also == * Mosaic (genetics) * Human somatic variation == References == Category:DNA Category:Genetics Category:Mutation ","title":"Somatic mutation"},{"id":"63758245","text":"Ronald Thomas Dalton Neville (2 December 1929 ‚Äì 31 May 1986) was an Australia- born Papua New Guinean politician and businessman.

The work is particularly noted in modern scholarship for including an account of the travels of a Norwegian traveller whom it calls Ohthere, which provides unique information about northern Europe around the late ninth century.Nicole Guenther Discenza, ‚ÄòOrosius, Old English', in The Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature in Britain . ==Editions and translations== * Orosius, Old English History of the World: An Anglo-Saxon Rewriting of Orosius, ed. and trans.

The squadron was first formed during the pre-war expansion of the army in 1939 just before Second World War.

Just a little after forming, the squadron was disbanded.Niehorster, Leo. ‚ÄúAldershot Command.‚Äù Aldershot Command, British Army, 03.09.1939, http://niehorster.org/017_britain/39_commands/aldershot.html.Watson and Rinaldi Page 151 In May 1940, the squadron was reformed in the Middle-East known as 10th Railway Construction and Operations Company (10 RW Cons and Op Coy). By July the squadron was based at RAF El Daba, supporting the RAF squadrons there. While based, the squadron was tasked with supporting the RAF squadrons through railway construction and support operations. Just a little after this, the squadron was moved to Sudan after being replaced by another company. By 1943, the squadron was renamed as 10th Railway Construction Company. In October 1943, following the Invasion of Sicily and eventual movement into mainland Italy, the company was assigned to the 1212th Railway Construction Group. Following the end of the war, the company was based in Trieste and later Austria. ===Post War=== In 1947, the company moved to Egypt and assigned to the 10th Transport Regiment. Later, the squadron was assigned to Headquarters Railway Group in the Suez Canal Zone and then later the Middle-East Transport Regiment in 1954. By May 1955 the company moved to Longmoor and was assigned to the 16th Railway Training Regiment. In June of that year, the company was reduced to a cadre but by September was reformed and renamed as 10 Transportation Squadron. After reforming, the squadron joined the former regiment the 16th. Just a few weeks after, the squadron was reorganized as a Port for Far East Land Forces (FARLEF). After reorganizing, the squadron moved to Singapore seems to have become independent after this move. During this time, the squadron was administered by the 17th Port Transport Regiment. During this time, the squadron maintained an independent troop in Hong Kong. By 1960, the squadron was assigned to the Engineer Base Group, Singapore. In 1964 the squadron was disbanded and their role taken over by the Royal Logistic Corps.Watson and Rinaldi Page 244 In 1964 the squadron was disbanded and concurrently reformed that same year as 10 Field Squadron (Airfields). The squadron was formed at Invicta barracks in Maidstone under 36 Engineer Regiment. Formed with the original intention of supporting the troops based in Aden it was No. 5004 RAF Airfield Construction Squadron reformed under the Army control. In August the next year, the squadron moved to RAF Khormaksar and assigned directly to British Forces Aden. In October that same year, the squadron moved location to RAF Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates. After moving, the squadron was renamed as 10 (Gulf) Field Squadron. By January 1969 the squadron moved back to Longmoore and assigned to the 37th Engineer Regiment. After moving back, the squadron was used as Hawker Siddeley Harrier air support squadron. In 1969 the Harrier had just been introduced, it was the newest and very first VTOL operational plane. It was found that after an examination, the Harrier worked much better in groups instead of individually. This created a need for a Harrier Support Group, this formation was the result of the 1966 Defence White Paper. From February to April 1971 the squadron deployed, less one troop deployed to Gibraltar on an emergency tour. And in April, still without that troop, deployed to Honduras. The troop that had been left behind, \\"A Troop\\" deployed to Northern Ireland as part of Operation Banner from October 70‚ÄîJanuary 71. By January 1973 the squadron moved to RAF Laarbruch in Western Germany. After moving, the squadron was assigned as one of the RAF Support units. By 1982 the squadron moved to Mansergh Barracks in Gutersloh under 38th Engineer Regiment. Finally, in December 1992 the squadron became \\"non-operational\\" and was disbanded in July 1993. ===21st Century=== On 26 February 2004 following the \\"Delivering Security in a Changing World\\" reforms of 2003, the squadron was reformed as 10 Field Squadron (Air Support). The squadron was based at RAF Leeming and assigned to 39 Engineer Regiment (Air Assault). The squadron later deployed on Operation Telic II from June‚ÄîNovember 2003.

Hansen was born in Gisborne in 1934 and grew up in Hexton near Gisborne. His parents were Ruie and Eva Hansen, and he had three siblings. His father was riding in the cavalry in WWI and all four children developed into skilled equestrians. Graeme started riding aged five; it was his transport to get to Mangapapa Primary School. He then attended Gisborne Intermediate and King's College in Auckland. His nickname \\"Hec\\" referred to the most prominent jockey of the time, Hector Gray. Hansen started competing internationally in 1959. His uncle gave him a horse, Saba Sam, which his uncle considered not good enough for track racing, but it turned out to be an excellent show jumper. In 1964, Graeme Hansen and his elder brother Bruce Hansen made the first New Zealand equestrian team that was sent to the Tokyo Olympics. At the team jumping event captained by Bruce Hansen, they came in tenth place. In the individual jumping event he came twenty-third on Saba Sam. Graeme Hansen was New Zealand Olympian number 179. Both Hansen brothers retired from international competitions in 1968. Hansen was also competing in track racing and went horse hunting. He became an international horse jumping judge and was sought after to speak at judging seminars. Hansen last went horse hunting three weeks before his death. He died, after a short illness, in late August 2007. He was survived by his wife and three children. In 2013, Hansen was posthumously inducted into the Tairawhiti Hall of Fame.

The tree has an association with an aggressive species of ant with a very painful sting, which lives in its hollow branches and twigs, and gives rise to its common name of \\"ant tree\\". ==Description== Barteria fistulosa is a small evergreen tree growing to a height of about . It has a deep taproot, multiple trunks and spreading horizontal branches which are hollow. The leaves are alternate, simple, slightly overlapping and borne on short flattened stalks. The leaf blades are glossy green, oblong, and widest just beyond the mid-point, and have entire margins and a slight notch at the apex. The tiny, regular, white flowers form an arc of five flowers around the leaf bases and are followed by small globular fruits. ==Distribution and habitat== Barteria fistulosa can be found in tropical Central Africa, its range extending from Nigeria to the Democratic Republic of Congo. It grows in moist mixed terra firma forest, where it forms part of the understory. It is also found in gallery forests, secondary forests, glades and clearings. The seedlings can tolerate deep shade. ==Ecology== Tetraponera aethiops Barteria fistulosa has a symbiotic relationship with the very aggressive ant Tetraponera aethiops, which makes its home in the hollow twigs and branches (known as domatia) and defends the tree against herbivores. This ant lives exclusively on B. fistulosa; each ant colony has a single queen and the ants feed on nectar produced by the tree in extra-floral nectaries, and on the honeydew produced by scale insects that they tend inside their domatia. Elephants like to feed on the foliage of this tree, but their trunks are likely to be very sensitive to attacks by the ant. As well as deterring herbivores, the ants remove pieces of debris from the surface of the leaves, carrying them to the edge of the blade before dropping them off. ==Uses== Several parts of this tree are used in traditional medicine; the roots, bark and leaves are used to reduce fevers and pains; a decoction of the bark has various uses and the sap helps with the healing of wounds; some parts of the tree are used against snake bites and epilepsy; and the young shoots are thought to have aphrodisiac properties. ==References== Category:Passifloraceae Category:Flora of Africa ","title":"Barteria fistulosa"},{"id":"63758725","text":"Thomas John Fahey (born 27 August 1943) is an Australian equestrian.

This work marks a turning point in Gerhard's style and composition processes, because in one hand, he recovers some old techniques such as the sonata form in the first movement, along with others not as old like the 12-tone technique. Gerhard brilliantly develops, combines and transforms these resources along with new systematic processes created by himself, so that it leads to a new and broad theoretical framework that will be essential to his music thereafter. == Background == Robert Gerhard began writing this string quartet in 1951 in Cambridge, where he lived in exile since 1939 as a result of Franco's dictatorship, within a significant historical and personal context. He had been one of the most important disciples (from the few who remained alive) of Arnold Schoenberg, who died in the same year of 1951. At the same moment, the twelve-tone compositional technique of the avant-garde in the interwar period defended by Schoenberg was replaced by integral serialism, led by Pierre Boulez. Shortly before, two of Gerhard's last pieces were poorly received by critics. The first one, the opera The Duenna, released abroad, was rejected for \\"abusing popular melodies\\", which may not have happened if the premiere had been in Barcelona. There, the public could have been more involved in the plot and its references to politics and society. The second piece, Sonata for viola and piano, is said to have been \\"lacking originality\\". This led Gerhard to a period of crisis. At this point he is witnessing a second great shock in the world of musical composition, after the first step towards the twelve-tone system, at the end of the First World War. Afterwards, he began a third stage of his compositional career, characterized by an exploration of the concept of serialism, but in a very different direction from that of Boulez or Messiaen. From then on, he applies the concept of serialization to pitch and temporalities, but in a more lax way: he does not necessarily make use of the entire chromatic scale, and also makes some block exchanges within a single series, leaving more room for expressiveness. He also develops serialism in terms of time, based on the concept of time-seven: Gerhard is inclined to orient himself towards proportions (rather than rhythm) and the distance between events (so that articulation, rhythm, duration, metric and form, are included in the same spectrum). However, despite the criticisms and his predilection for this new serialism, Gerhard was never opposed to use elements from the Catalan folk music in aspects such as rhythm, orchestration or in the shape of the tone-rows. From this moment on, he also took over from Schoenberg in the didactic field of 12-tone teaching, giving lectures and writing articles. In this sense, he shares with Bart√≥k the will of transforming the tradition to maintain it. In fact, the esthetic evoked by some of the pieces of this creative new period by Gerhard, such as the Piano Concerto (1951) or the Harpsichord Concerto (1956), denote to some extent, a clear influence of the Hungarian composer. In addition to this, by comparing aspects such as form, rhythm, modes or coloration, one can clearly see the existence of similarities in the use of folk music from the respective regions of each of the composers. Two years later, the premiere of the Symphony No. 1 (1953) had a considerable success, at the Festival of the International Society of Contemporary Music in Baden-Baden. Despite Gerhard didn't follow the other new musical currents, he was well aware of the work of the new generations of British composers and, in general, of the international scene. Within this situation there are a couple of exceptions: on one hand, during the 1950s he wrote instrumental music for BBC series (using the pseudonym \\"Joan de Serrallonga\\"); on the other hand, he researched and experimented with electronic music (particularly concrete music), obtaining resources and materials that would later give rise to his electro-acoustic compositions. In this task, Leopoldina Feichtegger played an important role (Poldi, married to Gerhard). And it could also be said that they would hardly have achieved all this progress without the patronage of Alice Roughton, who offered jobs and housing to the marriage: Alice's residence was an important place of assistance and reunion between intellectuals of the time. An important fact about the string quartet No. 1 is that actually it was not the first quartet he composed, as he had previously written 3 more, but Gerhard ended up dismissing the idea of incorporating this others into his catalog. The first two date from 1917 (being a pupil of Felip Pedrell) and 1922 (self-taught) respectively. The third has a more complex history: he composed it in 1927, while he was Schoenberg's student, but it is discussed whether it was really a work he presented to the professor of the Akademie der K√ºnste or not, as it differs stylistically from the rest of his works. However, a part of the material of this latter quartet appears in the Concertino for Strings (1929). In addition, two years before his return to Catalonia in 1929, he presented this quartet to a composition competition in Barcelona, to get a boost in his career in terms of recognition and economic autonomy. == Analysis == This work is written in four movements, and has an approximate duration of 20 minutes (19 in the premiere and 23 in the recording of the Kreutzer Quartet, of which the durations below are noted): * First movement: Allegro assai (7'11\\") * Second movement: Con vivacit√† (2'35\\") * Third movement: Grave (5'24\\") * Fourth movement: Molto allegro (8'34\\") The temporal difference between the beginning of the compositional process of the work and the end, although based on the same twelve-note sequence, creates a stylistic separation between movements 1‚Äì2 and 3‚Äì4. The last two movements are one of the first explorations of the \\"Combinatory Code\\" that relates heights and proportions through series.Mitchell, Rachel E. \\"Roberto Gerhard's Serial Procedures and Formal Design in String Quartets Nos. 1 and 2.\\" In: Adkins, Monty. The Roberto Gerhard Companion. Routledge, 2016-02-24, p. 193‚Äì194. . > \\"[I] employ simultaneously with the 12-note series, a set of numerically > expressed proportions.

Appearance of two complementary hexachords at the beginning of the pieceMitchell, Rachel E. \\"Form and function in Roberto Gerhard's String Quartet no. 1\\". Proceedings of the 1st International Roberto Gerhard Conference, p. 63. In addition, incidentally, one can notice that the golden ratio is implicit in the duration of the last movements:Mitchell, Rachel E. \\"Roberto Gerhard's Serial Procedures and Formal Design in String Quartets Nos. 1 and 2\\". In: Adkins, Monty. The Roberto Gerhard Companion. Routledge, 2016-02-24, p. 201. . this may vary depending on the recording, but we can see that the ratio between the fourth and third movement is approaching, as well as the total of the recording between the last two movements. === Analysis of the movements ===  Moviment I (Allegro assai)  Gerhard worked hard to reinvent the application of the sonata form by mixing it with the stylistic resources that he uses in his compositions, and this movement is a clear example of this. However, outside tonality, it was necessary to define new musical processes that would allow structuring a sonata within thematic and harmonic parameters. Because the thematic element is preserved within the twelve-tone ideology, it is not necessary to change the technique in this regard beyond the use of the kind of melodic lines of its own. As for harmony and the lack of tonality, he divides the tone-row of heights into two Hexachords and uses this duality to achieve the harmonic contrast that previously was marked by ancient modes and tonalities. Hexachords are a resource Schoenberg had used before, and Gerhard is known to have spent some time studying his master's compositions such as Von Heute auf Morgen.Mitchell, Rachel E. \\"Roberto Gerhard's Serial Procedures and Formal Design in String Quartets Nos. 1 and 2\\". In: Adkins, Monty. The Roberto Gerhard Companion. Routledge, 2016-02-24, p. 186. . Figure 2. Every possible hexachord, \\"closely\\" related to their inversions by means of the 12-tone series of the first movementMitchell, Rachel E. \\"Form and function in Roberto Gerhard's String Quartet no. 1\\". Proceedings of the 1st International Roberto Gerhard Conference, p. 64. The division of the tone-row into these two complementary hexachords at the beginning of the quartet predisposes the importance that the hexachordal relationship plays in this work. In addition to this, each hexachord in the original series is part of the SC 6‚Äì22 (012468), which is complementary in itself. As a result, each hexachord, either extracted from the beginning or the end of the row, is related by its transposition and retrograded inversion. Gerhard takes this a step further by choosing to relate hexachordal tone-rows that share five pitch classes in common. This means that for each hexachordal row there will be two other hexachords that share five pitch classes among each other. Since Gerhard exploits these relationships exclusively quartet, we will refer to hexachords who manifest this relationship as \\"closely\\" related. While each hexachord in its prime form has only one related companion who shares the six pitch classes, there are two hexachordal transformations for each of the related six-note segments. This ladder-shaped relationship can be seen in Figure 2, which features a \\"hexachordal matrix\\", where each prime shape of the series is reordered from lowest to highest (from the order of pitch class) within its two hexachordal limits. Lines drawn from each hexachord to the other are paired with their nearest relative. Due to this relationship, Gerhard can move perfectly between multiple transformations of the series keeping at least five notes in common between each hexachord, resulting in clear and uninterrupted harmonic coherence. Figure 3. The distribution of hexachords along the piece's structure, draws similarities with the sonata formMitchell, Rachel E. \\"Form and function in Roberto Gerhard's String Quartet no. 1\\". Proceedings of the 1st International Roberto Gerhard Conference, p. 65. Regarding the use of these hexachords in the themes, he develops the relationships between these two structures, using retrogrades and inversions to develop the areas that correspond to exposition, development, recapitulation, and primary and subordinate themes. Thus, for example, he can only present one hexachord (with its respective transpositions) in the exposition, and reserve certain combinations of transpositions for occurrences of very specific motifs.Mitchell, Rachel E. \\"Roberto Gerhard's Serial Procedures and Formal Design in String Quartets Nos. 1 and 2\\". In: Adkins, Monty. The Roberto Gerhard Companion. Routledge, 2016-02-24, p. 188-193. . The following schema refers to the association of these traditional segmentations and how Gerhard implements series transpositions and hexachords (encoded with P and H respectively). This new perspective of the harmonic structure is largely consistent with Babbitt's thinking, that the fundamental idea of 12-tone technique is a reformulation of the principle of tonality. In fact, it is inferred in Gerhard's writings that he was very much aware of Babbit's research.Mitchell, Rachel E. \\"Roberto Gerhard's Serial Procedures and Formal Design in String Quartets Nos. 1 and 2\\". In: Adkins, Monty. The Roberto Gerhard Companion. Routledge, 2016-02-24, p. 187. . In addition, this first movement features \\"echoes of primitive Iberian rhythms\\". Specifically, some of the polyrhythms in the ostinato refer to the Charradas of Salamanca, and at some rate, to the Fandango. Figure 4. Pairing of two series related by inversion and retrogradationMitchell, Rachel E. \\"Form and function in Roberto Gerhard's String Quartet no. 1\\". Proceedings of the 1st International Roberto Gerhard Conference, p. 67.  Second movement (Con vivacit√†)  In this movement he takes advantage of the hexachords to establish a link between the transformations of the tone-row and its inversions. In this way, on one hand he pairs each transposition of the original sequence, with its retrograde and, on the other, with another inversion and its respective retrogradation.  Third movement (Grave)  In this movement he takes advantage of the hexachords to establish a link between the transformations of the tone-row and its inversions. In this way, on one hand he pairs each transposition of the original sequence, with its retrograde and, on the other, with another inversion and its respective retrogradation. Figure 5. Derivaci√≥ de les durades a partir de la s√®rieMitchell, Rachel E. \\"Form and function in Roberto Gerhard's String Quartet no. 1\\". Proceedings of the 1st International Roberto Gerhard Conference, pg. 69. As for what temporality respects, the same tone- row allows deriving from itself the duration of the notes: it is achieved by making a simple subtraction in modulo 12, that is, subtracting and considering the results in the interval [1, 12] so that if a number is left out, you can add or subtract as many 12 as necessary. This procedure greatly influences the structure of the work, as it determines blocks of 78 (78= 1 + 2 + \\\\ldots + 12) eight notes where a single row acts. In addition, he divides the sequence into two hexachords so that their respective durations are 33 and 45. The 33:45 ratio has an essential implication throughout the movement, as he will divide it into 4 structured sections as follows: There are 3 sections of 11 bars (33 x 3 x 11) and the last one is 12 bars (12 x 45 ‚Äì 33). (12=45-33).Mitchell, Rachel E. \\"Form and function in Roberto Gerhard's String Quartet no. 1\\". Proceedings of the 1st International Roberto Gerhard Conference, p. 70. Thus, in addition to the rows, there is a rhythmic series that is used and that governs, in the words of Julian White \\"the movement, duration, and temporal succession of the total of sound events\\". Figure 6. Example of cyclic meter trains in the last movement of the Quartet  Fourth movement (Molto allegro)  This movement contains the same compositional principles as the previous ones but also introduces the technique of cyclic meter trains, which has the function of introducing musical structures with a certain number of beats on a metric with a different amount, which causes that the drop of the metric and the particular structure to not coincide until after a certain number of iterations (which will be the least common multiple of the pulsations that make up both elements). In particular, the following diagram (Figure 6) shows how each structure (a 9/8 and 7/8, respectively) sounds twice, adjusting with the 2/8 bar every 9 and 7 iterations, respectively. == Criticism on serialism == For the first time, Gerhard radically applied the rhythmic series theory in this quartet: The third movement can be understood as a study of proportions, and for it to be effective it is necessary to ensure perceptibility to the listener. These proportions, in part, could be derived from the same tone-row, and play with this ambivalence. Gerhard continually sought to keep updated with the innovations in all the art forms, science and technology, which greatly influenced the way he conceived and analyzed music. > \\"In the final two movements of the Quartet, Gerhard tries to rationalize > such correspondences and to establish in his music precise connections > between the pitch- and time-dimensions, which derive from a preconceived > constructive plan. Thus, to every note in the series measured in semitones > from a 'root-note' in the hexachordal system, a number is made to correspond > it such that it can equally refer to a scale of time or of metrical values. > Such a plan of organization may appear extremely rigid. But Roberto Gerhard > is no pedant. He always knows how to preserve his freedom of action in > confronting any musical problem.\\" Roman Vlad Instead of assigning a number sequence to all rhythms (which would determine the rhythmic pattern a priori), he preferred to work the series on more general instances (metric, rhythmic) and afterwards specify at a smaller scale. This distinguished him from other styles of serialism, criticized for lacking freedom and intuition. The other distinctive feature is the fact that he works with different time proportions that serve as a guide. == Premiere and recordings == Completed in 1955, the quartet (dedicated to the Parrenin Quartet) premiered in August of the following year at Dartington Summer School, with a total duration of 19 minutes.

It is native to the Amazon River basin in South America. ==Description== Like other members of the serrasalmid family, Myloplus nigrolineatus is characterized by a deep, elliptical, and laterally compressed body, giving it a shape reminiscent of an elongated disc. The body ranges from 146 to 238 mm in length and 59 to 71 mm in depth. It has a slightly upturned, terminal mouth with two rows of molar- like teeth. Behind this main row of teeth is a pair of conical cutting teeth with a sharp surface on the front edge. The cycloid scales are tiny and numerous, and the scales along the lateral line are black colored due to high concentrations of black chromatophores. Overall color ranges from silver to lead-grey with scattered orange blotching. Breeding males will also display bright orange to red patches around the gill plates, pectoral fins, and on the anterior lobe of the anal fin. Breeding females show irregular orange and dark grey blotches scattered on flanks. A stout spine precedes the dorsal fin, and the forked caudal fin has equal sized lobes. ==Taxonomy== ===Classification=== Myloplus nigrolineatus is primarily distinguished from its cogeners by the black row of lateral line scales for which it is named. The intensity of this coloration can vary depending on which river within the Amazon basin a population occupies. Additional morphological characteristics that differentiate M. nigrolineatus from other members of its genus include the presence of 25 to 29 branched rays in the dorsal fin, and a greater number of lateral line scales (98-120 vs. fewer than 98 in other species). ===Etymology=== The generic name Myloplus comes from the Greek word mylos meaning grey mullet, and ploos meaning movement of a serpent. The specific name nigrolineatus, and references the Latin word nigro meaning black, and lineatus meaning lined, and is derived from the dark colored lateral line characteristic of the species. ==Distribution and habitat== Myloplus nigrolineatus is widely distributed throughout the Amazon basin, where it inhabits slow-flowing backwaters and lakes. Specimens have been recorded from the Aripuan√£, √Ågua Boa do Univini, Nhamund√°, Tapaj√≥s, Tocantins, Juta√≠, Mau√©s- A√ßu, and Uatum√£ rivers, as well as Pauapixuna lake (Juru√° River), Tapau√° lake (Purus River), Serpa lake (Amazon River), Tracaj√° lake, and the Negro river basin. Despite the broad geographic range, this species is restricted to two specific habitat types. It requires either clear waters with very low levels of suspended sediments, or low ph and low sediment load blackwater habitats. ==Diet== This species is herbivorous, feeding mainly on aquatic plants. ==References== Category:Fish of South America Category:Serrasalmidae ","title":"Myloplus nigrolineatus"},{"id":"63758797","text":"The 1776 Rhode Island gubernatorial election was the first election in the State after its secession from British colonies and joining the United States.

His family were members of the powerful Hvide clan. In 1192, during the Crusades and after the fall of Jerusalem, he led a small group of Danish soldiers to the Holy Land. Upon his return, he had the Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg built. ==Early life== Born in 1127, Snare was the eldest son of Asser Rig (c. 1080‚Äì1151), also called Asser the rich, of the Hvide clan. Esbern's mother, Lady Inge, was the daughter of and Princess Cecilia Knutsdatter. He was the grandson of Skjalm Hvide and great-grandson Canute IV of Denmark (c. 1042 ‚Äì 10 July 1086), the first Danish king (1080‚Äì1086) to be canonized. His family lived in Fjenneslev, Zealand. His brother was Absalon (c. 1128‚Äì1201), who became a powerful warrior leader and main advisor to Danish kings, and also Bishop of Roskilde and later Archbishop of Lund. Valdemar was his foster brother. His other sibling was Ingefred Assersdatter (c. 1130-1160). ==Marriages and children== Esbern was married three times. His first two wives were Holmfred and Ingeborg. His third wife, Helene, was the daughter of a Swedish Jarl, who is presumed to be Guttorm. With Helene, he had a daughter Ingeborg, who married Peder Strangesen (d. 1241), who may have been the son of Valdemar. She became the owner of Esbern's castle at Kalundborg. He also had a daughter who married Anders Knudsen Gros√∏n of Tersl√∏segaard manor in Sor√∏. Esbern gave a farm, Ovre (Aworthe), located in Hvidovre to Sor√∏ Abbey around 1170, and it was later passed on to Absalon. Esbern acquired the farm, , sometime before his death. B.S. Ingemann wrote a poem about S√¶byg√•rd and its inhabitants, which is published in his novel, Valdemar Victory. ==Career== From \\"the most powerful family of magnates in the realm\\", Esbern was a royal chancellor and a h√∏vding (chieftain). He and his brother Absalon had a close relationship, or alliance, with Valdemar. Together, they consolidated the Danish Kingdom. In 1180, Esbern faced a rebellion because his brother, elected archbishop to the Roskilde see, had brought relatives into powerful positions. Then king, Valdemar interceded to put down the rebellion. Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg After the fall of Jerusalem, Pope Innocent III and others asked King Canute VI and the Danes to join the crusade, stating that it would be right for crusaders to die for Christ, as he died for them. This was not well received by the Danes. Esbern delivered a speech states that the Danish people had been sliding into a period of depravity and decline, he called the crusade to Jerusalem to be of noble effort, as requested by the Pope, who was of a superior position. In 1192, during the Crusades, he led a small group of Danish soldiers to the Holy Land. He became inspired and upon his return to Denmark, he built the Kalundborg Kirke (Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg); Art historian R.A. Stalley called the architectural style an \\"emphatic image of militant Christianity.\\" Esben is considered the founder of the town of Kalundborg. ==Death== In 1204, he died at when he broke his neck on a millstone after falling down a staircase. He was buried at Sor√∏ Abbey. After his death, Helene was royal mistress to Valdemar. ==Legacy== Two ships of the Royal Danish Navy have been named HDMS Esbern Snare, named after Esbern the Resolute: * HDMS Esbern Snare (L17) * HDMS Esbern Snare (F341) ==Popular culture== * He is the subject of a legend (Fin (legend)) and a later related poem Kalundborg Church by John Greenleaf Whittier. * B.S.

Edmunds is a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), and one of more than 50 attendees of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) advising the UK government on the COVID-19 pandemic. In a March 2020 interview early in the UK COVID-19 epidemic, Edmunds said that the outbreak \\"could be very serious ... much more serious than we've had for many years\\". He has also emphasised both the difficulties in maintaining social distancing over extended time periods, and the key role of herd immunity, saying \\"The only way to stop this epidemic is indeed to achieve herd immunity\\". During the loosening of UK lockdown measures in early June 2020, Edmunds said he believed a delay in implementing measures in March \\"cost a lot of lives\\", but noted that the data available then was \\"really quite poor\\", making decisions difficult.

His work during this period was documented in the 2018 American documentary film Bathtubs Over Broadway. ==Early life== Hank Beebe was born on July 16, 1926 in Woodbury, New Jersey, to Harold Henry and Miriam Priscilla (n√©e Davidson) Beebe. After High School, Beebe attended the University of North Carolina where he received a Master of Music in 1951.

In 1967, he worked briefly on The Mike Douglas Show before turning to musical theatre. While working on Broadway in New York City, Beebe auditioned for \\"The Chevy Show\\": a \\"corporate musical\\" presenting the new 1957 Chevrolet line of production. Although the show consisted of a musical book, score, cast and full orchestra, it was not meant to be seen by the public; only Detroit dealers and Chevy executives and their employees. Beebe worked as a musical consultant, arranger and composer on hundreds of \\"Industrial Musicals\\" for General Motors of Detroit, the Radio Corporation of America in Indianapolis, Coca-Cola, Westinghouse and the McDonald's Corporation in Oak Brook, Illinois from the 1950s to the early 1980s. In 1969, Beebe wrote the re-election song for New York City Mayor John Lindsay. In the early 1990s, staff writer for The David Letterman Show, Steve Young purchased an album entitled Go Fly a Kite (a 1966 GE Industrial Musical), for Letterman‚Äôs \\"Dave‚Äôs Record Collection\\" segment. \\"It started as something to make fun of,\\" Young said. \\"I thought, How pathetic, an insurance musical.

Their collaboration was turned into the award-winning documentary ‚Äò‚ÄôBathtubs Over Broadway‚Äô‚Äô.Bathtubs Over Broadway. Official Website. Beebe also wrote for both Off- and On- Broadway. His most popular work was the musical The Cowboy and The Tiger that ran for two years at the York Playhouse and the East 74th Street Theatre in New York city and starred Jack Gilford and Paul O'Keefe. It later aired on ABC as a made-for-television musical starring the original cast in 1963. The audience reception and critical acclaim was so positive, that ABC reprogrammed the musical 10 days later. His next musical, Tuscaloosa‚Äôs Calling Me ‚Ä¶ But I‚Äôm Not Going! (sometimes simply called: Tuscaloosa), was also a success. It opened Off- Broadway on December 1, 1975 and ran for 452 performances.

During this period there was one fighter squadron detached from RAF Fighter Command and two other HAA units covering the entire country, of which only one of these (8th (Belfast)) was fully organised and equipped.Basil Collier, Chapter IV 'The Eve of the War' Mobilisation In June 1939, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations. When General Sir Frederick Pyle took command of AA Command on 28 July 1939, the command had a severe shortage of equipment, especially in the HAA section of the AA branch. On the outbreak of war on 3 September 1939, there were a total of just 695 covering the entire country, many of which were only on loan from the Royal Navy. The situation was worse for the fact that AA Command's establishment had 2,232 units, yet not even half of the guns were available or produced. Phoney War During the early parts of the Phoney War, AA Command was lucky for there were very little to no air attacks over Great Britain, which allowed them to fix their structure, equipment shortages, and manpower issues. One of the first issues that were solved was the manpower, which was being steadily helped by the introduction of conscription in mid-1939, of which 20,000 were allocated to AA Command. During this period, many of the \\"militia\\"The term \\"Conscription\\" or \\"Draft\\" wasn't used, as it seemed a scary word, therefore these conscripts were designated as \\"Militia\\" or \\"Militiamen\\". were either medically unfit or in terrible condition due to many of the better militia going to overseas posts and deployments. On 1 June 1940 those AA regiments like the 102nd equipped with 3-inch or the newer 3.7-inch guns were termed Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA) to distinguish them from the new Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) units being formed. Thus, the regiment was renamed as the 102nd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (TA). During this period, the commander of AA Command, General Sir Frederick Pile, oversaw a massive expansion of the AA branch due to the lack of AA defences during the failed Norwegian Campaign and subsequent Battle of France. The general felt that if the AA defences and RAF Fighter Command could work together they could win the air war, thus preventing an invasion of Operation Sea Lion. As a result of this AA Command was reorganised and formed five new AA divisions and 3 AA Corps. (See: Anti-Aircraft Command#Organisation)102 Heavy AA Regiment RA (TA) at Royal Artillery 1939-45, Archived on 20 March 2005, Retrieved 7 January 2020 One of the new divisions was the 12th AA Division which was tasked with covering the Clyde (and South West Scotland) and Northern Ireland to relive the burden of the 3rd AA division. This new division was formed in accordance with the reorganisation of RAF Fighter Command which covered these same areas, therefore allowing the two groups to work more efficiently together. Battle of Britain On 20 July 1940 No. 245 Squadron RAF was moved to RAF Aldergrove in central Northern Ireland where they were tasked with providing support to the AA and Searchlight (S/L) units based in the area. By 11 September 1940 more forces were moved to Northern Ireland due to the threat of a flank invasion through the Republic of Ireland which was being somewhat tempted by Nazi Germany. During this period the large TA divisions, 53rd (Welsh) Infantry and 61st Infantry Division were based along with the independent 148th Infantry Brigade were tasked with defending the NI coast and border in addition to helping the AA defences.Basil Collier, the Defence of the United Kingdom, Map #17, Disposition of Home Forces 11 September 1940Basil Collier, Chapter XIV \\"The Invasion Risk: The Crisis and After (September, 1940 ‚Äì June, 1941)\\"N Ireland District at Royal Artillery 1939-45, Archived on 16 December 2004, Retrieved 7 January 2020 By November 1940, the following AA units were under the command of Northern Ireland District;British Anti-Aircraft Command, TA on 3 September 1939 at the Patriot FilesLitchfield, pp. 310-3 * Signals Troop, 8th AA Divisional Signals, Royal Corps of Signals (detached from HQ) * 3rd (Ulster) S/L, RA (SR), Belfast (covering Belfast and County Armagh) * 8th (Belfast) HAA, RA (SR), Belfast (covering Belfast and County Down) * 9th (Londonderry) HAA, RA (SR), Londonderry (covering Derry, County Londonderry, and County Antrim) * 102nd HAA, RA (TA), Antrim (covering County Antrim) By 13 November 1940 the AA defences in Northern Ireland were again expanded, with the new No. 82 Group RAF being formed from the two (soon to be many new squadrons and sections).Basil Collier, Defence of the United Kingdom, Chapter XVI \\"The Night Offensive Against London (7 September-13 November, 1940)\\" (See: Joint Helicopter Command Flying Station Aldergrove#Second World War) Throughout 1941 Northern Ireland was still very unprepared, this was evident that still only 22 AA guns were based throughout the country just as the Luftwaffe started bombing Belfast later that year.BBC, Northern Ireland's role in World War Two Middle East In May 1943 the regiment was sent to North Africa where it joined Middle East Forces in the HAA role of defending Northern Egypt. By 23 May 1943, the regiment was one of 25 HAA units based in the Middle East, is one of the 14 HAA units sent to reinforce the area. By 10 July 1943, the regiment was assigned to the Ninth Army which was formed following the redesignation of Middle East Forces and tasked with providing replacements to the Eighth Army.Joslen, p. 484Brayley, Middle East & Mediterranean, Location 70 While the regiment was based in North Africa, the regiment was organised as follows;Brayley, North Africa and Italy, Location 586 * Regimental Headquarters * 314th HAA Battery ** Battery HQ ** A Troop (x4 guns) ** B Troop ^^ * 315th HAA Battery **Battery HQ **C Troop ^^ **D Troop ^^ * 316th HAA Battery **Battery HQ **E Troop ^^ **F Troop ^^ Finally, in January 1944 the regiment was no longer deemed \\"important\\" and was placed in suspended animation with personnel moving to other units. ===Postwar=== When the Territorial Army was reformed in 1947, the regiment was reconstituted on 1 January 1947 in Belfast designated as the 502nd (Ulster) (Mixed) Heavy Anti- Aircraft Regiment, RA (TA) and assigned to the 51st Anti-Aircraft Brigade. On 10 March 1955, AA Command was disbanded and the regiment was amalgamated with the other Ulster AA regiments to form the 245th (Ulster) LAA Regiment, RA (TA).Alan Young, Territorial Army - Royal Artillery >> 474 - 519 Regiments, 1947-67 at British Army units from 1945 on ==Footnotes== Citations Notes ==References== * Martin Brayley, Men-at-Arms, The British Army 1939‚Äì45 (1) North West Europe.

In the context of patient-oriented research, patients are \\"actively engaged in governance, priority setting, developing the research questions, and even performing certain parts of the research itself\\". Patient engagement is based around person-centered care, the practice of medical patients actively participating in their own treatment - or research related to their treatment or conditions - in close cooperation with professionals and academic and medical institutions, regardless of the form of practice. Patient engagement is a form of patient participation, and thus falls under its loose list of possible terms that associate with it. ==Components== In Canadian medical culture, there are many components to patient engagement, the most notable ones being patient advisory, patient partnership, and patient-oriented research. These three components make up a basis of the Canadian approach to patient engagement, and each host institution tends to have their own definition of following terms, generalized below: *Patient advisory: Patient advisors are appointed by the hospitals, clinics, community health centers or local boards of health to provide these institutions or medical professionals advice from the perspective of patients, their family members and their caregivers at multiple times. *Patient partnership: This signifies a partnership between both the patients and the healthcare workers or institutions to ensure that the patient, in most cases chronically-ill patients, is getting the proper care they need while also supplying the healthcare workers, institutions and professionals with experiential knowledge that can aid them in helping future patients, as many patients are called upon to provide themselves with a significant amount of self-care. Patient partnership can also be in the form of partnering on research projects and research grants as co-authors. *Patient-oriented research: This means that medical professionals are engaging patients and their caregivers, family members, and friends in the research process. By doing so, medical professionals are able to gain a much more in-depth understanding of the priorities of patients, which can lead to a better understanding in the future for hospitals, clinics and community health centres. Additionally, patient-oriented research often includes the co-design of research projects and research grants with patients. ==Practice== Since 2015, patient advisors - patients advising on a project in the context of patient engagement - have been recruited to join hospital boards or health- care related projects across Canada in order to help institutions and medical professionals have a better understanding of the healthcare system from perspective of patients, their family members, and caregivers. For example, the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR), a sub-agency of the Canadian government under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Health, developed the Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR) to help patients and researchers work together and collaborate on specific research projects that are co-designed with patients, by patients, for patients. To assist with this, the government funds the Strategy for Patient Oriented Research (SPOR) and also funds SUPPORT Units in each province. With this training, inclusion, and encouragement across the country training patient advisors Canada has a pool of very effective engaged patients. A non-profit organization has been created by patients and caregivers across Canada to serve as a Community of Practice is the , The job of patient advisors is to return feedback based on their own experiences as a patient, family member or caregiver of a patient to ensure that hospitals and medical professionals understand the experience which a patient should have when in care of the hospital or a medical professional. They are also able to work with practice teams on either short or long-term commitments to determine the best course of action for future patients. ==See also== *Patient participation ==References== Category:Healthcare in Canada ","title":"Patient engagement in Canada"},{"id":"63759132","text":"Avalanche Peak is a peak located in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, and is part of the Absaroka Range.

The City of Los Angeles has installed neighborhood signs identify the geographic boundaries of the neighborhood. Neighborhood signs are located at the corners of Pico and Arlington, Washington and Arlington, Pico and Western and Washington and Western. The neighborhoods of Western Heights, Kinney Heights and Gramercy Park are located to the south. Harvard Heights and West Adams Heights are located to the east. Country Club Park is located north of Pico Boulevard. It is within region 1 of the United Neighborhoods Neighborhood Council (Arlington Heights, Angelus Vista). ==History== The Angelus Vista tracts were subdivided between 1902 and 1904. Building restrictions required all homes to cost a minimum of $2,000, Wide streets were paved throughout the area as part of the initial subdivision. Advertisements described Angelus Vista as part of an up-and-coming section of the city with excellent views of the mountains to the north. Nearby amenities mentioned in early advertisements included the Los Angeles Country Club to the north and Harvard Military College, a private boys' school to the east. Historically, the Angelus Vista area was serviced by two streetcar lines: the 16th Street Santa Monica Electric Car along what is now Venice Blvd and the Pico Streetcar line. In 1903, the Los Angeles Times ran a story boasting that many of the dwellings in new housing tracts were fine specimens of architectural work. An Angelus Vista home, located on St. Andrews Street was featured. The house was heated by hot air, lighted by gas and electricity, and estimated to have cost $8,500. In 2018, a neighborhood property located at 1848 South Gramercy Place was nominated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument. The West Adams Heritage Association asked members to write letters in support of the designation. The Cultural Heritage Commission site inspection determined that there had been a number significant of alterations. The commission determined that even though the subject property does date from the early period of the neighborhood‚Äôs development, it no longer retains sufficient integrity to individually convey its significance. The application was denied. ==Angelus Vista Historic District== Within Angelus Vista is the Angelus Vista Historic District. It comprises 89 buildings on three blocks including Van Ness Avenue, Cimarron Street, and Wilton Place between Venice and Washington Boulevards. The irregularly-shaped district also includes the block of Van Ness Avenue between Venice and Pico Boulevard and five properties on Gramercy Place. The district is an example of a residential neighborhood comprising Craftsman and Period Revival-style single-family and multi-family homes representing the period of development associated with streetcar suburbanization. ==Education== * Pio Pico Middle School, LAUSD, 1512 South Arlington Avenue ==References== ==External links== *United Neighborhoods Neighborhood Council Category:Neighborhoods in Los Angeles Category:Wilshire, Los Angeles Category:Central Los Angeles ","title":"Angelus Vista, Los Angeles"},{"id":"63759158","text":"Alfta-√ñsa OK is an Swedish sport club from Alfta, specialising in orienteering and ski orienteering.

She was the youngest of the ten children of William Cole, 1st Earl of Enniskillen, and his wife Anne, daughter of Galbraith Lowry-Corry. Her maternal uncle was Armar Lowry-Corry, 1st Earl Belmore. From her early letters, it appears that she was well educated. She attended the viceregal court at Dublin Castle from 1802. When her mother fell ill in 1802, her father placed her in charge of the household at Florence Court. She met Thomas Weddell de Grey in September 1803, who was \\"much struck by her\\". He proposed to her on 23 June 1805, and they were married on 20 July 1805 at the estate of Henry Luttrell, 2nd Earl of Carhampton, in Cobham, Surrey. They honeymooned at her husbands's homes at Putney and the Newby estate. The couple were close, and it has been noted that their correspondence shows a strong mutual respect. They had five children, with only their eldest two daughters surviving to adulthood: *Ann Florence (Countess Cowper) (8 June 1806 - 25 July 1880), eldest daughter and co-heiress, who married George Cowper, 6th Earl Cowper. She was suo jure Baroness Lucas, having inherited that title from her father *Thomas Philip (21 August 1807 - 30 March 1810) *Mary Gertrude (5 February 1809 - 11 July 1892), younger daughter and co- heiress *Frederick William (11 April 1810 - 6 February 1831) *Anabel Elizabeth (11 October 1816 - 13 September 1827) She was affected by the early deaths of her two sons and a daughter for the rest of her life. ==Public life== As her husband did not smoke, and de Grey preferred not to retire after dinner to a drawing room, she was deeply engaged with male after-dinner conversations about politics in the library. It was here that she had influence on senior politicians developed. It was at these meetings that she started a deep, platonic, friendship with Sir Robert Peel. Through their letters he confided in her his frustrations along with religious and political opinions he did not share with his male colleagues. She warned of the oncoming \\"bedchamber crisis\\" in 1839 which helped Peel negotiate the situation and led to him forming a government in 1841. She was opposed to Peel's invitations to her husband to become lord lieutenant of Ireland, as she did not want to leave their new home at Wrest Park and the wider society in England. In September 1841, her husband did accept Peel's request, and became lord lieutenant of Ireland. As his wife, de Grey was his firm supporter, and the newspapers of the time note how frequently she was at his side. Having attended the Dublin court in her youth, de Grey held the largest viceregal levee in Dublin since King George IV's visit in 1821 in November 1841, continuing to entertain on a grand scale. These events had different motivations, including trying to bring communities together, and attempting to dissuade Protestants from marching in response to the Repeal meetings. Still interested in philanthropy, she suggested public works to boost employment in Ireland that were funded from royal estates, and schemes to encourage native industries in Dublin. From her letters, it is clear that she did not sympathise with Orange views, and contrary to allegations in the newspapers and biographies of her husband, she did not influence her husband's views towards Orange opinions. When he became ill in 1844, de Grey took over his political correspondence, going on to negotiate his retirement and the selection of William √† Court, 1st Baron Heytesbury as his successor. After his retirement, she remained a supporter of Peel, including his policy to increase the Maynooth Grant. She did have great reservations as to whether Ireland would benefit from the repeal of the corn laws, maintaining that the Irish famine was due to a \\"scarcity of money\\" rather than a lack of food. In early 1848, de Grey's health began to decline, and she died at 4 St James's Square, London on 2 July 1848 from cancer. She is buried in the de Grey Mausoleum with a tomb sculpted by Terence Farrell. Portraits of de Grey are held at Florence Court, the National Portrait Gallery, London and the National Gallery of Ireland. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1784 births Category:1848 deaths Category:People from County Fermanagh Category:Cole family (Anglo-Irish aristocracy) ","title":"Henrietta Frances de Grey"},{"id":"63759549","text":"Allion may refer to: * Toyota Allion, model of sedan manufactured by Toyota * Allion Healthcare, former healthcare drug company based in New York ","title":"Allion"},{"id":"63759584","text":"August Albert Keersmaekers (1920‚Äì2009) was a Belgian literary scholar, with a particular interest in Dutch-language literature of the 17th through to early 20th centuries, and the literature of the Kempen. He identified a number of poems by Gerbrand Bredero, which had been assumed to reflect incidents in the poet's own life, as translations of French originals, fundamentally changing the understanding of Bredero's character and literary career.A. Keersmaekers, De onbekende Bredero, Spiegel der letteren, 11 (1968-1969), pp. 81-97. ==Life== Keersmaekers was born in Retie on 26 October 1920, the youngest of five children in a farming family. He was educated at the local primary school and then at the Minor Seminary in Hoogstraten.Luc Daems, August Albert Keersmaekers , Jaarboek van de Maatschappij der Nederlandse Letterkunde, 2012 (2013), pp. 65-74. In 1938 the family moved to Arendonk, and August matriculated at the Catholic University of Leuven. During his years as a student he was also involved in literary and cultural activities. In 1942 he graduated Licentiate in Germanic Philology, with an additional certificate for teaching in secondary education. After graduating he taught at the state secondary school in Turnhout until 1958. In 1945 he married Maria Ooms (1923‚Äì2009), with whom he would have ten children. In 1952 he completed a doctoral dissertation on Willem van Nieulandt II, and in 1961 he became a lecturer at the Facult√©s Universitaires Saint-Louis in Brussels. In 1963 he added courses at a college of commercial education in Antwerp. From 1969 until his retirement on 1 October 1986, he taught at the Jesuit university in Antwerp. Keersmaekers was a member of numerous literary and scholarly societies, and in 1978 he was elected to the Royal Academy of Dutch Language and Literature, in succession to the recently deceased Stephanus Axters. He was acting president of the academy in 1988 and in 1994. His wife passed away on 12 April 2009, and he died the following 28 September, at home in Duffel, where he had lived since 1963. ==Bibliography== Over the course of his lifetime Keersmaekers wrote at least 498 publications, not counting over 200 book reviews. The most significant of these are: * Het milde leven (1946) * De dichter Guilliam van Nieuwelandt en de Senecaans-classieke tragedie in de Zuidelijke Nederlanden (1957) * \\"De onbekende Bredero\\", Spiegel der letteren, 11 (1968-1969), pp. 81-97. * Felix Timmermans: een wonder van eenvoud (1990) * Het geluk van de schrijver: Felix Timmermans en zijn Pallieter (2000) ==References== Category:1920 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Catholic University of Leuven alumni ","title":"August Keersmaekers"},{"id":"63759662","text":"Racing Pride is a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights charity working in the motorsport industry to promote inclusivity across the sport, and amongst its technological and commercial partners.

It was constructed in the 5th-6th century CE, a time when local agricultural prosperity supported many surrounding monastic communities. == Location == The ruins of Zarzita stand on the western slopes of Jebel Sheikh Barakat, with views of the plain of Amuq, east of Antioch. The village is located on an ancient muleteer road linking Aleppo to Antioch via Toqad and Tormanin. Saint Simeon the Grand likely passed through Zarzita when he was forced to abandon the Eusebonas monastery. == Demographics == Although the inhabitants of Zarzita tend to be Turkish nomads, the village's original population numbered about 200 because of limited agricultural opportunities in the town itself. == Archaeological Remains == Seven inscriptions have been found in Zarzita, six of which note the structure's proprietor and the architect. Of the buildings that remain, archaeologists note a church, tower, and some houses. The single- nave church dates to the sixth century and has higher, narrower proportions compared to others in the region. The nave looks southwest and retains a rectangular sanctuary. There is one west entrance and two on either side wall (north and south). It has a square presbyterium and oblong side chambers. The columns and arches are lost.Portico, view from southwest The tower stands 30 meters southeast of the church, at the end of a long stoa. The two-story military structure is 4m2, and has a molded stringcourse with an inscribed date of 500 CE. This tower was likely commissioned by a priest Simeon, and built by the architects Eusebius and Jean. An ecclesiastical recluse may have lived in this tower, as the bottom floor could have functioned as a chapel, with the upper floor for living quarters. There are two doors and a small arched window. The north door has a deteriorated roundel carving with recluse symbolism. Most dwelling ruins in Zarzita have a simple rectangular style without cornices or other moldings. One ruin remains in only a two-story portico, while others just have inscriptions. Two on the south side of town have inscriptions that read: > God In the year 587, the 7th of the month Gorpieos.

The construction on the cathedral was completed on 9 May, Victory Day, it was consecrated on 14 June and opened on 22 June 2020, on the Day of Remembrance and Sorrow. ==Design== According to the official website, \\"the church was designed in a monumental Russian style, organically incorporating modern architectural approaches and innovations unique to the Orthodox church creation\\". The facades of the building are finished with metal, the arches are glazed. The walls of the church, decorated with murals, include battle scenes from military history and scripture texts. The decoration of the lower (small) church is made of ceramics and is decorated with Gzhel painting, with pieces of glass smalt used in the manufacture of mosaic panels. The central apse dedicated to the Resurrection of Christ is made in the form of a metal relief. The decoration of the church, the icon and the iconostasis (icon wall) are made of copper with enamels, as was done on the marching military icons. The image of the Saviour-Not-Made-by-Hands in the central dome of the church is the largest image of the Christ's face executed in mosaic. ===Glass mosaics=== Stained glass mosaics in the cathedral's vault feature various Red Army orders, accompanied by their respected ribbons that denote their class. Many of the orders display the faces of prominent military leaders from the Imperial Russian Army. The following orders are depicted in the mosaics: The Order of Alexander Nevsky (First Class), Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky (First Class), Order of Ushakov (First Class), Order of Nakhimov (First Class), Order of Suvorov (First Class), Order of Kutuzov (First Class), Order of Victory, Order of the Red Banner, Order of the Red Star, and the Order of the Patriotic War (First Class). ===Sizes=== Some of the sizes are symbolic. The height of the church along with the cross is 95 meters. The diameter of the drum of the main dome is 19.45 meters, symbolizing the year when the Great Patriotic War ended ‚Äì 1945. The height of the belfry is 75 meters, a reference to the 75 years that passed in 2020 since the end of World War II. The height of the small dome is 14.18 meters ‚Äì 1418 days and nights hostilities lasted in Great Patriotic War. The area of the church complex is 11,000 m¬≤. The capacity of the interior of the church is up to 6,000 people. ===Bells=== The bells are made at the Voronezh Foundry. The decoration of the bells repeats ornaments decorating the cathedral. The bells reflect the theme of Victory in the Great Patriotic War, icons of patrons of the Russian Army. The main bell-evangelist was decorated with bas-reliefs depicting key events of the Great Patriotic War. Work on the manufacture of bells was carried out for six months. The ensemble weighs more than 20 tons, it includes 18 bells, the largest of which weighs 10 tons. 17 of the 18 bells are dedicated to the types and arms of the troops. On the one hand the emblem is applied to the bell, on the other, the image of the patron saint. On 23 August 2019, bells are set on the belfry of the cathedral. ===Dome=== On 15 November 2019, a 80-ton central dome was erected on the cathedral, the height and diameter of which are 12 meters. In total, the cathedral has six domes, four of which are identical, each of which weighs 34 tons, the central one is the largest and one is on the belfry. The design has a high alloy steel frame with a strength factor from 300 to 1500 years. Ceremony in main temple ===Floor=== The floors of the cathedral are metal. The metal has come from the melting down of trophies, weapons and tanks that were seized from Wehrmacht forces. As visitors walk across the floors of the cathedral, it is intended to symbolise the \\"delivering a blow to the fascist enemy‚Äù. ===Main icon=== The central icon of the Main Church of the Russian Armed Forces is the \\"Holy Saviour\\" in the main dome. The Icon of the Savior Not Made by Hands is a canonical image of the Holy Face of Jesus Christ, miraculously imprinted on a piece of material and transmitted by the Saviour himself to King Abgar V of Osroene. The face on the icon surrounds the images of the Most Holy Mother of God of Kazan, of Vladimir, of Smolensk and of Tikhvin, placed on artistic reliefs that depict significant events in the history of the Russian state. In the ark, which invariably accompanies the icon, there are eight particles of holy patrons: the great martyr George the Victorious, St. Andrew the First-Called, St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, St. Sergius of Radonezh, the great martyr Barbara, the apostle Peter, the great martyr Panteleimon the Healer, and also Fyodor Ushakov, the righteous commander of the Black Sea Fleet and one of the most revered saints in the fleet. The image of the Savior is placed in a bronze fold and weighs about 100 kg. The icon itself without a fold has dimensions of about 98 √ó 84 √ó 10 cm. ==Controversies== Certain aspects of the design of the cathedral have prove to be controversial. ===Putin and Stalin mosaics controversy=== At the end of April 2020 photos were leaked which showed in the unfinished cathedral mosaics of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu and other high-ranking Russian officials, as well as Joseph Stalin. The Russian Orthodox Church initially explained the presence of mosaics featuring Putin and Stalin according to the tradition of depicting historical events ‚Äì in this case, the 2014 accession of the Crimea to Russia and the Great Patriotic War (World War II). However, later it was reported that the cathedral would not have any mosaics of Putin. The Russian Orthodox Church explained that this decision was made taking into account the President's own opinion.–í –†–ü–¶ –æ–±—ä—è—Å–Ω–∏–ª–∏ —Å–∏—Ç—É–∞—Ü–∏—é —Å –º–æ–∑–∞–∏–∫–æ–π —Å –ü—É—Ç–∏–Ω—ã–º –≤ —Ö—Ä–∞–º–µ –í–æ–æ—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–∏–ª ==Gallery== File:Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Odintsovsky District 03.jpg File:Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Odintsovsky District 07.jpg File:Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Odintsovsky District 02.jpg File:Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Odintsovsky District 05.jpg File:Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Odintsovsky District 06.jpg File:InstallationOfBells2019-01.jpg File:InstallationOfBells2019-02.jpg File:InstallationOfBells2019-03.jpg File:InstallationOfBells2019-04.jpg File:InstallationOfBells2019-05.jpg File:InstallationOfBells2019-06.jpg File:InstallationOfBells2019-07.jpg File:InstallationOfBells2019-08.jpg File:InstallationOfBells2019-09.jpg File:InstallationOfBells2019-10.jpg File:InstallationOfBells2019-11.jpg File:InstallationOfBells2019-12.jpg File:EanJMN4XgAMn6CM.jpg ==See also== *List of large Orthodox cathedrals *List of tallest domes ==References== ==External links== * Website of the Main Cathedral of the Russian Armed Forces * –°–∞–π—Ç –ü—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç–∞ –ú–∏–Ω–æ–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω—ã –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ ¬´–î–æ—Ä–æ–≥–∞ –ø–∞–º—è—Ç–∏¬ª Category:2020 establishments in Russia Category:Buildings and structures under construction in Russia Category:Military of Russia Category:Russian Orthodox cathedrals in Russia Category:Churches in Moscow Oblast Category:Churches completed in 2020 Category:21st-century Eastern Orthodox church buildings Category:Odintsovsky District ","title":"Main Cathedral of the Russian Armed Forces"},{"id":"63759829","text":"Somaiya Vidyavihar University is a private University located in Vidyavihar, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India == References == Category:Private universities in India Category:Universities and colleges in Maharashtra Category:Mumbai Category:2019 establishments in India ","title":"Somaiya Vidyavihar University"},{"id":"63759831","text":" Dauphine was a small 4-gun corvette of the French Navy. She is notable for the rescue operation to Tromelin Island that gave it its present name, and for taking part in the Second voyage of Kerguelen. The Baie de la Dauphine, in the Kerguelen Archipelago, is named in her honour. ==Career== Dauphine was launched in June 1773 at Ile Bourbon and commissioned under Ferron du Quengo. She was part of a squadron under Kerguelen-Tr√©marec, also comprising the 64-gun Roland and the 32-gun frigate Oiseau, under Captain de Saulx de Rosnevet. The squadron left Ile Bourbon on 19 October 1773 for Kerguelen's second expedition in search of the fabled Terra Australis. On 16 December, Dauphine discovered √éles Nuageuses. On 6 January, the squadron arrived at Baie de l'Oiseau and Ensign Rochegude left a message claiming the Kerguelen Islands for France. The Baie de la Dauphine is named for her. Dauphine, Gros Ventre and Oiseau returned to Madagascar, calling Antongil Bay. On 9 March 1774, Kerguelen ordered Dauphine to return to Mahavelona to trade slaves. Dauphine returned on 24 March. Ensign Tromelin-Lanuguy took command of Dauphine on 14 June 1774. In late 1774 and December 1775, Dauphine sailed to Madagascar resupply Maurice Benyovszky. On 29 November 1776, Dauphine rescued 7 women and an 8-month child, sole survivors of 160 slaves abandoned by the crew of a slave ship wrecked on \\"Isle aux Sables\\" (now Tromelin Island) on 27 September 1761, some 15 years earlier. In 1778, Dauphine was reconfigured with a brig rigging. In June 1780, she was captured by three British privateers. ==Notes, citations, and references == Notes Citations References * * * Category:Corvettes of the French Navy ","title":"French corvette Dauphine (1773)"},{"id":"63759854","text":"Drilon Cenaj (born 12 September 1997) is a Kosovan professional footballer who plays as a midfielder. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Cenaj is a product of youth team systems of the different Bosnian and Hungarian sides.

Bryant Jr. (born March 6, 1935) is a Professor Emeritus at the University of Michigan. In 1972, he became the first African-American member of the School of Natural Resources and Environment faculty at the University of Michigan. He is considered a pioneer in the field of environmental justice. ==Early life and education== Bryant was born on March 6, 1935, in Little Rock, Arkansas to parents Christalee and Bunyan Bryant. After moving to Flint, Michigan, he attended Flint Northern High School and obtained a position at General Motors. Following pressure from family and friends, he earned his Bachelor of Science at Eastern Michigan University and later enrolled in the University of Michigan for his Master's degree and PhD. While completing his doctoral thesis, Bryant was proposed an offer to join Michigan's School of Natural Resources and Environment. Although he was originally skeptical, as his goal was to focus on civil rights, he agreed to an offer of a one year term. In spite of this, he continued to participate in nonviolent civil rights activities with the Black Action Movement. One his actions was bringing a racially discriminatory housing policy to the Michigan Civil Rights Commission after he was refused an apartment unit. ==Career== In 1972, Bryant became the first African-American faculty member of the School of Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Michigan. In the same year, he co-developed an Environmental Advocacy curriculum to be added to the school. Bryant (right) with Paul Mohai in 2017 During the 1990s, Bryant increased his advocacy for environmental justice to a national level. He organized the first Michigan Conference on Race and the Incidence of Environmental Hazards and joined a group of prominent academics, later known as the Michigan Group or Michigan Coalition. The group wrote letters to Louis Wade Sullivan, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and to William Reilly, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, asking for meetings with the officials to discuss governmental policy on environmental discrimination. Although Sullivan never responded, Reilly met with them several times, resulting in the creation of the EPA's Work Group on Environmental Equity.Cole & Foster, From the Ground Up: Environmental Racism and the Rise of the Environmental Justice Movement, (New York University Press, New York & London), 2001 Later on, Bryant and Paul Mohai co-published Race and the Incidence of Environmental Hazards, which was one of the first major scholarly books that explored the links between race, class, and environmental hazards. This coincided with his establishment of an Environmental Justice program at the University of Michigan which was the first in the country to offer undergraduate and graduate degrees in the specialty. In 1994, following the signing of Executive Order 12898, \\"Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations,\\" Bryant, Mohai, and Jerry Poje co-facilitated a symposium on Health Research and Needs to Ensure Environmental Justice. The symposium included 1,100 community leaders, scientists, legal experts, and federal representatives. Following the symposium, Bryant received an Award for Research and Creative Projects and Seed Funding for Research. In 1998, he co-published Is there a \\"race\\" effect on concern for environmental quality? with Mohai. The article focused on the different concerns black individuals had regarding their environment compared to their white counterparts; such as a larger emphasis on pollution than nature preservation issues. In 2000, Bryant received the School of Natural Resources and Environment Outstanding Teaching Award and was later promoted to Thurnau Professorship for a three-year term. In 2004, he was the recipient of the Ernest A. Lynton Award for Faculty Professional Service and Academic Outreach. His advocacy efforts were also recognized by his hometown of Flint, Michigan in 2008 with the Lifetime Leadership Award. Bryant retired from teaching in 2012, and the department threw a conference in his honor titled \\"Honoring the Career of Bunyan Bryant: The Legacy and Future of Environmental Justice.\\" After retiring from teaching, the Detroiters Working for Environmental Justice established the Bunyan Bryant Award for Academic Excellence. He received the 2017 environmental justice champion award at the Flint Environmental Justice Summit on March 10, 2017. ==Personal life== Bryant and his wife Jean Rae Carlberg Bryant is married to Jean Rae Carlberg and they have no children together by choice.

They were both heavily involved in the founding of the Vega Coop credit union. Her father was a founding partner, along with some other relatives, and her mother became part of its first educational committee. Seijo's first encounter with community work was through a Catholic Action group when she was fifteen. With her parents she visited the community of Rapaurra in Candelaria, Vega Alta. The program, called \\"One Great Family\\" consisted of her parents working with the adults, while Seijo took care of the children. She is a great-great granddaughter of her hometown's three-time co-mayor, Jacinto Seijo. In 1970 Seijo graduated, after three years, with a Double bachelor's degree in Sociology and Social Work from the Catholic University of Puerto Rico in Ponce, Puerto Rico. During her time there she became the first person from the bachelor's program to do their practice at the service center in La Playa, Ponce just after it was opened by Sor Isolina Ferr√© in 1968. This was followed by a Master's in Social Work from the University of Puerto Rico two years later, which she finished in one year. == Career and research == Seijo has founded eight organizations in Puerto Rico. She worked at the Puerto Rico Administration of Mental Health and Anti- Addiction Services between 1973‚Äì1978. She has worked in academia since 1983, when she started teaching at the Central University of Bayam√≥n. One of her main projects, SIEMPREVIVAS, founded in September 1997, offers counseling to female survivors of gender-based and domestic violence. The program centers around support groups for the women and workshops for their children. Seijo commenced the project at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayag√ºez Campus after a friend of hers, her friend's two daughters, their grandmother, and her godfather, were murdered by her friend's husband. The program extends over seven municipalities across the western-side of Puerto Rico. In February 2003 she founded the University Institute for Community Development (UICD), which has impacted over 75 communities around the archipielago of Puerto Rico with the aid of 13 professors and 150-200 students from over 20 disciplines from the arts and sciences. This is done through the participatory action research method, which consists of going to disadvantaged communities close to where students live and work with the residents to increase their quality of life. An example of this is the design and construction of a community-owned aqueduct in Maizales, Naguabo. These experiences not only aid students in forming themselves, but also in preparing them for adult life as well as it being noted in their transcript as an investigation course. Through the UICD, Seijo collaborated with students from the Lyle School of Civil Engineering at Purdue, through their EPICS program, to develop a new community water system in Humatas, A√±asco. The involvement of engineers also ranges from \\"nutritional and agricultural programs\\" to \\"support to [the] elderly and children organizations.\\" After Hurricane Mar√≠a, the Institute received a grant from the Puerto Rico Relief Fund of South Central Wisconsin to make the community of Guayabota, Yabucoa sustainable in terms of food, electric power and plumbing. After the Hurricane, so many material donations came in that she had to store them in her office. Seijo is currently an Assistant Professor at the Social Sciences Department of the University of Puerto Rico Mayag√ºez (UPRM), where she has worked for the past two decades, as of April 2020, as well as being an activist for the past forty years. Her research is focused on gender issues, such as gender-based violence, and community-based movements. Seijo has obtained more than a $1 million of funding from federal grants. Additionally, she is the UPRM's Coordinator for the Gender-Based Violence Prevention Program. When visiting faculty and students from the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Civic Life's Scholars Program came to Puerto Rico in early 2014, Seijo prepared meetings and activities so they could learn about the struggles of Puerto Rican communities in the west-side of the island. Junior Chamber International hosted a panel title \\"Women of Impact\\" at the Puerto Rico Capitol in which Seijo recounted how she had decided to fight for women's rights when she lost a close friend, the friend's children and their grandmother to a crime of gender-based violence. She was invited again to the Capitol by the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico to give a speech on the impact communities have on the development of Puerto Rico. In 2015, the UPRM hosted the Eleventh Annual Conference on Sexual Assault: Promoting Collaborations between Universities and Communities, in which she was a member in a panel about pioneering university projects focused on violence against women. At the 2018 SOMOS Puerto Rico Conference, she was part of a panel on \\"The Grassroots Nonprofit Sector: A Vehicle for Change & Opportunity in Puerto Rico.\\" On November of the same year she led the silent \\"March for Peace and Equity\\", commemorating the women that had been killed as a result of gender- based violence in the preceding eleven months. In April 2019 she was invited as a speaker on \\"Civic Sector Engagement in Recovery\\" at the In Pursuit of Puerto Rican Studies Research Summit of the Centro de Estudios Puertorrique√±os held at the University of Central Florida. Later, that November, she was speaker at the University of Albany's RISE 2019 conference on the role of universities in disaster relief. In 2020 Seijo was granted the National Sexual Violence Resource Center Visionary Voice Award by the Puerto Rico sexual assault coalition, Coordinadora Paz para la Mujer. All her projects are collaborations, and her support even extends to lending use of her own office for other causes, as was the case with a food and water collection run by the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) and Tau Beta Pi (Œ§ŒíŒ†) in 2011. Seijo has collaborated with two of her children. Her oldest son, an artist, aided with members of the community and the UICD, painted over a 100 buildings in El Cerro, Naranjito. This ongoing work was partially supported by the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation. Her daughter works with the Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico, as supervisor of various vivariums, including Jos√© Ramon Fern√°ndez's NRHP Hacienda La Esperanza and leading the Para La Naturaleza's campaign to plant 750,000 trees in a period of seven years, as well as being the Treasurer of Puerto Rico's first agricultural trust. == References == Category:University of Puerto Rico, R√≠o Piedras Campus alumni Category:University of Puerto Rico alumni Category:Complutense University of Madrid alumni Category:Women social workers Category:American social workers Category:People from Vega Alta, Puerto Rico Category:Puerto Rican women activists Category:University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez people Category:Living people Category:1950 births ","title":"Luisa Seijo"},{"id":"63760583","text":"Mathia Collett (; 28 May 1737 - 21 July 1801) was a Norwegian merchant and businessperson. After her first husband's death, she was the co-owner of the trading company Collett & Leuch, an influential trading company, with her brother. From 1773 to her death in 1801, she was married to the then wealthiest person in Norway, Bernt Anker. She is the younger sister of the poet Ditlevine Feddersen. ==Early life== Collett was born on the 28th of May 1737 in Christiania as the tenth of eleven children to Peter and Anna Collett (). As a member of the Collett family, she was born into the social elite of Christiania. Given that she was a woman in 18th-century Norway, her options of education were limited; women were not allowed to attend universities until 1882. However, due to her social status she did receive home schooling, unlike women of lower social strata. Collett became an orphan at an early age; her father died when she was three years old, and her mother five years later. She inherited 12,500 riksdaler (approximately US$750,000 in 2019) after the death of her parents. She and her sister Ditlevine moved in with their widowed aunt Maria three years later. They stayed with their aunt until their marriages. ==First marriage== The Bogstad estate in which Collett lived with her first husband, Morten Leuch On the 6th of May 1758, Collett married her relative Morten Leuch, co-owner of the Collett & Leuch company, the then biggest trading company in Christiania, with her brother James Collett. Leuch was at the centre of the merchant aristocracy of Christiania, and owner of the Bogstad manor, which he had inherited from his mother. In 1761, the couple adopted the twelve year old daughter of Isaac Cold, Anna Elisabeth Cold, after his death. This would be the only child Leuch would raise with her. After Leuch's death in 1768, Collett became the sole owner of their estate as Cold could not inherit it. Collett also became the co-owner of Collett & Leuch until her second marriage in 1773. Collett continued living with their daughter until she sold the estate to her in 1772, the same year Cold married Peder Anker. ==Second marriage== The year after Collett sold their estate, she married Anker's brother, Bernt Anker, who was nine years her junior. The marriage was largely based in their economy; Anker stated that it was \\"an episode where his soul had no part\\". Romance was not present in their relationship, nevertheless, they were content. The couple traveled abroad often, as they were fond of European culture. This extends to their interest in theatre, as they started their own amateur theatre group, \\"The dramatic party\\" (), of which Mathia was the \\"directrix\\" (). Mathia would again take in a foster daughter, Martine Elieson, whom she would raise with her husband. Elieson would later marry Mathia's nephew, John Collett. Toward the end of the century, Anker had become the wealthiest individual in Norway. ===The Ankerian orphanage=== The Ankerian Orphanage On their anniversary in 1778, the couple founded \\"the Ankerian orphanage\\" (). Orphans, preferably those of higher status families, would be given free housing, meals, and education until their sixteenth birthday. The education consisted of literacy, calculus, geography, history, morals, and religion, and would mostly be taught by students. Due to Mathia's adolescence as an orphan, she would often teach classes herself, and would treat the \\"foreign and poor children as her own\\". After their graduation, they would be given clothes and finances. Boys would be given the opportunity to pursue a craft or travel overseas, while girls would be sent to work as maids, or be given comparable work. The orphanage was funded by the couple's immense wealth. ==Death== Mathia Collett died on the 21st of July 1801 at the age of 63 to unknown causes. Her funeral three days later was described as \\"one that has never been seen before\\", as the whole of Christiania was \\"in motion\\". Close family and friends weren't the only one's to attend the procession, as the children of the orphanage attended it along with their teacher, who walked in front of the coffin. Anker died four years later in 1805 at the age of 58. A monument was established in her memory in 1803 by Anker in Pal√©haven, a public garden close to an estate of his, Pal√©et, which would later become the residence of the royal family. The monument was later moved to Frogner Park to be closer Collett and Anker's residence, the Frogner manor. ==Notes== ==References== * Category:1737 births Category:1801 deaths Category:18th-century women Category:18th-century Norwegian people Category:18th-century Norwegian women Category:18th-century businesspeople Category:18th-century businesswomen Category:Women theatre directors Category:Norwegian theatre directors Category:Collett family (Norway) Category:Anker family ","title":"Mathia Collett"},{"id":"63760589","text":"Catherine Mary Green is a British biologist who is an Associate Professor in Chromosome Dynamics at the Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics at the University of Oxford. Her research considers chromosome stability during the replication of DNA. During the COVID-19 pandemic Green was part of the Oxford team who developed the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. == Early life and education == Green grew up in Gravesend. She was an undergraduate student at the University of Cambridge, where she has said that her love of science was solidified. After completing part II of biochemistry, Green was awarded an Imperial Cancer Research Fund (now Cancer Research UK) scholarship for her doctoral research. Green studied damaged DNA in yeast at the Clare Hall laboratories. After earning her doctorate, Green moved to the Curie Institute, where she studied DNA damage in human cells as a Marie Curie Fellow. Upon returning to the United Kingdom Green was appointed to the University of Sussex, where she studied DNA damage due to sunlight exposure. == Research and career == Green was made a Cancer Research UK Research Fellow in the Department of Zoology at the University of Cambridge in 2008. She held a Kaye Research Fellowship at Christ's College, Cambridge. Her research considered the mechanisms of genome replication at the genetic and epigenetic levels. During this replication process the mutations that are responsible for cancer can occur, or be fixed. Understanding the process that underpins this replication, and how cells control this replication, allows Green to better understand the development of cancer. In 2012 Green moved to the University of Oxford, where she joined the Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics. Here Green expanded her work in genomics to encompass the genetic and epigenetic stability of DNA. Green was made Monsanto Senior Research Fellow at Exeter College, Oxford in 2017. She leads the core facility in Chromosome Dynamics at the Wellcome Centre. During the COVID-19 pandemic Green was part of the Jenner Institute team who developed a coronavirus disease vaccine. The Jenner Institute vaccination platform had been prepared for the MERS and SARS outbreaks, and so was ready to respond quickly to the emerging disease. Green worked with Sarah Gilbert on the production of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination. The team started research in January 2020, and managed to identify a chimpanzee adenovirus vector (ChAdOx) that generated a strong immune response to SARS-CoV-2. They used the SARS- CoV-2 genome that had beens sequenced by researchers in Wuhan. The adenovirus cannot replicate, so does not cause further infection, and instead acts as a vector to transfer the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The spike protein, an external protein that enables the virus to enter cells, is responsible for the immune system response. In early April the team were awarded ¬£22 million of funding from the Government of the United Kingdom to run human trials. The vaccine underwent clinical trials in Oxford in April 2020. == Selected publications == * * * == References == Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:British biochemists Category:Academics of the University of Oxford Category:Academics of the University of Cambridge Category:British women biologists Category:Women biochemists ","title":"Catherine M.

Williams was portrayed by James MacArthur in the original show from 1968 to 1979, and later by Scott Caan in the series' remake from 2010 to 2020. ==Hawaii Five-O (1968‚Äì1980)== In the original show, Danny Williams was portrayed by James MacArthur from 1968 to 1979. In the series premiere, \\"Cocoon\\", Danny was played by Tim O'Kelly. MacArthur played the role for the rest of the first eleven seasons, appearing in 268 episodes. The only episode of the first eleven seasons, other than \\"Cocoon\\", that MacArthur did not appear in, was \\"Once Upon a Time: Part 2\\". In season twelve, the character was replaced by a new character, James Carew, who was portrayed by William Smith. MacArthur returned to reprise the role of Danny, who had become Hawaii's governor in the plot, in the 1997 unaired pilot of Hawaii Five-O. In \\"Retire in Sunny Hawaii...Forever\\", it is revealed that Danny has an aunt named Clara (portrayed by MacArthur's mother, Helen Hayes). In \\"The Clock Struck Twelve\\", it is revealed that Danny is skilled at defusing bombs. MacArthur had agreed to guest-star in an episode of the first season of the reboot, but he died on October 28, 2010, before filming his appearance. ==Hawaii Five-0 (2010‚Äì2020)== In the reboot, Danny Williams is portrayed by Scott Caan from 2010 to 2020. Caan portrayed Danny in all ten seasons, appearing in 208 episodes. Caan also portrayed Danny in a crossover episode with NCIS: Los Angeles. Scott Caan was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor ‚Äì Series, Miniseries or Television Film, in 2011, and for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Action TV Actor, in 2013, for his portrayal of Danny. Caan, along with Alex O'Loughlin, won the TV Guide Award for Favorite Bromance, in 2013, for their portrayal's of Danny and Steve McGarrett, respectively. Detective Sergeant Daniel \\"Danny\\" \\"Danno\\" James Williams is a member of the Five-0 Task Force and the de facto second in command. He is an experienced detective whose police background and tendency to go \\"by the book\\" clashes with McGarrett's \\"shoot now, talk later\\" style. It is established in Season 1 that Danny was from New Jersey, presumably around the New York metropolitan area, and was only living in Hawaii because his ex- wife Rachel had remarried and moved there with their daughter Grace to join her new husband Stan Edwards. He transferred from Newark PD to the Honolulu PD to be closer to Grace. In the Pilot, Danny had moved to Hawaii six months ago and was a \\"greener than grass\\" homicide detective with the HPD when he was assigned the murder investigation of John McGarrett. He comes into contact with John's son Lieutenant Commander Steve McGarrett, then still on active duty, who returns home to Hawaii seeking revenge and intending to take over the investigation into the murder of his father. The Governor had requested the younger McGarrett to set up a task force and Danny was his first recruit. They then recruit Chin Ho Kelly and Kono Kalakaua to form the Five-0 Task Force. Danny often rants to McGarrett about his dislike for everything Hawaiian, from pineapples on pizza to surfing etiquette, while McGarrett would mock his affinity for wearing ties and loafers at work, a practice not common in Hawaii. Regarded as a haole for being a non-Hawaiian and not following island customs during the first season, Danny is often viewed as a curiosity or with disdain by the locals and other HPD cops and the first season sees the rest of the team often having to explain to him the idiosyncrasies of life in Hawaii. For example, his insistence on wearing what he deemed to be \\"professional attire\\" (tie and loafers) and disregard for surf etiquette or Native Hawaiian culture is met with ridicule and light-hearted derision from his co-workers. He eventually stops wearing ties and, in the season 5 premiere, admits that he feels at home in Hawaii and views his Five-0 co- workers as his extended family. The son of Eddie and Clara Williams, he comes from a large working-class family and is the second oldest of four children. He has a younger brother Matt and two sisters (one of whom is older sister named Stella), both of whom are married. It is implied through his conversations with McGarrett that Danny is close to his family, although the rift between him and Matt never closed due to Matt drifting towards the criminal side of the business world. In season 3 Stella sends her son Eric Russo, who had dropped out of college, to Danny in a desperate attempt to set him straight. Eric, who calls Danny \\"Uncle D\\", spends the day tailing the Five-0 team on a case involving college professor and his students and finds his calling in forensics after providing some valuable insights which led to the arrest of the perpetrator. He moves to Hawaii and begins working in the forensics lab from season 5 onwards. Danny began his career as a police officer with the Newark PD. When he was a patrol officer, he testified against his training officer, Rick Peterson (Peter Greene), under a subpoena during Peterson's trial for corruption. He worked his way up to become a respected homicide detective with 87 convictions before transferring to the Honolulu Police Department. In 2001, he witnessed the murder of his partner Grace Tilwell by a pair of gangsters they had been sent to apprehend. After barely making it out alive, he notices smoke billowing from the World Trade Center and was later ordered to New York City to assist the NYPD. That day still haunts Danny and his daughter Grace was named after Tilwell. He often describes his time with the Newark PD as a \\"happy time\\" of his life as he was still happily married to Rachel and Grace was born. Danny is portrayed as a loyal cop who is married to his job first and life second. As a consequence, he is often at odds with his ex-wife Rachel for sometimes not being on time to pick up Grace. He is very loyal to his friends and colleagues, once refusing to believe that his former HPD partner Meka was corrupt even when pitted against overwhelming evidence after the partner was found dead under suspicious circumstances. Likewise, he often gives Steve the benefit of the doubt even when the latter resorts to more \\"unorthodox\\" methods in an investigation as he trusts Steve's judgment. A running gag in the show is the regular \\"carguments\\" between Danny and McGarrett. Much of Danny's interaction with McGarrett outside work usually involves an argument on the way to and from a crime scene or when interviewing suspects, resulting in characters commenting about the duo being like an \\"old married couple\\". Their partnership even being referred to as a marriage by Danny (and several other characters), and him even calling McGarrett \\"babe\\" on several occasions. Their polar opposite personalities and work styles are often a source of both friction and banter. For example, McGarrett is extremely neat and organized, likely a result of his military days, whereas Danny tends to be a slob, as evidenced by the appearance of their offices and homes. Danny's \\"by-the-book\\" style contrasts with McGarrett's \\"the ends justify the means\\" approach (which Danny calls \\"shoot now, ask questions later\\"). Lou Grover once described Danny as \\"the brains\\" to McGarrett's \\"brawn\\". Indeed, by season 2, he adopts some of McGarrett's crude and unorthodox interrogation techniques, prompting Chin to comment that he has been \\"hanging out with McGarrett too long\\". In \\"Hana Keaka\\", it is mentioned that Danny attended Seton Hall University where he minored in business, which made him the ideal candidate to go undercover at Oahu State University as an economics professor. In \\"No Ke Ali'i' Wahine A Me Ka Aina\\", Danny and Steve, along with an MI-6 officer (Chris Vance) are awarded the George Cross by Queen Elizabeth II for stopping a terrorist attack against Europe. Danny's pistol is an H&K; P30 although he carried a SIG Sauer SP2009 in the pilot. Later, in seasons 8 and 9,Danny and Rachel reconcile. He is a passionate football fan and has mentioned that he is a fan of the New York Jets and Super Bowl‚Äìwinning quarterback Peyton Manning. ==See also== *List of Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series) characters ==References== Category:Hawaii Five-O characters Category:Fictional Honolulu Police Department detectives Category:Fictional police sergeants ","title":"Danny &quot;Danno&quot; Williams"},{"id":"63760601","text":"H√ºsn√º √ñzkara (born 25 January 1955) is a retired Turkish football defender and later manager. ==References== Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Turkish footballers Category:Trabzonspor footballers Category:MKE Ankarag√ºc√º footballers Category:Kahramanmara≈üspor footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Turkey under-21 international footballers Category:Turkey international footballers Category:Turkish football managers Category:Boluspor managers Category:Hatayspor managers Category:Kayseri Erciyesspor managers Category:Sarƒ±yer S.K. managers Category:Konyaspor managers Category:Kayserispor managers Category:ƒ∞stanbul Ba≈üak≈üehir F.K. managers Category:Sakaryaspor managers Category:Adanaspor managers Category:Kardemir Karab√ºkspor managers Category:Giresunspor managers Category:Elazƒ±ƒüspor managers Category:Orduspor managers Category:Fethiyespor managers ","title":"H√ºsn√º √ñzkara"},{"id":"63760613","text":"Herbert Armstrong Catalog of Copyright Entries: Third series, 1969, \\"Friend (It's So Hard to Understand)\\", p.188 (born 14 May 1944) is a Northern Irish guitarist, singer and songwriter.

India has traditionally had a lower percentage of population of appropriately skilled workers comparable to other economies of the world. In its 11th five-year plan for the financial year 2007-12 suggested actions to increase the skilled workforce in the country to 15 million annually and targetted to skill 500 million people by 2022. In line with the recommendations in the five-year plan and to mitigate the challanges faced by the economy of the shortage of the skilled forkforce. The government formulated a skill development policy in 2009, with emphasis given to special courses to be imparted through Industrial Training Institutes in partnership with the private sector. In the 12th five-year plan, a further push was given to skill development and employment. The new government at the center in 2014, recognized skill development as an important aspect of the economy and focused on bridging the skill gap of the nation by formulating standards required for quality employment. A dedicated Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship was formed to look after various activities of skill development. Similarly, to encourage the corporate sector to participate in employment generation.The government also amended the Aprentices Act to provide more flexibility to the employer's. ==Initiatives== Considerable GDP growth of India post-liberalization initiatives of 1991 created immense employment potential. But, this economic growth did not translate into employment and created job shortages for skilled manpower. These challenges highlighted an immediate need for a skill development program in the country. A broad policy framework was implemented in line with the recommendations of the five-year plan by launching skill development policy of 2009. A special budget was allocated and Prime Minister's National Skill Development Council was established to strategize skill development programs in the country. Similarly, National Skill Development Agency was formulated to implement different schemes of the central government in coordination with various states and the private sector. Still, after investing enormous resources in infrastructure and training initiatives, creating a skilled workforce suiting industry requirement could not be achieved. One of the impediments in achieving success in the 2009 policy is attributed to the focus given to Vocational Education and Training (VET) imparted through ITI's. As a World Bank report in 2008, suggested expanding the VET system as a skill development program would not substantially improve the outcomes. Whereas (Ahamed, 2016) considering National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) data in his research argues, the net effect of VET's in the Indian context is positive for employment and wages, he further asserts, the reason for that could be specific VET courses and employer participation. After the formation of the new government at the center, the recommendations from the twelfth five-year plan were acted upon. In which much focus was laid on upgrading skill development initiatives by undertaking infrastructural and institutional means. Well designed courses were developed to encourage the participation of youngsters through the largest vocational scheme in The World, the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY). Some corporate houses, in coordination with the government designed the curriculum for the skilling courses and employed the students after completion of respective courses. An executive from one of the leading corporate houses, thus commented: \\"A partnership of government policy, industry interface and continuing engagement is the key to strengthening our economic prowess.\\" Many industry leaders praised the government for bringing all the skilling activities to a dedicated ministry, which were earlier undertaken by the Finance Ministry. ==References== ==External links== *Skill Development Policy of 2009 *Skill Development Policy of 2015 Category:Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Category:Policies of India ","title":"National Policy on Skill Development"},{"id":"63760645","text":"Franco Sala (on the right) gives Fedele Confalonieri (on the left) the piano diploma Fedele Confalonieri (born 6 August 1937 in Milan) is an Italian manager, current president of Mediaset and, since 2017, president of the Venerable Factory of the Duomo of Milan. == Biography == Confalonieri grew up in the Isola district of Milan, where formed a strong friendship with Silvio Berlusconi, a year older than him, which continued even during the high school and university years.

In 2011, after his mother passed away from cancer, Turpin began making music as an outlet to express his emotions while grieving her loss. == Music career == In 2013, Turpin released his debut single \\"Cranes\\" which garnered enough interest for him to start performing around Johannesburg.

It is one of only two species of deer known to have been native to the African continent, alongside the Barbary stag, a subspecies of red deer. It is considered to be closely related to the giant deer species of Eurasia. == Taxonomy == alt= The species was first described by Richard Lydekker as Cervus algericus in 1890 from a maxilla with teeth found near Hammam Maskhoutine in Algeria.Lydekker, R., 1890. On a cervine jaw from Algeria. Proceedings of Zoological Society 1890, 602‚Äê604. The species Cervus pachygenys was erected for a pachyostotic mandible and an isolated molar found in Algeria by Auguste Pomel in 1892.Pomel, A., 1892. Sur deux Ruminants de l‚Äô√©poque n√©olithique en Alg√©rie: Cervus pachygenys et Antilope maupasi. Compte Rendu de l‚ÄôAcad√©mie des Sciences 115, 213-216. L√©once Joleaud in two publications in 1914 and 1916 synonymised the two species, and suggested affinities with the giant deer of Europe, and placed it in the newly erected subgenus Megaceroides within the genus Megaceros (junior synonym of Megaloceros) as the type species.Joleaud, L., 1914.Sur le Cervus (Megaceroides) algericus Lydekker, 1890. Comptes rendus des s√©ances de la Soci√©t√© de biologie et deses filiales76, 737-739.Joleaud, L. 1916. Cervus (Megaceroides) algericus Lydekker, 1890.

Azzaroli, A.,1953.The Deer of the Weybourn Crag and Forest Bed of Norfolk. Bulletin of the British Museum (Natural History), Geology 2,3-96. The taxonomic relationships of giant deer and their smaller insular relatives (often referred to collectively as members of the tribe Megacerini, though it is not known whether the grouping is monophyletic) are unresolved, with a long and convoluted taxonomic history. The genus Megaceroides is also used as a synonym of Praemegaceros by some authors, reflecting to its unresolved taxonomic position with respect to other giant deer. It was considered belong to Megaloceros by Hadjouis in 1990 with Megaceroides at subgenus rank. Affinities with Megaloceros have been suggested based on several morphological grounds. A comprehensive description of the taxon by Roman Croitor published in 2016 suggested that it originated from Megaloceros mugharensis from the Middle Pleistocene of the Levant, with Middle Pleistocene cervid remains from North Africa possibly belonging to an ancestor of the species, and retained Megaceroides at generic rank. == Distribution == The species was found within the Mediterranean region of northwest Africa north of the Atlas Mountains, with 26 known localities within Algeria and Morocco, extending from Bizmoune cave near Essaouira in the west to Hammam Maskhoutine and Puits des Chaachas in the East. The oldest known remains of the species are around 24 kya BP. No other deer are known to have been native to the African continent aside from M. algericus and the Barbary stag, an extant subspecies of red deer, which is also native to the same area of northwest Africa. == Description == A√Øn B√©nian skull in dorsal view, scale bar 5 cm The species is known from limited material, and knowledge of post-cranial remains and antlers are poor. The estimated size of the animal is smaller than a red deer but slightly larger than a fallow deer. It is known from a mostly complete skull of an aged individual with worn teeth found near A√Øn B√©nian in Algeria, alongside other fragmentary crania. The skull is broad, but the length of the skull, specifically the splanchnocranium (the region of the skull behind the dental region) is relatively short. This combination of a wide but proportionally short skull is a morphology that is unknown in any other deer species. The two halves of the mandible are estimated to have a contact angle of 60 degrees, which is extremely wide in comparison to other deer, to compensate for the wide skull. The parietals are flat, with a straight facial profile. The eyes face further outward and less forward than Sinomegaceros pachyosteus. The skull and dentary exhibit extreme thickening (pachyostosis) somewhat similar to that in Megaloceros, unlike Megaloceros, the vomer is largely unaffected. The pachyostosis is among the most extreme of any known mammal. The upper canines are absent (there are no sockets for them present on the A√Øn B√©nian skull) and the lower fourth premolar (P4) is molarised. The preserved proximal portion of the antler is straight and cylindrical in cross section, and orientated anteriorly, laterally and slightly dorsally, the antler becomes flattened distally. An isolated radius suggested to belong to the taxon is known from Berrouaghia, which is robust and proportionally short in comparison to other cerivds, and the mid shaft measurement of 40mm is proportionally wider than that of M. giganteus. Croitor suggests that several rock art drawings from the Altas and the Sahara depict the taxon, which show horned animals, some with antler like tines including proportionally long tails. This interpretation, which had previously been suggested by other authors, has been criticised, noting that there are no known remains for the taxon from the Sahara, and that previous interpretions of the rock art representing deer had been based on faulty fossil identification of deer in Mali. == Ecology == The ecology of the species is unclear owing to the lack of living analogues for its unique morphology. On several morphological grounds, Croitor proposed that its habits were peri- or semiaquatic, with the weak mastication ability and polished cheek teeth by attrition suggesting a preference for soft water plants, with taking of non-aquatic forage during the dry seasons. The extreme pachyostosis was suggested to have been a protection against attacks by crocodiles. == Extinction == Remains from the Tamar Hat and Taza I archaeological sites suggests that the species may have been hunted by people. The latest known date for the species from Bizmoune has an age estimated between 6641 and 6009 cal BP (4691 to 4059 BCE) at the end of the Epipaleolithic. The Holocene transition in North Africa also saw other extinctions of ungulates, including Gazella, Equus, Camelus, the African subspecies of the aurochs and Syncerus (formerly Pelorovis) antiquus. == References == Category:Cenozoic mammals of Africa Category:Pleistocene even- toed ungulates Category:Holocene extinctions Category:Fossil taxa described in 1890 Category:Taxa named by Richard Lydekker ","title":"Megaceroides algericus"},{"id":"63760901","text":"Senator Ballard may refer to: *Charles Ballard (politician) (1836‚Äì1891), Connecticut State Senate *David W.

His father, Enrique Hidalgo, an orphan from Guayaquil, Ecuador, graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was an aerospace engineer during the Cold War. He married Liselotte Schlumberger, from Heidelberg Germany, after World War II. Hidalgo attended Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where he completed a bachelor of science degree, magna cum laude, in fine arts and biology in 1974. He subsequently earned a medical degree at Georgetown and then completed residencies in general surgery, plastic surgery, and a fellowship in microsurgery, all at New York University Medical Center (now NYU Langone Health) in 1985. === Career === Hidalgo was certified by the American Board of Surgery (1985), and American Board of Plastic Surgery (1987). His initial experience with the fibula free flap for mandible reconstruction was documented in the publication Fibula Free Flap: A New Method of Mandible Reconstruction. This article was ranked sixth of the 25 most cited articles on plastic surgery for the last 50 years. Hidalgo established a fellowship training program in microsurgery during his tenure at Memorial.

The railroad was incorporated on April 11, 1853, to run from Jersey Shore, in Lycoming County, to the New York state line, up Pine Creek through Tioga, Potter and McKean Counties, or turning at Gaines from Pine Creek up Long Run to reach the state line. Alexander H. McHenry, a prominent local surveyor, was one of the original incorporators. Another was John A. Gamble, a resident of Jersey Shore and state Canal Commissioner. The charter was amended on April 4, 1854 to allow the railroad to build up the \\"third fork of Pine Creek\\" and down Crooked Creek to connect with the Tioga Railroad near Tioga. Another supplement, on March 25, 1856, allowed the railroad to build a branch up the \\"first fork of Pine Creek\\" to the Larrys Creek Plank Road at English Center and on up Blockhouse Creek to reach Blossburg, site of coal mines and the terminus of the Tioga Railroad. Despite this legislative activity, little work took place, and the company was quiescent for several years. A revival of the corporation took place in 1864, directed by Francis Hughes. The charter was amended on April 14, 1864 to permit the construction of the branch to Tioga via Marsh Creek (the \\"third fork of Pine Creek\\") and Crooked Creek once the main line had been located as far as Manchester, on the third fork, and also allowed it to construct branches to the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad from Jersey Shore, or to any other railroad in Clinton or Lycoming Counties. A final amendment to the charter on March 21, 1865 allowed the company to change its name. While a new survey was run, the enterprise again failed to go forward. A local history states that the \\"name was merged into the Jersey Shore, Pine Creek and Buffalo Railway\\" in 1870, but that railroad possessed a separate charter, and no corporate merger ever seems to have taken place. That company did succeed in building a line from Jersey Shore up Pine Creek and then Marsh Creek to a junction with the Fall Brook Railway, which had built south from Tioga. Some grading was done along Pine Creek to the west of Marsh Creek, but was sold to the Coudersport and Port Allegany Railroad and never completed as a through line. ==Bibliography== ==References== * * * Category:Defunct Pennsylvania railroads ","title":"Jersey Shore, Pine Creek and State Line Railroad"},{"id":"63761159","text":"Senator Curran may refer to: *Chuck Curran (born 1939), Ohio State Senate *Henry M.

Begun in 2011 in London, the original cast members took the show to the Edinburgh Festival Free Fringe in the summer of 2012. Following their initial success, they began performing a monthly show in London, transferring to the West End in 2017, and have since performed on BBC Radio 4, on tour, and at the Edinburgh Fringe. ==Performances== Each show is performed as an hour long self contained comedy play in the style of Jane Austen novel, with six cast members improvising the story, accompanied by live music. Audience members are asked to write down the title in the style of Jane Austen, such asBath to the Future, Mansfield Shark or Strictly Come Darcy. A title is selected at random from the submissions, and is then improvised by the cast. The cast members perform in Regency costume using tropes associated with Austen's work, other works of the period, and modern adaptations. The title is likely to influence the story, so Strictly Come Darcy may feature ballroom dancing in the plot. ==History== ===Origin=== Four of the original six members of the cast, Cooke-Hodgson, Morpurgo, Murray and Parris had been members of The Oxford Imps whilst studying in Oxford and wanted to explore long-form improvised comedy. Parris and Cooke-Hodgson originated the idea of a Jane Austen themed show, and together with fellow improvisers Lloyd and Dickson, then began performing Austentatious together. ===Early success=== After initial performances in London in 2011, the original cast performed the show at the 2012 Free Fringe, receiving positive reviews and sell-out crowds. Following this success they continued to perform across the UK, adding Roberts and Gittins to the cast. They began a regular monthly show in London, initially at the Leicester Square Theatre and have returned to the Edinburgh Fringe annually, selling out the show every year from 2014 to 2018. In 2014 the show won the Chortle Award for Best Character, Improv or Sketch Act. ===West End transfer=== They transferred to the Piccadilly Theatre for a West End run in 2017, and have since performed in a number of West End venues, adding Shearing to the cast, most recently the Fortune Theatre from March 2020. They have performed two 30-minute shows on BBC Radio 4 and currently perform in McEwan Hall, the largest space at the festival, during the Fringe. ==Cast== The cast currently comprises nine members, with six performing at a time. * Amy Cooke-Hodgson (founder) * Graham Dickson (founder) * Cariad Lloyd (founder) * Joseph Morpurgo (founder) ‚Äì nominated for an Edinburgh Comedy Award in 2015 for solo work * Andrew Hunter Murray (founder) * Rachel Parris (founder) * Charlotte Gittins * Daniel Nils Roberts * Lauren Shearing ‚Äì also a cast member of Showstopper!

He was born in County Down, Ireland, probably near Downpatrick. James and his brother Bernard immigrated to New England shortly before the American Revolutionary War Described as a \\"convivial, noble‚Äìhearted Irishman\\", he married Margaret Elliot, sister of Thomas Handasyd Perkins (T.H. Perkins), in October 1783. Magee lived in Roxbury, today part of Boston, ultimately in the Shirley‚ÄìEustis House, which he bought in 1798. His brother, Bernard Magee, was also a sea captain in the maritime fur trade. ==American Revolution== During the American Revolutionary War James Magee commanded several ships. First, in 1777, the privateer Independence, which was captured and brought into Boston Harbor by the British ship Countess. In 1778 he briefly commanded the brigantine Ann. Then he took command of the General Arnold, a brigantine of 20 guns that was issued a letter of marque in May 1778. The General Arnold wrecked in Plymouth Bay with the death of 83 of the crew. From 1779 to 1783 James Magee commanded at least three more wartime vessels, the Amsterdam, Hermione, and Gustavus. In 1781 the Amsterdam was captured off Cape Ann by the British frigate Amphytrite. The Gustavus was issued a letter of marque in December 1782.Lincoln (1906), p. 323 ==China trader== Magee was the captain of one of the first American ships to sail to Guangzhou (Canton), China, the Hope, in 1786‚Äì1787.Malloy, Mary (1998), pp. 30‚Äì32, 129‚Äì130 The Hope, owned by Samuel Shaw, Isaac Sears, and other New York merchants, left New York City on 4 February 1786. Sailing via the Cape of Good Hope, the Hope arrived at Batavia (today Jakarta) in April, the first American ship to visit that port. Within months of his return to Boston, James Magee became captain of the Astrea, one of four ships owned by Elias Hasket Derby that sailed from New England to Canton via the Cape of Good Hope in the late 1780s. With Magee's brother-in-law Thomas Handasyd Perkins as supercargo, the Astrea sailed in 1789 with a cargo including 38 tons of ginseng, about $30,000 in specie, and quantities of beeswax, butter, rum, cod, candles, snuff, and iron. It returned to Salem on 1 June 1790 with a cargo of tea and silk. While at Canton Magee encountered Captain Robert Gray of the Columbia Rediviva and John Kendrick of the Lady Washington, who inspired Magee and T.H. Perkins to enter the maritime fur trade themselves. This resulted in the voyage of the Hope under Joseph Ingraham (not the same Hope that Magee had captained earlier), and the Margaret, under James Magee.Malloy, Mary (1998), pp. 30‚Äì32, 129‚Äì130 After the voyage of Astrea Thomas Handasyd Perkins and his brother James Perkins organized a merchant company known as James and T.H. Perkins and Company or J. and T.H. Perkins, which became one of the largest American companies involved in the China and maritime fur trade business. T.H. Perkins also created a criminal opium syndicate known as The Boston Concern. James Magee was part owner of several ships involved in the maritime fur trade. Along with Thomas Handasyd Perkins and Russell Sturgis, he was part owner of the Hope, a 70-ton brigantine built at Kittery, Maine in 1789. The Hope sailed to the Pacific Northwest Coast and China from 1790 to 1792 under Joseph Ingraham. He was also part owner of the Eliza, along with J. and T.H. Perkins, Russell Sturgis, and others, which was built at Providence, Rhode Island in 1796 and voyaged to the Northwest Coast and China in 1799‚Äì1800, under captain James Rowan and with 15‚Äìyear old William F. Sturgis aboard.Malloy, Mary (1998), pp. 98‚Äì99 Magee was also part owner, along with J. & T.H. Perkins, Russell Sturgis, and Eleazar Johnson, of the Hazard, which was built at Newburyport, Massachusetts in 1796. The Hazard made several voyages to the Northwest Coast and China under captain Benjamin Swift. The first was from 1797‚Äì1799, the second was from 1799‚Äì1802, the third from 1802‚Äì1805. The fourth, under captain William Smith, was from 1805‚Äì1808. After James Magee's death his widow Margaret Magee inherited his share and she was one of the owners of the Hazard from July 1802 to April 1809. Margaret Magee was the only Boston woman known to have owned a share in a maritime fur trade vessel.Malloy, Mary (1998), p. 109 ==Voygage of the Margaret== James Magee was captain of the Margaret, which was on the Pacific Northwest Coast in 1792. He was part owner of the Margaret, along with Thomas Handasyd Perkins, Russell Sturgis, and James & Thomas Lamb. The Margaret was a Boston‚Äìbuilt ship of 161 tons, 8 swivel guns, and a crew of 25, and was launched in the fall of 1791. The crew included the \\"historian\\" Jonathan Howell who, with Magee, collected many artifacts from the Pacific Northwest Coast and Hawaii for the Massachusetts Historical Society. On 24 October 1791 the Margaret sailed from Boston to the Pacific Northwest coast via Cape Horn, arriving at Houston Stewart Channel in Haida Gwaii in April 1792. James Magee had fallen ill and the first mate, David Lamb, was in command. In May, still at Haida Gwaii, the Margaret encountered the Columbia Rediviva, under captain Robert Gray. Like other traders at the time, Magee found the trade goods he had brought were no longer much desired by the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. In May 1792 he wrote in the ship's log: \\"The Articles of Trade we mostly made up of in this place were Muskets, Copper, some Cloathing, a new Iron Necklaces, but any of Iron mecanical Tools they were not fond of except files, which they were very fond of but to our disadvantage we had none.\\" Robert Haswell, of the Columbia Rediviva wrote that the Margaret was \\"as fine a vessel as ever I saw of her size, and appeared exceeding well fitted for the voyage and I believe there was no expense spared.\\" The Margaret and Columbia met again on 3 July 1792 near the southern end of Haida Gwaii. The two ships sailed together down the coast of Vancouver Island to Clayoqout Sound. The leader of the Tla-o-qui-aht Nuu-chah-nulth of Clayoquot Sound, Chief Wickaninnish, came on board the Margaret. Robert Gray, also on board Margaret, convinced Wickaninnish to visit the Columbia as well. Wickaninnish did, although according to John Boit, \\"he did not appear happy\\". Wickaninnish disliked and feared Gray, who had destroyed the village of Opitsaht with cannon fire earlier in that year. In late July the Margaret sailed to the Columbia River to trade for furs, with little success. Returning north, on 8 August 1792 the Margaret anchored at Yuquot and the Spanish outpost Santa Cruz de Nuca in Nootka Sound, in company with the Hope, under Joseph Ingraham. On learning of Captain Magee's illness, Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra, the commandant of Santa Cruz de Nuca, offered him a residence on shore. On 12 August the Margaret, under David Lamb, sailed in company with the Hope to search for fur trading opportunities. Magee remained at Santa Cruz de Nuca. When George Vancouver arrived at Nootka Sound on 28 August and noted that Captain Magee was living on shore with his surgeon and John Howell. While at Santa Cruz de Nuca, James Magee, John Howell, and several others, served as witnesses to an official statement made by the Mowachaht Nuu-chah-nulth Chief Maquinna to Bodega y Quadra, having to do with the Nootka Crisis and the claims of John Meares. Moci√±o (2011), p. 69 In addition, Captain Magee sent Vancouver a complaint, saying that the British captains William Brown of the Butterworth and James Baker of the Jenny had fired upon the natives in Clayoquot Sound in August 1792, and should be charged with piracy. Captain Brown of the Butterworth had tried to rob the natives of their furs and, encountering resistance, fired upon them, killing four. The Margaret, under David Lamb, returned to Nootka Sound on 21 September 1792. The Hope arrived about a week later. During the 1792 season the Margaret had acquired about 1,200 sea otter pelts. Sometime during the season, the Margaret struck a rock in Hecate Strait, southeast of Rose Point, Haida Gwaii. This rock became known as \\"Margaret Rock\\". Magee had intended to have the Margaret spend the winter in Nootka Sound, and to build a small schooner to act as a tender for the 1793 season. The furs collected by the Margaret were to be taken to China by the Hope. Instead, some men were left to build the schooner and both the Margaret and Hope sailed together for China, via the Hawaiian Islands. They arrived in Hawaii on 5 November 1792. On 8 November the Margaret and Hope encountered the Halcyon under Captain Charles Barkley. The three vessels sailed together to Waikiki, Oahu, to procure water. Then they sailed to Kauai, arriving on 11 November. On the 13th the Halcyon left for China. The Margaret did likewise on 21 November, arriving at Macau in early January 1793. While in China David Lamb left the ship. John Howell, the historian also left, having attached himself to Captain John Kendrick of the Lady Washington. The Margaret left China in late January 1793 and in April arrived on the Pacific Northwest Coast. At Nootka Sound the schooner was finished months before Margaret arrived. Little is known about the schooner. Its name is unknown. It was probably about 30 tons, built by Mr. Smith, the head carpenter, and launched in December 1792. By the time Margaret arrived the schooner had collected upwards of a thousand sea otter skins. While trading in near Ninstints, Haida Gwaii, Magee found that the Haida \\"...would not sell them [sea otter furs] for anything but Moose skins which we had none of. These skins the[y] call Clemmons which if we had would command skin for skin.\\" The term \\"clemmon\\", also spelled \\"clammon\\", \\"clammel\\", and other ways, were hides of moose, elk, or sometimes caribou. Among other uses, the Tlingit and Haida used them as a base for armor. Sailing south in the Margaret, Magee obtained a quantity of clemmons at Barkley Sound and the Washington coast. Magee returned north and sold the hides \\"at the rate of 3 prime [sea otter] skins for the best sort [of clemmon] & 2 for the second\\". Between the Margaret and the schooner, over 3,000 sea otter pelts were collected in 1793, a remarkable feat given that there were at least ten competing ships. At the end of the 1793 trading season the Margaret sailed to China via Hawaii, arriving at Oahu in October and Canton in December 1793. The fate of the schooner is unknown. From Canton the Margaret returned to Boston in company with the schooner Jane, belonging to the Dorr family. On 17 August 1794 the Margaret arrived at Boston. Upon return, James Magee presented the Massachusetts Historical Society with an \\"extract of the log-books and journals\\" and a large collection of \\"curiosities\\", most of which are now in the collection of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University. The voyage of the Margaret was very profitable and inspired many other New Englanders to enter the maritime fur trade. ==Later life== The voyage of the Margaret was James Magee's last. He was now wealthy and successful, and settled down in Roxbury. He continued to join commercial ventures but did not again captain ships himself. In 1798 he bought the former mansion of Governor William Shirley. Later, in 1819, his widow Margaret Magee sold the property to Governor William Eustis. Thus today the mansion is known as the Shirley‚ÄìEustis House. During his voyages James Magee had collected a number of artifacts, which he presented at various times to Harvard University, the Massachusetts Historical Society, and the Boston Marine Society. He was a member of the Boston Marine Society and the Charitable Irish Society of Boston. In 1795 James Magee, along with James Lamb, Russell Sturgis, and Stephen Hills (sometimes called \\"Hill\\"), bought the British brig Fairy, which they renamed Sea Otter. The Sea Otter sailed to the Northwest Coast and China in 1795‚Äì1798. The captain was Stephen Hills and the supercargo Mr. Elliot. Sometime in 1796, at Cumshewa, Cumshewa Inlet, in Haida Gwaii, the captain, supercargo, and two others, were killed by Haida when they went ashore in a small boat. According to William F. Sturgis, the attack was led by the Haida Chief Scotsi, his brother, and a few others, and was in retaliation for a \\"vile outrage\\" that had shortly before \\"been committed by the crew of an English vessel\\". The Sea Otter continued under the command of William Bowles, who had been first mate. Among the officers was James Rowan, who later took revenge upon Scotsi and others while captain of the Eliza. The Sea Otter arrived in Canton in November 1797 with a cargo of 2,520 sea otter skins and 2,755 sea otter tails, valued at over $47,000. The vessel returned to Boston in July 1798 with almost 50,000 pounds of tea, 7,000 pieces of nankeens, 100 sets of chinaware, 300 tea sets, and a quantity of silk fabric and thread. The owners made a profit ten times the value of their original investment.Malloy, Mary (1998), p. 157 In 1800‚Äì1801 James Magee's brother, Bernard, captained the Globe on another voyage to the Northwest Coast and China. The Globe was a 245-ton ship built in 1800 at Newbury, Massachusetts. It was owned by J. and T.H. Perkins, and Bernard and James Magee.Malloy, Mary (1998), p. 104 Bernard Magee was killed in 1801 at Skidegate, Haida Gwaii, when the Globe, was attacked by Haida. According to William F. Sturgis, the attack was retribution for the execution of five Kaigani Haida chiefs by James D. Ingersoll, captain of the Charlotte. Ingersoll's act was itself retribution for an earlier attack upon the Belle Savage.Malloy, Mary (1998), pp. 85‚Äì86 By 1800 James Magee's health was failing. In the fall of 1800 Magee and his wife joined Thomas Handasyd Perkins on a trip to Ballston Spa and Saratoga Springs, New York, partly for Magee's health. A few months after returning to Boston James Magee suffered the last of several strokes. He died on 2 February 1801, in his home at Roxbury. On 5 February 1801 he was buried, probably in the Central Burying Ground in Boston Common, in the tomb he had purchased in 1790, in which his wife and four of his children were later interred. James and Margaret Magee had nine children. All but one, Mary Magee, died young. Their son Charles Magee lived just long enough to marry and have a daughter. ==See also== * List of historical ships in British Columbia ==Notes== ==Further reading== * Category:1750 births Category:1801 deaths Category:18th-century American businesspeople Category:18th-century explorers Category:American explorers Category:American explorers of the Pacific Category:American fur traders Category:Burials in Boston Category:Businesspeople from Boston Category:Circumnavigators of the globe Category:Explorers of British Columbia Category:History of the Pacific Northwest Category:History of Vancouver Island Category:People from Boston Category:People from Roxbury, Boston Category:Sea captains ","title":"James Magee (sea captain)"},{"id":"63761371","text":"One 31, fully known as Channel One 31 () and branded as One31 or One31 HD, is a Thai digital terrestrial television channel owned by GMM Grammy.

Her other best known singles include \\"So Special\\" and \\"Open Your Heart\\", both of which reached the top 20 of the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart in 1991. Jefferies, who sometimes went by the stage name Sweet Sable beginning in 1994, often changed the spelling of her name or reinvented it, depending on the release. Variations of her name included Ceybil, Sable Jefferies, her birthname Sybil Jefferies, and Ceybil Jeffries. Jefferies should not be confused with Sybil, another American R&B; and pop singer‚Äìsongwriter. ==Biography== Born Sybil Jefferies, she was a native of Brooklyn, New York. She initially signed with Atlantic Records, which released her debut album, Let Music Take Control in 1991. Two singles from the album, \\"So Special\\" and \\"Open Your Heart\\", were both top 20 hits on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart that same year. Prior to the release of her sophomore album Open Your Heart, Jefferies left Atlantic Records and signed with Scotti Brothers Records under the new artist name \\"Sable Jefferies\\". The first single from the album, \\"Friends (For Old Time Sake)\\", was more heavily influenced by the new jack swing genre, rather than her earlier house music work. \\"Friends (For Old Time Sake)\\" proved successful by reaching number 15 on the Billboard R&B; chart and number 2 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. Shortened to \\"Old Time's Sake\\", her song was included on the Above the Rim film soundtrack in 1994 under her moniker, Sweet Sable. The album also spawned two other singles, \\"Tonight\\" and \\"Love Thang\\", which both landed on the Billboard R&B; chart. Her single, \\"Love Than\\", reached number 1 on the former Billboard Hot Dance Breakdowns chart in 1995, beating out Usher's \\"Think of You\\", which peaked at number 2 behind Jefferies' song. In 1996, she collaborated with Dutch house group Deep Zone to provide vocals for their single, \\"It's Gonna Be Alright\\" under her original name, Ceybil Jefferies. \\"It's Gonna Be Alright\\" peaked at number 20 on the Dance Club Songs chart. In a review written at the time, Larry Flick from Billboard described the song as \\"a joyfully optimistic romp merging edgy house beats with keyboards that are, by turns, jazzy and retro-disco. Life in the urban lane has done wonders for Jefferies' voice, which is now far more assured and smooth.\\" Jefferies continued to record and release music into the 2000s. However, she was diagnosed with neurosarcoidosis, an inflammatory type of sarcoidosis which severely affected her lungs and breathing capacity. Her diagnosis effectively ended her singing career. Additionally, Jefferies lost much of her vision due to the illness. Ceybil Jefferies died from COVID-19 in April 2020. Her death was announced and confirmed by music industry colleagues on April 10, 2020, including record producer Salaam Remi. ==References== Category:Date of birth unknown Category:1962 births Category:2020 deaths Category:African-American female singers Category:American house musicians Category:American contemporary R&B; singers Category:Musicians from Brooklyn Category:Singers from New York City Category:Deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in New York (state) Category:Atlantic Records artists ","title":"Ceybil Jefferies"},{"id":"63761621","text":"Togo and the Rise of Japanese Sea Power is a 1936 non-fiction book by Edwin A.

Purpura (April 2, 1927 ‚Äì May 16, 2019) was a neuroscientist. who was well known for his research focused on intellectual disability. His work also focused on the origin of brain waves, developmental neurobiology, and epilepsy. From 1982 to 1983, Purpura was appointed as the president of the Society for Neuroscience. In 1984, he was recruited to be the dean of Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University. He served as the dean for a total of 22 years. ==Personal life== Purpura was born in Manhattan, New York on April 2, 1927 and grew up in the Upper East Side. After World War II, Purpura served in the United States Air Force. In 1948, Dr. Purpura married Florence Williams and eventually had four children: Craig, Kent, Keith, and Allyson. Along with four children, he also had four grandchildren. In his later years, Purpura resided in Manhattan, New York with his wife. On May 16, 2019, he passed away at the age of 92. == Education and career == In 1949, Dominick P. Purpura earned his Bachelor's degree from Columbia University. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Medical School with a Medical degree. Purpura went on to teach at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons before being recruited to teach and be the chair of anatomy at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University in 1967. He left Einstein in 1982 to be the dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine, however he went back to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1984 where he remained for the rest of his career. An image of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University === Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University === After being recruited in 1967, Purpura served as the Scientific Director of the Einstein's Rose F. Kennedy Center for Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities from 1969 to 1972. The center focused on both developmental and intellectual disabilities, which were also the focus of Purpura's research. After two years as the scientific director, he was appointed as the center's director. In 1974, he founded the neuroscience department at the university. For a brief moment, Purpura was the dean of Stanford's School of Medicine but his heart belonged to Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University. By 1984, Purpura achieved the status of dean of the university. Purpura is duly recognized as \\"the longest-serving dean of any medical school in the United States\\" after serving a total of 22 years at Einstein. Due to this long term served, Purpura was able to accomplish many things throughout his career. During his time as Dean, Purpura was quoted as positioning Einstein as the \\"educational hub\\" of the five major teaching hospitals in New York : Monteflore Medical Center, Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, Jacobi Medical Center, North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, Beth Israel Medical Center. Since his retirement in 2006, the neuroscience department at the College of Medicine has been named after him as a way to recognize both his leadership at the university and in the field of neuroscience. Throughout Purpura's professional and academic career he published over 200 scientific articles and chapters. === Society for Neuroscience === In 1982, Purpura was appointed as the president for the Society of Neuroscience for a one year term. During his time as president, Dominick Purpura oversaw the Long-Range Planning Report which helped define the structure, policies, and programs of the Society. The Report resulted in a much more well-rounded society that focused on education and increasing the diversity of the Society. == Research == Dominick Purpura's research centered on intellectual disability, developmental neurobiology, brain waves, and epilepsy. In 2009, Purpura along with colleague Mark F. Mehler researched the relationship between an unregulated noradrenergic system during development and Autism Spectrum Disorders. The noradrenergic receptors are involved with stress response, learning, memory and more. Their hypothesis resulted in further research in the field in an attempt to discover ways to target this system to help those with autistic disorders. Purpura also researched the relationship between brain wave activity and temperature using golden hamsters. His research in this area resulted in the discovery that hamsters show no brain waves below a bodily temperature of 19 degrees Celsius. This discovery lead to investigation of the connection between temperature and the activity of the nervous system. Along with a few other colleagues, Dr. Purpura studied electrical stimulation to the human cortex. They showed that direct stimulation to the human cortex resulted in a negative response, then a slow positive response, and a slower negative response. This study lead to further investigation of possible surgeries to help those with epilepsy. == Connections == Purpura came to have many valuable connections throughout his career as a neuroscientist. As he was the Dean of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University, he came to know many other neuroscientists such as Bernard Cohen (Mt. Sinai), Carlos A. Diaz-Balzac (Yeshiva University), and Steven U. Walkley (Albert Einstein). One of Purpura's most significant colleagues was Harry Grundfest (Columbia University). Between the two of them and various other colleagues, they wrote over 40 published papers between 1951 and 1955. They also laid groundbreaking research for neuropharmacology. Their findings involved how to use pharmacological devices to obtain critical information about the system that was being researched. As he was influenced by his predecessors, his teachings influenced those he had touched in his later years. Others such as Pasko Rakic and Norman Lamm were some of his colleagues during his time as dean. Edward R. Burns M.D. (executive dean at Einstein) shared that Purpura revolutionized how medical education was taught. == Awards and honors == Throughout his career, Dr. Purpura received an abundance of awards. His progress in the field of neuroscience was repetitively acknowledged. The following are included among his many awards: * National Medical Research Award (1988) * Excellence in Science and Technology (1988) * AES Clinical Science Research Award (1992) * Presidential Award from the Society of Neuroscience (1996) He also held a variety of leadership roles throughout his career including the president of the Eastern Association of Encephalographs, the American Epilepsy Society, the Society for Neuroscience, and the International Brain Research Association. Purpura also was a member of the Neurology A Study Section of the National Institutes of Health. He was also a candidate for the directorial position at the National Institutes of Health in 1990. == References == Category:1927 births Category:2019 deaths Category:American neuroscientists Category:Epileptologists Category:Columbia University alumni Category:Harvard Medical School alumni ","title":"Dominick P.

Rowan Callick of the Weekend Australian described him as \\"by far the best-known Australian in the country\\". \\\\- Alternate title: \\"China's accidental megastar\\". Available at Pressreader ==Early biography== He grew up in the western suburbs of Sydney. His family was Turkish Australian. He initially worked in sales, and had a career in Mediterranean cuisine. He also previously did standup comedy. ==Career== Circa 2011 he moved to Hohhot, and began working at Hohhot No 35 Middle School. The agency he used assigned him to Hohhot even though he was at first to go to Shenyang. Gulasi later established his own training school for adult education, New World Language Training School. Gulasi had started a social media account with some videos, and before his first major video his follower count was 50. He gained significant social media attention when he posted a video of people making the mistake of using the word \\"play\\" to mean to socialize with someone when the word is not natively used in English in this way. Gulasi's follower count was at 5,000 followers at one point, and then to 120,000 24 hours after that. The video with the misuse of \\"play\\" was ultimately reblogged 71,100 times and received 29,880 likes and 27,400 comments. He uses QQ and Sina Weibo, with the latter being his primary point of activity. Millennials are his main audience. He had 5 million followers on the latter by 2017. Later that year his follower count was eight million. By 2019 Gulasi had over 1.7 million followers. Prices for advertising on Gulasi's page reached up to $60,000 U.S. dollars. By 2017 the advertising price was up to $75,000 Australian dollars.

OV1-1 was an American Earth science research satellite designed to measure radiation, micrometeoroid density, and magnetic fields in orbit. Launched 21 January 1965, the mission resulted in failure when, after a successful launch of its Atlas booster, OV1-1's onboard Altair motor failed to fire. ==History== In the early 1960s, the US Air Force initiated an effort to reduce the expense of space research. Satellite production was standardized to improve reliability and cost-efficiency. The research satellites would fly on test vehicles or be piggybacked with other satellites. In 1961, the Air Force Office of Aerospace Research (OAR) created the Aerospace Research Support Program (ARSP) to request satellite research proposals and choose mission experiments. The USAF Space and Missiles Organization created their own analog of the ARSP called the Space Experiments Support Program (SESP), which sponsored a greater proportion of technological experiments than the ARSP. The OV1 series was originally designed as adaptations of the 2.7 m \\"Scientific Passenger Pods\\" (SPP), which, starting on 2 October 1961, rode piggyback on suborbital Atlas missile tests and conducted scientific experiments during their short time in space. General Dynamics received a $2 million contract on 13 September 1963 to build a new version of the SPP (called the Atlas Retained Structure (ARS)) that would carry a self-orbiting satellite. Once the Atlas missile and ARS reached apogee, the satellite inside would be deployed and thrust itself into orbit. In addition to the orbital SPP, General Dynamics would create six of these satellites, each to be long with a diameter of , able to carry a payload into a circular orbit. Dubbed \\"Satellite for Aerospace Research\\" (SATAR), the series of satellites were originally to be launched from the Eastern Test Range on Atlas missions testing experimental Advanced Ballistic Re-Entry System (ABRES) nosecones. However, in 1964, the Air Force transferred ABRES launches to the Western Test Range, causing a year's delay for the program. Moreover, because WTR launches would be into polar orbit as opposed to the low-inclination orbits typical of ETR launches, less mass could be lofted into orbit using the same thrust, and the mass of the SATAR satellites had to be reduced. OV1-1 with solid motor undergoing balance test at General Dynamics/Astronautics in San Diego ==Spacecraft design== OV1-1, like the others in the OV1 series, was long and in diameter, and consisted of a cylindrical experiment housing capped with flattened cones on both ends containing 5000 solar cells producing 22 watts of power. Two antennas for transmitting telemetry and receiving commands extended from the sides of the spacecraft. 12 helium-pressurized hydrogen peroxide thrusters provided attitude control. OV1-1 weighed , with its Altair booster. ==Experiments== OV1-1's seven experiment package was designed to measure micrometeoroid density, cosmic radio noise, electron density variations, magnetic fields, proton concentrations, and Earth-based infrared and ultraviolet emissions. ==Mission== Launched from Vandenberg's 576-B-3 launch pad at 21 January 1965 21:34:54 UTC, OV1-1 (then called Aerospace Research Vehicle (ARV)) was the first satellite launched into a western-facing orbit. While the Atlas D carrying OV1-1 flew without incident, OV1-1's Altair booster did not fire at apogee, and the spacecraft remained stranded in its ARS. ==Legacy and status== The OV1 program ultimately comprised 22 missions, the last flying on 19 September 1971. ==References== Category:Spacecraft launched in 1965 ","title":"OV1-1"},{"id":"63762285","text":"Luigi Novarini Luigi Novarini (1594‚Äì1656) was an Italian theologian and scholar. == Biography == Luigi Novarini was born at Verona in 1594.

After having studied theology and entered the priesthood at Venice, he returned to his native city, where he occupied different positions in his order. He was well skilled in the Greek, Hebrew, and Syriac languages, and enjoyed the esteem of the princes and learned men of his time. He died at Verona in 1656.

They cover a large area of basaltic and rhyolitic lava flows that erupted during an episode of widespread basaltic volcanism during the Cretaceous period. The flood basalts are characterized by lava flows, dykes, sills, and intrusions, and other volcanic features include plugs, scoria, and spatter cones.

Journal of Petrology, 42(7), 1249‚Äì1278. doi: 10.1093/petrology/42.7.1249 ==Geologic Setting== The formation of three major sedimentary basins on the western edge of Madagascar occurred as a result of crustal extension in the center of Gondwana since Permo-Carboniferous times. These basins include Morondava, Mahajanga, and Ambilobe basins. The Morondava basin overlies the Precambrian basement and is composed of a thick sequence of Carboniferous to Late Triassic sedimentary rocks from the Karoo Supergroup as well as Middle Jurassic to Cenozoic rocks. The Mahajanga, the second largest basin in Madagascar, extends 400 km along the northwestern coast and is filled by a thick sequence of sediments from the Karoo Supergroup deposited during the Late Permian to early Jurassic. During the Late Cretaceous, a sequence of flood basalts up to 200 m thick covered Permo-Triassic and Lower Cretaceous sedimentary sequences. These basalt flows cover a wide area of the basin and form the Antanimena and Bongolava-Manasamody plateaus. During the Early Cenozoic, Madagascar experienced regional uplift and intracontinental rifting. This can be evidenced by the development of several graben or half graben systems throughout the island as well as the uplift in the central backbone of the island.

(2012). 40Ar‚Äì39Ar ages and isotope geochemistry of Cretaceous basalts in northern Madagascar: refining eruption ages, extent of crustal contamination and parental magmas in a flood basalt province. Geological Magazine, 150(1), 1‚Äì17. doi: 10.1017/s0016756812000088 ==Age and Extent== The volcanism began in northern Madagascar and moved toward southern Madagascar over a period of several million years. While age constraints on the flood basalts vary depending on the source, most concur that the volcanism occurred between 85 to 92 Ma using argon-argon dating processes. In northern Madagascar, ages ranged from 88 to 92 Ma, while in southern Madagascar, ages ranged from 85 to 88 Ma. Argon-argon and uranium-lead dating both indicate that the volcanism first ended in the northern part of the island. The extent of the volcanism covers the rifted margin of the eastern coast of Madagascar, the Mahajanga and Morondava basins in western Madagascar. It extends down to the Precambrian basement. Prior to erosional effects, the flood basalts covered over approximately 1,000,000 km2. ==Formation== The magmatic evolution of the flood basalts show evidence of different parental magmas, fractionation, and open system processes. Mafic tholeittic samples model N-MORB magmas from a depleted mantle source and likely experienced a small amount of crustal contamination in the form of light rare earth element enriched, crust-derived melt. The presence of MORB-like rocks could indicate that an asthenospheric mantle source was important in west-central Madagascar. Some mafic rocks of transitional-alkaline composition fractionated to evolved basaltic composition. The transitional-alkaline rocks also closely model MORB and were likely formed by low degrees of partial melting from a depleted mantle source. Chemical and isotopic differences between different magmas in different areas of the large igneous province indicate independent parental magmas and differences in source regions. ==Petrographic and Geochemical Characteristics== The magmatic evolution of the basalts is dominated by low pressure crystal fractionation from olivine, chromium-spinel, plagioclase, and clinopyroxene. The basalts can be split to form two subprovinces based on concentration of incompatible elements and geographical position. The western subprovince is composed of mafic and intermediate rocks. They have a low abundance of high field strength elements, negative Nb anomalies, and a wide range of initial 144Nd/143Nd. These characteristics are similar to N-MORB mantle sources with low pressure crustal contamination. The eastern subprovince is composed of mafic rocks that are mildly enriched in incompatible elements. The highest concentrations of incompatible elements are found in tholeiites of the Mahajanga basin, the Tampokesta Kamoreen area and the Tamatave area. 144Nd/143Nd ratios also have a narrower initial range. These characteristics are similar to enriched mantle sources with minor crustal contamination. There has also been no clear evidence that the geochemical characteristics in the Madagascar flood basalts are similar to observed in the Marion hotspot lavas, basaltic and rhyolitic lavas that also erupted in Madagascar during the Late Cretaceous.

They are notable for having penned the post-apocalyptic iyashikei manga, Girls' Last Tour, and the four-panel surreal comedy manga, Shimeji Simulation. == Biography == Tsukumizu has been reading extensively since they were in primary school, and read novels all through upper secondary. They cite Haruki Murakami's Norwegian Wood and Dance Dance Dance, and Kaori Ekuni's Kirakira Hikaru as having influenced the themes behind Girls' Last Tour. In upper secondary, they started to become interested in anime, and began drawing moe in their third year. This interest would bloom to encompass manga as well. Tsukumizu attended the Aichi University of Education, and wished to study painting to become an art teacher. At that temporal juncture, they only saw drawing manga as a hobby. As a post-secondary student, Tsukumizu loved war movies, especially Saving Private Ryan. The Kettenkrad that appears in Girls' Last Tour is an homage to the movie. In 2013, they published a Touhou Project d≈çjinshi, Flan Wants to Die, about an immortal y≈çkai named Flan who longs to die. In their second year of post- secondary, Tsukumizu began drawing manga and was invited to a manga circle by a friend. They regularly uploaded their work on the Internet, and this caught the eye of someone at the publishing company Shinchosha. Their first commercially published work was Girls' Last Tour. Their next major series, Shimeji Simulation, started to be serialized in Media Factory's Comic Cune magazine on January 26, 2019. == Works == *Flan Wants to Die (2013) *Girls' Last Tour (2014‚Äì2018) *Shimeji Simulation (2019‚Äìongoing) == References == == External links == * * Category:Living people Category:Manga artists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Tsukumizu"},{"id":"63762666","text":"First Order may refer to: * First order (religious), an institute of consecrated life for men ** First Order of Saint Francis, one such grouping * First Order (Star Wars), a fictional autocratic military dictatorship * First- order, a term used in mathematics and logic ","title":"First Order"},{"id":"63762673","text":"USC Stadium is a multi-purpose indoor sports facility located on the Sippy Downs campus of the University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland.

While the completo is what they are best known for, Domin√≥ also serves Chilean-style sandwiches, empanadas and salads. Beginning with one location in central Santiago, Domin√≥ has since expanded to have locations across the country. ==History== The first Domin√≥ opened in 1952 on Agustinas street. This location is still in operation to this day. Founded by Pedro Pubill, he sought to bring an American style soda fountain restaurant (which were very popular at the time) to Chile. As Domin√≥ established itself, it became known for its creativity in their menu. Many consider Domin√≥ to be the first to set the trend of having numerous different unique completo combinations. Domin√≥ would operate solely out of their original location until 1995 when they opened their second location also in central Santiago. This expansion would be followed by the addition of one more location in 1999 followed by a large expansion in 2000s which would bring their total locations to over 30. ==Products== Example of a completo variation with numerous toppings. Domin√≥ specializes in food typically found at fuente de sodas. Fuente de sodas are a traditional style of fast-food restaurant found in Chile that serve foods such as churrascos, lomitos and completos. While Domin√≥ serves all of these aforementioned items, they are most known for their completo. Currently they serve sixteen variations of completos, ranging from the classic completo italiano (tomato, avocado, mayo) to the more unique turco (egg and cheese). ===Completos=== Domin√≥ has more variations of the completo than a typical fuente de soda. Each of their variations is referred to with a specific name, which is not uncommon in Chile. In addition to the traditional variations, Domin√≥ has completos such as the alemana (tomato, sauerkraut, mayo), the rodeo (cheese, barbecue sauce and bacon) and the irlandesa (lettuce, tomato and mayo). ===Sandwiches=== Domin√≥ offers the typical styles of sandwiches found at fuente de sodas, namely churrascos (thin slices of beef), lomitos (braised pork) and mechadas (Chilean-style roast beef).

There was news that on the nights of 14th and 15th July, notorious dacoit Nahar Singh, with his group, was hiding in Gindkho forest. To check the truth behind this news, Sri Bhurelal himself decided to go to forest. This was a very dangerous step, but he went ahead and found out it to be true and Nahar Singh was hiding in that forest. Shri Bhurelal informed about this to his division. Police took some time for preparation. They were alert that the dacoits should not leave forest. Shri Bhurelal again went into the forest at dark hour of night, taking his gun with him. Putting his life at stake, he reached almost near to the dacoits. Nahar Singh got to know of his location and he fired at Sri Bhurelal.

He released several ghostwritten books, most prominently The Art of the Deal (1987). Starting in the 1990s, he was a regular guest on the Howard Stern Show and other talk shows, promoted the professional wrestling company World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment, and made several cameo film and TV appearances. From 2004 to 2015, Trump hosted The Apprentice, a reality show in which contestants competed on business-related tasks. == Books == Trump's first ghostwritten book, The Art of the Deal (1987), was on the New York Times Best Seller list for 48 weeks. According to The New Yorker, \\"The book expanded Trump's renown far beyond New York City, promoting an image of himself as a successful dealmaker and tycoon.\\" Tony Schwartz, who is credited as co-author, later said he did all the writing, backed by Howard Kaminsky, then-head of Random House, the book's publisher. Two further lesser memoirs were published in 1990 and 1997. == Professional wrestling == Trump has had a sporadic relationship with professional wrestling promotion World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment and its owners Vince and Linda McMahon since the late 1980s; in 1988 and 1989, WrestleMania IV and V, which took place at the Atlantic City Convention Hall, were billed in storyline as taking place at the nearby Trump Plaza. In 2004, Trump appeared for a live interview at WrestleMania XX, conducted by Jesse Ventura, a former wrestler and former Governor of Minnesota. In 2007, Trump participated in the \\"Battle of the Billionaires\\" storyline feud against Vince McMahon, this led to Trump headlining WrestleMania 23. At the event, Trump's representative wrestler, Bobby Lashley, defeated McMahon's representative wrestler, Umaga, therefore McMahon was shaved bald by Trump as both men had wagered their hair on the outcome of the match. Guest referee Stone Cold Steve Austin then attacked Trump with the Stone Cold Stunner wrestling move. In 2009, Trump participated in a storyline in which he bought WWE's flagship television program WWE Raw from Vince McMahon, then re-sold it back shortly after. Trump was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013. As president, Trump in 2016 appointed Linda McMahon to his Cabinet as Administrator of the Small Business Administration. == The Apprentice == Trump with Dennis Rodman for Celebrity Apprentice in 2009 In 2003, Trump became the co-producer and host of The Apprentice, a reality show in which contestants competed for a one-year management job with the Trump Organization, and Trump weeded out applicants with the catchphrase \\"You're fired\\". He later co-hosted The Celebrity Apprentice, in which celebrities competed to win money for charities. == Acting == Trump has made cameo appearances in eight films and television shows and performed a song as a Green Acres character with Megan Mullally at the 57th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2005. This is due to his demand that he be allowed to cameo in any movie that features Trump Tower.

He said that it was while he was there that he discovered that his parents were \\"godless\\", so he prayed for them for about six months before he \\"left God at about six and a half\\". ==Career== Jensen started writing for music magazines when he was 15, and The Sydney Morning Herald employed him as a critic when he was 16. After finishing high school, the Herald took him on as a news reporter, a role he was in for five years, until at the age of 23 he became summer editor at the paper. While he was at the Herald, he won a Walkley Award for Young Print Journalist of the Year in 2010. In 2008, Archibald Prize-winning artist Adam Cullen asked Jensen to live with him and write his biography. He stayed for about four years, in the role of observer as Cullen dealt in drugs and was arraigned for weapons possession. Jensen was even shot in the leg by Cullen, to prove his commitment to the book. After Cullen's death in 2012, Jensen completed and published his biography, titled Acute Misfortune: The Life and Death of Adam Cullen. He later said \\"...I allowed myself to be in fairly traumatic settings during that book, because I had convinced myself that the professional response was to be absent from them\\" and that he \\"[needed] to continue working on the project to properly extricate [himself] from it\\". He had met publisher Morry Schwartz while he was at the Herald and together they decided to launch a Saturday newspaper. Jensen moved to Melbourne in 2013 in order to prepare for publication of the new weekly newspaper. The Saturday Paper was launched in February 2014, as a return to \\"old fashioned journalism\\", and based on Jensen's drive to \\"reconnect journalism with writing\\" and away from \\"just arranging facts from most important to least important\\". Jensen remained editor until June 2018, when Vice Media features editor Maddison Connaughton was appointed to the position, when Jensen became editor-in-chief of Schwartz Media.He was the paper's representative on the judging panel for the annual Horne Prize since its inception in 2016, being replaced by Connaughton in 2019. In 2017, Jensen published an essay, Erik Jensen on Kate Jennings, in the monograph series Writers on Writing, in which he writes about the Australian novelist, poet and feminist Kate Jennings. Jennings co-wrote the screenplay of the 2019 film Acute Misfortune, with director Thomas M. Wright. He has also written for television. , Jensen continues as editor for the Saturday Paper and editor-in- chief of Schwartz Media. ==Awards== , Jensen has won the following awards: *2010: Walkley Award for Young Australian Journalist Award, Print News *2015: for Acute Misfortune: The Life and Death of Adam Cullen **Winner, \\"The Nib\\", CAL Waverley Library Award for Literature, Alex Buzo Shortlist Prize **Winner, \\"The Nib\\", CAL Waverley Library Award for Literature **Shortlisted, Victorian Premier's Literary Awards, Nettie Palmer Prize for Non-Fiction *2019: for Acute Misfortune (2019 film) **Nominated, Film Critics Circle of Australia ‚Äì Best Screenplay, Original or Adapted **Nominated, AACTA Awards, Best Indie Film ==References== ==Further reading== * * * Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Australian writers Category:21st-century Australian journalists Category:21st-century Australian writers Category:Australian newspaper editors ","title":"Erik Jensen (writer)"},{"id":"63763206","text":"The 1988‚Äì89 Southern Jaguars basketball team represented Southern University during the 1988‚Äì89 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

Simonsen, whose parents came from Denmark (his father was a merchant), attended the Manchester Grammar School and studied at the University of Manchester, where he obtained his bachelor's degree with top grades in 1904, a Ph.D. in 1909 and was a student of William Henry Perkin Jr. In 1907 he became an assistant lecturer and demonstrator in Manchester. Before the First World War he was in Madras, where from 1910 he was professor colleague of Charles Gibson at the Presidency College. While Gibson went to England after the war broke out, Simonsen stayed in India, where he was an oil controller and advisor to the Indian Munitions Board. He also founded the Indian Science Congress Association in 1914, whose secretary he was until 1926. From 1919 to 1925 he was chief chemist at the Forest Research Institute and College in Dehra Dun and from 1925 to 1928 professor at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore. In 1928 he returned to England, where he was first Gibson's colleague at Guy's Hospital in London. In 1930 he became a professor at the University of Wales in Bangor (Wales) where he remained until 1942. From 1943 to 1952 he was research director of the Colonial Products Research Council (later Tropical Products Research Council). In 1945 he became a member of the Agricultural Research Council. Simonsen dealt with the chemistry of natural products, especially terpenes and sesquiterpenes. For example, he discovered 3-Carene in Indian turpentine. He often worked with AE Bradfield and AR Penfield, director of the Museum of Art and Sciences in Sydney, who provided him with interesting new natural products. He was primarily an experimenter and had little interest in theory. A visit with Robert Robinson to the Caribbean and the US in 1944 led to the establishment of the Microbiology Research Institute in Trinidad and the effective control of mosquitoes on the British Guiana coast, which significantly reduced child mortality. In 1946 he visited South and East Africa with Ian Heilbron. In 1950 he received the Davy Medal. From 1932 he was a fellow of the Royal Society. In 1949 he was ennobled. In 1949 he received the Ernest Guenther Award from the American Chemical Society. He was an honorary doctorate in St. Andrews, Malaysia and Birmingham. Ewart Jones is one of his doctoral students.

He received a BS from Shurtleff College, Carbondale and an MS in mathematics from the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana. He then worked as a teacher at Alton and then moved to work at the Owens-Illinois Company. He then became a director of personnel at Toledo publishing in business and management journals. He served as an advisor to the Kennedy and Johnson administrations as a member of the council on economic opportunity and won a distinguished service award in 1965 from the American Association of Industrial Management. When Mayfield was 28, he was incapacitated by a stroke and resolved to study birds during the recovery. With help from Josselyn Van Tyne of the University of Michigan he began a study of Kirtland's warbler which eventually resulted in a monograph The Kirtland's Warbler (1960) for which he received a Brewster Medal in 1961. He also worked on efforts to preserve, manage and monitor the habitats in the breeding areas of Kirtland's warbler. Mayfield discovered that the bird preferred young jack pines but the management of small plots did not induce their breeding and he then discovered that they nested in clusters with several males competing to mark out their territories. He then identified the minimum area needed to be managed for ensuring their breeding. Mayfield's most famous contribution was a method that he developed for calculating nest success that takes into account nests that the observer did not locate. He developed the method using his mathematical training as a matter of fact during his Kirtland's warbler study and then went on to explain it to the wider ornithological world in his 1961 paper and further attempting to simplify the procedure in a 1975 paper. His probabilistic approach to calculating nest success was derived from his professional experience in industrial safety where incidents were calculated according to per-worker-day exposure. Mayfield made several trips to the Arctic Circle and one of his studies was on the breeding biology of the red phalarope. Mayfield received the 1990 Arthur A. Allen Award from Cornell University and the 2003 lifetime achievement award of the Toledo Naturalists' Association. Mayfield published nearly 200 papers in ornithology but saw himself as an amateur in the field of ornithology and examined the historic role of amateurs in ornithology in a 1979 article. Mayfield was the only person to have served as a president for the American Ornithologists‚Äô Union, Cooper Ornithological Society, as well as the Wilson Ornithological Society. == Personal life == Mayfield married Virginia Duval and they had four children. When Mayfield was aged 70 he discovered that his biological mother was still alive. After writing to her he was invited to Minnesota where they met. He also met his four siblings who had been born after their parents' marriage and had been unaware of his existence. == References == == External links == * Kirtland's warbler related correspondence * Renowned Ornithologist was O-I exec.

Iowa voters elected state senators in half of the state senate's districts--the 25 odd-numbered state senate districts. State senators serve four-year terms in the Iowa State Senate, with half of the seats up for election each cycle. A statewide map of the 50 state Senate districts in the year 1978 is provided by the Iowa General Assembly here. The primary election on June 6, 1978 determined which candidates appeared on the November 7, 1978 general election ballot. Primary election results can be obtained here. General election results can be obtained here. Following the previous election in 1976, Democrats had control of the Iowa state Senate with 26 seats to Republicans' 24 seats. To take control of the chamber from Democrats, the Republicans needed to net 2 Senate seats. Republicans flipped control of the Iowa State Senate following the 1978 general election, with Republicans claiming 28 seats and Democrats falling to 22 seats after the election (a net gain of 4 seats for the Republicans). ==Summary of Results== *NOTE: The 25 even-numbered districts did not have elections in 1978 so they are not listed here. { class=\\"sortable \\" style=\\"font-size:95%;line- height:14px;\\" ! class=\\"unsortable\\" State Senate District ! class=\\"unsortable\\"Incumbent ! colspan=\\"2\\" Party ! class=\\"unsortable\\"Elected Senator ! colspan=\\"2\\" Party -  1st  Lucas DeKoster  style=\\"background:;\\"  Rep  Lucas DeKoster  style=\\"background:;\\"  Republican -  3rd  Warren E.

One of Singapore's largest independent oil traders, Hin Leong filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2020. ==Operations== In December 2010, Hin Leong announced plans to build Singapore's fourth oil refinery. In 2014, the company announced plans to file for an initial public offering (IPO) but walked them back by the end of the year. ==Bankruptcy== When the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China was first announced, Lim believed that the Chinese government would effectively contain it and therefore made the \\"quintessential Hin Leong play\\" of betting that oil prices would rise as a result of a recovering demand for oil. However, as the coronavirus crisis worsened into a pandemic and amidst plunging crude oil prices, the company faced pressure to make partial loan repayments amounting to billions of dollars; despite selling off oil pledged as collateral, the company was still unable to raise enough money to pay down its loans. In a meeting with its lenders, Lim revealed that the company had written off $800 million in futures trading losses, although it had declared a revenue of $20 billion and a net income of close to $80 million in the 2019 financial year. The company owed some $3.85 billion to 23 lenders, the biggest of which being HSBC which held $600 million of Hin Leong's debt. Singapore's three largest banks also faced significant debt exposure to Hin Leong; UOB was owed $100 million, whereas OCBC and DBS Bank had exposures of $200 million and $290 million respectively. Having initially filed for bankruptcy protection under Section 211B of Singapore's Companies Act with the High Court of Singapore on 17 April 2020, Hin Leong subsequently sought for \\"judicial management\\" under independent accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), which would oversee the restructuring of Hin Leong's debt. The bid was approved on 27 April. Lim resigned from Hin Leong on 17 April while stating that he wished for his children to remain as directors of the company. On 21 April, the Singapore Police Force confirmed that an investigation of Hin Leong was underway. Lim was charged with forgery on 14 August. In a joint statement, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Enterprise Singapore (ESG) and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) said that they were also \\"closely monitoring developments related to the firm and the broader oil trading and bunkering sectors\\". In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing suggested that Hin Leong's bankruptcy would not have any negative impact on Singapore's reputation or its \\"wider market\\". ==References== Category:1963 establishments in Singapore Category:Oil traders Category:Singaporean companies established in 1963 Category:Non- renewable resource companies established in 1963 Category:Energy companies of Singapore ","title":"Hin Leong"},{"id":"63763451","text":"Ice Time is an unproduced 1990 four-part Doctor Who adventure, written by Marc Platt for the Seventh Doctor and Ace,Doctor Who Magazine issue 255- ‚Äú27 up‚Äù- Owen, Dave- retrieved August 1997 and was considered as the second story for the proposed ‚ÄúSeason 27‚Äù.A brief history of Doctor Who stories- The Lost Stories (The Seventh Doctor)- Patrick Sullivan, Shannon == Synopsis == The Doctor and Ace land on the Doctor's home planet Gallifrey, where Ace would need to be trained as a Timelord to help the society.

J. Fredrick in his debut, and produced by Suriya. The film stars Jyothika leading an ensemble cast including K. Bhagyaraj, R. Parthiban, Thiagarajan, Pratap Pothen and Pandiarajan. The film premiered digitally on 29 May 2020 on Prime Video. == Plot == In 2004, a North Indian woman named 'Psycho' Jothi is convicted for the murder of 2 young men, Rohit and Diwakar, and the kidnapping and serial killing of numerous young girls, and is revealed to have been killed in an encounter when she attempted to escape. 15 years later, A resident in Ooty named 'Petition' Pethuraj reopens the case, citing that Jothi is innocent and he wishes to pose a defense for her. Venba, Pethuraj's daughter and an amateur lawyer, seeks to revive the case amidst oppositions. After proving that the main eyewitness, Ramar, who had testified against Jothi, was in Chennai at the time of the murder, and that he was merely a character fabricated by the investigating officer DSP R. Alexander, Venba is successful in getting a second hearing. This leads to the public prosecutor being replaced with Rajarathinam, a renowned criminal lawyer appointed by a businessman named Varadharajan, Rohit's father. Rajarathinam is successful in proving that Venba's claims that Ramar was an illegitimate witness is false by nullifying the alibi Venba had discovered. During the next hearing, Venba reveals that Jothi was not a North Indian immigrant, but a Tamilian whose name was Sakthijothi. Sakthijothi had eloped with a man from a different caste and moved to Jaipur in the early 1990s, and as a result, her husband was murdered by her father and relatives in the name of honor killing. Venba asks Pethuraj to take the stand, who then testifies that a pregnant Sakthijothi had come to Ooty seeking refuge, and began to stay with Pethuraj and his wife Philomina. One day several years later, Pethuraj heard Sakthijothi's daughter's screams from the road outside the house, and witnessed Sakthijothi chasing after a car in which her daughter was being taken away, which is shown to have been Rohit and Diwakar's. Venba then shows another video footage of Jothi running with a young girl, saying that Jothi did not try to kidnap her, as the girl was Jothi's daughter, revealing that she is in fact Sakthijothi's daughter, Venba Sakthijothi. Upon confronting Varadharajan for hiding various details about the case, Rajarathinam is made to meet Alexander, who reveals several facts about the case that were never bought into light. It is revealed that Jothi had discovered the whereabouts of a dilapidated bungalow in Lovedale, which is said to have been a hide-out for Rohit and Diwakar, who used to kidnap and rape young girls there. The corpse of a young girl was found buried outside the bungalow, who was later identified as Angel, a girl who had gone missing during a school convention. Venba claims that Alexander had committed perjury when he testified that he had arrested Jothi in Tiruppur, revealing that the arrest was made by Sub- Inspector Suresh Pandian. However, when she requests to summon Suresh Pandian to testify in the next hearing, Rajarathinam reveals that Suresh Pandian had committed suicide the previous night owing to work-pressure. Venba and Pethuraj are at a loss as Suresh Pandian was the ace up their sleeve. After going through an emotional setback, Venba reveals in the next hearing that she was brutally raped by Rohit and Diwakar, going on to reveal that the conviction of Jothi and the death of Suresh Pandian was all a conspiracy by Varadharajan to save his son's and his own reputation, and that DSP Alexander and the entire investigation team were in on the plot, but says she cannot prove this. However, she receives immense support from the public after this, majority of who believe in Jothi's innocence. On the day of judgement, the judge has a change of heart and summons Varadharajan to be present at the next hearing to testify. However, the judge goes on to take a bribe from Varadharajan, promising a favorable verdict, an action which is looked down upon by the former's friend, Karpooram, who reprimands him. At the next hearing, Varadharajan takes the stand, and Venba openly accuses him of being a cutthroat criminal who has been building his reputation by silencing all those of who have raised their voice against him. The judge disallows Varadharajan to leave the courtroom until Venba's interrogation is complete, implying that he has reformed. Venba then introduces a witness who she says can confirm Varadharajan's presence at the tea factory where Jothi was shot dead, and disrespectfully asks Varadharajan why he was present there. Varadharajan then mocks the judicial system in anger, saying that they cannot convict him of anything. Venba then paints a picture of the entire crime that took place in 2004. After chasing the car in which Venba was kidnapped, a distraught Sakthijothi ran across the hamlet looking for her daughter, eventually discovering the bungalow outside which she finds Venba's clothes. She goes inside to find Venba struggling for life, and finds the corpse of another girl, who is revealed to have been Angel, who she then buries outside the bungalow. While attempting to make her way back home, she is intercepted by Rohit and Diwakar, and manages to get hold of Rohit's pistol, using which she shoots both of them dead. Despite Pethuraj's reservations, Sakthijothi hands Venba over to the couple, asking them to take care of her, and surrenders herself to Suresh Pandian. Upon Alexander's orders, an oblivious Suresh Pandian brings Sakthijothi to the tea factory, where she is shot dead by Varadharajan himself. Rajarathinam does not make a rebuttal, and Varadharajan is convicted. At a memorial service for Sakthijothi, Rajarathinam reveals to Venba that he is aware that she is not Sakthijothi's daughter, but the young girl Angel. It is revealed that upon arriving at the bungalow, Sakthijothi had found not Angel, but Venba to be dead. After burying her daughter's corpse, Sakthijothi had saved the distraught Angel and killed the 2 young men. Upon Rajarathinam questioning why she did so much for a woman she did not even know, Angel reveals that the pain that she and Sakthijothi suffered were the same and that she will continue to live on as Sakthijothi's daughter Venba. The end credits reveals a series of cases registered under the child abuse act in India. == Cast == * Jyothika as Venba / Sakthijothi (imagination) / Angel * K. Bhagyaraj as 'Petition' Pethuraj * R.

The title was derived from a song in Sorgam (1970). It is the directorial debut of J. J. Frederick. The film was produced by Suriya under 2D Entertainment, videographed by Ramji and edited by Ruben. While writing the script for the film, Frederick consulted legal advisors including Rajasekhar Pandian, a co-producer of the film, and visited court proceedings. The film was shot in Ooty and features five directors (namely Bhagyaraj, Parthiban, Pandiarajan, Pratap Pothen and Thiagarajan) in supporting roles. Principal photography began in July 2019, and ended in November. == Soundtrack == The music is composed by Govind Vasantha. == Release == Ponmagal Vandhal was released on 29 May 2020 on Prime Video. It was originally set to be released theatrically on 27 March, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the theatrical release was dropped in favour of a digital release. This resulted in members of the Theatre Owners Association in Tamil Nadu threatening to boycott films produced by or starring Suriya, citing potential financial losses for theatres. The film was dubbed in Telugu as Bangaru Thalli in 2020. == Critical reception == The film received mixed reviews. M. Suganth of The Times of India rated it 2 stars out of 5, saying, \\"For, both in its writing and making, there is a strong made-for-TV feel about this project [...] As far as courtroom dramas go, Ponmagal Vandhal is decidedly lacklustre. Instead of fiery dialogues and charged arguments between the opposing lawyers what we get are emotional statements being passed off as explosive proof.\\" Baradwaj Rangan stated, \\"This Courtroom Drama, Starring Jyotika, Needed To Be Much Darker, But It's Content To Remain Family-Friendly\\" and further go on to say \\"The director doesn't trust his material. He doesn't trust the audience enough to feel that this \\"issue\\" is enough, and doesn't need to be cheaply sensationalised\\". Pradeep Kumar of The Hindu commended the film's delivery of a \\"powerful line of messaging\\" but also noted that the movie \\"falls prey to the Tamil cinema formula\\", not affording enough time for the viewers to process the emotions. Rediff.com's Divya Nair rated 1 out of 5 stars, stating \\"It is unfair that good actors like Jyotika and Parthiban are wasted in what could have been a spectacular courtroom drama, backed by facts and evidence rather than tears and words.\\" Firstpost rated 3.5 out of 5 stars stating \\"Ponmagal Vandhal fits perfectly into Jyotika's pursuit\\".Behindwoods rated 2.75 out of 5 stars stating \\"Jyothika's Ponmagal Vandhal is a valuable film, that must be watched by everyone for the hard hitting message it drives home\\".

She wrote under several Pseudonyms, the most common being Jolanda, Viola d'Alba, and Margheritina di Cento. == Biography == Majocchi was the daughter of musician and politician Antonio Majocchi (1831‚Äì1907), one-time mayor of Cento, and his wife Lavinia Agnoletti (1839‚Äì1911), who had a rich literary, linguistic, and musical background. Majocchi had two sisters, Clementina Laura (known by her pseudonym Bruna) and Gabriella. Majocchi was a writer, journalist, and editor. In 1882, she published under the pseudonym Jolanda, which she borrowed from a character in the opera Una Partita a Scacchi (\\"A Game of Chess\\") by Giuseppe Giacosa. === Author === Majocchi was very knowledgeable in the English language. At 17, Majocchi was known for translating stories in the magazine Maccies Model from French to Italian. Majocchi also subscribed to some Italian magazines, but one in particular attracted her attention: Cordelia. Cordelia was published from 1881 to 1884 by Angelo de Gubernatis, who would become Majocchi's lifelong friend and collaborator. In Cordelia's first issue, De Gubernatis invited his young readers to send \\"a little thing done there\\" to the editorial staff for publication. Majocchi responded immediately with her first poetic sketch, \\"Il fior della ventura\\" (The Flower of Fortune), which was published under her first pseudonym, Margheritina di Cento, on 12 February 1882. After her initial publication, she was a regular contributor to the magazine with a fixed starting salary of 5 lire per page. Her signature appeared at the bottom of each piece. Her first stories, which were originally published in installments, were collected for publication in later years as single volumes: Dal mio verziere (From My Orchard), Critical essays (Rocca San Casciano, 1896) and Le Ignote (The Unknowns) (Bologna, 1899). === Married life === On 8 December 1884, Majocchi married the Marquis Ferdinando Plattis, a young man from Padua, and she moved to San Giovanni in Persiceto. They had a son named Giovan Battista Plattis, whom they called Gino. In a letter written to De Gubernatis, she assured him that her collaboration with Cordelia would not be interrupted because of her marriage. Ferdinando died on 5 May 1893 following a brief illness. Economic difficulties forced Majocchi to intensify her writing work. She sent Gino to De Gubernatis for a time for him to continue his studies. Until the end of the 1800s, she was a widely known author. She won a succession of awards and watched new editions and reprints of her volumes become available. She also expanded her range of collaborations with magazines and newspapers, conferences, public speeches, participation in humanitarian activities and new editorial experiences. === Editor-in-chief === Having been a collaborator with Cordelia since the first issue, Majocchi assumed the vacant position of editor-in-chief in 1911 after the death of editor Ida Baccini. She became the third person to hold that position for the magazine. She made immediate changes in hopes of improving readership and encouraging her subscribers to become more avid readers and writers. According to Bloom, her efforts were a success: > The magazine, despite its success in its first years of publishing, reached > a wider audience over time during the editorship of Ida Baccini and, later, > that of Maria Maiocchi Plattis, better known by her pen name, Jolanda. This > later success can be attributed to the ability of these two editors to > create a recognizable product as well as to the relationship that they > managed to establish with their young readers. Under Majocchi's leadership, Cordelia met with \\"unusual success\\" and, by 1913, its subscriber base reached about 10,000, according to Bloom. Majocchi also took on philanthropic roles and founded an association to collect books for prisoners. The success of that initiative spurred the formation of other associations and activities, such as making Cordelia available in braille to expand its reach to blind patrons. She was also instrumental in creating several conferences. === Death === Majocchi was actively engaged in the education of young female readers until her death in Cento on 8 August 1917. A street near Cento's city center is named in her honor using several of her names: Via Jolanda Maria Maiocchi Plattis. == References == == External links == * A critical review of M.'s writings can be found in Jolanda: the ideas and the work, edited by C.

Paternus was accused of treason by Aurelius' successor, his son Commodus, and executed.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 73.5 == Career == Paternus first appears as ab epistulis Latinis for emperor Marcus Aurelius, who had entered into negotiations with the Cotini to ally with them against their neighbors the Marcomanni; however, the Cotini played Paternus false, and in the words of Cassius Dio, not only failed to negotiate in good faith \\"but even treated Paternus himself shamefully, thereby bringing about their own destruction later.\\"Dio, Roman History, 71.12 Anthony Birley dates this event to the year 171.Birley, Marcus Aurelius: A Biography, revised edition (London: Routlege, 1987), p. 171 Following the emperor's victory over the Marcomanni and the Quadi the following year, Marcus Aurelius waged a punitive action against the Cotini. In this fighting, Paternus must have distinguished himself, for he is attested as having received consular ornaments. Paternus is next documented as one of the witnesses to the Tabula Banasitana, a bronze tablet dated to 6 July 177, which records the grant of Roman citizenship to a family in Mauretania Tingitana. The witnesses are drawn from the Imperial amici or senior courtiers, who include consular senators such as Marcus Gavius Squilla Gallicanus, Manius Acilius Glabrio Gnaeus Cornelius Severus, and Titus Sextius Lateranus; senior eques such as the former praetorian prefect Marcus Bassaeus Rufus, the current pretorian prefect Sextus Tigidius Perennis, praefectus vigilum Quintus Cervidius Scaevola, and praefectus annonae Titus Flavius Piso‚Äîas well as Tarrutenius Paternus. By the end of Marcus Aurelius' reign, Paternus had been appointed praetorian prefect, serving as the colleague of Bassaeus Rufus, and he was executing this office when Marcus Aurelius died 17 March 180 and was succeeded by his son Commodus. Paternus died a few years after that. The primary sources about his activities during the following reign contradict each other: Dio Cassius claims Tarrutenius Paternus was innocent of any treasonous act towards Commodus, stating that \\"if he had plotted against Commodus, as he was accused of doing, could easily have killed him while he himself was still in command of the Pretorians; but he had not done so.\\"Dio, Roman History, 72.5.2 On the other hand, the Historia Augusta claims that Paternus provided advice to Marcus Ummidius Quadratus Annianus and Lucilla, Commodus' sister, in their unsuccessful plot to kill Commodus‚Äîalthough when the plot was uncovered, Paternus managed to evade being caught up in the executions that followed. However, when Commodus' freedman Saoterus was killed by members of the Praetorian Guard, who blamed him for Commodus' unpopularity with the populace, Tigidius Perennis managed to portray Paternus as the instigator of the crime. As a result, Paternus, Salvius Julianus, whose son was betrothed to Paternus' son, and Paternus' friend the current ab epistulis Latinis Vitruvius Secundus were also executed.Historia Augusta, \\"Commodus\\", 4.1-10 Anthony Birley is inclined to accept the account of the Historia Augusta over that of Cassius Dio, noting that Salvius Julianus' kinsman Didius Julianus, who was governor of Germania Inferior at the time, was accused with being complicit with Salvius in treason against Commodus, but managed to clear himself and was allowed to withdraw to his native Milan.Birley, Septimus Severus: The African emperor, revised edition (New Haven: Yale, 1988), p. 61 == Writings == Paternus was known to have written on Roman Law, but little is known about those works or their contents. Extracts from the work appear in Justinian's Digest; Aemilius Macer and Vegetius call him \\"diligentissimus juris militaris adsertor.\\" A literary work in four books attributed to him has survived with the title De re militari; however, it was probably written by an anonymous writer under his name. == References == Category:2nd-century Romans Category:Executed ancient Roman people Category:People executed by the Roman Empire Category:2nd-century executions Category:Praetorian prefects ","title":"Publius Tarrutenius Paternus"},{"id":"63763731","text":"La Mosquitia is a Spanish name for: *Mosquito Coast, a region on the Caribbean coast of Central America, presently divided into: **La Mosquitia (Nicaragua), comprising the North and South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Regions **La Mosquitia (Honduras), largely within Gracias a Dios Department ","title":"La Mosquitia"},{"id":"63763776","text":"Levashovka () is a rural locality (a selo) and the administrative center of Verkhnetoydenskoye Rural Settlement, Anninsky District, Voronezh Oblast, Russia.

It can take still screenshots of an open window, rectangular areas, a free-form area, or the entire screen. Snips can then be annotated using a mouse or a tablet, stored as an image file (PNG, GIF, or JPEG formats), copied to the clipboard, e-mailed, or shared with another supported UWP app. Snip & Sketch allows for basic image editing of the snapshot, with different colored pens, pencils, an eraser, and a highlighter. Before Snip & Sketch, Snipping Tool was included as a PowerToy for the Microsoft Tablet PC launch on November 7, 2002, and on all editions starting in Windows Vista. Currently, both apps are available on Windows 10. Similar to Snipping Tool, Snip & Sketch includes a delay function, but the time options are different. Snip & Sketch only includes delay options of three seconds or ten seconds. The delay function is valuable for taking a screenshot showing context menus, or handles that appear around a graphic object when that object is selected. Without the delay feature it would not be possible to take a screenshot showing context menus and object handles because these disappear when any other item (such as Snip & Sketch itself) is clicked on. To use the delay feature, one opens Snip & Sketch, clicks on the chevron next to the New button, and chooses a delay. Then during that delay, one clicks on the button for the handler at the top of the screen to choose a mode, selects an area of the screen, and waits for the delay to lapse. At the end of the delay, Snip & Sketch automatically becomes active without the user having to click, and therefore the context menu or object handles do not disappear and a screenshot can be taken of them.

Busse's lab studies context-dependent visual processing in mouse models by performing large scale in vivo electrophysiological recordings in the thalamic and cortical circuits of awake and behaving mice. == Early life and education == Busse was born in Germany in 1977. She had an early interest in brain studies and received a scholarship from the State of Bavaria that supported her studies in basic psychology at the University of Leipzig, in Leipzig, Germany from 1997‚Äì1999. Busse then pursued further studies at the Max Planck Research School at the University of T√ºbingen in Germany where she focused in Neural and Behavioral Sciences from 1999‚Äì2001. During her time at T√ºbingen, Busse pursued research abroad for her Master's in Neuroscience. She moved to the United States for 6 months where she studied under the mentorship of Marty Woldorff at Duke University. Busse explored the cognitive underpinnings of attention in the human brain in the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at Duke University. After successfully completing her Master's in 2001, Busse stayed at Duke University for another year to work as a research technician, continuing to explore the neurobiological underpinnings of cognition using various imaging techniques such as fMRI, EEG, and ERP. In late 2002, Busse pursued her doctoral work back in Germany at the German Primate Center G√∂ttingen and the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience. Busse worked under the mentorship of Stefan Treue, where she entered the field of visual processing, exploring the neural basis of visual perception using non-human primates as a model organism. Busse completed her PhD in Neuroscience in 2006 and then moved back to the United States for one year funded by the Leopoldina Postdoctoral Scholarship. Busse completed her postdoctoral work at the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute in San Francisco, USA in 2007 and then moved to the Institute of Ophthalmology at the University College London, in the United Kingdom to work as a Research Associate under the mentorship of Matteo Carandini from 2008‚Äì2010. Under Carandini, Busse explored visual processing in the cat V1 and visual behavior in mice. === Cognitive Neuroscience of Attention === In the Woldorff Lab, Busse explored caveats to fMRI experimental trial structure in human fMRI experiments. Since fMRI experiments often suffer from extensive overlap of adjacent trial brain signals, experimenters started to implement ‚Äúnull‚Äù or ‚Äúno-stim‚Äù trials in order to provide time for extraction of stimulus generated signal during non-event trials. However, Busse sought to explore the hypothesis that ‚Äúnull-event‚Äù trials actually evoke unique brain activity patterns, called the omitted stimulus response (OSR). In am auditory task, Busse found significant OSRs, defined by an early posterior negative wave followed by a larger anterior positive wave, across a variety of stimulus rates and omitted stimulus percentages. Her work provided no only insight into the brain's OSR but also to the caveat associated with using OSRs as a ‚Äúnull‚Äù trial. Busse then published a fascinating paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences exploring the phenomenon of cross-modal attentional spreading. Busse found that when a subject is paying attention to a stimulus in one sensory modality, it increases the subject's attention to a non-related stimulus in a different sensory modality. This finding elucidated the idea that simultaneous yet disconnected stimuli can be grouped into one multisensory object enhancing the cognitive processing that is allocated to both stimuli. === Visual Attention and Processing === For her graduate work, Busse explored how cognition influences sensory information processing. For example, Busse became interested in top-down processing of sensory information in the case of visual attention, which is the ability of the brain to focus on one aspect of the visual environment even though it is taking in multitudes of visual information at once. Busse first showed both spatial and feature-based influences of exogenous cueing on motion processing. Autonomic shifts in attention, driven by exogenous cueing, appeared to be integrally driven by characteristic modulations of sensory processing. Busse then explored how cognitive attention in macaques changes the neural representation of motion information. Busse found that visual attention enhances the spatio-temporal structure of receptive fields for moving objects. Busse completed her dissertation in 2008, showing that cognitive factors have strong modulatory effects on the processing of visual motion. In her postdoctoral studies, Busse first explored visual processing in the primary visual cortex in cats. Busse found that when populations of neurons encode multiple stimuli simultaneously, a model of contrast normalization best explains how neurons represent multiple stimuli in V1. Essentially, the population response can be described as a weighted sum of the individual responses to the components of the visual stimulus. Not only did their modelling of normalization hold in cats, but also extended to recordings from human primary visual cortex. Busse was then ready to move her experiments into mice, a common model organism is systems neuroscience to dissect neural circuits, but she first had to pioneer a new approach to be able to relate vision circuits to perception in mice. Busse extensively trained mice to detect visual contrast using trial-based operant conditioning. After extensive training, they found that choices mice made in this operant task were not only based on the learned contrast association but also factors such as reward value or recent failures. When they used a generalized linear model to decode the neural data to predict behavioral outputs, they found that the decoder performed better than the mouse suggesting that the mouse might not be using the V1 information in the most optimal way. == Career and research == In 2010, Busse became a Junior Research Group Leader in the Werner Reichardt Center for Integrative Neuroscience at the University of T√ºbingen, in Germany. She led a team of researchers to approach studying the visual stimuli in an ethologically relevant way. Since visual systems are designed to reflect an organisms environment, Busse shaped her research program around probing the neural circuits underlying visual processing with stimuli similar to those that would be experienced in that organisms natural environment. In 2016, Busse was recruited to the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in Germany to hold a professorship within the Munich Center for Neurosciences. Busse currently leads the Vision Circuits Lab along with co-principal investigator Steffen Katzner within the Department of Biology, Neurobiology Division. === Exploring Neuronal Circuits of Visual Perception in Mice === As a Junior Research Group Leader, Busse began to explore the neural circuits underlying visual processing in mouse models. Busse began by asking whether surround suppression, a computation known to underlie visual salience, could be observed in the V1 cortex. Busse and her team found that in awake mice, parvalbumin positive interneurons in the primary visual cortex mediate surround suppression, however, when mice are under anesthesia, this profoundly affects surround suppression and thus spatial integration. Using optogenetics, Busse and her team were able to show in awake mice that activation of PV+ interneurons increases the receptive field size and decreases the suppression of neural populations, underscoring the role these cells play in spatial integration and highlighting the utility of mice in circuit level analyses of visual processing. Continuing to use mice as models to study visual processing, Busse and her team explored how behavioral context impacts neural activity in V1. They found that locomotion de-correlates V1 population responses however, locomotion seemed to control the tuning of dorsolateral geniculate nucleus population responses. Overall, their findings highlighted novel insight into the effects of locomotion in early visual system information processing. As a new faculty at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Busse explored whether and how each cortical layer performs surround suppression and coordinates this across cortical layers. Using in vivo recordings, Busse and her group were able to detect that layer 3 and layer 4 exhibited the strongest surround suppression and that intermediate stimulus sizes resulted in the strongest functional connections between layers. In their 2019 publication in Neuron, Busse and her colleagues at T√ºbingen shed light on the mechanisms by which the large degree of visual information coming in from the retina is processed and transferred in a manageable way to the visual cortex. Ganglion cells are the first cells to receive the image information from the retina, and they pass this information along to the thalamus, where Busse and her colleagues think there might be a pre-processing step before this information is routed to the cortex. To test this hypothesis, Busse and her colleagues recorded from retinal cells and thalamic cells and then used computational modelling to see which retinal cells contribute to the responses of thalamic cells. Fascinatingly, they found that the output of one thalamic cell relies on no more than 5 retinal cells, and that though these retinal inputs are combined to generate an output, they are not given equal weights. Their work highlighted the active role of the thalamus in signal processing, not just signal relaying as is thought to be the canonical function of the thalamus. == Awards and honors == * 2009 Berlin- Brandenburg Academy of Sciences Award * 2008 Junior Scientist Award of the Leibniz-Gemeinschaft * 2008 F√∂rderpreis‚Äô of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences * 2007 Doctoral Thesis Prize ‚ÄúEffects of selective attention on sensory processing of visual motion‚Äù == Select publications == * Rom√°n Ros√≥n, M., Bauer, Y., Kotkat, A.H., Berens, P., Euler, T., and Busse, L.

When she was three years old, her family moved to ƒ∞zmir and she completed her secondary and high school education there. In 2010, she started professional music with the band \\"Jackpot\\" in ƒ∞zmir, performing mainly cover songs. Until 2012, she performed with this group on stage in different cities, including ƒ∞zmir, Eski≈üehir and Bursa. She later joined the Fire of Anatolia as a dancer. Her backing vocals were featured in Murat Dalkƒ±lƒ±√ß's song \\"L√ºzumsuz Sava≈ü\\", and she worked as Dalkƒ±lƒ±√ß's backing vocalist for three years. With Dalkƒ±lƒ±√ß's help, she released her first single \\"Fƒ±r√ßa\\" in 2014. She started her solo career shortly afterwards. She became famous after releasing a cover version of Ezhel's song \\"Felaket\\". Additionally, she covered a number of other songs, notably by Fikri Karayel, Harun Kol√ßak and √úmit Sayƒ±n, which she shared on her YouTube channel. These covers helped with increasing her fame. In June 2019, she released a single with Anƒ±l Piyancƒ± titled \\"Bƒ±rakman Doƒüru Mu?\\". She also had minor roles in various TV series such as Adƒ± Mutluluk, Yasak Elma, Sil Ba≈ütan and Umuda Kelep√ße Vurulmaz. She gained further popularity after her single \\"Her Yerde Sen\\" became the theme song for the TV series of the same title \\"Her Yerde Sen\\", which aired its first episode on 14 June 2019. The song presents a lively mood, starting with an electric guitar riff that became the motive of the entire song. The song aptly narrates the backdrop of the show - two different people, Demir and Selin, who were forced to live in the same house because of a mishandled sale, the former being the managing director of the firm which the latter works in. An instrumental version of the song was also featured in the show's soundtrack, composed mainly by Zeynep Alasya and Alpay G√∂ltekin. She became an advertising face for Adidas in 2019 and Elidor in 2020. == Music style == Bastƒ±k mainly performs acoustic and electronic music. According to Tolga Akyƒ±ldƒ±z, performing the songs of artists such as Aylin Aslƒ±m, ƒ∞zel, Ferda Anƒ±l Yarkƒ±n, Kenan Doƒüulu, Levent Y√ºksel, Jabbar, Tarkan, Mustafa Sandal, ≈ûebnem Ferah, Harun Kol√ßak, Ajda Pekkan, Nil√ºfer, Kerim Tekin, ≈ûahsenem, Pinhani and Sezen Aksu, and her duets with multiple artists have contributed to her popularity in the digital music market. Bastƒ±k was able to come to the fore with these advantages. It has been suggested that Can Ozan, who made his debut in the same time as Bastƒ±k, became more popular and known after his duet with her was released. == Discography == ; Singles * 2014: \\"Fƒ±r√ßa\\" * 2017: \\"≈ûahaneyim\\" * 2019: \\"Her Yerde Sen\\" * 2019: \\"Bƒ±rakman Doƒüru Mu?\\" (with Anƒ±l Piyancƒ±) * 2019: \\"Mod\\" (with Mustafa Sandal) * 2020: \\"Uslanmƒ±yor Bu\\" * 2020: \\"√áukur\\" * 2020: \\"Her Mevsim Yazƒ±m\\" * 2020: \\"Bir Daha\\" * 2020: \\"Dargƒ±n\\" (with Emir Can ƒ∞ƒürek) == Filmography == ;TV series * 2014: Sil Ba≈ütan * 2015: Adƒ± Mutluluk ‚Äì Gonca G√ºl Duran * 2016: Umuda Kelep√ße Vurulmaz ‚Äì R√ºya * 2018: Yasak Elma ‚Äì ƒ∞rem == References == == External links == * Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Turkish female singers Category:Turkish lyricists Category:Turkish pop singers Category:Golden Butterfly Award winners Category:21st-century Turkish singers Category:People from √áanakkale Category:Turkish television actresses Category:21st-century women singers ","title":"Zeynep Bastƒ±k"},{"id":"63764019","text":"Federal State Budgetary Educational Institution of Higher Education \\"Kazan State Agrarian University\\" () is a higher educational institution in the system of training, retraining and advanced training of employees of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation (Ministry of Agriculture of Russia), located in the city of Kazan, Republic of Tatarstan, Russian Federation. ==History== On May 22, 1922, the Kazan Institute of Agriculture and Forestry was established on the basis of the union of the agricultural faculty of the Polytechnic Institute and the forest faculty of Kazan University.

It is the major protein component of the otoconia (ear dust). In mice the protein is called otoconin-90, and is coded by the Ocn-95 gene. In humans the ortholog is called PLA2L, originally believed to be a pseudogene. In mice the protein contains 469 amino acids, and is coded by 1906 base-pair DNA. In mice the protein is first formed at day 9.5 in the otic vesicle dorsal wall epithelium, and also in the endolymphatic duct. This is before any minerals are deposited. Four days later it also appears in the non-sensory epithelium of the utricle and saccule and semicircular canals. The roof of the cochlear duct also has some. By ten days after birth the protein is not found in any cells, but only in the acellular membranes. The otoconin-90 contains two secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) domains. sPLA2 has a rigid structure with eight disulfide bonds. The sPLA2 domain has the ability to bind a phospholipid, but does not have enzymatic capability. Presumably the domain also binds calcium Ca2+ ions and carbonate CO32+. Otoconin-90 would position the ions to fit into a calcite lattice. The calcium is hypothesized to be secreted from the sensory epithelium into the gelatinous substance on the top of which it meets otoconin and forms otoconia. In amphibians (Xenopus) a similar mass protein is contained in the utricle along with calcite. The saccule contains aragonite with otoconin-22 which is 22 kDa in mass. Otoconin-22 contains 127 amino acids. Otoconin-22 has a single sPLA2 domain. Chondrostean fish contain a similar protein of 40 to 50 kDa mass, and vaterite as the mineral component. In mammals otoconin makes up 90% of the protein component of an otoconium grain, primarily in the core. ==References== Category:Glycoproteins ","title":"Otoconin"},{"id":"63764111","text":"Adidas Nemeziz are a range of football boots created by German sportswear manufacturers Adidas.

With a minute left Dur√°n tried to attack Hearns with a body shot, but Hearns countered with a left hook that opened a cut above Dur√°n's eye. 30 seconds later Hearns sent Dur√°n down after catching him flush with a hard right hand. After getting back up and taking the referee's standing-eight count Dur√°n was allowed to continue but Hearns swarmed Dur√°n with a series of rights and lefts before knocking him down again with an uppercut to the body with only seconds remaining though Dur√°n would again get back and answer the referee's eight-count as the round came to an end. After the bell rang, a dazed Dur√°n wandered to a neutral corner causing one of his corner-men to grab him and lead him back to his own.

In other actions, she allegedly set fire to a door of the Latvian Ministry of Education and was arrested for a political protest in Moscow. ==Early life== Lebedeva is a Latvian of Russian ethnicity who grew up in Daugavpils, Latvia. ==Prince Charles incident== In November 2001 Charles, Prince of Wales, made an official visit to Latvia. Lebedeva, then aged 16, approached Charles as he was greeting people at the Freedom Monument in Riga and struck him with three red carnations. The incident was reported by international mainstream media. Lebedeva was immediately arrested and taken to the Department of National Security. She was strip-searched, interrogated, and charged under statute 87 of the Latvian criminal code, which carried a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison. After three days, she was released from the detention centre and required to report every day to Daugavpils police station until the case came to trial. Lebedeva had intended the action as a protest against the killing of civilians during the war in Afghanistan but forgot to say anything until she was being bundled into a police car. She later told The Guardian: \\"I've got no idea what his views are on the war. I saw him just as a representative for Britain\\". Prince Charles was on a five-day tour of the Baltic states and privately admitted that the incident had \\"frightened me rigid\\". However, he made a plea for leniency and the charge was dropped from assaulting a foreign dignitary to hooliganism, which carried a maximum prison sentence of two years. Latvian President Vaira Vƒ´ƒ∑e-Freiberga and Lebedeva's English teacher had already apologised to the prince. Eventually, the charge was lessened again; Lebedeva was sentenced to unspecified educational measures and put under her mother's supervision for one year. If Lebedeva had engaged in criminal activity or hooliganism, her mother would have been put on trial. Lebedeva subsequently gained the nickname 'Alina Carnation'. ==Later life== Lebedeva was back in the Latvian news in 2004, when she was arrested for allegedly setting fire to a door at the Ministry of Education. The 18-year-old Lebedova and a 23-year-old man were arrested in Daugavpils. She was not charged, but a judge ordered her to be placed in detention for a week whilst the crime was investigated. The arson attack was allegedly connected to a National Bolshevik Party protest against a new law requiring that all schools teach mainly in Latvian. BBC News reported later in 2004 that Lebedeva was amongst the National Bolshevik Party activists arrested after an action in which they invaded the Russian presidential offices in Moscow and hung a banner which read \\"Putin go away\\". Lebedeva was then jailed for two years. Lebedeva stood for election as a Member of the European Parliament for the Motherland party in 2009. She was the second person on the Motherland party list, after the party's leader Juris ≈Ωuravƒºovs. Lebedeva then renounced politics and returned to her studies. As of 2012, she had earned a bachelor's degree in social pedagogy and was preparing for a master's degree. ==See also== * Katie Sierra suspension controversy ==References== ==External links== * Free Alina Lebedeva Category:Latvian activists Category:1980s births Category:Living people Category:People from Daugavpils Category:Latvian political people Category:Latvian women in politics ","title":"Alina Lebedeva"},{"id":"63764266","text":"The Kurt Weill Centre is a cultural site in Dessau, in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.

The building was built on the site of the Parrott Building, a three-story building erected in 1851 by early San Francisco settler John Parott. The building was demolished in 1926 to make room for construction of the current high-rise tower. The demolition prompted a treasure hunt due to rumors that early settlers had buried Mexican doubloons, gold nuggets, jewels, and property deeds on the property. A new 15-story, steel-frame building was built on the site with the construction completed in January 1927. The new building, known as the Financial Center Building, was designed by architect Frederick H. Meyer and Albin R. Johnson. The building included Florentine Renaissance and Richardsonian Romanesque design elements. The facade featured rusticated cast stone on the first five floors, a red-brick facade and higher floors, and a corbelled cast-stone cornice arcade on the top floor. In 1956, the building's owner (First Western Bank & Trust) substantially remodeled and \\"modernized\\" the exterior base of the building, interior entrance and lobby. The cast stone on the exterior of the lower floors was removed and replaced with polished granite cladding. The building's original arched windows were also replaced with rectangular storefront windows. Marble wainscotting, door trim, and bronze elevator doors were also removed. By 1997, the building had been vacant for several years when it was acquired by Omni Hotels. Omni's plans to convert the building to a hotel were delayed for several years. In 2001 and 2002, the building was renovated at a reported cost of $125 million. The renovation was designed by Patri Merker Architects. Elements of the 1956 modernization were reversed to restore the building's original design. Original 1926 drawings were used to restore the stone facade and other exterior design elements. The property's square footage was also substantially increased by raising the roof and addition of an 80,000-square-foot structure at the rear. The building has been given an \\"A\\" rating by the City of San Francisco indicating that it is of \\"highest importance\\" in evaluating historic buildings. The hotel is a member of the Historic Hotels of America. ==References== ==External links== *Omni San Francisco Hotel, official site Category:Hotels in California ","title":"Omni San Francisco Hotel"},{"id":"63764300","text":"was a port settlement which existed from the Heian to the Muromachi period located in what is now part of the city of Goshogawara, Aomori in the T≈çhoku region of Japan. Its ruins are now is an archaeological site which was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2005. ==Overview== Tosaminato was located on the narrow strip of land which separate Lake J≈´san from the Sea of Japan on the west coast of Aomori Prefecture. The area forms a natural harbor, as Lake J≈´san was an inlet of the sea during that period, and not a lake. It was developed as a center for trade with the Ainu people and the Asian mainland by the Hiraizumi-based Northern Fujiwara during the Heian period, although it may have been used by the Emishi people much earlier. From 1229 it came under the control of the And≈ç clan, who built a castle for protection, and who came to dominate trade with the northern island of Ezo in the Kamakura period. By the early Muromachi period, it was a major port on the coastal trade routes along the Sea of Japan, and was also actively involved in overseas trade directly with the Korean Peninsula. However, by the mid- Muromachi period, the And≈ç clan was forced to relocate from the area to Hokkaido due to increasing aggressive attacks by the Nanbu clan in 1432, and Tosaminato went into rapid decline. The Nanbu developed Noheji on Mutsu Bay as their main port for contact with Ezo, as it was more convenient to their seat at Sannohe Castle and later to Morioka, and Tosaminato eventually silted up, becoming largely unusable. During the Edo Period, then area came under the control of the Tsugaru clan, who had a strong enmity against the Nanbu. The Tsugaru attempted to redevelop Tosaminto as a port on the kitamaebune trade routes to take their rice and timber to markets in Osaka and to re-establish contacts with Ezo, but it never regained its former prosperity The archaeological site is roughly triangular in shape and covers around 55 hectares, approximately 2 km north‚Äìsouth and up to 500 m east‚Äìwest. It was excavated between 1993 and 1995 by a team from the National Museum of Japanese History, and in 1995-1996 by teams from the Aomori Prefecture Education Office and Toyama University. Excavation revealed that the settlement was defended by an outer wall of packed earth, while an interior wall separated the city into two parts. The north sector included the And≈ç residence, surrounded by those of their vassals, a temple, and the port itself. The southern sector included other residences, commercial spaces, and temples. Chinese ceramics and Kyoto- style tiles, which are rare in the T≈çhoku region, have also been found. Excavated artifacts indicated that it reached its apogee around the second half fourteenth to early fifteenth century. ==See also== *List of Historic Sites of Japan (Aomori) ==References== ==External links== *Aomori prefectural government official site *Goshogawara city official site Category:Muromachi period Category:History of Aomori Prefecture Category:Goshogawara Category:Archaeological sites in Japan Category:Historic Sites of Japan ","title":"Tosaminato"},{"id":"63764306","text":"Harendra Kumar Sur was a Member of the 1st National Assembly of Pakistan as a representative of East Pakistan. ==Career== Sur represented Noakhali in the Bengal Legislative Council.

Eardly-Wilmot was appointed to the old North-West Provinces and Oudh region of colonial India. He rose to prominence within the Indian Forest Service for his conservation lead method and unorthodox approach. He advocated methods of numbering and ageing trees, surveying methods which were not common on the Indian sub-continent at that time. Eardley-Wilmot also introduced a ban on the felling of the best specimens which had been a common practice in Colonial India. In 1906, Sir Eardley-Wilmot created the Forest Research Institute to promote greater understanding of the forests of the Indian sub- continent.

The town hall, which is the headquarters of Barking and Dagenham London Borough Council, is a locally listed building. ==History== The old town hall in East Street The building was commissioned to replace the old town hall in East Street. A large site was chosen for the new building east of Broadway and extensive demolition of aging residential accommodation was undertaken in the late 1930s. The clearance included the buildings on Heath Street which led down to Barking Wharf. The new building was designed by Herbert Jackson and Reginald Edmonds in the Neo-Georgian style and was inspired by Stockholm City Hall. The design for the main frontage in Barking Town Square, which was brick faced, involved nine bays with an arched doorway on the ground floor, a balcony and three tall windows on the first floor and three smaller windows on the second floor; a tall clock tower surmounted by a cupola was erected at roof level. The size of the building was maximised by the use of lengthy side elevations: the elevations on the north west and south east sides extended back 17 bays. Construction work started in 1939 and was delayed the completed basement was put into use as an air raid shelter for the duration of the Second World War. After the war construction was resumed and was undertaken by the council's own direct workforce at a cost of ¬£520,000. The building was officially opened by Dame Evelyn Sharp, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, on 17 December 1958. Barking Assembly Hall, which adjoins the main building, was added in 1961. Now known as \\"The Broadway\\", it was remodeled as an arts centre and auditorium in 2006. The town hall was established as the headquarters of the Municipal Borough of Barking and continued to function as the local of seat of government when the enlarged London Borough of Barking and Dagenham was formed in 1965. Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, visited the town hall complex as part of the borough's 50th anniversary celebrations in July 2015. A major refurbishment of the complex, to a design by Hawkins\\\\Brown, was completed in 2006 with further alterations to facilitate open plan working being completed in April 2018. ==References== Category:Government buildings completed in 1958 Category:City and town halls in London ","title":"Barking Town Hall"},{"id":"63765155","text":"Frontispiece of Iter Exstaticum (1660) Itinerarium exstaticum quo mundi opificium is a 1656 work by the Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher. It is an imaginary dialogue in which an angel named Cosmiel takes the narrator, Theodidactus ('taught by God') on a journey through the planets. It is the only work by Kircher devoted entirely to astronomy, and one of only two pieces of imaginative fiction by him. A revised and expanded second edition, entitled Iter Exstaticum, was published in 1660. ==Background== In his 1641 work Magnes sive de Arte Magnetica, Kircher had argued against the cosmological theories of both Kepler and Galileo, but had written nothing on the subject since. It is not clear why Kircher took it up again, though the preface mentions encouragement from Emperor Frederick III. The book was dedicated to Queen Christina of Sweden who visited the Vatican just after it was published. ==Narrative== Itinerarium Exstaticum relates how, lulled into a sleepy reverie by a concert of sacred music in the Jesuit College, Theodidactus finds himself guided through the heavens by a guiding angel. The views Kircher explored in his dialogue were remarkable for a seventeenth-century Jesuit. He imagined stars of different sizes, accompanied by planets, turning around each other and moving through space. The stars, as he described them. were ‚Äúfixed‚Äù but moved in circular orbits sometimes in systems of binary or multiple stars, with vast distances between them. As he believed they were very far away and all moved around the earth, he believed they moved with tremendous speed. The only known translation of the work from Latin is an unpublished manuscript version Voyage extatique dans les globes c√©lestes; dans les abimes de la mer et dans l'int√©rieur du globe terrestre. Traduit du P√®re Kirker composed in France between 1722 and 1736. ==Criticism== As was normal, Kircher's manuscript was reviewed by Jesuit censors before publication was approved by the Superior of the order. There were some misgivings that the work included views that were 'dangerous to faith.' When published, Itinerarium Exstaticum attracted considerable criticism for its departure from the Aristolelian cosmology that the Catholic Church had essentially adhered to since the trial of Galileo. In his work Kircher supported the Tychonic model of the universe, with the Earth at its centre and other planets moving around the Sun. However he also maintained, against Aristotle, that the different planets were all made of the same material as the Earth, and that sunspots existed. ==Iter Exstaticum== Diagram of different models of the universe, from Iter Exstaticum Illustration from Iter Exstaticum Rather than reply to his critics himself, he had his student Kaspar Schott prepare a second edition which included additional details in refutation of his critics' arguments. This was published in Germany in 1660 under the title Iter Exstaticum. A separate work with a similar title was Iter Exstaticum II (1657). Kircher advertised as a prelude to his Mundus Subterraneus; an extatic journey that took Theodidactus in the opposite direction, down under the earth. Itinerarium Exstaticum and Iter Exstaticum II were Kircher's only two ventures into imaginative fiction. ==Illustrations in Iter Exstaticum== As a work of imaginative literature, Itinerarium Exstaticum did not include illustrations. Iter Exstaticum (1660) however contained many explanatory diagrams. The frontispiece of Iter Exstaticum depicts Kircher himself holding a compass, with the angel Cosmiel next to him gesturing towards a huge image of the universe. This is a representation of the Tychonic system, but it is remarkable because while it is clearly marked as moving around the Earth, the Sun is represented at the centre of the universe. above all stands the name of God written in Hebrew. The frontispiece was the work of Johann Friedrich Fleischberger, a Nuremberg engraver. ==Bibliography== * Harald Siebert.

The local names for the street are \\"Eierberg\\", \\"Gurke\\" (cucumber, due to its length), \\"Riemenschleifer\\" (belt-grinder) or \\"Riemenwalzwerk\\" (belt rolling mill). ==History== The Hamme district in Bochum had at least eight brothels by the railway tracks on Kurzen Stra√üe (now Sophienstra√üe) in 1904. In 1912, the M√§rkischer Sprecher newspaper reported on the city's plans to allow \\"regulated brothel operations only in the immediate vicinity of the city centre\\" on what was then Maarbr√ºcker Stra√üe, the street name being changed to Im Winkel in 1929. ==Modern times== Layout of Im Winkel The collection of brothels is designed in the style of a square surrounded by shop windows. Depending on the time of day, 50 to 100 prostitutes offer their services there. A Laufhaus was built at a cost of a million euros and was opened in 2009. The property has 40 rooms on several floors and a pizzeria. The Laufhaus is known locally as the \\"Eierberg\\". The city of Bochum's restricted district ordinance of January 21, 2003 limits prostitution to Im Winkel. On May 31, 2006, the Gelsenkirchen Administrative Court criticised that the wording of the ordinance did not describe the boundaries of the restricted area precisely enough. Im Winkel is located in the Bochum-Mitte district, close proximity to the site of the mining group Bochum Association of West Park and the Centennial Hall. The organic structural structure of the location can be described as a special feature, since an almost village atmosphere is created by several alleys and squares. The Madonna Association (Madonna e.V.) offers on-site advice for prostitutes. Madonna was founded in 1991 and is jointly funded by the North Rhine-Westphalia Senate and the city of Bochum. Following the enlargement of the EU in 2007, the number of foreign prostitutes working in the area increased. A 2008 investigation into an international prostitution ring based in Bochum led to the discovery of match-fixing and ultimately to the 2009 European football match-fixing scandal.

Belonging to a wealthy family in Bucharest, Assan was an important figure in the industrialization of Romania. He studied engineering, commerce and economics, which impulsed him to discover the globe. In 1896, he became the first Romanian to travel to the Arctic, and between 1897 and 1898, he became the first Romanian to travel around the world. His travels were later presented to King Carol I of Romania. Assan died on 16 June 1918 in Montreux, Switzerland. ==Biography== The Assan House in Bucharest, now considered a monument Assan was born on 1 August 1860 in Bucharest, belonging to a rich family. His father, George Assan, a Romanian from Bessarabia, settled in the city and built the first windmill in Romanian history (known as the Windmill of Assan) on the shore of the Colentina Lake in 1853. His mother was Alexandrina Assan. Gheorghe G. Assan, his brother who was born in 1862, studied commerce in Antwerp, Belgium, and held various positions in commercial and other institutions. Assan studied engineering in Li√®ge, Belgium, and economics in Montreux, Switzerland. In 1884, he returned to Bucharest to become a partner in his father's company with his brother. These two modernized the company and built two factories, one for soap and the other for paint and varnish. Assan was one of the persons who helped Romania industrialize at approximately the same rate as other European countries. He also designed a canal between CernavodƒÉ and Constan»õa (later the Danube‚ÄìBlack Sea Canal), publishing an article in 1899 about it. Assan, together with the aviation and automobile enthusiast George Valentin Bibescu and the baron Barbu Bellu, was the first person to bring an automobile to Romania. The first two requested one from the brand FN Herstal. Since Bibescu did not have time to register it, Assan became in 1900 the first person to receive a plate, 1B. However, Bibescu wanted to be the first one, so in 1901, the Capital Prefecture made an exception and gave him the plate 0B, technically making him the owner of the first plate in Romania. Not much is known about Assan's family. He married a Romani woman and had three daughters. Assan named them according to where he was when they were born. Thus, the first was called Athenaida after Athens, Consuella after Spain and Pacifica after the Pacific Ocean. In 1904, Assan built a grain silo, making it the tallest building in Bucharest at the time. He also built the first edible corn oil factory in the country. Between 1906 and 1914, he built a neoclassical house in Bucharest, known as the Assan House. He died on 16 June 1918 in Montreux. ==Expeditions== Assan, stimulated by his knowledge of economics, commerce and industry, was greatly interested in discovering the world. Therefore, in the summer of 1896, he embarked on the Norwegian ship Erling Jart and, along with other scientists of various nationalities, traveled to the Arctic. Assan and the scientists studied the geological structure and natural resources of the archipelago of Svalbard. Thus, he became the first Romanian to travel to the Arctic. Afterwards, between 1897 and 1898, departing from Constan»õa, he passed through Constantinople, Alexandria, Ceylon, Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Nagasaki, Tokyo, Yokohama, San Francisco, New York and London, establishing several trade agreements and becoming the first Romanian to travel around the world. His expeditions were published in the Royal Society of Geography of Romania, of which he was a member. After returning, he presented his conference CƒÉlƒÉtorie √Æn regiunile polare nordice (\\"Journey in the northern Polar regions\\") to the King Carol I and the Prince Ferdinand I, and days later to the Queen Elisabeth of Wied. In 1899, he presented to the public CƒÉlƒÉtoria √Æmprejurul PƒÉm√¢ntului (\\"Journey around the Earth\\"), his second conference. Between December 1897 and the middle of 1898, Assan made another trip, this time with more economic and cultural intentions. ==References== Assan Assan Assan Assan Assan Assan Assan ","title":"Bazil Assan"},{"id":"63765285","text":"And Berry Came Too is a 1936 collection of comic short stories by the English author Dornford Yates (Cecil William Mercer), featuring his recurring 'Berry' characters. == Plot == Eight short stories, mostly set in Hampshire.

The reviewer welcomed the return of Berry after an absence of five years and suggested that the publication would be met with \\"a loud and general cheer\\". There was, however, some criticism of the author's \\"curious blind spot\\" in his portrayal of women, and in particular the way in which the narrator, Boy, maintains a commentary on the beauty, sweetness and virtue of the female characters, and the way in which he enthusiastically and repeatedly likens his girlfriend to a child.

During the transplant period (1883-1888), Hanseong Sunbo and Hanseong Jubo, Korea's first modern newspapers, were published. Hanseong Sunbo Later, during the period of birth (1896-1904), Independent Newspaper was founded by Seo Jae-pil, and during the period of struggle (1904-1910), Daehan Maeil Shinbo, Hwangseong press, and Daeguk press were founded against the Japanese. === Hanseong Sunbo (Êº¢ÂüéÊó¨Â†±) === Hanseong Sunbo was the first modern newspaper in Korea. It was published three times monthly by Park Mun-guk, Seoul beginning on October 31, 1883. Thereafter, it was published on the first day of each month. In 1882, Park Young-hyo and his group visited Japan as receptionists (an envoy sent to Japan during King Gojong's reign in the late Joseon Dynasty) and brought back several Japanese people, including journalists and printers, to help produce newspapers. Park Yeong-Hyo, who was soon appointed to Hanseongbu Panyun after returning to Korea, frequently visited the palace and stressed to King Gojong the necessity of the newspaper. Oon February 28, 1883, King Gojong ordered the Hansung Department to take charge of publishing the newspaper. The articles were largely divided into domestic and international articles. The domestic articles include government gazette, private newsletter, and city council information, and the best articles of each country focus on war or conflict between powerful and weak countries at the time, modern military equipment or defense measures, and blossoming culture. === Hanseong Jubo (Êº¢ÂüéÂë®Â†±) === As the first weekly newspaper in Korea, Hanseong Jubo was founded on January 25, 1886, in the form of a double edition of Hanseong Sunbo. Its founding history reveals, the paper made it its greatest mission to be loyal to the king and to make the people realize. Sunbo and Jubo had something in common, in that they were issued by Bak Mun-guk, which was established by the government to publish newspapers, and the purpose of publication was the same. === Independent newspaper === Independent newspaper The Independent Newspaper (1896.4. 7‚Äì1899. 12.4) was the first private newspaper in Korea and was launched by Seo Jae-pil on April 7, 1896. The Independent Newspaper was the first newspaper published by civilians, and reflects a clear difference between the content and the way they are operated. The newspaper was characterized by its emphasis on modern nationalism, democratic ideas, and independent modernization, educating and enlightening the people. The paper also emphasized the urgency and importance of the new education, believing that education is the most urgent priority to strengthen the country and speed up the enlightenment. Third, for the first time, it taught the people the idea of democracy and insisted on the need for national suffrage and the establishment of a parliament. Fourth, it emphasized the reform of social customs, such as the upsurge of public morality, national unity, rectification of the evil wind of slander, and cultivation of the attitude of living, contributing to society. Fifth, it emphasized that the power of the country comes from the modern development of industry. Sixth, it condemned the tyranny and corruption of bureaucrats and emphasized compliance and the creation of a fair social climate. Seventh, the international situation surrounding Korea at that time was in critical condition; constantly raising awareness that there was a risk of losing independence without national awakening, and emphasized to be wary of foreign influence. When the independent newspaper accused high-ranking government officials of corruption and denounced the invasion of interests by the powers, representing the interests of the nation and leading public opinion, disgruntled Russian legation and water poloists plotted Seo Jae-pil's expulsion. Japan has also entered a closed path in line with the move. == Japanese colonial era (1910 - 1945) == At this time, there were private newspapers published by Koreans and newspapers issued by the Governor-General. These private and institutional papers contained conflicting content. === Resistance press === Resistance newspapers were the centerpiece of the national movement as well as a window to introduce foreign ideas and record all aspects of life in colonial Joseon, including politics, economy, culture, and education. Chosun Ilbo and Dong-A Ilbo The Chosun Ilbo and Dong-A Ilbo, published in the Japanese occupation, the three 'private newspapers' times. The Jegi Ilbo, which was founded by Choe Nam-seon in 1924, was later published by 1936, with its title changed to the Joong-Ang Ilbo, JoongAng Ilbo, and Chosun JoongAng Ilbo. Until the Japanese Government-General's forced closure of all Korean-issued private papers in August 1940, newspapers were a record of all the life of colonial Joseon, including politics, economy, culture, and education, as well as a window for introducing and bringing in foreign ideas, and being the center of the national movement. The newspaper company was a gathering place for talent and a presentation stage for literary works. === Governor-General's newspaper === The Governor-General issued the newspapers in three languages, streamlining, glorifying and promoting colonial rule. Maeil Shinbo  Gyeongseong Ilbo, Maeil Shinbo, Seoul press  The Governor-General rationalized, glorified, and promoted colonial rule by publishing three organ papers: Korean (Maeil Shinbo), Japanese (Kyungsung Ilbo), and English (The Seoul Press). Government organ is important, the diplomatic value in the Japanese occupation was the study of history. Maeil Shinbo was incorporated into the Gyeongseong Ilbo until it was spun off as an independent corporation in 1938, and managed by a Japanese president. Maesin the Japanese occupation for 35 years uninterrupted and the only Korean newspaper published. After Korea's liberation from Japan's colonial rule, the title was changed to Seoul The Gyeongseong Ilbo was published in Japanese until December 10, 1945, even after the collapse of the Japanese colonial rule. After the forced annexation of Korea and Japan, the Japanese Government- General of Korea issued the three-language organ \\"Kyungsung Ilbo,\\" \\"Maeil Shinbo\\" and \\"The Seoul Press.\\" The three organizations were established as separate newspapers before the annexation of Korea, and after the annexation, they promoted and promoted Japan's colonial rule and justified the war of aggression. == Korean Independence == Since Korea's liberation from Japan's colonial rule, numerous periodicals, including newspapers and magazines, have emerged in response to media oppression. Also, the media was divided into left and right, causing confusion. === Left-right confrontational press === Liberation Daily  Chosun's People Daily press and Liberation Daily.  The left-wing group took the lead in the press by first taking control of the facilities for printing newspapers. The leading left-wing newspapers were the Chosun's People Daily and the Liberation Daily. Founded on September 8, 1945, the Korean People's Daily was founded by Korean employees working in the Gyeongseong Ilbo, which was first published by Kim Jeong-do, but since late October, Hong Jeung-sik, a big figure in the left-wing media community, changed to editor- in-chief and publisher, serving as the organ of the Communist Party. The number of printing facilities immediately after Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule was very small and most of them belonged to Japanese people. The Communist Party of Korea not only received the Gonozawa Printing Office in Sogong-dong, Seoul, which was the best facility at the time, but also recruited the publishing labor union. Chosun's people daily press was the first daily newspaper in Seoul after the August 15 Liberation, and on September 8, left-wing reporters from the Gyeongseong Ilbo, the official newspaper of the Japanese Government-General of Korea, were founded as tabloid Korean newspapers. The Liberation Daily was founded in 1945 by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Korea in Seoul. == Military government (1960-1980) == The military government After May 16, 1961, the military government conducted a complete overhaul of newspapers and news agencies. A year later, the military government strongly pushed ahead with its media policy to reform the structure of the media, announcing a 25-point \\"press policy\\" and \\"press policy implementation standards.\\" The Dong-A and Chosun incident occurred due to the intervention of government authorities, the press freedom protection movement, the suppression of advertisements, and labor-management conflicts. === The Dong-A and Chosun incidents === On the surface, it was a conflict between the reporters and management of the two leading newspapers, Dong-A Ilbo and Chosun Ilbo. However, this incident exposed the problems faced by the media, such as the dismissal of a large number of journalists in the 1970s, as well as the discord between journalists and business owners.  Dong-A ilbo incident  The Dong-A Ilbo incident started directly with the union formation of reporters. On March 7, 1974, 33 reporters from the Dong-A Ilbo formed the Dong-A Ilbo Branch of the National Publishing Workers' Union. The company, however, began to fire the reporters in line with Dong-A Ilbo's traditional policy of not recognizing labor unions. The union filed a lawsuit against it, leading to conflicts and complicated lawsuits. In the midst of such labor- management conflicts, the Dong-A Ilbo dismissed or suspended reporters between March 10 and April 1975, forcing 134 reporters, producers and announcers to leave the company as a whole.  Chosun ilbo incident  Just around this time, the Chosun Ilbo dismissed the two journalists for \\"infringing their editorial rights.\\" As a result, a total of 58 journalists were dismissed or suspended indefinitely by the end of March the following year due to worsening conflicts between management and reporters, but 33 reporters were dismissed as they canceled disciplinary action. === Media Integration and Abandoned Incident === In 1980, consolidation of newspapers, broadcasting, and telecommunications under the leadership of the new military The Jun Doo-hwan forces, which took control of the power due to the December 12 incident, established a press team (Lee Sang-jae) at the intelligence office of the security company in early 1980 and merged media companies to control the media essential to the power struggle, and dismissed journalists who were resistant or critical. The reason for the merger was that the media companies have become insolvent and a hotbed of corruption due to the turmoil of media organizations, undermining the sound media climate. The voluntary closure or consolidation was only a formality, and in fact, the New Military Department's security division led the move. The new military, including Jun Doo-hwan, was found to be part of a ruling scenario in which the government forcibly merged media outlets such as newspapers, broadcasters, and news agencies under the guise of improving the structure of the media to complete the rebellion of the new military forces. == References == Category:Mass media in Korea Category:History of Korea ","title":"History of newspapers in Korea"},{"id":"63765444","text":"The Portrait of Juana of Austria and a Young Girl is a full-length portrait executed by the Italian sixteenth-century artist Sofonisba Anguissola.

Many hospitals have scaled back or postponed non-emergency care. This has medical consequences for the people served by the hospitals, and it has financial consequences for the hospitals. Health and social systems across the globe are struggling to cope. The situation is especially challenging in humanitarian, fragile and low-income country contexts, where health and social systems are already weak. Health facilities in many places are closing or limiting services. Services to provide sexual and reproductive health care risk being sidelined, which will lead to higher maternal mortality and morbidity. == General implications == Researchers could show that due to cancelled or postponed surgical procedures, 28.4 Million procedures had been postponed during the peak 12 weeks of the pandemic. 2.3 Million cancer surgeries were expected to be postponed. Estimates could show that 72.3% of all surgical procedures would be cancelled and that benign disease and orthopaedics would be the most affected procedures. On the other hand, a study published by the same group could show that postoperative pulmonary complications and mortality were significantly elevated in operated patients with SARS-CoV-2-infection. Thus a careful balance would have to be found between the risks of the operation and the risk of delaying the latter. To minimize the risk for SARS- CoV-2-related complications after hospital procedures, it was later during the pandemic proposed to establish COVID-19-free clinical pathways. == Asia == China has rapidly constructed new hospitals to accommodate a large number of beds. According to doctors in Tokyo, Japan, the state of emergency is not enough for stopping the spread of the coronavirus. == North America == In the United States, hospitals financially rely on \\"surgeries, scans and other well- reimbursed services to privately insured patients\\"; when non-emergency care was discontinued during the pandemic, causing severe financial problems. For example, the Mayo Clinic's revenue had a net gain of $1 billion in 2019, but had to cancel surgeries in 2020 and therefore expects to lose nearly $1 billion during 2020. The federal government passed the CARES Act which is giving $30 billion to hospitals nationwide. 261 hospital systems laid off or furloughed over 100,000 employees by May 21. == Africa == Doctors and nurses working in public hospitals went on strike over lack of PPE's, to use while treating patients. \\"Some countries like Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, and Ivory Coast have insurance for their health workers and have promised to provide them with allowances.\\" == On female staff == Globally, women make up 70 percent of workers in the health and social sector.

G√ºnther Erich Freytag described the species in 1955 as Triturus vulgaris kosswigii, a subspecies of the smooth newt (now Lissotriton vulgaris). After genetic data had suggested the smooth newt was a complex of distinct lineages, Dubois and Raffa√´lli, in 2009, recognised several subspecies, including Kosswig's smooth newt, as distinct species. This was followed by subsequent authors. Molecular phylogenetics suggested that the closest relative of Kosswig's smooth newt is the Greek smooth newt (Lissotriton graecus) from the Balkans. The species differs from other species in the smooth newt species complex mainly in the male secondary characters during breeding season. The male dorsal crest is less than 1 mm high, but high at the tail base, has smooth edges, and ends in a long filament. The well-developed dorso-lateral folds give the body a square shape. The toe flaps are well developed. Paedomorphic adults have been reported for Kosswig's smooth newt. The species's conservation status has not yet been evaluated separately from the smooth newt by the IUCN. Since its range is much smaller than that of the smooth newt species complex as a whole, it is likely to be more vulnerable than previously estimated. ==References== Category:Lissotriton Category:Amphibians of Turkey Category:Endemic fauna of Turkey Category:Amphibians described in 1955 ","title":"Kosswig's smooth newt"},{"id":"63765648","text":"Marvin Sims (born June 18, 1957) is a former American football fullback.

It is popular worldwide, including in Italy, and is one of the iconic items from pizzerias's menus. Traditionally, the cheeses include Mozzarella, as the fundamental component, which maintains humidity during cooking, partially protecting the other cheeses from the strong heat of the oven. Gorgonzola is almost systematically present and the completing duo consists of other local cheeses, depending on the region, with Fontina and Parmigiano-Reggiano as the typical complements, but other variants include Pecorino, Ricotta, Stracchino, Robiola, Taleggio, smoked Provola or Caciocavallo. Beside Mozzarella, mass- produced pizzas often use Parmesan, Romano, Asiago, and other Italian-style cheeses, though some use non-Italian cheeses such as Edam, Emmental and Blue cheese. The choice of cheeses is not random, they should be full-fat or semi- fat and vary in flavour. Besides Mozzarella, the quattro formaggi usually combines a blue or mature cheese, a soft cheese (such as Emmental or Gruyere) or a creamy cheese (such as Robiola or Stracchino), and a hard cheese (parmesan or pecorino, grated). Unlike other pizzas, like the Napolitan or the Margherita, which have an old, rich, and documented history, the Quattro Formaggi, despite its popularity and preponderance, has a less clear origin, certainly due to its composition being so obvious. It is believed to originate from the Lazio region at the beginning of the 18th century. Its less obvious and more recent versions, like the Quattro Latti pizza, can be on the opposite tracked in the history of gastronomy. ==See also== * List of Italian dishes * List of pizza varieties by country ==References== quattro formaggi ","title":"Pizza quattro formaggi"},{"id":"63766275","text":"Variety (German title: Variet√© ) is a 1935 French-German drama film directed by Nicolas Farkas and starring Annabella, Hans Albers and Attila H√∂rbiger.Bock & Bergfelder p.8 It is based on the 1912 novel The Oath of Stephan Huller by Felix Hollaender.

It comprises tangy sour Hatkora to spicy hot chicken tikka masala, confectionery Tusha Shinni to savoury Nunor Bora and the fermented fish Hutki Shira. Hatkora is a common fruit and used to cook different dishes with fish and meat. Enriched with Vitamin C and antioxidants, Hatkora curry is best eaten with rice. Though Sylhetis are mainly rice and fish eaters, their culinary system is distinctly different to non-Sylhetis. Multicultural people of Barak Valley to Surma valley, and the Sylheti diaspora have influenced the Sylheti food and flavours practiced for ages. Among them, the culinary system of Khasi, Kuki and other tribes are noteworthy. The cuisine of Sylhet has grown up depending on the availability of plants and animals in the region. Mainly indigenous with some variety, food culture is performed among the Sylhetis that received some external influences as well. When the 360 disciples of Shah Jalal arrived in this region, they not only brought their distinct cultures but also brought distinct cooking styles of their own. Which included many meat dishes along with chicken, beef and goat cooked Mughlai, Middle-Eastern, and Northern Indian style. Mughlai Porota, Pilau, Korma, Kalia, Roast, Biriyani and Kofta for curry dishes while Zardah, Firni and Kheer for desserts have been also included. In London, in the 1940s some entrepreneurial Sylhetis began setting up caf√©s and introduced curry and rice to the menu. But lack of confidence saw the Bangladeshis refer to their food as Indian. In the United Kingdom, more than 8 out of 10 Indian restaurants are owned by Bangladeshis, 95% of which come from Sylhet. Sylhet is not known for its cuisine, though 80% to 90% British curry-house trace their roots directly to Sylhet. Chefs from Sylhet region developed the British curry to a greater extent since the 1960s. Chicken tikka masala, invented by the Sylhetis is regarded as Britain's National dish since 2001, by Britain‚Äôs foreign secretary Robin Cook. The birthday celebration of the British Prime Minister Tony Blair's daughter at a Bangladeshi restaurant proves the popularity of Sylheti cuisine. Historian Lizzie Collingham, in her 2005 book Curry: A Biography, coined that the Sylheti curry cooks converted ‚Äúunadventurous British palates‚Äù to a new flavour spectrum. == Rice == Traditional Sylheti diet Most of the Bangladeshi people are accustomed to eating Una Bhat (boiled rice), except the Chitagonian and Sylhetis. In Sylhet region, the notable rices are Aush, Aman, Boro, Eri, Biroin, Kalojira, Sonali Jira etc. Ala Bhat (Atop rice) is the staple food of the Sylhetis. Atop rice is a little sticky and delicious. They also prefer glutinous rice to make different delicacy. Research found that Sylheti rice has a lower arsenic concentration than similar types of rice from other regions of Bangladesh. According to the journal Biomedical Spectroscopy and Imaging, the Sylheti rice contained higher amounts of the essential nutrients selenium and zinc. Several varieties of Sylheti aromatic rice are also lower arsenic contaminated than the well-known Basmati aromatic rice from India and Pakistan. ===Akhni === Akhni is a mixed rice dish made of ghee, meat, vegetables etc. It is known as Akhni Birani and Akhni Fulaw as it is considered to be a particular variation of biryani or polao. It is a popular dish in the month of Ramadan, and any special occasion. === Biroin Bhat === Biroin Bhat is one type of glutinous rice popular in Sylhet region. There is a special type of red-and-white sticky aromatic Biroin Rice is found only in the Sylhet region. This aromatic biroin chaul is cooked and eaten with fried fish, meat or kebab, khirshah rasmalai, date molasses etc. Biroin Chal is an organic rice cultivated in the highland of Sylhet and Chottogram. It is the main ingredients for Chunga Pitha, a traditional rice cake in the Sylhet region. === Kisuri === Soft Kisuri or simply Kisuri is one kind of rice-based meal which is similar in consistency to porridge. It is a traditional food in Sylheti cuisine. During the holy month of Ramadan, it is served most dinner tables as a staple food for iftar. To cook Kisuri aromatic rice mixing with various spices including ghee, kalozira and fenugreek is used. There are two types of Soft Khichuri; white soft khichuri (jau/zau) and yellow soft khichuri (kisuri). == Meat == Curries made with pastes of fresh and dried chillies, roots and spices are very favourite to Sylhetis. === Beef Hatkora === Beef Hatkora is curry cooking by Hatkora, a special citrus fruit with beef. It is a very famous dish at the time of Eid-ul-Adha festival. The cooking style of Sylheti Hatkora is not same the cooking system of Bangladeshis at all. Both of its taste and aroma are different from all other Bangladeshi cuisine. This fruit is commonly used in Sylheti curries. Not only a popular khatta or Tenga curry is made with the bones of cow feet and Hatkora but also different kinds of meat is used as well. === Chicken tikka masala === Chicken tikka masala is composed of chicken tikka, boneless chunks of chicken marinated in spices and yogurt. A sauce is usually creamy and orange-coloured is used to cook this curry. The Multicultural Handbook of Food, Nutrition and Dietetics credits its creation to Bangladeshi migrant chefs in the 1960s. Chicken tikka masala is served in restaurants around the world. === Aash Bash === Aash Bash is one kind of curry made of duck and bamboo shoot. Though it is not as common in all areas as a curry, it is one of the traditional and delicious dishes in Sylheti cuisine. This dish is eaten with rice or Tandoor bread. Aash Bash curry is less spicy in taste. === Phall === Phall is a British Asian curry which was originated in the British Bangladeshi-owned curry-houses. It is hotter than vindaloo. This dish is a tomato-based thick curry which includes ginger and fennel seeds optionally. == Fish == mashed vegetables Different types of fish curries is available in Sylheti cuisine. Fish is eaten both curry and fried. Dried and fermented fish called Hutki, and Hatkora, a bitter and fragrant citrus fruit are used for cooking curries. Even the extremely hot Naga Morich is used with broths. The most savored local cuisines include Hidol or fermented fish chutney, Hutki Shira or dried fish curry, and various freshwater fish indigenous to this region. It is thought by the locals that excessive spicy hotness of Hidol Chutney is a remedy for colds and headaches. === Hutki Shira === Hutki Shira is a fermented fish curry made of vegetables, leafy greens and fish or prawns. It is curry without oil or fat. This dish varies on the availability of seasonal vegetables. Traditionally, hidol is used to cook the curry. === Thoikor Tenga === Thoikor Tenga is a curry dish and very popular in Sylhet. Thoikor is an citrus fruit, it is found almost all over the year in the Sylhet region like Hatkora. It is cooked with small fish. == Delicacy and savory == Fob === Bakarkhani === Sylhety Bakarkhani is completely different from the variants of Dhaka. Dhakai Bakarkhani is a somewhat cookie type snack, where the Sylheti bakarkhani resembles paratha a lot. Bakarkhani is an Iftar item in Sylhet. It is also eaten with tea at night during the month of ramadan. Sylheti Bakharkhani can be tasted as savoury or slightly sweet, leavened or unleavened, soft or crisp. According to a hearsay, Bakarkhani was invented in the middle of the 18th century. It is believed that Bakarkhani was first made by the people of Sylhet. Sylhetis learnt making Bakarkhani from the Afghans who stayed in Sylhet after defeated by the Mughals in 1612. Later many Sylhetis came to Dhaka and started making Bakarkhani commercially. At present most of the of Dhaka's bakarkhani sellers are from the Sylhet Division. === Biscuits === From the second half of the 19th century, Europeans and Muslims introduced biscuits and loaves in the Sylhet region that attracted the Muslim community highly. It gained popularity by the Hindus much more later. === Handesh === Handesh is a sweet and puffy deep- fried snack made of molasses or sugar and flour. It is also known as teler pitha. It is often eaten with tea as a snack. It is very famous on special occasions such as naming ceremonies and wedding festivities and at the time of Eid festival of the Sylhetis. === Nunor Bora === Nunor Bora also known as Nungora is a savoury rice flour snack. It is made of onion, ginger and turmeric that gives the snack its golden appearance. It is eaten with tea as a snack and is very popular at the time of Eid festival to the Sylhetis. Nunor Bora can be stored in a fridge for a later usage without frying. === Sunga Pitha === Sunga Fita is a traditional rice cake (pitha).

They entered service from the middle of 1971 and were classified as MEE-5, where M = Meter-gauge, E = Diesel-electric, E = English-electric and 5 = 5√ó100 hp = 500 hp. ==Description== 3118 in Chittagong in March 2003 The Class 3100s were ordered by the Pakistan Eastern Railway in 1971, that became the Bangladesh Railway. They were of the hood type with a full-width driving cab at one end. The very short overall length of helps visibility in the restricted loading gauge. The locomotive is carried on two cast-steel bogies designed to negotiate curves of radius. A direct-coupled DC generator transmits power from a four-cylinder pressure-charged engine to four axle-hung traction motors which drive the wheels through straight spur gears. The fabricated underframe designed to meet the buffing load requirement has solebars of rolled steel section deep, with main cross-members at bogie pivots, engine and generator mountings. The whole surface of the underframe is enclosed by steel plate, with platform and steps surfaced with non-slip tread. ABC couplers and drawgear are mounted at a height of ) from the rail. The underframe carries a fuel tank and sand boxes serving the four outer wheels through pneumatic ejectors. The steel hood unit is divided into four compartments housing radiator, ancillary equipment, engine and generator, each having weather-sealed removable or hinged access hatches. Steps up from the rail provide access to both side platforms, which are fitted with handrails along the hood side; outward-opening aluminium doors in the cab front panels give access to the cab from the platform plates. The interior of the cab roof is insulated and lined and a ventilating fan is provided. Driving controls are duplicated at each side of a central driver's desk, which also contains a range of instruments and surmounts the main control-gear cubicle. Two upholstered seats hinged from the cab sides, windscreen wipers and sun visors are provided. Each bogie is a one-piece cast steel H frame with primary suspension consisting of coil springs in pockets above the axleboxes. Hydraulic dampers are fitted, but neither secondary suspension nor bogie intercoupling were considered necessary for a low-speed locomotive operating on shunting and transfer duties. Westinghouse air operated brake gear is fitted and wheels are of rolled steel solid type. The English Electric 4SRKT MkII four-cylinder turbocharged diesel engine, normally rated at at 850rpm, is set to to suit the hot, humid conditions normal in this service. It is unit- mounted with a Type EE824 six-pole DC generator continuously rated at 600A at 530V. The fabricated rolled steel frame incorporates battery field, commutating and starting windings. Class F insulation is used for main fields and Class H insulation is used both for the interpoles and the armature. The commutator uses silver-bearing copper segments with mica splitters on epoxy- glass insulated Vee rings. A bulkhead across the generator forms a separate generator compartment, which houses an auxiliary control gear cubicle next to the cab. The radiator compartment houses a single radiator panel comprising both cooling water and lubricating oil sections. The radiator fan is mounted integrally behind the panel and is directly belt-driven from an engine-shaft extension. The fan draws air through the radiator panel discharging it through grilled openings in the compartment sides. A water tank of capacity, with level gauge and low-water warning device, is mounted in the roof. The ancillary compartment houses a Westinghouse E25B compressor unit and combined auxiliary generator and traction motor blower unit, both of which are belt- driven from a pulley on the radiator fan drive-shaft. A vacuum exhauster also located in this compartment is electrically driven. Ventilation louvres and thick gel-oil-wetted metal filters are mounted on the generator and ancillary equipment side doors. The engine draws air through these primary filters and then through a secondary dry panel filter mounted on the bulkhead. The blower unit draws air from the filters in the panel sides feeding it to the four traction motors through ducts and flexible bellows. The main generator discharges air into the engine room. The engine crankcase breather is piped to the engine compartment roof, where the engine exhaust also discharges after passing through the turbocharger. The four Type EE549 four-pole traction motors, continuously rated at 300A, 265V, 474rpm, are axle-hung in sleeve bearings and nose suspended by springs. Class H insulation is used for both field and armature windings. The control system is based on the very simple, robust and reliable equipment originated by English Electric, as is fitted to over 1500 diesel-electric shunting locomotives in service in various countries. Engine shutdown occurs if water temperature becomes too high or coolant level is too low, oil pressure is too low or engine overspeeds. Traction motor overload is prevented by relays which open if maximum current is exceeded. Automatic wheelslip is controlled by a relay which de-energises the governor override solenoid, bringing the load regulator towards minimum field. There is also provision for automatic sanding under slip conditions.EE- AEI metre-gauge diesels for light track in Pakistan Modern Railways April 1971Pakistan Eastern buys 500hp metre-gauge shunters Railway Gazette International March 1971 ==Usage== These 26 locomotives were only used for shunting purpose.

Its range borders that of the smooth newt (L. vulgaris), the Greek smooth newt (L. graecus) and Kosswig's smooth newt (L. kosswigi) to the north, west, and east, respectively. Christopher Raxworthy described the species in 1988 as Triturus vulgaris schmidtleri, a subspecies of the smooth newt. After genetic data had suggested the smooth newt was a complex of distinct lineages, Pabijan and colleagues recognised Schmidtler's smooth newt as distinct species in 2017. This was followed by subsequent authors. The species differs from other species in the smooth newt species complex mainly in the male secondary characters during breeding season. It is overall very similar to the smooth newt but rather small, with males reaching length. The dorsal crest reaches 2 mm or more in height and is denticulated. The tail end is elongated but does not have a filament as in the neighbouring Kosswig's smooth newt. There body is slightly square-shaped but has no dorso- lateral folds. Toe flaps are only weakly developed. Paedomorphic adults have been reported for Schmidtler's smooth newt. The species's conservation status has not yet been evaluated separately from the smooth newt by the IUCN. Since its range is much smaller than that of the smooth newt species complex as a whole, it is likely to be more vulnerable than previously estimated. ==References== Category:Lissotriton Category:Amphibians of Europe Category:Amphibians of Turkey Category:Amphibians described in 1988 ","title":"Schmidtler's smooth newt"},{"id":"63766621","text":"Luis Jos√© Rueda Aparicio (born 3 March 1962) is a Colombian prelate who is Archbishop of Bogot√°.

It ended with the defeat of the interventionist troops and its retreat. ==Background== Sent by Tsar Vasily Shuisky, who was besieged in Moscow, Prince Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky entered into a Russian‚ÄìSwedish Alliance in northern Russia, attracted an army of Swedish mercenaries to the side of Russia, and also assembled a Russian army. After the advance detachment, led by Fedor Chulkov and Evert Horn, defeated the intervention detachment, led by Jan Kernozitsky, at the Battle of Toropets, the Russian and Swedish armies marched from Novgorod and marched to Torzhok. The strategically important city itself was \\"deposited\\" from the impostor, and its wooden fortress was occupied by the 4,000-strong Russian‚ÄìSwedish detachment of Kornila Cheglokov, Klaus Boy and Otto Gelmer who had been sent in advance. Later, 1,000 warriors of Semyon Golovin and Evert Horn joined them. The 13-thousand army of interventionists, pulled together under Torzhok in order to prevent the advance of Skopin-Shuisky's army to Moscow, consisted of an 8-thousand detachment of Kernozitsky (2 thousand Polish hussars, as well as 6 thousand Zaporozhian Cossacks and Tushins), two thousand Polish lancers of Zborowski, one thousand cavalry under the command of the Tushino governor Grigory Shakhovsky, as well as two thousand warriors from other Polish regiments. However, by the time of the battle near Torzhok, the interventionists managed to bring less than half of their troops to the city. ==Course of the battle== Zborovsky, who led the army of interventionists, tried to immediately take the city, but failed to do this because of the resistance of the garrison. The fire that arose in the wooden Kremlin was put out. To help Torzhok's garrison, a detachment of Golovin and Horn arrived. After that, the troops lined up against each other in battle formations. Zborowski began the battle with a massive attack of three companies of heavy armored cavalry. Two of them came across a deep phalanx of German infantrymen, bristling with long spears, and were forced to retreat, suffering heavy losses. However, the third company of attackers managed to crush the Russian and Swedish cavalry on the flank and drive it to the city walls. But the timely sortie from the city of governor Kornila Cheglokov helped restore the situation and allowed the retreating Russian-Swedish cavalry, together with the ripened forces, to launch a counterattack. The interventionists were forced to leave the battlefield. Having learned from the prisoners about the advance of a large army of Skopin-Shuisky, Zborovsky decided to retreat to Tver. ==Aftermath== Despite Jan Pyotr Sapieha's victorious reports about the large Russian‚ÄìSwedish losses, the tactical situation spoke of the defeat of the interventionists. Having retreated to Tver, Zborovsky did not fulfill the task assigned to him ‚Äì the capture of Torzhok and consolidation in it in order to block the way to the main forces of Skopin-Shuisky. Polish losses were unexpectedly large. It also became clear that the heavily organized cavalry was opposed by a well-organized and armed army capable of repelling its attacks in field battles. Large military formations were sent to help Zborovsky near Tver, which indicated great concern in the camp of the interventionists. In Torzhok, meanwhile, the main army of Skopin-Shuisky and De la Gardie gradually gathered. From Smolensk came Prince Yakov Baryatinsky, sent by the governor Mikhail Shein, with four thousand warriors. Having formed regiments from the Russian-Swedish army, Skopin-Shuisky after some time marched in the direction of Tver, under the walls of which the Battle of Tver took place. ==See also== *De la Gardie campaign ==Sources== *Vadim Kargalov.

Founded in 2009 and based in Buenos Aires, it is the regional network of the Climate Action Network and considered a \\"node\\" helping to collaborate in the Latin American and Caribbean region. It links over 30 non-governmental organisations, which are engaged in climate justice issues and active against climate change (as of 25 April 2020). == Structure == The regional network is composed of more than 30 organizations from different countries in Latin America. Currently, it is coordinated by Alejandro Aleman from the Nicaraguan organisation Centro Humboldt (as of 25 April 2020). Within CAN International, there is a regional officer. At the moment Karla Maass hold this position (as of 25 April 2020). Member organisations of CAN-LA are located in: * Argentina * Barbados * Bolivia * Brazil * Chile * Colombia * Haiti * Honduras * Mexico * Nicaragua * Paraguay * Peru * United States (Ciudadn√≠a Sustentable frente al Cambio Climatico, A.C.) * Uruguay * Venezuela == Activities == The regional node tries to foster networks between different organisations working in Central and Latin America. The organisation's reasoning behind it is that through collaboration, the organisations can more easily further the cause of climate justice. One of the most important functions of the organisation is Latin American representation at UN climate conferences. Delegates of CAN-LA attend the climate negotiations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). They are present at the conferences of the parties (COP) and the intersessionals in Bonn. Since COP20 in 2014, they have press conferences to inform the public about their views. During COPs, they organise side events where they can set their own agenda and invite panelists. They also inform the public and publish reports, analyses and comments, for example in the Chilean newspaper \\"El d√≠namo\\". Before COP23, the network organised a webinar called \\"Camino a la COP23: Una visi√≥n desde Am√©rica Latina y el Caribe\\". After COP25, they wrote a report about their view on the negotiations and reflecting on the outcome. That the climate conference in 2019 was moved from Chile to Spain was considered a missed opportunity for Latin America, not only because many representatives could not be present, but also because a bigger cohesion within the region was not reached. They reacted to the postponement of COP26 due to the COVID-19 pandemic with a common declaration highlighting that the health crisis is connected to the bigger ecological crisis and the most vulnerable communities are affected the most by both crises. == References == == External links == * CAN-LA at the website of Climate Action Network * Twitter-Account of CAN-LA Category:Environmental organisations based in Argentina Category:International climate change organizations ","title":"Climate Action Network Latin America"},{"id":"63766900","text":"Shiv Sampati Ram is an Indian politician.

She currently works as a metadesign researcher and Associate Lecturer in Design Writing at Goldsmiths, University of London; as a Senior Lecturer, Head of Contextual Practices, and Director of the Metadesign Research Centre (MRC) at Swansea College of Art, University of Wales Trinity Saint David; and also as a design and language consultant to several educational institutions internationally. == Education == Lockheart was awarded her Ph.D from the Design Department of Goldsmiths, University of London, in 2016. Her thesis was on the subject of collaborative writing as a tool for design teams at Master's degree-level in higher education. She holds a Master of Arts (MA) in Teaching English as a second or foreign language (TESOL) from the Institute of Education, University of London. and an MA in Fine Art from Manchester Metropolitan University. She completed her Bachelor of Arts (BA, Honours) in Fine Art from Saint Martins School of Art, University of the Arts London; and her Foundation Diploma in Art and Design at the Stourbridge School of Art, Design and Technology. She also holds a Certificate in Teaching Learners with Specific Learning Difficulties (Dyslexia) from OCR at University College London's Centre for Human Communication; and an Adult Education Teaching Certificate in English as a second or foreign language (EFL) at Morley College in London. == Career == Julia Lockheart is a British artist and university academic. Her artistic practice concerns the depiction of dreams in artworks that then enable the sharing of the dream with others. This has led to research on the relationship of sharing dreams to empathy. Her other research strand focuses on writing in art and design, for which she is the co-founder and Director of the Writing- PAD network and co-founder and co-editor of the Journal of Writing in Creative Practice (published by Intellect Books). She currently works as a metadesign researcher and Associate Lecturer in Design Writing at Goldsmiths, University of London; as a Senior Lecturer, Head of Contextual Practices, and Director of the Metadesign Research Centre (MRC) at Swansea College of Art, University of Wales Trinity Saint David; and also as a design and language consultant to several educational institutions internationally. Lockheart is a member of the National Association of Writers in Education, the Staff and Educational Development Association, and The Idries Shah Foundation, formerly The Institute for Cultural Research; Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, and Senior Fellow of the Higher Education Academy. == The Coldstream Reports == In 2018, Lockheart published an important academic paper, \\"The importance of writing as a material practice for art and design students: A contemporary rereading of the Coldstream Reports\\". William Coldstream was an English realist painter and art teacher, and from 1959 he was Chairman of the National Advisory Council on Art Education. In 1960, the council published its first report, named after Coldstrean, which proposed and set out requirements for a new Diploma in Art and Design (Dip.A.D.), such as written essays and written examinations, and \\"helped to change the structure of art school teaching in Britain\\". According to the study carried out by Lockheart, and her own experience as a practitioner or studio artist ‚Äì rather than a theorist ‚Äì however, the recommendation of academic writing for practitioners contained in the Coldstream Reports were misread and, as a result, strong and ‚Äì according to Lockheart, unfounded ‚Äì beliefs were formed among academics and those in managerial positions throughout the Higher Education (HE) sector. Lockheart posits that \\"upholding these institutional assumptions may have an impact on how writing is used as a component of examination and therefore aligned with the need for academic parity across the HE sector, rather than as a tool for understanding and articulating practice.\\" \\"As a result,\\" she continues, \\"this article calls for the reinstatement of a unified HE art and design curriculum to be filled with a diversity of pedagogical [teaching] approaches, including writing practices, that are complementary to and inform the purposes of creative practice.\\" As a result of this controversial mis-reading of the first report and a later report published in 1970, in 1970 \\"the Department of Education and Science ... recommended the humanities style academic thesis or dissertation as a part of the move from the [old] Diploma in Design to ...\\" the new Diploma in Art and Design (Dip.A.D.), and these mis-readings have \\"caused writing to be used as an examinable measure rather than as a tool for learning\\", to its detriment. === Academic literacies === In a paper co-written with G. Melles in 2012, titled \\"Writing PAD: Writing purposefully in art and design: Responding to converging and diverging new academic literacies\\", Lockheart argues that while academic literacies and writing practices are well-established in older, traditional academic disciplines, more recent disciplines such as art and design have been forced to adopt these existing academic practices or to justify their own distinctive practices, and this has been a contentious issue in the discipline of art and design (which includes diverse fields, each with their differences and their own requirements, such as fine art, graphic design and fashion design). It is in this spirit that Lockheart teaches Contextual Practice, and primarily for this reason that she co-founded an academic network, Writing-PAD, to provide a platform for these new ideas and practices (see below). == Writing-PAD and Journal of Writing in Creative Practice == Lockheart is also director and co-ordinator of Writing- PAD ‚Äì short for Writing Purposefully in Art and Design ‚Äì an online academic and research network connecting over 100 institutions. Writing-PAD grew out of Lockheart's interest in a correct interpretation and implementation of the Coldsteam Reports and in academic literacies, and was specifically set-up \\"to support and disseminate the range of genres associated with writing in art and design;\\" and also \\"to promote discussion about the necessary balance of consensus and dissensus that art and design fields require to remain vibrant.\\" Lockheart is also co-editor of the Journal of Writing in Creative Practice, which she co-founded with Goldsmiths' Emeritus Professor and University of Wales Trinity Saint David's Professor of Practice, John Wood. The JWCP, too, grew out of the contentious re-reading of the Coldstream Reports, and also out of the Writing-PAD international network, and is its \\"published voice\\" ‚Äì as did the later project \\"DreamsID\\" (see below). == DreamsID == Interpretation of a dream of being attacked.DreamsID (short for \\"Dreams Illustrated and Discussed\\" or \\"Dreams Interpreted and Drawn\\") is a practical, collaborative project between Lockheart and research psychologist, Professor Mark Blagrove. They hold 50‚Äì60 minute sessions with the dream subject and an invited audience, and while the subject shares their dream, with Blagrove helping to facilitate and visualize the dream narrative, Lockheart draws and paints the dream, in real-time, on a torn-out page from Sigmund Freud's book, The Interpretation of Dreams, to create \\"a tapestry of elements, plot, metaphoric imagery, and Freud's words.\\" Then, later in the session, the audience is invited to join in the discussion, referencing the dream to waking life, according to the method devised by psychiatrist Montague Ullman. Interpretation of a dream of flying.In the course of the sessions, Lockheart and Blagrove began to notice that the sharing of the dreams and the discussions were having an effect not only on them but on some of the audience, and that the sessions were invoking empathy toward the subjects sharing their dreams. As a result of this, the collaborators went on to co- author an important scientific paper, \\"Testing the Empathy Theory of Dreaming: The Relationships Between Dream Sharing and Trait and State Empathy\\", which was later published in Frontiers in Psychology. In April 2019, the BBC World Service Television programme CrowdScience broadcast a segment in which Lockheart is shown painting as a candidate shares her dream. In April 2020, Lockheart's artwork was featured in a New Scientist article on how the COVID-19 pandemic was affecting people's dreams. == Selected publications== Lockheart has published several papers in academic and research journals, given a number of conference presentations, and held many workshops. She has also given numerous public performances, on subjects such as dreams and nightmares, and her interpretations of the psychiatrist Sigmund Freud's book, The Interpretations of Dreams, and drawn and painted dream interpretations in real-time for the \\"DreamsID\\" project (above). === Print publications / chapters === * Chapter 10: Edwards, H. and Lockheart, J.

It occurs from sea level to elevation. Willy Wolterstorff described the species in 1914 as Triton vulgaris subsp. typica forma lantzi, a form of the smooth newt (now Lissotriton vulgaris), and it was later raised to subspecies rank. After genetic data had suggested the smooth newt was a complex of distinct lineages, Dubois and Raffa√´lli, in 2009, recognised several subspecies, including the Caucasian smooth newt, as distinct species. This was followed by subsequent authors. The species differs from other species in the smooth newt species complex mainly in the male secondary characters during breeding season. The dorsal crest in males reaches 1 mm or more in height and has an almost spine-shaped denticulation. The tail gradually elongates into a fine thread but has no distinct filament. The body is slightly square-shaped but has no dorso-lateral folds. Toe flaps are moderately developed. Paedomorphic adults have been recorded for the Caucasian smooth newt. The species's conservation status has not yet been evaluated separately from the smooth newt by the IUCN. Since its range is much smaller than that of the smooth newt species complex as a whole, it is likely to be more vulnerable than previously estimated. In Armenia, Azerbaijan and northeastern Turkey, it is potentially extinct. It is listed in the Red Data Books of Russia and the majority of its North Caucasus provinces and autonomous republics. Destruction of aquatic habitats, deforestation, collection for the pet trade and the introduction of fish were cited as threats. ==References== Category:Lissotriton Category:Amphibians of Russia Category:Amphibians described in 1914 ","title":"Caucasian smooth newt"},{"id":"63767152","text":"The 9th Legion is a legion of the Korean People's Army.

In 1993, the Legion Political Commissioner began to enlist officers such as the Bowie and Politicians to coup. On the Lunar New Year in 1994, the Legion General rejected their proposal and died on January 2nd. When the corps commander died suddenly, in March 1994, General Kim Young-chun, the general secretary-general of the country, was dispatched to serve as corps commander. Coup mock members used the border to collect dollars through trade projects to raise funds for the coup without the sergeant's command. The coup mock was discovered in April 1995 following the investigation by the People's Security Agency for the distribution of dollars, and the leaders were arrested as Kim Young-chun attracted a coup meeting at the Iwon Airport in Hamgyeongnam-do. Some 40 officers of the Legion were executed, some of whom were killed in the hands of Captain Jang Seong-taek, chief of the Central Party. Thereafter, the 24th Division under the 6th Corps exchanged the 34th Division under the 5th Corps, and was renamed the 9th Corps to erase the 6th Corps, which became the pronoun of rebellion.

They left en masse as French citizens at the end of the Algerian war and settled mostly in the south of France. Although French, the Pieds-Noirs were largely descended from Spanish, Italian and Maltese settlers as well as French. They have nevertheless remained for the most part fiercely loyal to France throughout the history of French Algeria and its aftermath. There have, however, been occasional expressions of autonomism and even separatism, particularly around the fall of the Second Empire and again at the fall of French rule in Algeria. ==Provisional government== The Gouvernement provisoire Pied-Noir en exil was created on 1 October 2016 in Montpellier by a small group of veteran Pied-Noir activists in response to what they saw as marginalization by successive French governments. A written constitution was formalised the following year in Nice. This document outlines the aims of peace and neutrality as well as the basis for Pied-Noir sovereignty as claimed in international law. The GPPNE has expressed a desire for membership of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization and even to acquire a territory in the Mediterranean region, although they have made no specific territorial claims. ==See also== * Volkstaat ==References== Category:Governments in exile Category:2016 establishments in France Category:Political organizations based in France Category:Secessionist organizations Category:Micronations in France ","title":"Etat Pied-Noir"},{"id":"63767286","text":"The 2017‚Äì18 Liga IV Olt was the 50th season of the Liga IV Olt, the fourth tier of the Romanian football league system.

Although both ships were frigates, Bellone belonged to the Iphig√©nie class and was a comparatively large frigate for her time, carrying a battery of 18-pounder long guns, while Coventry was a sixth- rate armed only with 9-pounder long guns. Furthermore, Bellone had the advantage of the wind. The nominal crew of Coventry was about tho thirds of that of Bellone, but in the occasion it was reinforced by the troops she was carrying. In spite of these overwhelming odds, Coventry managed to inflict heavy casualties on Bellone, and most decisively to shoot most of the senior staff. The resulting confusion on Bellone allowed Coventry to escape to Madras. == Background == The War of American Independence triggered an Anglo- French War from 1778 and, by extension, a Fourth Anglo-Dutch War from 1780 when the Dutch Republic refuse to stop trading with enemies of Britain. This aligned French and Dutch interests in the Indian Ocean theatre. France had a base of operation at Isle de France (Mauritius) and was allied with Hyder Ali, while the Dutch were holding the Dutch Cape Colony. France sent convoys escorted by ships of the line to reinforce these outpost. The French consolidated squadrons from Pondicherry, Isle de France and those escorting the convoys into a force numbering 15 ships of the line and several frigates, first under Estienne d'Orves and, after he died, under Suffren. This fleet was opposed to an equivalent British force under Admiral Edward Hughes. In August 1782, Suffren and Hughes had already fought three inconclusive actions at Sadras on 17 February 1782, Providien on 12 April and Negapatam on 6 July, and were positioning for their fourth encounter at Trincomalee, that was to flare up on 25 August and last until 3 September. In late July, Suffren's squadron was at Cuddalore for a high-level meeting with Hyder Ali in neighbouring Bahour. Suffren sent his light ships to recon Trincomalee; informed that the British fleet was not in harbour, he decided to sail there himself and land troops and attempt to conquer the city. The French squadron left Cuddalore on 2 August 1782 and progressed towards Batacalo. Suffren detached Bellone with orders to sail first and Batacalo and then Galle, where French captain Aymar was waiting for him with the 74-gun Illustre, the 64-gun Saint Michel and 8 transports carrying troops and supplies. Bellone had a new captain, Pierrevert, who was a nephew to Suffren; he had replaced the former captain, Jean Andr√© de Pas de Beaulieu, promoted to the command of the 64-gun Brillant during Suffren's reshuffling of his captains in the wake of the Battle of Negapatam. == Battle == On 12 August, as the French squadron had arrived at Batacalo and was anchored in the bay, HMS Coventry sailed in the South-East of the harbour, ferrying troops to Madras. Vengeur and Art√©sien attempted to chase to investigate, but soon lost contact and returned to the fleet. Meanwhile, Bellone had her mainmast damaged by a gust of wind off Ceylon and was sailing to Batacalo for repairs. The two ships met near Friar's Hood. Bellone had the advantage of the wind and was a much stronger frigate than Coventry. However, Pierrevert made the mistake of stopping his frigate and letting Coventry approach, allowing Mitchell to close to pistol range and open fire with grapeshot and musketry. This caused heavy casualties on Bellone, and soon mortally wounded Pierrevert himself. As the first officer took over, second officer Boucher started arguing that he was the one who should take command, due to a regulation barring foreigners to command French warships, and since the first officer was of Italian origin. As they argued, fire from Coventry killed Boucher and gravely wounded the first officer. The third officer took over but, lacking experience, he failed to gain the confidence of his crew and was unable to prevent Coventry's escape. Bellone sustained 60 men killed or wounded. == Aftermath == The battle lasted 2 hours, killing or wounding about 60 French and 50 British. Coventry, her rigging badly damaged, limped back to Madras. Hughes had hoped to set sail around 15 August, but it was not until 22 that he was ready to depart. The delay allowed Suffren to lay siege to Trincomalee, where Fort Ostenburg fell on 30. Suffren restored Beaulieu as captain of Bellone, and replaced him on Brillant with Lieutenant de Kersauson. Coventry would eventually be captured on 12 January 1783, when her new captain, William Wolseley, mistook four French ships of the line for British East Indiamen. == See also == * Action of 14 December 1798, a similarly unbalanced action between the French 24-gun corvette Bayonnaise and the British 32-gun frigate Ambuscade.

As a lieutenant, he fought at the Battle of the Nile in 1798 and the Siege of Acre in 1799. Promoted to the rank of commander on 14 February 1801, Brodie is one of two people credited with the command of at the Battle of Copenhagen in April. Promoted to captain in 1802, Brodie spent some time in charge of a group of Sea Fencibles in south-west Ireland. He commissioned the 38-gun in 1808 and served in her in the Mediterranean and West Indies. Brodie died in Jamaica from an unknown illness on 14 March 1811. ==Early life and career== Thomas Charles Brodie was born in 1779. He was the son of William Brodie, a magistrate at the Great Marlborough Street law courts, and the grandson of David Brodie, a Royal Navy officer who fought at the Battle of Porto Bello in 1739 and the Battle of Cartegena in 1741.Hore p.61 Brodie entered the Royal Naval Academy at Portsmouth in 1791, became a midshipman in 1794 and on 17 February 1798, passed his examination for lieutenant. He served in this capacity, aboard , at the Battle of the Nile. At the Siege of Acre, Brodie was in charge of one of the small gunboats that swept the French trenches with flanking fire, helping to repel repeated French assaults on the city. Brodie was promoted to the rank of commander on 14 February 1801. ==Command== Naval historian Peter Hore claims that, on receiving his promotion, Brodie was given command of and took her into the Battle of Copenhagen in April. Many earlier sources, including William Laird ClowesClowes (Vol.IV) p.403 and William James,James (Vol.III) p.67 disagree, recording William Bolton as her captain during this period but Hore insists that this is incorrect and the original source of this \\"mistake\\", Steel's Original and Correct Navy List (1801), was out of date at the time. According to Hore, Arrow log and muster book, held at the National Archives at Kew, bear Brodie's signature from 25 February 1801 and other documents indicate that Bolton was on half pay in England throughout April. At the battle, Arrow was in a squadron of sloops and frigates, under the command of Edward Riou, that attacked the Danish vessels near the harbour mouth.Clowes (Vol.IV) p.432 She was the last to get into position and had to run the entire length of Nelson's line, firing between the ships as she went. Unlike Nelson, Riou obeyed Hyde Parker's famous signal, and had his squadron withdraw.Clowes (Vol.IV) pp.435-436 Most of his force had been badly mauled by the shore batteries, having been exposed to fire for up to 2 hours but Arrow escaped serious damage, having only just arrived to drop anchor and let off a single salvo. Brodie was made captain in 1802. He spent some time in command of the Sea Fencibles, that operated between Sheep's Head and Dursey Island in County Cork, before commissioning the newly built in 1808 for service in the Mediterranean and West Indies. Later that year, on 3 October, she captured Dix Sept Decembre. On 17 January 1810, Hyperion in company with and the gun-brig , recaptured the merchant ship, Tom. ==Capture and death== Brodie was captured and held prisoner while visiting Haiti in 1811. The ship was being resupplied at Gonaives when an English merchant asked for Brodie's protection. Shortly after, the shore batteries unexpectedly fired upon Hyperion boats. Three people were killed and Brodie and two other officers were taken prisoner. They were released the following day after the first lieutenant had Hyperion beat up a narrow channel and present its broadside to the town.Hore pp.61-62 A few weeks later, Brodie was in Jamaica where, on 14 March, he died from a mystery illness.

Two decades later. these remains were identified as belonging to a distinct North American taxon, new to science. In 2020, they were named and described by Mexican paleontologists Claudia In√©s Serrano-Bra√±as, Belinda Espinosa-Ch√°vez, Sarah Augusta Maccracken, Cirene Guti√©rrez-Blando, Claudio de Le√≥n-D√°vila and Jos√© Flores Ventura as the type species Paraxenisaurus normalensis. The generic name is derived from the Greek par√°xenos, \\"strange\\". The specific name is after the Benem√©rita Escuela Normal de Coahuila, a teacher training institution, where the fossils had been deposited. They include the holotype BENC 2/2-001, a partial skeleton lacking the skull. Four additional specimens were referred, from separate individuals. The material contains vertebrae of the backbone, as well as a thighbone, an astragalus and hand and foot elements. == Description == Based on the fossil elements of the holotype, the specimen was an adult. The length of Paraxenisaurus has been estimated at , and its weight at . == Classification == A phylogenetic analysis recovered Paraxenisaurus as a member of the Deinocheiridae, in a polytomy with Deinocheirus and Garudimimus. It would then represent the first deinocheirid dinosaur found in North America. == Paleoecology == Known from the Cerro del Pueblo Formation, Paraxenisaurus lived alongside Acantholipan, Coahuilaceratops, Latirhinus, and Velafrons, and other undescribed ornithomimosaurs.

After the war, he split from the Communist Party of Great Britain to found the Scottish Communist Party, then left this to form the Scottish Workers Republican Party, calling for an independent Communist Scotland. In 1923, he died aged 44, with his health broken after the long-term effects of imprisonment. His funeral was a mass public event, perhaps the largest ever to be held in Glasgow, with perhaps ten thousand people following the funeral procession. ==The song== The song covers four verses, with the last line of each verse repeated with emphasis in place of a chorus. Henderson's notes indicate the first verse should then be repeated, starting softly and working up to a crescendo. The first verse calls to the listener in different areas of Scotland (\\"Hey, Mac, did ye see him, as ye cam' doon by Gorgie...\\") - before setting the action firmly in Glasgow, with men leaving their work to greet Maclean (\\"Turn oot, Jock and Jimmie, leave your crans and your muckle gantries\\"). In the second, the procession moves through Glasgow, down Argyle Street and London Road, bringing out both Highlanders and Irishmen (\\"the red and the green, lad, we'll wear side by side\\"). The third takes the procession to Glasgow Green, home of many past mass demonstrations. It sets Maclean in his position as a leader (\\"they'll mind what he said here / in Glasgie, oor city - and the haill warld beside\\") and on a level with his contemporaries overseas (\\"Lenin's his fiere, lad, an' Liebknecht's his mate\\"). The fourth moves to a more domestic setting, with the marchers returning to their homes with Maclean's memory (\\"at hame wi' his Glasgie freens, their fame and their pride\\"). It closes with a look to the future, when \\"the red will be worn, my lads, an' Scotland will march again / Noo great John Maclean has come hame tae the Clyde\\". As with much of Henderson's writing, the song is written in a broad Scots register, with flashes of humour - the workmen must rush, because Maclean will be \\"ower thrang tae bide\\", too busy to wait for them. Timothy Neat identified the use of Scots as helping tighten the link between the singer and the audience, and described the poem as \\"at once traditional in form and contemporary in content\\". It was written by Henderson to be performed to a traditional tune, an adaptation of \\"Bonny Glenshee\\", later adapted further as the tune for Scotland the Brave and Freedom Come-All- Ye.http://research.culturalequity.org/get-audio-detailed- recording.do?recordingId=12375# ==Performance and recordings== Henderson wrote the song for a memorial meeting commemorating MacLean in November 1948, the twenty-fifth anniversary of his death.Henderson (2000) p.162 It was sung by William Noble to end the event, following poems by Hugh MacDiarmid, Sydney Goodsir Smith, and Sorley MacLean, and was warmly received, \\"passing in one singing into the musical consciousness of the nation. Morris Blythman, the organiser, described Noble's performance as \\"the first swallow of the folk revival\\". Henderson later performed it as part of the Edinburgh People's Festival Ceilidh in August 1951, which was recorded by Alan Lomax. It was one of the few overtly political pieces performed at the event.http://research.culturalequity.org/get-audio-detailed- recording.do?recordingId=12375 A second recording of Henderson performing the song in London, March 1951, also survives in the Lomax collection.http://research.culturalequity.org/rc-b2/get-audio-detailed- recording.do?recordingId=7164 Later recordings include those by The Clutha (1971), Dick Gaughan (1972), North Sea Gas (2000), and Danny Glover (2008). ==References== Category:Scottish songs Category:Works by Hamish Henderson ","title":"The John Maclean March"},{"id":"63768004","text":"The 1890 Invercargill mayoral election was held on 26 November 1890. ==Results== The following table gives the election results: ==References== Category:1890 elections in New Zealand Category:Mayoral elections in Invercargill ","title":"1890 Invercargill mayoral election"},{"id":"63768021","text":"Sara Papadopoulou (born 16 October 1987) is a Cypriot footballer who plays as a midfielder for First Division club AC Omonia and the Cyprus women's national team. ==References== Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Women's association football midfielders Category:Cypriot women's footballers Category:Cyprus women's international footballers Category:AC Omonia players ","title":"Sara Papadopoulou"},{"id":"63768027","text":"Donnan Plumb (born August 22, 1938) is an American equestrian.

For brewers on the Cerro Ba√∫l mesa \\"Corn and Peruvian pepper-tree berries were used to make the beer, which was drunk from elaborate beakers up to half a gallon in volume.\\" == The brewery == The brewery, which was located on a mountaintop, produced hundreds of gallons of chicha de mole beer every week; it was consumed on a daily basis and as a part of trade negotiations, celebrations, marriages, and funerals. ‚ÄúAround A.D. 1000, the Wari ritualistically abandoned the mesa-top fortress in the Moquega river basin. They brewed one last batch of chicha and drained it before smashing the keros (ceremonial drinking mugs) and setting fire to the brewery, the last building to be torched.‚Äù == Women brewers == Most modern chicha brewers are women, but women like the acllacuna, Inca's chosen women, also brewed in the past. Accounts from Spanish conquerors in the 15th Century described Incan women as master brewers and weavers; the Incans were a successor culture of the Wari. ‚ÄúHistorical accounts relate that Inka chicha was brewed by the ‚Äò‚Äôchosen women‚Äô or aqlla who were given in service as part of the tribute payments of conquered polities.‚Äù Chicha was also an important element in local community rituals and the discovery of brewing and serving vessels among common household possessions showed that families produced chicha as a daily beverage. Because there are parallels between the practiced of the better- known Incas and the earlier Waris, ‚Äúit is very likely that maize beer production during Wari times was already an activity carried out by women, who more than likely were the predecessor of the aqllas.‚Äù An archaeological discovery of a 1,000-year-old brewing facility from the Wari empire, which predates the Incas, showed that women played a crucial role in ancient Andean societies and the Cerro Ba√∫l mesa brewery was staffed by elite women. Researchers found several elegant metal tupu shawl pins in the brewery; pins were not found in other parts in the city.

These alternative story elements serve as the backdrop for up to 16 quests available in the game's single-player format, which delve into extant game lore such as the Fifth Blight or during the fall of the ancient elven capital of Arlathan. Each quest is a self-contained map and lets players re-experience key moments from the main Dragon Age video games, novels, and codex entries. Heroes of Dragon Age allows players to purchase and collect 3D figures of characters called \\"heroes\\" in the game, form them into a squad, and then battle either player or AI-controlled enemies. Robert Purchese from Eurogamer observed that the characters featured in Heroes were \\"pulled from all corners of the Dragon Age lore: good, evil, past, present - even the books are mined for inspiration\\", which include multiple fan favorites and notorious foes from the series. Collectible units range from common types like soldiers and bandits, through to unique characters like Alistair and Morrigan, each with their own traits for the players to consider. Post-launch support for Heroes has increased the number of collectible characters drawing from Dragon Age: Inquisition, which was released in November 2014, as well as other recent media. == Gameplay == A squad of five characters, with the color of each figurine's base indicating the faction and rank of the individual unit. The game functions as a squad-based strategy game with the battles playing out automatically, and the outcome is contingent upon the selection of characters in a five-person party, their abilities and formation on the battlefield, as well as any runes that are buffing the team. Every character has a faction, shown by the colored tile they stand on, and if players who match these in appropriate rows and columns are rewarded with boosted statistics. Players can also tweak a characters statistics based on their placement in the player's squad: characters placed on the back row also gain a higher chance of dealing double damage, while those on the front get bonus health. The fifth character slot is to the side, and is reserved for large units such bears, giant spiders, or towering tree monsters known as Sylvan. When four characters of the same faction are used simultaneously, a faction bonus is granted which is calculated from each individual character's percentages added together. Players may keep multiple squads on hand which are optimized to take down specific types of opponents. The player's characters are sorted into different classes and could level up by accumulating experience points earned in combat, similar to a traditional role-playing video game. Players may choose to combine identical characters in their collection into one amalgamation, which pools their experience points and raises their experience level cap in the process. Players may apply the \\"consume\\" mechanic on up to five redundant or unwanted characters of any kind and absorb them into a preferred favorite character, which in turn appropriates experience points from redundant characters in exchange for the probability of increasing the odds of delivering double-damage critical hits, as well as improving the statistics of another character. In combat, the player's team line up on the left hand side while the opposing team line up on the right hand side. Once a battle has commenced, individual units from both teams will then exchange attacks, with their turns and actions dictated by their statistics and positions, until the entirety of one team is eliminated. Characters with a high initiative score move quickly and will be the first to strike, while slower characters will attack on a lower priority scale but deal more damage per hit. Players may use runes, which are single-use, time-limited power-ups to enhance their chances of success. Runes provide a range of benefits such as buffing the party's overall attack power, help players accumulate experience points or in-game currency faster, or direct individual units to focus their attacks on the opponent's quickest, weakest or most powerful fighters. Players may also engage in player versus player battles, where players win and lose trophies depending on their rate of success. == Development == Heroes of Dragon Age producer Tim Lander disclosed in an interview with Eurogamer that he led a 30-person team at EA Capital Games, and together they spent about a year developing the game prior to launch. He described the game's freemium model as a \\"time versus money thing\\", noting that money only speeds up the time it would take for players to obtain any attractive rewards, and that players do not have pay anything provided they are willing to invest their time into the game. Executive Producer Jeferson Valadares said that the studio wanted to make an accessible strategy RPG which \\"takes full advantage of the Dragon Age universe‚Äôs cool characters and locations.‚Äù Both Lander and Valadares insisted that nothing is locked behind a paywall in the game and that the entirety of the game's content is accessible just through playing. Valadares in particular explained that fairness is very important to the developers, and that \\"players that spend money can just increase their odds of getting rare characters\\". The game does not provide any original story content or story-based tie-in to Inquisition, as EA Capital Games felt that content of that nature is best left to BioWare; instead, the focus for the developers is on gameplay. Lander did not rule out adding any original story content for the game at a future date, noting that the developers would need to work closely with BioWare on that aspect and that any content of that nature would need to \\"make sense\\", and claimed that EA Capital Games employ community managers who actively engage with the player community and canvass for their opinions on solutions to improve their gameplay experience. Lander explained that the developers were committed continue to support Heroes by adding new characters, new features and support over a period of several years, and he was confident that Heroes is a standalone title that he believe players could play for years. ==Reception== Heroes of Dragon Age has received a mixed response from critics, holding a 59/100 rating on Metacritic based on 8 reviews. Kenn Leandre from IGN scored the game 7.8 out of 10, commenting that the game \\"hits all the right notes in not only getting players hooked-up on playing it over and over again\\", but also succeeds in \\"presenting impressive depths in terms of strategy, style of play and character designs\\". Leanre praised Heroes for its quality visuals, engaging battle mechanics, the generous variety of characters available for players at the start of the game, and its booster pack mechanics; conversely, he noted the game's repetitive battles and lack of trading option as among its most prominent weaknesses. Dan Whitehead from Eurogamer explained that while the game's various mechanics suggests that Heroes is about depth and strategy, he observed that it is \\"only true up to a point\\", noting that it is difficult to stay engaged when players have no real input in determining battlefield tactics, and have to leave it to chance. Whitehead felt that \\"it would only take a few more turns of the micro- transaction screw for it to be intolerable\\", and that a \\"more astute understanding of what players want and need (often two different things) can make for a more satisfying, yet no less commercial, free-to-play experience\\". Nevertheless, he observed that the \\"somewhat awkward middle ground\\" as exemplified by games like Heroes represented \\"huge progress for EA's freemium ambitions\\", drawing a comparison to its contemporary, the much-maligned Dungeon Keeper Mobile game and said that Heroes \\"doesn't get it as gruesomely wrong\\". He opined that had the developers put \\"a little more faith in the player's ability to cope with deeper strategy\\", Heroes would have turned out to be \\"a genuinely good game\\". Scott Nichols from Digital Spy drew attention to the game's focus which was \\"squarely on collecting character figurines\\", and concluded that Heroes of Dragon Age will only really appeal to dedicated fans of the series. He observed that \\"collecting and leveling up your figurines can become quite addicting\\", but advised that series fans \\"should set their expectations accordingly before playing, because there is still a long wait until the next proper game in the series\\". Leif Johnson from MacLife said Heroes is a \\"generally entertaining romp through Thedan lore\\", with its Campaigns full of extra information about the world's lore. He praised the visuals and music for providing an authentic ambience, fast-paced battles where the game's \\"consume-and-combine mechanic\\" adds a depth of strategy. He criticized the lack of battle interaction and an overly limiting stamina bar. ==References== ==External links== *Heroes of Dragon Age webpage on the Electronic Arts website Category:2013 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Digital collectible card games Category:Dragon Age Category:Electronic Arts games Category:IOS games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Heroes of Dragon Age"},{"id":"63768670","text":"Alexander Shilov may refer to: * Alexander E.

No members of this gens are mentioned by ancient writers, but a number are known from inscriptions, dating entirely or almost entirely from imperial times, and concentrated in Gaul, Germania, Noricum, and adjacent areas. ==Origin== The nomen Secundinius belongs to a class of gentilicia formed from other names using the suffix ', indicating that it was derived either from the cognomen Secundinus, or from the nomen Secundius.Chase, pp. 125, 126. Both of these in turn derive from Secundus, a name originally given to a second son or second child; Secundinus is a diminutive form. Secundus may originally have been a praenomen, like similar names such as Quintus, Sextus, and Decimus, but in the time of the Republic the masculine form is only encountered as a surname.Chase, pp. 150, 151. ==Praenomina== The main praenomina of the Secundinii were Gaius and Lucius, two of the most common names at every period of Roman history. Only a few examples of other praenomina are found in the inscriptions of this gens, many of which lack praenomina. Also found are Marcus and Sextus, which were common, and Postumus, which was relatively scarce as a praenomen, although common as a surname under the Empire. ==Members== * Secundinia Nepotilla, the wife of Valerius Victor, and the mother of Gaia Valeria Candidida, buried at Cemenelum in Alpes Maritimae in the late first century, with a monument dedicated by her parents.. * Sextus Secundinius, together with his wife, Junia Firmis, built a sepulchre at Virunum in Noricum, dating to the first century, or the first half of the second, for themselves and their children, Mogetius, aged nine, and Sextianus, aged seven.. * Lucius Secundinius Surianus, buried at Flavia Solva in Noricum, aged fifty-one, during the first century, or the first half of the second.. * Postumus Secundinius Maximus, the heir of Tiberius Julius Ingenuus of Virunum, a soldier from the twelfth urban cohort at Rome, in the century of Naevius, who was buried at Rome in the late first or early second century, aged twenty- four years, having served for six years. * Secundinia Severina, the wife of Gaius Sacretius Spectatinus, one of the duumviri jure dicundo at Flavia Solva, who built a sepulchre for himself and his wife at the present site of Grafendorf bei Hartburg, then part of Noricum, dating to the first half of the second century.. * Lucius Secundinius, an officer in the second cohort of an uncertain military unit in AD 135.. * Secundinius Justinus, made an offering to Jupiter Dolichenus, according to an inscription found at the present site of Zeillern, formerly part of Noricum, between the first and third centuries.AEA, 2008, 45. * Secundinius Mercator, buried at Noreia in Noricum between the first and third centuries.. * Secundinius Vibianus, made an offering to the tutelary deity of Noricum at Virunum between the first and third centuries.. * Secundinius Verullus, a centurion in the Legio II Augusta, stationed along Hadrian's Wall in Britain during the middle of the second century..e. * Gaius Secundinius Eutyches, buried at Alba Julia in Dacia during the second century, with a monument dedicated by his wife, Vibia Annia.IDR, iii. 5. 2, 572. * Secundinia Paterna, buried at Rome, aged thirty years, five months, in a second-century tomb built by her husband, Valerius Secularis.. * Gaius Secundinius Sabinianus, made a second-century offering to Silvanus Domesticus at Aquincum in Pannonia Inferior.. * Gaius Secundinius Secundus, one of the aediles at Celeiensium, built a second-century tomb at Ivenna in Noricum for himself and his wife, Materna, the daughter of Vibenus.. * Lucius Secundinius Victor, built a second-century tomb at Fanum Fortunae in Umbria for Clearchus, the slave of Lucius Titius Felix.. * Gaius Secundinius Legitimus, a member of the college of Jupiter Cernenius at Alburnus Major in Dacia, according to an inscription from AD 167.IDR, i. 31. * Secundinius Ursinus, built a tomb at Virunum, dating to the middle or late second century, for himself, his wife, Betautunis, and their granddaughter, Lasciva, aged one year and five months.. * Secundinius Divixtus, one of a number of persons who made offerings to Fortuna at Civitas Alisinensium in Germania Inferior, according to an inscription dating to the second century, or the first half of the third.. * Secundinia Festiva, buried in a tomb byult by Acceptus Senilis at Celeia in Noricum, dating to the second or third century.AIJ, 33. * Secundinius Verus, a soldier stationed at Alexandria in AD 199.. * Secundinius Amantius, a cornicularius, or hornblower, in the Legio XXII Primigenia, who, with the permission of his father, Primulus, made offerings to Sol Invictus, Mithras, and Mars at Mogontiacum in Germania Superior, in the latter half of the second century, or the early part of the third.. * Marcus Secundinius Silvanus, a negotiator, or merchant, dealing in chalk from Britain, who made offerings to Nehalennia at Ganventa in Gallia Belgica, in the latter half of the second century, or the first half of the third., . * Secundinius Serotinus, buried at Abodiacum in Raetia, aged ninety-five years, fifteen days, in the late second century, or first half of the third.. * Gaius Secundinius Dignus, made offerings to Jupiter Optimus Maximus and Juno Regina at the present site of Osterburken, formerly part of Germania Superior, in the late second or early third century.. * Marcus Secundinius Vitalis, a decurion in the Ala I Thracum, along with his wife, Claudia Priscilla, and daughter, Secundinia Vitalina, made an offering to Jupiter Optimus Maximus Depulsor at Poetovio in Pannonia Superior, in the late second or early third century.ILJug, i. 339. * Secundinia M. f.

Pterotermes occidentis is the single species in the genus. This termite lives in the extremely dry conditions found in the Sonoran Desert in southwestern United States, Baja California and Mexico. It feeds on dry wood and lives entirely within a single piece of timber. ==Description== Pterotermes occidentis is the largest drywood termite found in the deserts of southwestern USA. It is a primitive species of termite and the castes are indistinct. The eggs hatch into nymphs which grow into \\"pseudergates\\", which act as workers before developing into either soldiers or winged reproductives. The winged reproductives have large black compound eyes with white eyespots immediately above. The thorax and abdomen are orange and the pronotum is relatively flat and does not curve downwards at the side. The soldiers have a rounded, flat- topped head, large wingbuds, and a massive pronotum with a V-shaped notch at the front which distinguishes them from other species found in the region. They are also unusual in having prominent eyespots. ==Ecology== Blue palo verde with dead wood suitable for colonisation After a mating flight, individual reproductives walk across the substrate, searching for a suitable hole or crevice in dry dead wood. They do not bore a hole, but may enlarge an existing one. They may be later joined in the hole by another individual, and one to three days later, seal the entrance with a faecal plug. colony founding is a very slow process; after the nest has been in existence for a year, their offspring may number somewhere between zero and twelve. The colony expands by the creation of a haphazard collection of galleries. These are generally kept clean, but \\"kick holes\\" are made to the exterior in places through which faecal pellets are pushed. The holes are then resealed, and abandoned chambers may be filled with faecal pellets and the desiccated corpses of any colony members that have died. These termites are intolerant of moisture, feed only on dry wood and derive the water they need from their diet. Flights of reproductives occur in July and August. P. occidentis feeds mainly in dead branches of Parkinsonia florida, the blue palo verde, while Marginitermes hubbardi, another species of drywood termite present in the Sonoran Desert, mainly feeds on the skeletal remains of saguaro. Dry timber being a very difficult food from which to extract nourishment, the termites accumulate an array of about forty symbiotic microorganisms in their gut to help them digest it. All colonies of P. occidentis have this wide range of gut symbionts, suggesting that the diversity is necessary for colony survival. ==References== Category:Termite genera Category:Insects of Mexico Category:Insects of the United States Category:Insects described in 1853 ","title":"Pterotermes"},{"id":"63768850","text":"Saint John the Evangelist Church of Ireland (Irish: Eaglais Naomh Eoin an Soisc√©ala√≠ na h√âireann) is an Evangelical Protestant, freestanding cruciform- plan church built of limestone located on Church Hill, Ballinasloe, Co.

At Rhode Island, he made 75% of his field goal attempts and 98% of his extra point attempts. In 2019, in his redshirt senior season with the Herd, he made 85.7% of his kicks with a long of 53 yards. ==Professional career== The New England Patriots selected Rohrwasser in the fifth round of the 2020 NFL draft with the 159th overall pick. The move came a few weeks after they released kicker Stephen Gostkowski, whom they drafted in 2006. In the middle of training camp, the Patriots signed Nick Folk, who had played for the team in 2019, as competition to Rohrwasser. Rohrwasser was waived as part of the team's final cutdowns on September 5, 2020. He was signed to the practice squad the following day. ==Controversy== Upon his selection, Rohrwasser was scrutinized for having a tattoo of the logo of the Three Percenters, a far-right paramilitary group. The Three Percenters have been condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League as a white supremacist hate group. Rohrwasser claimed to have no links to the organization and denounced it, pledging to cover up the tattoo. He further claimed that when he received the tattoo he thought the symbol represented military support. Some commentators questioned whether his denial of previous links with the group was authentic. On April 27, Rohrwasser pledged to have the tattoo removed completely. ==References== ==External links== *Marshall Thundering Herd bio Category:Living people Category:American football placekickers Category:Marshall Thundering Herd football players Category:New England Patriots players Category:People from Clifton Park, New York Category:Players of American football from New York (state) Category:Rhode Island Rams football players Category:1996 births ","title":"Justin Rohrwasser"},{"id":"63768879","text":"Peter Sainthill may refer to: * Peter Sainthill (died 1571) (1524-1571), Member Parliament for Grampound * Peter Sainthill (1593-1648), Member of Parliament for Tiverton in Devon * Peter Sainthill (surgeon) (1698-1775), British 18th century surgeon and a Fellow of the Royal Society ","title":"Peter Sainthill (disambiguation)"},{"id":"63768918","text":"Richard John Lee (born 6 March 1950) is an Australian business executive and a former banker and first-class cricketer.

On 27 May, the band released the third single \\"Hellbringer\\" featuring Jamie Hails of Polaris. The single was inconspicuously teased by the band as an April Fool's Day joke with revelation that on the \\"album cover\\" of the single they already teased that Hails will feature on the song as his face was on the cover but halfway hidden. That same day, the band also revealed other guest musicians that will feature on the album. On 8 July, the band released their fourth single \\"Dystopia\\". On 5 August, two days before the album release, the band released their fifth single \\"Moving On\\". ==Composition== ===Style=== The genre of the album has been described primarily as metalcore and nu metal while exploring elements of other genres such as rap rock, pop rock, hard rock, and post-hardcore. ==Critical reception== The album received mostly positive reviews, but also mixed reviews from several critics. Carlos Zelaya from Dead Press! rated the album positively but saying: \\"In Hearts Wake have noble intentions, and have clearly made a real go of it. The consistency isn't really there on a songwriting level, making for generally up and down record, but there's still enough on Kaliyuga to peak interest.\\" Distorted Sound scored the album 7 out of 10 and said: \\"For everything Kaliyuga doesn't get right is certainly made up for by everything it does hit the nail on the head with. Their metalcore sound has been truly honed to the best it can be, and there are standout cuts through this record that will hold up as some of the best music the band have produced. There might be some questionable vocal performances alongside the standout moments, and also some moments throughout the record that simply highlight how well the band succeed in other areas thanks to their miss of the mark. This is another solid album from a band that have a pretty consistently great career and seem to be intent on simply sharpening the blade even further. For anyone who has already enjoyed the newest offerings from Bury Tomorrow and Polaris will have an absolute field day with this.\\" Heavy magazine in a positive review said: \\"In Hearts Wake have successfully delivered four career-defining albums revolving around the elements: 'Earth', 'Air', 'Water' and now 'Fire'. Where our world goes next is, to an extent, in our hands.\\" Kerrang! gave the album 4 out of 5 and stated: \\"It's an acknowledgement that whether or not this music makes any real difference will depend, ultimately, on who's listening. What is clear is that In Hearts Wake have delivered an LP with the substance and accessibility to touch the widest possible audience ‚Äì and the quality to cement their place at the top table of Aussie metalcore. The righteous little rippers.\\" Alex Sievers from KillYourStereo gave the album 40 out of 100 and said: \\"While I applaud In Hearts Wake for putting their money where their mouth is with the eco- friendly, recycled manufacturing around the physical copies of Kaliyuga, I loathe a vast majority of the musical content on this new record. Like Void of Vision's Hyperdaze (2019), Kaliyuga would've instead made for a decent little EP rather than an uninteresting full-length. Because Kaliyuga is an incredibly mixed bag, nothing more than the smouldering ash of the great fire it could've been. For every 'Worldwide Suicide' or 'Dystopia' that dares lift the record up, there's a 'Husk' or a 'Timebomb' ready to cling to its feet and pull it right back down into the depths of hellish mediocrity. At the absolute smallest mercy, however, this is better than Ark. Much like how this album's name-sake marks the end of a cycle or era, I sincerely hope that Kaliyuga so too marks the end of this weaker, poorer cycle of In Hearts Wake's output; that a newer, bolder period for their music is just around the corner.\\" New Noise gave the album a perfect score 5 out of 5 and stated: \\"The band's sense of 'triumph' thereby feels richly grounded, as the band guide listeners through murky musical depths but subsequently break through the metaphorical surface with their consistently invigorating guitar riffing, propulsive drum rhythm, and bass groove, which together propel the central perspective to the point of finding some kind of metaphorical light on the other side of initial chaos.\\" Rock 'N' Load praised the album saying, \\"All in all, KALIYUGA is a great release that shows In Hearts Wake grow as musicians to an incredible degree. Being experimental within your sound is never something bands can predict the response to, but it pays off here without question. The album has a familiar sound that's easy to approach while being a refreshing new take on the Metalcore formula at the same time, that both fans of the genre and those who usually look past it will be able to find substance and enjoyment with great ease.\\" Wall of Sound gave the album a score 6/10 and saying: \\"With the amount of promotion that was put into this album to build hype, I can't help but feel that it is the expectation of what this album could have been is what has lead to what could possibly be its biggest downfall. There will be fans that enjoy this album, but it definitely isn't for everybody. Perhaps it was written to be appreciated more in a live setting?\\" ==Track listing== Adapted from Apple Music. ==Personnel== In Hearts Wake * Jake Taylor ‚Äì lead vocals * Eaven Dall ‚Äì lead guitar, backing vocals * Ben Nairne ‚Äì rhythm guitar * Kyle Erich ‚Äì bass, clean vocals * Conor Ward ‚Äì drums Additional muscians * Jamie Hails of Polaris ‚Äì guest vocals on track 3 * Georgia Flood ‚Äì guest vocals on track 7 * Randy Reimann of Massappeal ‚Äì guest vocals on track 11 Additional personnel * Josh Schroeder ‚Äì production ==Charts== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\"  +Chart performance for Kaliyuga - ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2020) ! scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - ! scope=\\"row\\" Australian Albums (ARIA)  3 } ==References== Category:2020 albums Category:In Hearts Wake albums Category:UNFD albums Category:Rise Records albums ","title":"Kaliyuga (album)"},{"id":"63769234","text":"Marisabel Cabrera (born December 12, 1975) is an American lawyer and politician from the state of Wisconsin.

Many local newspapers have been severely affected by losses in advertising revenues from coronavirus; journalists have been laid off, and some publications have folded. Many newspapers with paywalls lowered them for some or all of their coronavirus coverage. Journalists have worked to produce coverage of the pandemic combating misinformation, providing public health updates, and supplying entertainment to help people cope with the virus's impact. == Censorship == In some countries ‚Äì including Turkey, Egypt, India, Bangladesh, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Madagascar, Zambia, Cote d‚ÄôIvoire, Zimbabwe, Eswatini, Venezuela, Belarus, Montenegro, Kosovo, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, and Somalia ‚Äì journalists have been threatened or arrested for their coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Jordanian authorities arrested Roya TV channel's owner, Fares Sayegh, and its news director, Mohamad al-Khalidi, for reporting on lack of jobs and money needed by labourers to feed families during the curfew in mid-April. On 16 March, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis signed an emergency decree, giving authorities the power to remove, report or close websites spreading \\"fake news\\" about the COVID-19 pandemic, with no opportunity to appeal. Myanmar blocked access to 221 news websites, including several leading media outlets. In China Caixin has had a number of articles about the source and research COVID-19 pandemic removed from their website after publication. In Madagascar, a journalist was arrested and charged with spreading fake news and incitement of hatred towards President Andry Rajoelina after she criticized the president's handling of the pandemic. On 5 May, Philippines' National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) issued a cease and desist order against the country's largest media company, ABS-CBN TV network, forcing it to suspend operations for all of its physical broadcasting channels. There are allegations that the NTC refusal over the renewal of the franchise was based on the network's critical news coverage of President Rodrigo Duterte's administration. ABS-CBN said in a statement: \\"Millions of Filipinos will lose their source of news and entertainment when ABS-CBN is ordered to go off-air on TV and radio tonight... People need crucial and timely information as the nation deals with the COVID-19 pandemic.\\" On 16 June, Egyptian journalist and editor-in-chief of the al-Diyar newspaper was detained and charged with spreading false news, joining a \\"terrorist organization\\" and misusing social media after he criticized his country's handling of the pandemic. ==Australia== BuzzFeed announced it was ending its news operations in Australia, as well as in the UK, partly due to a slump in advertising revenue due to the pandemic. The news outlet furloughed its four Australia news staff in the cutback. ==Canada== In Canada, a number of permanent layoffs and the closure of newspapers have been attributed to the pandemic. In Atlantic Canada, production was suspended on all weekly publications owned by SaltWire Network, for a 3-month period. Only its four dailies (The Chronicle Herald, Cape Breton Post, The Guardian, and The Telegram) were kept in production. Halifax alternative weekly The Coast also laid off staff. Postmedia ended the publication of the Manitoba newspapers Altona Red River Valley Echo, Carman Valley Leader, Gimli's Interlake Spectator, Morden Times, Selkirk Journal, Stonewall Argus & Teulon Times, Winkler Times, and The Prairie Farmer. In Ontario, they closed the newspapers Kingsville Reporter, Windsor-Essex's Lakeshore News, LaSalle Post, Tecumseh Shoreline Week, and Tilbury Times.

Torstar brand Metroland Media has ceased the print editions of the Beach-East York Neighbourhood Voice, Bloor West-Parkdale Neighbourhood Voice, and York-City Centre Neighbourhood Voice newspapers. The Bolton offices of The Caledon Enterprise were closed, with staff moving into the Brampton Guardian and Mississauga News shared newsroom in Mississauga. In Quebec, CN2i reduced their six daily newspapers to Saturday editions as of March. The move resulted in 143 temporary layoffs. Sing Tao Daily Toronto, owned by Torstar, is ending its weekly free print edition. Canadian Jewish News is closed its operations after 60 years. Winnipeg's The Jewish News and Post, established in 1925, became an online-only publication. ==Hong Kong== The South China Morning Post announced on 22 April 2020 that it would introduce a package of cost-cutting and revenue-raising measures intended to weather the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Twenty-seven senior executives had immediate pay cuts, higher paid staff were asked to take three weeks unpaid leave, salaries were frozen, and a limited number of redundancies were made. From August 2020 the newspaper announced it was bringing back its paywall to try to make up the revenue shortfall due to loss of advertising during the pandemic. ==India== As of 4 May 2020, almost 100 journalists had tested positive for COVID-19 in India. Fifteen employees of the Jai Maharashtra news network had the virus, as did nineteen employees of the Punjab Kesari newspaper. Media watchers reported jobs losses, pay cuts, and shutting down of editions in various places in India. ==United Kingdom== Many media organisations have reported slumps in advertising revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Oliver Dowden, said the pandemic had caused the \\"biggest existential crisis\\" in the history of the press, as local and national newspapers experienced circulation decline. On 20 March 2020, the London business newspaper City A.M. suspended its print edition and announced it would halve its staff pay in April. Independent Digital News and Media, the owner of The Independent and indy100 news websites, furloughed some of its staff and cut wages for employees. BuzzFeed announced it was ending its news operations in the UK, as well as in Australia, partly due to a slump in advertising revenue due to the pandemic. Its ten news staff in the UK were furloughed in the cutback. The newspaper group Reach plc, which owns titles including the Daily Mirror and Daily Express, reported a 30% fall in its revenues for April 2020. In July 2020 it announced that due to falling income it would cut 550 jobs. Amid the pandemic, the Daily Mail overtook The Sun as the biggest-selling newspaper in the UK in May 2020. In July 2020, The Guardian announced it would cut 180 jobs. Figures at the newspaper said that revenues would be ¬£25 million less than the year's budget. ==United States== The scale of the COVID-19 outbreak has prompted several major publishers to temporarily disable their paywalls on related articles, including Bloomberg News, The Atlantic, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Seattle Times. Many local newspapers were already severely struggling before the crisis. Several alt weekly newspapers in affected metropolitan areas, including The Stranger in Seattle and Austin Chronicle, have announced layoffs and funding drives due to lost revenue. Advertisements concerning public events and venues accounted for a majority of revenue for alt-weekly newspapers, which was disrupted by the cancellation of large public gatherings. Online advertisements also dropped to avoid running ads next to coronavirus coverage. ==See also== * Media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic * Misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic ==References== ==External links== * Mapping of media impacts in Canada, through J-Source, a program of Ryerson University. journalism Category:Journalism ","title":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on journalism"},{"id":"63769305","text":"Wallingford Public Access Association, Inc.

All except one of the songs had previously appeared in print, mostly either in Hogg's earlier publications or in a range of periodicals. ==Background== During the 1820s songs by Hogg had appeared in a number of periodicals, most notably in the Noctes Ambrosianae series in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. In April 1830 Hogg announced to William Blackwood that he was selecting the best of these songs for a 'pocket volume'.The Collected Letters of James Hogg: Volume 2 1820‚Äí1831, ed. Gillian Hughes (Edinburgh, 2006), 380: Hogg to William Blackwood, 11 April 1830. In the event the choice was not limited to the previous decade: Hogg assembled songs from throughout his career, so that the volume offers a comprehensive survey of his work in the field. He was closely involved with the production of the volume between October and December, adjusting the contents and correcting the proofs, although his nephew Robert played a minor part in the process.Songs, by The Ettrick Shepherd, ed.

A critical edition, by Kirsteen McCue with Janette Currie, appeared in 2014 as Volume 28 in the Stirling/South Carolina Research Edition of The Collected Works of James Hogg, published by Edinburgh University Press. ==Reception== The reviewers gave the volume an overwhelmingly favourable reception. Hogg was seen as a worthy successor of Burns, and the headnotes were found entertaining and informative. The final sentence of the review in The Literary Gazette may be regarded as representative of the general verdict: 'This volume will greatly raise the poet in the estimation of England, which is too apt to mistake him for a Noctesian roisterer, and, though an imaginative, a sometimes coarse prose writer.'The Literary Gazette, 1 January 1831, 5‚Äí6 (6). ==References== Category:1831 poems Category:Scottish songs ","title":"Songs, by The Ettrick Shepherd"},{"id":"63769439","text":"The 1988‚Äì89 Robert Morris Colonials men's basketball team represented Robert Morris University in the 1988‚Äì89 NCAA Division I basketball season.

For his performance, he received Honorable Mention All-Mountain West honors. In 2018, his campaign was cut short by a season-ending Achilles injury suffered in the third game of the season. In 2019, as a redshirt junior, he was again struck by injury, as a season-ending Lisfranc foot injury sidelined him for the final nine games of the year. In January 2020, despite having played only five full games over the previous two seasons, Muti announced that he would forgo his final season of college eligibility and declare for the 2020 NFL Draft.

It was envisaged as a companion volume to Songs, by The Ettrick Shepherd, which had appeared at the end of January 1831 and been well received.James Hogg, A Queer Book, ed. P. D. Garside (Edinburgh, 1995), xiii. The new volume is a collection of 26 poems, longer than those in Songs and (apart from the first two) assembled from periodicals between 1825 and 1831: more than half the poems first appeared in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. Although Hogg left the final choice of poems to his nephew Robert and William Blackwood he gave fairly detailed guidance. Reluctantly, he also agreed that the two men should be permitted to modernise his 'beloved ancient stile' Ibid., xiii‚Äíxvi; The Collected Letters of James Hogg: Volume 2 1820‚Äí1831, ed.

By The Ettrick Shepherd, published by William Blackwood in Edinburgh and T[homas] Cadell in London, appeared at the end of April or beginning of May 1832. A thousand copies were printed.Garside, op. cit., xi, xxi. A critical edition, by P. D. Garside, appeared in 1995 as Volume 3 in the Stirling/South Carolina Research Edition of The Complete Works of James Hogg, published by Edinburgh University Press. In view of the non- authorial changes made to Hogg's text, especially the modernising of his 'ancient stile', this edition recovers texts from manuscript (in eleven cases), Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine (in nine cases), and Annuals (in six cases), but it preserves the 1832 contents and their order. ==Contents== 'The Wyffe of Ezdel-more' (first publication here): *: The Laird of Gilbertoun shoots a pair of moorhens, unaware that they are two lovers transformed by a witch. Together laird and witch bury the pair (in human form), the witch singing a dirge. *: The witch tells Gilbertoun her story: after her father had sold her into slavery she burned down the royal harem, emerging from the flames as a spirit. Returning home, she found her lover unfaithful and refused to forgive him: as a consequence she was condemned to a thousand-year penance. *: The witch transforms three virgins disappointed in love into birds, one of them a lark.

The history of the bank is significantly intertwined with the development of the Sino-Italian political relations during the interwar period. == The Banca Italo-Cinese == On October 19, 1919, Chinese shareholders represented by the Honorable Hsu Shih-ing (Ë®±‰∏ñËã±), via the Chinese Ambassador in Italy, Wang Kouang Ky and Italian shareholders including delegates of Credito Italiano, Banca Unione and Credito Varesino met at the Chinese Embassy in Rome. They agreed to sign a convention to establish a new bank in China to be named the Banca Italo-Cinese (the Sino-Italian Bank). On November 8, 1919, a financial agreement was also signed by all the Italian shareholders of the new institution, who convened at the Credito Italiano main office in Milano to confirm the capital funding. The documents were signed by high profile Italian industrialists such as Grand Officer Carlo Orsi, managing director of Credito Italiano, Grand Officer Carlo Feltrinelli, managing director of Banca Unione (formerly Banca Feltrinelli) and Grand Officer Lionello Scelsi, a former Italian consul in Shanghai. The final deed of constitution was later registered by the Italian Consul Vincenzo Fileti at the Italian consulate in Tientsin on February 18, 1920. The establishment of a new bank was an important step undertaken to improve the visibility of the Italian community in China, which until then was only marginally supported by the Italian governments. Colonial powers, such as Great Britain, France and Germany, offered ample diplomatic support and financial resources to their own entrepreneurs in those years. The Sino- Italian Bank joined international banks already based in China since the end of the Opium Wars, such as the British-Chartered Oriental Banking Corporation, established in Shanghai in 1848, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China (1857) and the Hong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, which began operating in 1865. The German Deutsch-Asiatische Bank joined them in May 1889 and the Russian-Chinese Bank (1896) and Banque de l'Indochine (1898) followed shortly after. The capital structure of the Sino-Italian Bank was finally set up with the equal participation of the Italian (Series I shareholders, possessing 12,000 shares) and Chinese shareholders (Series C shareholders, also possessing a total of 12,000 shares). The subscribed Series I capital was initially 4 million lire oro (exchanged at 1 Lg. Pound = 25 Lire oro) and the Series C capital was 1.2 million Chinese dollars, which increased to 16 million lire oro and 4.8 million Chinese dollars, respectively (24 January 1920). Lionello Scelsi was the first appointed president of the bank, and the first managing directors were Egidio Marzoli, Ernesto De Negri, Carlo Feltrinelli (the Banca Unione managing director) and Carlo Orsi (the Credito Italiano managing director). The bank‚Äôs main purpose was the financial intermediation of Italian manufactured products and the import of raw materials from China, mainly leather and silk. == The Banca Italiana per la Cina == The interests of the Chinese and Italian shareholders within the Sino- Italian Bank soon diverged. The bank‚Äôs management did not consider the Chinese market and entrepreneurs as commercial entities of importance due to the political uncertainties that characterized China in those years; in addition, local Chinese businesses were generating substantial financial losses for the bank. The Sino-Italian Bank was dissolved and renamed Banca Italiana per la Cina (Italian Bank for China) after the deliberation of the assembly held on 14 January 1924 in Tientsin. The new registration act was deposited at the Italian consulate of Shanghai on 19 August 1924 and bank‚Äôs legal domicile of the new bank was set in Shanghai. This time the share capital was entirely subscribed by Credito Italiano in gold valued at 1 million USD and divided into 10,000 shares. The Italian Bank for China‚Äôs main office was established at Kiukiang Road 16. From the 1930s onwards, the Banca Italiana per la Cina became financial intermediary of important confidential transactions between the Italian and Chinese governments, such as the final solution of the question of the Boxer Indemnity, formally resolved with the signing of a memorandum in London by Italian Finance Minister Guido Jung (1876‚Äì1949) and Chinese Minister Tse-Ven Soong (1894‚Äì1971) on 1 July 1933 and the settlement of the Skoda Loan, always in 1933, a long question that involved several European governments starting from 1912. The bank continued to operate without restrictions until September 9, 1943, the day after the armistice signed by Italy with the Allies at Cassibile in Sicily, when Japanese soldiers seized the bank in Shanghai. They opened the main safe box, confiscating confidential documentation and the cash available, while the Chinese employees were dismissed. Most of the Italian managers and families were detained at the Presbyterian University in Weihsien internment camp (in Shandong province), about 150 miles from Shanghai until the end of the war. The bank ceased the operation, despite a long negotiation with the Japanese authorities first and later with the Chinese government after the liberation. The detailed reports of these events are still kept in the archives of the bank today held at the Historical Archive of UniCredit Group in Milano. == The End of the Banca Italiana per la Cina == After the war, in a letter sent on December 24, 1945 addressed to the board of directors in Milano, the bank‚Äôs management suggested the operation‚Äôs indefinite closure, explaining that the abolition of extraterritoriality privileges and the end of the concession system was a catastrophic event for foreigner interests and activities in China. Foreign banks lost the exclusivity of contracts with the public utility companies (e.g., electricity, transportation [trams], water distribution, telephones). They also lost the privilege to print banknotes and the right of confidentiality, which until then was guaranteed by foreign intermediaries. Said privilege no longer applied because of the strong supervision and interference of local authorities. The factor of competition indeed moved in favor of the Chinese banks, and the strong antiWestern and anticolonial sentiment of both the Chinese people and authorities made difficult to successfully pursue a foreign banking enterprise again. On July 2, 1947, the assembly of the Credito Italiano deliberated the transfer of the legal domicile of the bank from Shanghai to Vaduz in Lichtenstein, under the denomination of Italianische Bank f√ºr China. Two years later, in 1949, the banking institution was renamed Societ√† per Iniziative Finanziarie, Bancarie e Commerciali (SINIT), declaring the de facto end of the experience of the only wholly Italian-owned bank incorporated in China until today. After that experience, a long time passed before an Italian bank began operating in China again. In 1996, the Banca di Roma was the first Italian bank to open a fully operational branch in Shanghai. Due to a complex and unexpected situation, the mother company later merged into UniCredit group in 2008; the latter coincidentally found itself leading business activities in China from the same city that it had left more than half a century earlier. ==References== Category:Banking in China Category:Finance in Italy ","title":"Banca Italiana per la Cina"},{"id":"63769506","text":"Yakkha may refer to: * Yakkha people, an ethnic group of South Asia * Yakkha language, a Sino-Tibetan language * Yaksha, also known as yakkha, a class of spirits in South and Southeast Asian cultures == See also == * Yakka (disambiguation) Category:Language and nationality disambiguation pages ","title":"Yakkha"},{"id":"63769509","text":"Blake Whittfield Ferguson (born April 21, 1997) is an American football long snapper for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL).

Due to disagreements over the money earned from the Cimpor deal, Ricardo and Corn√©lio Brennand split their joint group into their own individual companies. Following the creation of IRB, Brennand moved his investments to the energy sector, particularly in wind and hydropower. In 2009 he resumed investments in the cement industry, and later ventured into real estate, financing the private residential community Reserva do Paiva in Cabo de Santo Agostinho. In August 2019 it was announced the Brennand group would invest R$450 million in the construction of three wind farms in Bahia, which are expected to be completed in early 2021. At the time the company also planned to enter the solar power industry. The Ricardo Brennand Institute's collection includes historic and artistic objects from a wide range of periods, from the Late Middle Ages to the 21st century. It contains historic and iconographic documents related to the colonial period and Dutch Brazil, which includes an important collection of paintings made by Dutch artist Frans Post (1612‚Äì1680), one of the members of the company of John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen, who led the New Holland colony in Pernambuco. In 1952, on a trip to England, Brennand purchased many weapons that would later be included in the museum's collection; he acquired many of the items in the museum from auctions and other private collections. In 2003 Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands visited the museum. In 2019 Brennand's net worth was valued at R$3.1 billion by Forbes, which made him the second-oldest billionaire in Brazil at the time. == Personal life == Brennand was married to Gra√ßa Monteiro Brennand, with whom he had eight children. He was the cousin of ceramics artist Francisco Brennand. Brennand died on 25 April 2020, aged 92, at Real Hospital Portugu√™s in Recife, due to complications from COVID-19. Remembrances came from Pernambuco governor Paulo C√¢mara and Recife mayor Geraldo J√∫lio, the latter declaring three days of mourning in honor of Brennand. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1927 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Brazilian art collectors Category:Deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in Pernambuco Category:Brazilian people of English descent Category:Federal University of Pernambuco alumni Category:People from Recife Category:Brazilian engineers Category:Brazilian businesspeople Category:Brazilian billionaires ","title":"Ricardo Brennand"},{"id":"63769532","text":"The 1999 West Dorset District Council election was held on Thursday 6 May 1999 to elect councillors to West Dorset District Council in England.

He was styled from birth Duke of Somerset, but never formally created a peer. == Early life == Edmund Tudor was born on 21 February 1499, at Greenwich Palace, Kent. He was baptised in the Church of the Observant Friars on 24 February 1499.Alison Weir, Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy (London, U.K.: The Bodley Head, 1999), page 152 The festivities for the christening were considered very splendid.Elizabeth of York: A Tudor Queen and Her World, Alison Weir, (New York: Balentine Books, 2013), p. 361.

Lady Margaret Beaufort gave the child a gift of ¬£100 and rewarded the midwife and nurses.The Life and Death of Edmund Tudor, Duke of Somerset, The Freelance History Writer, Retrieved 25/04 2020 Edmund spent some time in the royal nursery of Eltham Palace with his elder sisters Margaret and Mary and his brother the Duke of York (afterwards King Henry VIII). The eldest sibling, Arthur, did not reside in the nursery with his siblings, as he had his own household. Edmund was present with his elder siblings Margaret, Mary and Henry when Erasmus and Thomas More visited the royal nursery at Eltham Palace in September 1499. The seven-month-old Edmund was held in the arms of his nurse during the visit.Montgomery-Massingberd, Hugh (editor). Burke's Guide to the Royal Family, Burke's Peerage, London, 1973, p. 204. == Duke of Somerset == Edmund is said to have been created Duke of Somerset, but no enrolment of a patent of such creation is to be found. It seems likely that, although he may have been styled Duke of Somerset, he died before he was so created. His elder brother Henry, afterwards King Henry VIII of England, was not created Duke of York until he was above 3 years of age.G.E. Cokayne; with Vicary Gibbs, H.A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H.

The cause of Edmund's death is unknown, and he could have died of a number of childhood diseases, however it is known that at the time of his death the plague was rampant. King Henry and Queen Elizabeth had travelled to Calais and stayed for 40 days. The royal children were removed from Eltham Palace to the more remote Hatfield House in Hertfordshire for isolation. On 16 June, as the plague abated, Henry and Elizabeth sailed to Dover. It was either during their return or upon their arrival that they received the news of Edmund's death at Hatfield. == Funeral == Edmund was given a state funeral, and records indicate that the king gave over ¬£242 for the burial of Edmund.Blood Sisters: The Women Behind the Wars of the Roses, Sarah Gristwood, (New York: Basic Books, 2013), 242. He was buried in Westminster Abbey on 22 June 1500.

She has danced from an early age: she first began to dance in Kinshasa at the Protestant church there. She also took part in hip-hop dance battles in the streets of Kinshasa with the group, Rue Des Danses Urbains Hip- hop. She moved to Brussels to study at The Performing Arts and Research Training School (P.A.R.T.S.). She studied there for two years. == Career == Ngemi is a well-known dancer and choreographer from the DRC. Her style of dance fuses Congolese dances from the streets and clubs with European traditions of dance. The style is described it as Chakamadesu A U C - Afro, Urban & Contemporary (chaka madesu is a Congolese stew, cooked in a variety of ways). In 2006 she worked with the choreographer Jacques Banayang, who introduced her to contemporary dance. In 2008 she toured Africa and Europe as part of a work created by the choreographer Thomas Styeart. She has worked with Ula Sickle on a project entitled Jolie and on other projects well-known choreographers. She has worked with Boris Charmatz on several projects. Ngemi's work can be political and in 2015 she collaborated with rapper and producer Baloji on a work that criticised the influence that cellphone and alcohol industries have on society in the DRC. One venue for this performance was at the Fondation Cartier in Paris. The work Jolie has been performed around the world, including at the Reykjavik Dance Festival.

The process continued to 1918 and was adopted by the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes against the Albanian populations of Kosovo between 1918‚Äì1938. The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes resisted the Kachak movement and used Serbo-Montenegrin colonisers in an attempt to \\"de-albanize\\" areas inhabited by Albanians. There is an integration process among Albanian immigrants in Greece that can be perhaps termed as 'de-albanisation'. During the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the term entered again in political discourse. In 1989, Rugova opposed the \\"de-albanization\\" of Kosovo. In 1992, the Serbian Radical Party recommended that Kosovo be \\"de-albanized\\". After the riots in Kosovo, Slobodan Milosevic implemented a policy of \\"dealbanization\\" similar to those in 1918. In political discourse in Serbia, the call for dealbanizacija as it became an unrealistic goal after the Kosovo War gave way to a more pragmatic - as viewed from the Serbian perspective - call for federalizacija (the political attempt to keep Kosovo Albanians within a Serbia with broad autonomy) across the political spectrum. In Albanian historiography the term is also used in order to refer to the process of \\"dealbanization\\" of Albanian historical figures in Balkan historiography. In post-Yugoslav countries with significant Albanian minorities, the term is used in a form which alludes to the ethnic slur ≈†iptar, de≈°iptarizacija, as a nationalist slogan directed against Albanian communities. The ultras of FK Vardar, one of the biggest clubs in Northern Macedonia have frequently unveiled a banner with the call for de≈°iptarizacija during the club's football matches. In 2017, such an incident was followed by an attack against Albanian youngsters who were walking outside the stadium. == References == Category:Anti-national sentiment Category:Racism Category:Modern history of Kosovo Category:Yugoslav Serbia Category:Settlement schemes Category:Serbian‚ÄìAlbanian conflict ","title":"Dealbanisation"},{"id":"63769639","text":"Meera A.

He showed considerable promise as a two-year-old in 2016 when he won three of his four races including the Listed Grand Crit√©rium de Bordeaux. In the first half of his three-year-old campaign he developed into a top-class performer, winning the Prix de Fontainebleau, Poule d'Essai des Poulains and Prix du Jockey Club. He was beaten in three subsequent races although he ran well to finish fifth in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. ==Background== Brametot is a bay horse with no white markings bred in Ireland by Jorge Cardemil de Rurange. In December 2014 he was put up for auction at the Arqana December Breeding Stock sale and was bought for ‚Ç¨26,000 by Sylvain Vidal. He entered the ownership of Gerard Augustin-Normand & Mme E Vidal and was sent into training with Jean-Claude Rouget at Pau. He was ridden in all of his races by Cristian Demuro He is from the first crop of foals sired by Rajsaman, a top-class performer who won the Prix Perth, Prix du Muguet and Prix Daniel Wildenstein. Brametot's dam Morning Light won two races in her native Germany and was a half-sister to Monsun. ==Racing career== ===2016: two-year-old season=== Brametot began his racing career in a contest for previously unraced juveniles over 1200 metres on soft ground at Deauville Racecourse on 17 June in which he started at odds of 6.8/1 and won by two lengths from the Andr√© Fabre-trained Xaarino. On 2 August at the same track, the colt started favourite for a race over 1500 metres and won by four lengths from Incampo and five others. At the end of the month Brametot started odds-on favourite for a race over 1600 metres at Deauville but was outpaced in the closing stages and was beaten three lengths into second place by High Alpha. The colt ended his season in the Listed Grand Crit√©rium de Bordeaux over 1600 metres at Bordeaux Le Bouscat Racecourse on 11 October. Starting the 7/10 favourite he disputed the lead from the start, went to the front 600 metres from the finish and stayed on well to win by one and a half lengths from Samuna. ===2017: three-year-old season=== In 2017 Longchamp Racecourse was closed for redevelopment and the racecourse's major fixtures were moved to other tracks. Brametot made his first appearance of the season in the Group 3 Prix de Fontainebleau, run that year over 1600 metres at Chantilly Racecourse on 16 April and started the 4.1/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Xaarino, Markazi (Prix Omnium II) and Spotify. Brametot started poorly and was detached from the field in last place in the early stages but made steady progress and moved into contention in the straight. He took the lead 200 metres from the finish and drew away to win \\"comfortably\\" by two and a half lengths from Stunning Spirit. After the race Jean-Claude Rouget, whose stable had been affected by a viral infection said \\"After what we have been through these past few weeks, it shows how you can be down one day and up the next... I know he was a little far back in the race, but that is the only way to ride him as he‚Äôd otherwise be too keen. Cristian rode him perfectly, he made his progress in stages and let him roll at the end.\\" Shortly after the race a half-share in the colt's ownership was purchased by the Qatar-based Al Shaqab Racing. The 2017 edition of the Group 1 Poule d'Essai des Poulains was run over 1600 metres at Deauville on 14 May and saw Brametot start the 4/1 second favourite behind the Prix Jean-Luc Lagard√®re winner National Defense. The other eleven runners included Rivet, Orderofthegarter (Leopardstown 2,000 Guineas Trial Stakes), Peace Envoy (Anglesey Stakes), South Seas (Solario Stakes) and Spotify. After racing towards the rear of the field Brametot made rapid progress on the stands-side approaching the last 200 metres, overtook Rivet and then got the better of Le Brivido in the final strides to win by a short head. Rouget commented \\"He should stay further and he won today because of his stamina. I'm delighted for the new owner partnership and for my team, as I had not won this race before. We will now take our time to decide on his future. At Chantilly on 4 June Brametot started the 13/8 favourite for the Prix du Jockey Club over 2000 metres at Chantilly. His eleven opponents included Recoletos (Prix Greffulhe), Rivet, Waldgeist, Soleil Marin (Prix Noailles), War Decree (Vintage Stakes) and Orderofthegarter. Brametot started slowly and raced towards the rear of the field as Taj Mahal set the pace, before being switched to the outside to make his challenge in the straight. He produced a sustained run to overtake Recoletos 50 metres from the finish and caught Waldgeist on the line to win by a short head. Rouget said \\"It's huge. I almost did not run in this race, but Churchill frightened me in the St James's Palace Stakes. So we tried, but between trying and succeeding, there is a difference. It is all the more beautiful after the virus that touched one of my barns... The colt will have a rest this summer and we haven't set any precise objectives for the autumn yet\\" while Demuro commented \\"He started off slowly, like he is used to, and I had a hard time following. I was a little caught for speed in the turn, but he finished really strongly. He is a very hard horse, very strong ‚Äì a true Group 1 horse. After a break of two and a half months Brametot returned to the track in the Group 2 Prix Guillaume d'Ornano over 2000 metres at Deauville on 15 August in which he started the 1.3/1 favourite but never recovered from a poor start and came home fifth of the eight runners behind the British-trained Eminent. On 1 October the colt started a 20/1 outsider for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 metres at Chantilly. He tracked the leaders for most of the way and kept on well in the straight to finish fifth behind Enable, Cloth of Stars, Ulysses and Order of St George. Three weeks later Brametot was sent to England to contest the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Ascot Racecourse. He went off the 11/2 third choice in the betting but after moving into contention two furlongs from the finish he tired badly on the soft ground and came home sixth behind Cracksman, beaten almost fifteen lengths by the winner. In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Brametot was rated at 121 making him the twenty-ninth best horse in the world. ==Stud record== At the end of his racing career Brametot was retired to become a breeding stallion at the Haras de Bouquetot before moving to the Gestut Ebbesloh in Germany for the 2020 season. ==Pedigree== ==References== Category:2014 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in France Category:Thoroughbred family 8-a ","title":"Brametot (horse)"},{"id":"63769682","text":"Khalil Davis (born August 22, 1996) is an American football defensive end for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL).

Jorgensen had previously been the Libertarian Party's vice presidential nominee in 1996, when she ran on a ticket with author Harry Browne. Currently a senior lecturer of psychology at Clemson University, Jorgensen had owned a software company at the time of her 1996 vice presidential candidacy. Jorgensen's positions are typically described as being consistent with the Libertarian Party's platform. Her campaign has received less media coverage than those of Gary Johnson, former Republican governor of New Mexico and Jorgensen's predecessor as the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee in 2012 and 2016. Her name recognition upon entering the race is also widely considered to have been lower than Johnson's. Although Jorgensen is often described as appealing to the Libertarian Party's base, some in the party, such as her main primary opponent Future of Freedom Foundation founder Jacob Hornberger, have criticized her for perceived departures from libertarian ideology in exchange for mainstream appeal. The Libertarian Party experienced a competitive primary. On May 23, at the virtual 2020 Libertarian National Convention, Jorgensen was selected as the party's 2020 presidential nominee after four rounds of voting by delegates. She is the party's first female presidential nominee.

Jorgensen won a single primary prior to the Convention, in Nebraska, on May 12, 2020. After Justin Amash entered and then exited the race Jacob Hornberger lost a significant number of votes and on the fourth round of balloting Jorgensen was nominated. She did not endorse anybody to be her running mate and after three ballots Spike Cohen was nominated. After her nomination, she went on to win the New Mexico primary on June 2, 2020, which had been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. == General election campaign == === Ballot access === Jorgensen achieved ballot access in all 50 states and the District of Columbia on September 15, 2020. === Website crash === After the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, Jorgensen's website crashed due to high volume of traffic. == Endorsements == Jorgensen has received endorsements from Peter Schiff, John Stossel, and Katherine Timpf, among others.

It is a type of space debris, which describes all defunct human-made objects in outer space. At the end of their service life, the majority of satellites suffer from orbital decay and are destroyed by the heat of atmospheric entry. Zombie satellites, however, maintain a stable orbit but are either partially or completely inoperable, preventing operators from communicating with them consistently. ==History== ===Transit 5B-5=== One of the oldest known zombie satellites is Transit 5B-5, which was launched in 1965 as part of the Transit system. Also known as NAVSAT or NNSS (for Navy Navigation Satellite System), it is one of the first satellite navigation systems (or satnav). Transit 5B-5 is nuclear powered and still in a stable polar orbit, though operators are unable to control it. ===LES-1=== LES-1, also known as Lincoln Experimental Satellite 1, was a communications satellite launched by the United States Air Force on February 11, 1965 to study the use of UHF (ultrahigh-frequency) radio transmissions. It never achieved optimal orbit and was out of contact for more than 40 years before spontaneously resuming transmissions in 2012. ===Galaxy 15=== Galaxy 15 is a U.S. telecommunications satellite launched in 2005. In April of 2010, only five years into a planned 15 year mission, its operator, Intelsat, lost control of the satellite and it drifted out of its orbital slot. Several months later, on December 27, 2010, the satellite rebooted itself and began responding to commands again. Intelsat re-positioned it back to its original orbital slot in April of 2011. ===IMAGE=== Launched in 2000, IMAGE (Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration), a NASA spacecraft studying the Earth's magnetosphere, unexpectedly ceased operations in December 2005. It was a zombie satellite until Scott Tilley, an amateur radio operator living in Canada tracked it down in January 2018. On February 25, contact with IMAGE was again lost. It was reestablished in March but lost again in August. NASA is currently evaluating a recovery mission. ===Zuma=== USA-280 (codenamed Zuma) was a classified U.S. government satellite launched by SpaceX on January 8, 2018. The government reported that the $3.5 billion satellite likely failed to deploy properly and re-entered the atmosphere. Despite that announcement, the secrecy surrounding the mission generated speculation regarding its fate. Amateur astronomers attempted to locate any trace of Zuma visually. It has been implied that the search for Zuma indirectly led to discovery of IMAGE. ===LES-5=== On March 24, 2020, contact with another lost Lincoln Experimental Satellite, LES-5, was made by Scott Tilley. The satellite is only in operation when its solar panels are receiving sunlight. ==See also== *Space debris *Skylab 4 *Space Liability Convention *List of spaceflight-related accidents and incidents *Laser broom *Kessler syndrome ==References== Category:Satellites Category:Space debris ","title":"Zombie satellite"},{"id":"63769836","text":"Sleeth is a surname.

Another sanitation issue was the informal traders selling items such as fruit exacerbating the outbreak.

In May 1792 he wrote in the ship's log: \\"The Articles of Trade we mostly made up of in this place were Muskets, Copper, some Cloathing, a new Iron Necklaces, but any of Iron mecanical Tools they were not fond of except files, which they were very fond of but to our disadvantage we had none.\\" Robert Haswell, of the Columbia Rediviva wrote that the Margaret was \\"as fine a vessel as ever I saw of her size, and appeared exceeding well fitted for the voyage and I believe there was no expense spared.\\" The Margaret and Columbia met again on 3 July 1792 near the southern end of Haida Gwaii. The two ships sailed together down the coast of Vancouver Island to Clayoqout Sound. The leader of the Tla-o-qui- aht Nuu-chah-nulth of Clayoquot Sound, Chief Wickaninnish, came on board the Margaret. Robert Gray, also on board Margaret, convinced Wickaninnish to visit the Columbia as well. Wickaninnish did, although according to John Boit, \\"he did not appear happy\\". Wickaninnish disliked and feared Gray, who had destroyed the village of Opitsaht with cannon fire earlier in that year. In late July the Margaret sailed to the Columbia River to trade for furs, with little success. Returning north, on 8 August 1792 the Margaret anchored at Yuquot and the Spanish outpost Santa Cruz de Nuca in Nootka Sound, in company with the Hope, under Joseph Ingraham. On learning of Captain Magee's illness, Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra, the commandant of Santa Cruz de Nuca, offered him a residence on shore. On 12 August the Margaret, under David Lamb, sailed in company with the Hope to search for fur trading opportunities. Magee remained at Santa Cruz de Nuca. When George Vancouver arrived at Nootka Sound on 28 August and noted that Captain Magee was living on shore with his surgeon and John Howell. While at Santa Cruz de Nuca, James Magee, John Howell, and several others, served as witnesses to an official statement made by the Mowachaht Nuu-chah-nulth Chief Maquinna to Bodega y Quadra, having to do with the Nootka Crisis and the claims of John Meares. Moci√±o (2011), p. 69 In addition, Captain Magee sent Vancouver a complaint, saying that the British captains William Brown of the Butterworth and James Baker of the Jenny had fired upon the natives in Clayoquot Sound in August 1792, and should be charged with piracy. Captain Brown of the Butterworth had tried to rob the natives of their furs and, encountering resistance, fired upon them, killing four. The Margaret, under David Lamb, returned to Nootka Sound on 21 September 1792. The Hope arrived about a week later. During the 1792 season the Margaret had acquired about 1,200 sea otter pelts. Sometime during the season, the Margaret struck a rock in Hecate Strait, southeast of Rose Point, Haida Gwaii. This rock became known as \\"Margaret Rock\\". Magee had intended to have the Margaret spend the winter in Nootka Sound, and to build a small schooner to act as a tender for the 1793 season. The furs collected by the Margaret were to be taken to China by the Hope. Instead, some men were left to build the schooner and both the Margaret and Hope sailed together for China, via the Hawaiian Islands. They arrived in Hawaii on 5 November 1792. On 8 November the Margaret and Hope encountered the Halcyon under Captain Charles Barkley. The three vessels sailed together to Waikiki, Oahu, to procure water. Then they sailed to Kauai, arriving on 11 November. On the 13th the Halcyon left for China. The Margaret did likewise on 21 November, arriving at Macau in early January 1793. While in China David Lamb left the ship. John Howell, the historian also left, having attached himself to Captain John Kendrick of the Lady Washington. The Margaret left China in late January 1793 and in April arrived on the Pacific Northwest Coast. At Nootka Sound the schooner was finished months before Margaret arrived. Little is known about the schooner. Its name is unknown. It was probably about 30 tons, built by Mr. Smith, the head carpenter, and launched in December 1792. By the time Margaret arrived the schooner had collected upwards of a thousand sea otter skins. While trading in near Ninstints, Haida Gwaii, Magee found that the Haida \\"...would not sell them [sea otter furs] for anything but Moose skins which we had none of. These skins the[y] call Clemmons which if we had would command skin for skin.\\" The term \\"clemmon\\", also spelled \\"clammon\\", \\"clammel\\", and other ways, were hides of moose, elk, or sometimes caribou. Among other uses, the Tlingit and Haida used them as a base for armor. Sailing south in the Margaret, Magee obtained a quantity of clemmons at Barkley Sound and the Washington coast. Magee returned north and sold the hides \\"at the rate of 3 prime [sea otter] skins for the best sort [of clemmon] & 2 for the second\\". Between the Margaret and the schooner, over 3,000 sea otter pelts were collected in 1793, a remarkable feat given that there were at least ten competing ships. At the end of the 1793 trading season the Margaret sailed to China via Hawaii, arriving at Oahu in October and Canton in December 1793. The fate of the schooner is unknown. From Canton the Margaret returned to Boston in company with the schooner Jane, belonging to the Dorr family. On 17 August 1794 the Margaret arrived at Boston. Upon return, James Magee presented the Massachusetts Historical Society with an \\"extract of the log-books and journals\\" and a large collection of \\"curiosities\\", most of which are now in the collection of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University. The voyage of the Margaret was very profitable and inspired many other New Englanders to enter the maritime fur trade. The original manuscript log of this voyage of the Margaret is lost, but an incomplete transcription survives in at least three copies owned by the Massachusetts Historical Society, the Peabody Essex Museum, and the Nantucket Historical Association. Historians disagree over who wrote the log. James R. Gibson believes it was the second mate, Otis Liscome. Rhys Richards says it was Cornelius Soule. After returning to Boston in August 1794 the Margaret was registered under new owners in November 1794, again in Boston. On 7 January 1796 the Margaret was wrecked on Gooseberry Rocks, about out from Marblehead, Massachusetts. ==See also== *History of the west coast of North America *List of ships in British Columbia ==References== Category:1791 ships Category:Age of Sail merchant ships Category:Age of Sail merchant ships of the United States Category:Fur trade Category:Exploration ships Category:Haida Gwaii Category:History of the Pacific Northwest Category:History of Vancouver Island Category:Merchant ships of the United States Category:Pre-Confederation British Columbia Category:Ships built in Boston ","title":"Margaret (1791 ship)"},{"id":"63769935","text":"Umberto Rizzitano was an Italian academic, known for reviving Arab-Islamic studies in the University of Palermo and Sicily, neglected since the death of Michele Amari.The chair of Lingua e letteratura araba ('Arabic language and literature') in Palermo had been held with alternating prestige by Salvatore Morso, Vincenzo Mortillaro, Giuseppe Caruso, Salvatore Cusa and Bartolomeo Lagumina, until the exceptional decade between 1902 and 1913 by Carlo Alfonso Nallino, followed twenty years later by Ignazio Di Matteo. == Life == Rizzitano was born in Egypt, where his family (of Sicilian origin, from Messina) had moved for his father's work. Here he studied in Italian schools, perfecting his classical Arabic, written and spoken, as well as the Egyptian language, lazily defined as a \\"dialect\\". He graduated in 1937 from the University of Rome, where Prof. Michelangelo Guidi, acted as advisor on a thesis on the Umayyad poet, Ab≈´ Mi·∏•«ßan Nu·π£ayb b. RabƒÅ·∏• (),Partially published in the Rivista degli Orientali of the University of Rome in 1943 (pp. 421‚Äì471). on which he gave a report to the XX International Congress of Orientalists (Brussels, 5‚Äì10 September 1938). Rizzitano participated in WWII. When he almost immediately fell prisoner in 1940, to the Egyptian Sidi Barrani, he managed to escape and reach Cairo clandestinely before regaining Italy. Rizzitano was Libera docenza and assistant to the chair of Arabic language and literature at the University of Rome, where he had conducted his studies, however, he returned to Egypt as director of Italian at the University of Cairo and at the University of 'Ayn Shams, of the same Egyptian capital. In Cairo he directed the Institute of Italian Culture with untiring enthusiasm. In 1959 the chair in Palermo of Arabic language and literature was finally filled after decades of vacancy. Rizzitano was the undisputed winner. At the same time, his statement on the \\"Return of the teaching of the Arabic language and literature to the University of Palermo\\" outlined a budget and an operational project aimed at encouraging participation by the younger generation. Through tireless research, Rizzitano shaped this project assuming the role of bridge between Italian and Arab cultures. In 1949 he participated in the first translation into Italian, for Einaudi, of the complete Arabic version of One Thousand and One Nights,Originally in 4 volumes, Rizzitano's is the fourth, of VII + 787 pp. ‚Äì together with his fraternal friend Francesco Gabrieli, Antonio Cesaro, Virginia Vacca and Costantino Pansera and in that same 1944, he translated the novel Zaynab by Mohammed Hussein Heikal. In 1965 he published for the Institute for the Orient the masterpiece of ·π¨ƒÅhƒÅ ·∏§useyn, al-AyyƒÅm (‚ÄòThe Days‚Äô) and between 1975 and 1977 he participated in the first world edition of the manuscript of the geographical work of al-Idrisi sponsored by the Universit√† degli Studi di Napoli \\"L'Orientale\\" of Naples and by the Istituto italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente of Rome and updated the Biblioteca arabo-sicula by Michele Amari, in view of the National Edition of the works of the great Sicilian scholar. Rizzitano's attention to the issue of dialogue between religions and cultures led him, at the express invitation of the Arab Republic of Libya, to participate, as an Italian observer, in the Islamic-Christian colloquium held in Tripoli from 1 to 5 February 1975. He organized a famous international conference, held in Rome, Venice and Palermo, on the \\"Arab presence in European culture\\". In 1979 he became President of the Istituto per l'Oriente Carlo Alfonso Nallino, the oldest Italian non- university research center for modern and contemporary Arabists. His contributions on the emerging Egyptian literature of the twentieth century are fundamental, without forgetting the Arab-Sicilian literati, such as Ab≈´ l-·∏§asan  øAlƒ´ b.  øAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn al-·π¢iqillƒ´, called \\"al-Ballan≈´bƒ´\\" (or Billan≈´bƒ´, that is \\"of Villanova\\"). The bibliography of Umberto Rizzitano's writings records over 120 publications among those that have particularly distinguished his work as an Arabist and Islamist.Exactly 121. The complete bibliography has been published by the magazine Oriente Moderno, of the Istituto per l‚ÄôOriente Carlo Alfonso Nallino (of which he was a Councilor and then President in the three years preceding his sudden death), on n. 7‚Äì12 of 1980, at pp. 375‚Äì382. and confirms the fact that the continuous search for common historical, linguistic and literary roots had as its engine the demonstration of \\"a possibility of coexistence of men of different race and religion\\". He participated in numerous national and international conferences, where he always managed to fascinate the Arabic-speaking audience with his perfect pronunciation of the Arabic language and published numerous scientific contributions that still make him the most fruitful Sicilian scholar of Arabism after Amari, of whom he was the most worthy disciple. == Selected works == (Just some of the most significant of the 121 printed works by Rizzitano are listed) * Mohammed Hussein Heikal, Zeinab, translation by U.

The Army organized and deployed different types of railway regiments and battalions. As operations progressed, the railway units were used to support the American Expeditionary Forces as well. U.S. rail regiments moved both troops and supplies for the AEF and for the allies from the seaports to the front. ==Organization== Organization began with a survey group established by Secretary of War Newton D. Baker and railway executive Samuel Morse Felton Jr. This group, led by William Barclay Parsons, examined docks and rail traffic and recommended a solution for the United States. After Parsons' group observed that the France's ports were inadequate, its rail system was carrying all the traffic it could bear, and its canals were blocked, it requested that engineers be sent to France. The Army sent nine railway regiments, all filled with volunteers from U. S. railways, as follows: five construction regiments, three operations regiments, and one shop regiment. Railway regiments typically consisted of two battalions of three companies each. ==Railway units== ===First deployments=== * 11th Engineer Regiment (Railway) (standard gauge railway construction), organized at Fort Totten, New York in June 1917, moved to the port of embarkation, Hoboken, New Jersey in July 1917, overseas as S.O.S. troops from July 1917 to April 1919, moved to Camp Mills, New York in April 1919, demobilized at Camp Upton, New York in April 1919. * 12th Engineer Regiment (standard gauge railway operation), organized at St. Louis, Missouri in May 1918, moved to Camp Gaillard, Missouri in June 1917 and to the port of embarkation, Hoboken, New Jersey in July 1917, overseas as S.O.S. troops from July 1917 to April 1919, moved to Camp Upton, New York in April 1919, demobilized at Camp Funston, Kansas in May 1919 * 13th Engineer Regiment (standard gauge railway operation), organized at Chicago, Illinois in July 1917, moved to the port of embarkation, Hoboken, New Jersey in July 1917, overseas as S.O.S. troops from July 1917 to April 1919, moved to the port of embarkation, Hoboken, New Jersey in July 1917, overseas as S.O.S. troops until April 1919, moved to Camp Mills, New York in April 1919, demobilized at Camp Grant, Illinois in May 1919. * 14th Engineer Regiment (standard gauge railway operation), organized at Camp Rockingham, New Hampshire in June 1917, moved to the port of embarkation, Hoboken, New Jersey in July 1917, overseas as Army troops from July 1917 to April 1919, moved to Camp Devens, Massachusetts in April 1919, demobilized at Camp Devens in May 1919. * 15th Engineer Regiment (standard gauge railway construction), organized at Oakmont, Pennsylvania in May 1917, moved to the port of embarkation, Hoboken, New Jersey in July 1917, overseas as Army troops from July 1917 to April 1919, moved to Camp Upton, New York in April 1919, demobilized at Camp Sherman, Ohio in May 1919. * 16th Engineer Regiment (standard gauge railway construction), organized at Detroit, Michigan in May 1917, moved to the port of embarkation, Hoboken, New Jersey in August 1917, overseas as S.O.S. troops from August 1917 to April 1919, moved to Camp Upton, New York in April 1919, demobilized at Camp Custer, Michigan in May 1919. * 17th Engineer Regiment (standard gauge railway construction), organized at Atlanta, Georgia in July 1917, moved to the port of embarkation, Hoboken, New Jersey in August 1917, overseas as S.O.S. troops from August 1917 to April 1919, moved to Camp Merritt.

The countries agreed that the size of U.S. locomotives used in France would have a traction force limited only by the clearances and load-bearing capacity of French railways and that cars would match the capacity of the locomotives. After two test runs proved the feasibility of air brakes, the French agreed to allow American cars to be equipped with those brakes, which the French rolling stock was not. Instead of American knuckle couplers, U.S. trains would be equipped with couplers and buffers used in France. American trains were limited to a length of ; the limit was imposed by the length of French passing sidings. The standard American locomotive in use was the 2-8-0 Consolidation type. More than 1600 of the Consolidation locomotives were assembled in France by U.S. mechanics; most were allocated to the AEF. Almost twenty thousand American- made railway cars were received in France during the war and after the armistice.

The riots were in response to a series of anti-war articles written in a Federalist newspaper by federalist statesman Alexander Contee Hanson after the United States had declared war on United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland during the War of 1812. == Origins == At the 1808 United States presidential election the Democratic-Republican candidate James Madison won his first term as the President of the United States. Madison won the vast majority of his vote outside of the Federalist stronghold of New England. In Maryland, the vote was split with nine votes for Madison and two votes for the Federalist candidate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney.. On 18 June 1812, Madison signed off a declaration of war upon the United Kingdom, thus starting the War of 1812. Every Federalist member of congress voted against declaring war. A Federalist statesman in the Maryland House of Delegates named Alexander Contee Hanson launched the Federal Republican & Commercial Gazette newspaper in 1808. It became known as one of the nations most extreme federalist newspapers. == Riots == === 22 June === On the night of 22 June 1812, just four days after war had been declared, an angry mob gathered outside the office of the Federal Republican newspaper. Angered by the paper's criticism of the Republican administration, the entire office was leveled to its foundations and printing apparatus' were destroyed by the mob. One of the editors narrowly escaped with his life. One of the attackers was killed as he attempted to knock out a window on the upper floor and fell with it on to the street below. The papers editor, Alexander Contee Hanson, vowed to recommence the paper to assert his rights and resist oppression. The mobs continued for several more weeks and anyone with Federalist or Pro-British views were attacked. === 27 July === By 27 July, Alexander Hanson had re-established the Federal Republican in the house of one of its proprietors, Mr. Wagner, and occupied it with around fifteen to twenty other men including James Lingan and Henry Lee III. Fearing that another mob may form, the men were prepared to defend the house and armed themselves with muskets, pistols and swords. Shortly after eight o' clock in the evening a mob formed outside and threw stones at the house which broke the windows and burst open the shutters. Henry Lee fired warning shots over the heads of the mob to try and frighten them away, but to no avail. The mob broke open the lower door and were fired upon, hitting and killing a man named Dr. Gale, forcing him to be dragged off by the mob. The violence continued throughout the night in which resulted in several men being wounded. === 28 July === Around sunrise the next day, the mob brought an artillery field piece and placed it in front of the house, but they were prevented from firing it by the arrival of mayor Edward Johnson and other officials. The men were eventually persuaded to vacate the house and taken to the Baltimore Prison under armed guard. The men were marched through the streets on the one mile journey, protected by two lines of around fifty infantry and twenty Dragoons. Some of the men were injured as protesters who lined the streets threw stones. The men were placed in the prison without armed guard, that despite the mayor promising one and stating that he would lose his own life before the men should be hurt. In the company of the mayor were three men, two named Mumma and Maxwell, one of which had a key in his hand. The men said they were acquaintances of the jailer, but the men suspected that they had bad intentions, having been seen as part of the mob before. A mob said to number around 300 soon gathered outside the prison by nightfall and managed to break in to the prison almost instantly without exertion, making the men believe that it was opened by someone with a key, possibly Mumma or Maxwell. The men attempted to rush the mob to escape, but to no avail, and nine of them were beaten for a number of hours whilst others were not recognized by the mob and managed to escape unhurt. The men had penknives stuck in-to their faces and hands and had hot candle grease poured into their eyes. James Lingan was killed and an attempt was made to cut off the nose of Henry Lee. Robert Thompson was tarred and feathered and paraded around town on the back of a cart. The men were eventually saved by a Dr. Hall, who encouraged the mob to retire until morning. Hall and four other doctors tended to the men's wounds and commandeered Carriages for the men to make their escape. == Aftermath == Alexander Hanson later moved to Georgetown where he continued to publish his newspaper unmolested. He also continued his political career, elected as a Federalist to the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Congresses until his resignation in 1816. He was then elected to the United States senate in 1816 until his death on his estate in Elkridge, Maryland having never fully recovered from his injuries. Henry Lee suffered severe internal injuries during the violence and was in constant physical pain. He sought relief in the warmer climate of the West Indies but when his condition did not improve, he attempted to return home but died on the way on Cumberland Island in Georgia James Lingan was buried in Georgetown in a funeral procession that was headed by George Washington Parke Custis and attended by some of the men who survived the mob. Lingan's remains were moved many years after his death to Arlington National Cemetery. == References == Category:Riots and civil disorder in Baltimore Category:1812 in Maryland Category:War of 1812 Category:Political riots in the United States ","title":"1812 Baltimore riots"},{"id":"63770069","text":"The Battle of Bor was one of the first battles of the South Sudanese Civil War, consisting of a series of clashes for the city of Bor, the capital of Jonglei State, between the SPLA and SPLA defectors under Peter Gadet, part of the force that would become the SPLA-IO. The city changed hands four times between December 18, 2013 and January 18, 2014, ultimately leaving the SPLA in control. == Background == On December 15, 2013, clashes broke out in the capital, Juba, as primarily Nuer units defected from the SPLA, the army of South Sudan. During the clashes, Dinka soldiers killed Nuer civilians in what some Nuer called a massacre. Tensions rose in Bor in Jonglei State, and three Dinka (all members of the Bor subgroup) were killed in incidents around the city on December 17. Throughout the battle comparisons were made to the Bor massacre of 1991, during the Second Sudanese Civil War, in which Nuer forces under Riek Machar killed an estimated 2,000 Dinka. == The Battle == Bor and the surrounding towns in which the battle occurred On December 18, 2013, at 02:30, around 2,000 soldiers under Peter Gadet, the commander of the 8th Division, a primarily Nuer unit, defected and launched a surprise attack with tanks, rockets, mortars, and artillery on the Panpandiar and Malual-Chaat military camps outside Bor, overrunning them by around 05:00. Fighting spread into the city, and a large part of the civilian population fled. By the evening of December 18, Gadet's troops were in control of the city center. On December 21, gunfire hit two US military airplanes attempting to evacuate American citizens from South Sudan, wounding four servicemen and forcing the planes to turn back. Also on December 21, there were reports of Ugandan jets bombing rebel positions. Around 15,000 civilians had fled to the UN base at Bor by December 22, leading to the UN reinforcing the base. Elements of the 3rd Division were rushed to Juba as the SPLA prepared to take back Bor. On December 24, the SPLA declared victory after taking Panpandiar and Malual- Chaat and then most of the city as Gadet's troops made an orderly retreat, but fighting continued near the airport. There were no Christmas services in the city on December 25 as the fighting moved north of Bor to the town of Padak. On December 27, Ugandan MiG-29 jets bombed rebel positions around Bor, and on December 30 Uganda confirmed it had sent troops into South Sudan. By December 30 the youths of the Nuer White Army at joined the rebels in an attempt to retake Bor. On December 31, the rebels had control of most of Bor, with the SPLA controlling the airport. President Salva Kiir declared a state of emergency in Jonglei State on January 1, 2014, as the rebels moved south in the direction of Juba along the Bor-Juba road. The SPLA began releasing Equatorian garrisons to Juba, and Uganda also sent reinforcements. On January 4, while moving from Juba to the frontline in the town of Pariak, south of Bor, two groups of SPLA troops were ambushed, suffering heavy losses, including the death of Brigadier General Abraham Jongroor Deng. On January 5, SPLA forces took Pariak and pushed to the outskirts of Bor. However, the rebels launched an attack from the east on Pariak, now behind the front lines, but were repulsed. On January 17, Gadet's forces, overwhelmed by airstrikes and not wanting an engagement with the Ugandans, withdrew from Bor. However, the SPLA and the Uganda People's Defence Force did not enter the city until January 18, believing that the rebels were still there. == Aftermath == After of month of conflict, Bor was mostly destroyed from fighting and looting. Upon regaining the city, SPLA soldiers tried to force their way into the UN camp. The camp still contained thousands of people, leading to a measles outbreak about a week after the end of the fighting. == References == Category:South Sudanese Civil War Category:Battles in 2013 Category:Battles in 2014 ","title":"Battle of Bor"},{"id":"63770085","text":"The Bobadilla family was one of the most wealthy and influential families within the Kingdom of Spain, particularly during the Age of Discovery. ==Overview== The family had a long history of service and ties to the crown of Castile.

The term 'land' in this article includes buildings and other structures upon land.Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012 s.113, meaning of land. Example missives are available to view on the Law Society of Scotland and Property Standardisation Group websites. The missives of sale form the first of three stages required to validly transfer ownership of land in Scotland. The three stages are: # The Contractual Stage (The Missives of Sale) # The Conveyancing Stage # The Registration Stage == Principles of the contract and conveyance stages == === Traditio legal system === The contractual stage or missives of sale only create binding personal obligations (and their respective personal rights) which are enforceable under the law of obligations (Scottish contract law). These obligations are usually among other things, an obligation on the Seller to grant a disposition transferring ownership and an obligation for the Buyer to pay the purchase price and an obligation for the Buyer to take delivery of the granted disposition. The obligations under a contract are personal rights, rights in personam, so the contract alone does not create or transfer the real right of ownership in itself.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Transfer of Ownership, para 642. This is because Scots law follows the principle that traditionibus non nudis pactis dominia rerum transferuntur: ownership is transferred by delivery (or other conveyance) and not by bare contract.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia,PROPERTY - PART I: GENERAL LAW (Volume 18), Ch. 13. TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP, para 606. === Abstract legal system === Only a conveyance, as a separate legal legal act, can effect the transfer agreed to under the contract between the parties. As well as being a traditio system, Scots law also uses the principle of 'abstraction', meaning the conveyance does rely on the cause of the transfer. In Scots law the recognised causa for transfers of land are: * Contract * Gift * Exchange of land (called a Contract of Excambion) * Transfer in trust, expressly or otherwise The validity of the conveyance (the transfer of property) does not depend on the validity of the cause of the transfer as Viscount StairViscount Stair is an institutional writer and as such is an authoritative source of law in Scots law. describes: > \\"We do not follow that subtility of annulling deeds, because they are sine > causa‚Ä¶ and therefore narratives expressing the cause of the disposition, are > never inquired into, because, though there were no cause, the disposition is > good.‚ÄôStair, II, 3.14. Therefore, Scotland differs from common-law jurisdictions such as England & Wales by requiring a conveyance stage as well as the formation of a contract. While a conveyance may be valid irrespective of the contract, the reasons for the contract's invalidity may also extend to invalidate the conveyance as a vitium reale. This can arise in certain cases of fraud or where the Seller lacks capacity.T. B. Smith, 'Error and transfer of title' (1967) The journal of the Law Society of Scotland. == Stage one of voluntary transfer of land: the missives of sale == The first stage of a voluntary transfer of land, as described above, is typically contractual in nature, where parties negotiate the formal contract of sale between the owner (the Seller) and the Buyer. In Scots law, this contract is known as the missives of sale and typically are a series of formal letters with each parties offers and qualifications (containing conditions needed to be complied by either party). With the corporeal heritable property, the nature of its property's usage will reflect on the missives of sale, especially where the property is residential or commercial property. === Requirements of written contract === Under the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995, a written document is required for the creation of a contract for transfer, variation or extinction of a real right in land.Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995 section 1(2(a(i))). As ownership is a real right, a written contract is required. Unlike common contracts, which form one single document, the contract is laid out across multiple letters, the missives. The missives of sale can be considered a valid written contract because the buyer has made an offer in one document and the seller has accepted in another.Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995 s.2(1(2)). A person cannot make a contract orally or by any other means in relation to the sale of heritable property, other than by writings subscribed by the granter (ie: the Seller in the missives of sale)Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995 s.2(1) or through the use of electronic documents compliant with section 9B of the 1995 Act.Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995 s.9B === Electronic documents === A contract is capable of being formed by electronic documents, such as by e-mail, if they are validly executed under s.9B of the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995. This electronic document must be _authenticated_ by the party sending it (ie: the Buyer/Seller) and meet any requirements made by the Scottish Ministers, the legal name for the Scottish Government.Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995 s.9B(1(a)). Authenticated means: > \\"Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995 Section 9B (2) An electronic > document is authenticated by a person if the electronic signature of that > person‚Äî (a) is i _ncorporated into_ , or _logically associated_ with, the > electronic document, (b) was _created by the person by whom it purports to > have been created_ , and (c) is of such type, and _satisfies such > requirements_ (if any), as may be prescribed by the _Scottish Ministers in > regulations_.\\" The Scottish Government has introduced regulations for electronic documents under the Electronic Documents (Scotland) Regulations 2014 (SSI 2014/83). Under the 2014 Regulations, only an \\"advanced electronic signature\\" is capable of being an electronic signature, which requires \\"sophisticated technology\\" and must comply with the Electronic Signature Regulations 2002. Solicitors in Scotland have access to advanced electronic signature technology through their Law Society of Scotland smartcard so can execute these documents on their client's behalf. == Formation of missives of sale == In Scots law, a contract is created when an offer from one party is accepted by another party (sometimes coined as 'offer + acceptance = contract'). However, as discussed above, this contract must be done in writing where it involves the transfer of ownership under the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995. === Conditional offers === A Buyer will often include conditions that have to be met in his offer in the missives. In residential property, this is usually done by incorporating the Scottish Standard Clauses (see below) into the offer, which includes such conditions such as having sight of reports on the property or the inclusion of any moveable property (such as white goods) in the sale of the property. Such conditions may be suspensive, which will prevent the creation of a legally binding contract until the conditions are complied with. === Qualified acceptance === A Seller of property can accept the Buyer's offer to buy outright as a de plano acceptance. However, it is usually common practice to qualify an acceptance by the making of further conditions. Where a seller makes a qualified acceptance, Scots law treats this as new offer, an offer to sell, which the Buyer must then accept de plano or issue a new offer to buy with further or amended conditions; the offer to buy is effectively 'destroyed' by the qualified acceptance or offer to sell and cannot be relied upon by the Seller.Wolf and Wolf v Forfar Potato Co 1984 SLT 10 This creates a 'ping pong' effect of a series of offers to sell/offers to purchase between the two parties, also termed missives, with no formally agreed contract until one party accepts the other's offer de plano. The final offer and de plano acceptance letters form the contract of sale in Scots law, hence the contract being called the missives (ie: letters) of sale. === Time limits === It is possible to qualify an offer to buy/qualified acceptance with a time limits for acceptance where wording is clearly used for the other party to identify the deadline.Littlejohn v Hadwen (1882) 20 SLR 5; Bell Principles s 73; Gloag p 35; W W McBryde The Law of Contract in Scotland (3rd edn, 2007) para 6-57 However, a new counter-offer made within the time limit will 'destroy' the qualified acceptance time limit. Where no time limit is made, the offer or counter-offer will cease for acceptance after the passage of a reasonable time.Thomson v James (1855) 18 D 1 at 10; Stair Institutions I,3,9. === The postal rule === When a party accepts the other parties' offer to purchase/offer to sell de plano, it is effective to create a binding contract from the moment it is posted or sent to a document exchange irretrievably (such as DX) not when it is received by the other party. This is due to the application of the doctrine known as the Postal Acceptance Rule in Scots law.Thomson v James (1855) 18 D 1; Henthorn v Fraser [1892] 2 Ch 27.  Abolition of the postal acceptance rule  The Scottish Law Commission has published a report in 2018 (Report on Review of Contract Law: Formation, Interpretation, Remedies for Breach, and Penalty Clauses, SLC Report 252) recommending the abolition of the postal acceptance rule and its replacement with a new statutory regime, available to view in its draft form on the Scottish Law Commission website. At the time of writing, it remains to be seen whether this draft bill accompanying the report will be introduced into the Scottish Parliament.Response from the Scottish Government Minister for Community Safety, Ash Denham MSP to the 2018 Report. Available at: https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/files/8615/4936/1366/Response_from_the_Scottish_Government_to_Reports_on_Contract_Law_Report_No_252_and_Moveable_Transactions_Report_No_249.pdf === Withdrawing an offer to buy/offer to sell === There is no requirement to withdraw an offer or qualified acceptance by formal writing under the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995.MacMillan v Caldwell 1990 SC 389, 1991 SCLR 73, 1991 SLT 325, OH. It is not possible in Scots law for a party to withdraw their own qualifications to an offer once these qualifications have been received by the other party, and then to send a new de plano acceptance to the other party's offer in an attempt to create a valid contract which could not have been concluded previously.Rutterford Ltd v Allied Breweries Ltd 1990 SCLR 186, 1990 SLT 249, OH. In MacMillan v Caldwell,1990 SC 389, 1991 SCLR 73, 1991 SLT 325, OH. NB: This is an Outer House judgment and may be overruled by a subsequent new case in the Inner House or United Kingdom Supreme Court. Lord Kirkwood held that once one of the parties indicated he was no longer prepared to contract, the other party cannot create the contract by accepting de plano an existing offer.1990 SC 38 However, the onus will be on the party who made the offer to prove that timeous notice of withdrawal of the offer was communicated to the other party's agent before any valid acceptance de plano is made.1990 SC 389 === Prior communings rule and clauses === At common law, following Winston v Patrick,1980 SC 246 the delivery of a disposition supersedes any personal obligations in the contract, even if collateral in nature. The Contract (Scotland) Act 1997 altered this common law rule, so that the missives are no longer superseded by the disposition.Contract (Scotland) Act 1997 s.2 However, many conveyancers still include the use of a 2-year supersession clause in the Missives of Sale to ensure that contractual obligations come to end after 2 years rather than by negative prescription under the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Conveyancing (2nd reissue), Ch 3, Structure and Form of Deeds, para 81. It is important to note that the use of this clause will apply to both Buyer's and Seller's obligations under the contract.Pena v Ray 1987 SC 1, 1987 SLT 609, OH. == Residential property == In cases of residential property, the Seller will place the property for sale on the market through an estate agent of solicitor firm. === Home report === Depending on the nature of the residential property, the Seller typically must obtain a home report (including a questionnaire and survey report) when placing the property on the market,Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 s.98; The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 (Prescribed Documents) Regulations 2008. excluding:See The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 (Prescribed Documents) Regulations 2008. * Property for sale as part of a portfolio. * Seasonal and holiday accommodation. * Property for sale alongside or ancillary to non- residential property. * Property used for both residential and non-residential use * Property which is unoccupied and unsafe for occupation * Property which has not been previously used as a house before. === Missives process in residential property transactions === The Seller may advertise the property on the market at a fixed price or use a blind-bidding system whereby multiple offerers silently bid against each other without knowledge of the other offeror's offered purchase price. The offeror, if they wish to purchase the property, will submit a formal written offer through their solicitor to the Seller's agents to purchase the residential property. The offer will outline the bid price and any conditions to be complied with by the Seller, such as the Buyer having sight of reports on the property or the inclusion of any moveable property (such as white goods) in the sale of the property. Only moveable property that has acceeded to the heritable property will be included in the transfer automatically. The seller with place a closing date, the date on which the Seller decides to stop receiving offers. The Seller will then review the offers made by the prospective buyers and choose a preferred buyer and will respond to this preferred buyer's offer. This response, called the acceptance, may accept the offer outright, known as a simple or de plano acceptance, resulting in a binding contract between the parties in Scots law. However, it is common for the Seller's initial response to be a qualified acceptance in order to avoid creating a binding missives of sale at an early stage. Without a de plano acceptance outright to either parties' terms, there is no binding contract.  Missives in newly built homes  Missives in newly built homes are typically offered by the Builder at a fixed price under a standard-form Offer to Sell issued by the Seller. The terms and conditions of the offer will be non-negotiable and the Buyer should receive legal advice before signing the document, as this is acceptance de plano results in a legally enforceable contract in Scotland. === The Scottish standard clauses === Because of the individualistic nature of offers of sale/offers to purchase, largely because of the discrete natures of residential properties, the system of missives in residential property became liable to complexity. Over time, standard styles (templates) became used in localities and across Sheriffdoms in an effort to simplify the missives stage. The Law Society of Scotland's Property Committee has built on this work which culminated with the publication of the Scottish Standard Clauses. These are available to view online alongside public guidance on the Law Society of Scotland Website. Today, the Scottish Standard Clauses have effectively become the \\"national Conditions of Sale\\" despite its recent completion in December 2014, and commencement of usage on 5 January 2015. The Scottish Standard Clauses are registered as a public document in the Books of Council and Session for all solicitors in Scotland to incorporate them into the missives of sale to simplify the process. However, there is nothing to preclude a solicitor from using their own drafting in the missives of sale of property. == Commercial property missives of sale == Commercial Property transactions may involve planning permissions and other legal requirements under planning law prior to the usage of land as a commercial property. As such, the missives of commercial property may have numerous conditions and complex terms, leading to a large amount of contractual negotiations. The Property Standardisation Group was formed by four law firms, CMS (formerly known as Dundas & Wilson), Dentons (formerly known as Maclay Murray & Spens), Pinsent Masons (formerly known as McGrigors), and Shepherd and Wedderburn in 2001 in a combined effort to produce common agreed styles (templates) for transactions of commercial heritable property in Scotland. These templates are available to view on the Property Standardisation Group website. Commercial transactions usually operate by the sharing of a draft agreement between the parties agents, now commonly done online on secure cloud software where both parties' agents can amend the document or by e-mail exchange of draft documents between agents, until the agreement of a draft missives of sale.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Conveyancing (2nd reissue), Chapter 2, para 8. The parties, or their authorised agents, can then formally sign and bind the parties to the contract in line with the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995. == Property sold at auction (public roup) == Heritable property may also be sold at an auction, called a roup in Scots law. The Seller prepares a standard contract that is exhibited to the bidders in advance of the auction.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch.4, Corporeal Heritable Property, para 641. The winning bidder at the roup, signs a minute of enactment and preference to bind himself to the pre-prepared contract and becomes the Buyer.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch.4, Corporeal Heritable Property, para 641. == Conclusion of missives == Once the parties contractual negotiations have concluded, a contract will be validly created where, as discussed above, a party makes a simple acceptance to another party's offer, which can incorporate acceptance to any previous qualified acceptances/offers conditions made. This point is known as the conclusion of missives and ends the contractual stage of the voluntary transfer of land. The conclusion of missives typically takes a few weeks to occur due to the due diligence process that each party must undertake before the creation of a legally binding agreement.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Conveyancing (2nd reissue), Ch 2, Missives and Other Obligations, para 9. However, the parties only obtain a personal right under contract law when the missives conclude; ie: there is no contract until then. Following the conclusion of missives, the Buyer will only have a personal right against the Seller not a real right (right in rem). However, the parties can move to the conveyancing stage. After conclusion, the missives, as an enforceable contract, may only be revoked by written discharge of the two parties.Inglis v Lowrie 1990 SLT (Sh Ct) 60 Should the parties wish to amend rather than discharge the current missives to enter into a new contract, they may apply to the Sheriff Court or Court of Session for a rectification order under Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1985 section 8. == Warrandice of Missives of Sale == A full and absolute warrandice (in other jurisdictions called a warranty) is implied by law in the missives of sale.Stair Institutions I,14.7. This means that the Seller warrants (ie: guarantees) the following four warranties: # Absolute Good Title # No lesser real rights (ie: no liferent or security etc. in the land) # No unusual real conditions (ie: no unusual burdens or servitudes attached to the land) # No future acts will be made prejudicial to the Buyer's title (ownership) to the land. In practice, these warranties are often expressly granted, which will vary or add to the implied warranties of the Seller, such as the use of the Scottish Standard Clauses. In the unlikely event that the missives are silent as to warranties, those implied by law will apply. === Warranty 1: absolute good title === The Seller warrants that he is able to convey ownership validly to the Buyer.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Transfer of Ownership, para 708. The warrant also covers that the Seller's right of ownership (title) is absolutely good, and not voidable or excluded from the Keeper of the Register of Scotland's indemnity.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Transfer of Ownership, para 708.Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012 s.73: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2012/5/part/7/enacted Hume, the institutional writer, and source of law in Scotland, says the Seller must also furnish the Buyer with evidence that the title is good.Hume Lectures vol II (Stair Soc vol 13, 1949 ed G C H Paton) p 38. The warrant must cover the whole of the property transferred, ie: the Seller must own all of the land that is agreed to be transferred under the Missives of Sale. An example of this can be commonly found in case law where the Seller contracts to transfer the entire land, that is to say a coele usuque ad centrum (from the heavens to the centre of the Earth) but the mineral rights, found in the strata of the land as a separate conventional tenement, are not owned by the Seller but by a third party but would be warranted to be transferred to the Buyer.Whyte v Lee (1879) 6 R 699; Crofts v Stewart's Trustees 1927 SC (HL) 65, 1927 SLT 362; Mossend Theatre Co Ltd v Livingstone 1930 SC 90, 1930 SLT 108; Campbell v M'Cutcheon 1963 SC 505, 1963 SLT 290 In a breach of this warranty, the Buyer can rescind the Missives of Sale, ending the contract between the two parties. Following Holms v Ashford Estates Ltd,[2009] CSIH 28, 2009 SCLR 428, 2009 SLT 389. it is settled that a warrant that the land transferred is fit for the purpose the Buyer has informed the Seller it was to be used does not fall within this warranty. === Warranty 2: No lesser real rights === The Seller warrants that there are no lesser real rights held in the land that is to be transferred, excluding leases.Hume Lectures vol IV (Stair Soc vol 17, 1955 ed G C H Paton) p 150; Bell Principles s 895; Dewar v Aitken (1780) Mor 16637 Leases have conflicting legal authority on whether they are covered by the Seller's no lesser real rights warranty. Older legal authorities from the 16th and 17th century Kingdom of Scotland courts appear to suggest that the implied warranty does not cover leases. The rationale for this was that historically, feudal owners would rarely occupy the land they owned, which was often leased or given to vassals through subinfeudation so a warranty that land has no lesser real rights was not relevant.Early case law: Simpson v Zoung (1563) Mor 16565; Lady Pitferran (1629) Mor 16577.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Transfer of Ownership, para 703. However, Hume, the institutional writer, and source of law in Scotland, wrote that only leases of a very long duration, at low rent, or where the lease gives the tenant large- ranging powers over the land, would be covered by this warranty.Hume vol IV,149. The modern source of authority in this area is Lothian and Border Farmers Ltd v M'Cutcheon 1952 SLT 450, OH. which followed the old authorities that a lease was not covered by warranty. However, there is academic criticism that this decision was incorrect, and remains a first instance judgment of the Outer House of the Court of Session.J M Halliday Conveyancing Law and Practice in Scotland vol I (1985) para 4-38(6). In any event, conveyancers will often add a clause to the missives, as is done in the Scottish Standard Clauses, that the property will be provided to the seller for entry and vacant possession. The occupancy rights of a spouse under the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981 are akin to a statutory quasi-real right and it is uncertain whether this is included in the warranty.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Transfer of Ownership, para 709. In any event, it is standard practice to include a term in the missives concerning occupancy rights, as is done in the Scottish Standard Clauses. === Warranty 3: No unusual real conditions === It was established definitively in 1835 that real conditions, such as servitudes and burdens, were covered by the absolute warranty made by the Seller.Urquhart v Halden (1835) 13 S 844. It is now implied in law that a Seller warrants that there are no real conditions on the property where:Welsh v Russell (1894) 21 R 769, 1 SLT 594; M'Connell v Chassells (1903) 10 SLT 790, OH; Armia Ltd v Daejan Developments Ltd 1978 SC 152, 1977 SLT (Notes) 9, 49, revsd 1979 SC (HL) 56, 1979 SLT 147; Morris v Ritchie 1992 GWD 33-1950, OH. # that the condition was _unknown_ to the Buyer at the time when the missives concluded; # that the condition is _unusual_ either generally or in relation to the _type_ and _location_ of the property in question; and # that the condition results in a _material diminution in the value_ of the property. All three tests must be satisfied for a claim in warrandice to succeed against an unknown real condition.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Transfer of Ownership, para 705. In practice, due diligence checks by each parties' agents should identify any previously unknown real conditions prior to the conclusion of missives.When determining knowledge, the court will look at whether by the Buyer's \\"negligence and inexcusabill ignorance\\"Drummond v Steuart (1549) Mor 16565 (translated from Scots: negligence and inexcusable ignorance) prevented him from having actual knowledge, if it did the court may hold the Buyer had constructive knowledge, knowledge based on the exercise of reasonable care.Drummond v Steuart (1549) Mor 16565 Therefore, a Buyer is deemed to know of and to expect real conditions of a standard type.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Transfer of Ownership, para 705. If the Seller avers, ie: makes a factual submission to the court, that the Buyer knew of the condition at the date of the conclusion of missives, the Seller alone must prove this evidential onus.M'Connell v Chassells (1903) 10 SLT 790 at 793, OH, per Lord Kincairney. Where the court finds that a Buyer acted with negligence and inexcusabill ignorance, thereby rejecting the warranty claim; parties who acted through a solicitor may alternatively be able to pursue a claim against the agent handling the sale for professional negligence. === Warrandice 4: No future acts will be made prejudicial to the Buyer's title to (ownership of) the land === The fourth warranty guarantees that the Seller will take no future acts that would prejudice the Buyer's contractual right to ownership. A Seller would breach their warranty where they grant a subsequent disposition to another individual or subsequently grant lesser real rights in the land to third parties after the Buyer has received their disposition. This warranty ceases to be relevant once ownership validly transfers to the Buyer, following the registration of the disposition.Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012 s.50. == Remedies to breach of contract (missives of sale) == === Breach of Warrandice of Missives of Sale === If a Buyer later discovers a latent defect in their title, it might prove impossible to trace the Seller or their predecessors following completion, or the date of entry, whereby the Buyer has paid the purchase price and the Seller has issued a disposition (this is usually done on the same day). As such the efficacy of warrandice as a legal remedy for Buyers later discovering latent defects in the property's title is limited. The point at which a warranty becomes enforceable is also of conflicting legal and academic opinion. Bell, the institutional writer, is of the opinion that: \\"the buyer has an absolute right to a good title ... and unless he shall have unequivocally discharged this right, he is not bound ... to wait till his right is challenged. It is a sufficient ground of exception to the title if it be liable to challenge\\"Bell Principles s 890 However, there are qualifications to the rule, such as a requirement that an action of ejection has been raised against the Buyer. Requirement for judicial eviction Contrary to wide belief by conveyancers,Such as the authors of Sinclair & Stewart. Conveyancing practice in Scotland (Seventh edition. ed.). London. . OCLC 1100869226. there is no requirement for ejection to enforce a warranty found in the Missives of Sale.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Transfer of Ownership, para 707. Judicial Eviction in the Scots law definition, deriving from Roman law, is not the laymen sense of the word eviction, whereby a tenant is removed from the property of the landlord. Instead, judicial eviction is where the true owner of the property asserts their right of ownership. An action of eviction must be raised in the court by the true Owner of the land and cannot be raised by the Buyer or by the Buyer raising a declarator (ie: a legal action requesting the Court to make a legal finding in a matter). If the Keeper of the Registers of Scotland exercises her power of rectification of the Land Register, this is also presumed to be considered a judicial eviction for the purposes of warrandice.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Transfer of Ownership, para 707. The requirements for judicial eviction or a serious threat of eviction by someone who has a superior title differs where the party relies on the warrandices in the disposition _._ Morris v Rae [2011] CSIH 30; 2011 S.C. 654; 2011 S.L.T. 701 (Inner House); [2012] UKSC 50; 2012 S.L.T. 88 (Supreme Court). The warrandice of a disposition has been given recent treatment by the Supreme Court in Morris v Rae, which now requires eviction (interference with the Buyer's right of ownership) or the threat of eviction by someone who has a better title (right) to the land.Morris v Rae [2011] CSIH 30; 2011 S.C. 654; 2011 S.L.T. 701 (Inner House); [2012] UKSC 50; 2012 S.L.T. 88 (Supreme Court)R. Rennie, 'Warrandice - the threat of the threat of eviction' (2013) Scots Law Times Issue 4, 27-29. Supersession of disposition warrandice over missives warrandice Typically, the delivery of a disposition with warrandice will supersede the Missives of Sale's warrandice given by the Seller. However, there are three scenarios where the Warrandice of Missives of Sale continue to be relevant: 1) Delayed settlement - Without the disposition being issued, the Buyer can only rely on the warrandice in the missives of sale. 2) Abandoned transaction following Missives of Sale - After the missives of sale, if the transaction is abandoned (ie: no disposition issued), the Buyer is still able to use the Missives of Sale 3) Contractual clause in Missives expressly preventing non-supersession of the warrandice. Terms may also still be enforceable under the Contract (Scotland) Act 1997. Remedy Where the missives of sale warrandice have been breached and are still enforceable, see above, the Buyer can typically rescind the Missives (ie: terminate the contract) and/or seek remedies of (A) raise an action of specific implement and/or (b) claiming damages for breach of a personal obligation. However, if the warrant breached was a positive obligation of the Seller, commonly in Missives of Sale these are obligation to provide a disposition, the Seller is allowed a reasonable period to perform the obligation. Rescission (ie: termination) of the Missives is only permitted following the conclusion of this reasonable period. If it transpires that the Seller has no ownership of the land at all (ie: neither ownership of the land, a legal or conventional separate tenement) then this would be considered irremediable and rescission is available to the Buyer immediately. If a breach occurs in which rescission is not available, ie: there is no positive obligation on the Seller to enforce, then there is no availability of damages. However, in practice, a remedy for damages without rescinding the Missives is provided for in the terms of the Missives of Sale itself, this contractual provision follows the Roman law contractual remedy, the actio quanti minoris, which allows claims that where there has been a breach of contract by the seller, the Buyer is entitled to retain the property and claim damages based on a diminution in the value of the property.SLC Report on Three Bad Rules in Contract Law, https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/files/9912/7989/6661/rep152.pdf == Statutory personal bar == A statutory personal bar exists in Scots law in relation to written contracts, similar to the concept of esoppel in other jurisdictions. This protection allows an otherwise invalid contract to be held valid and enforceable where parties have acted in reliance of the contract with material (financial or otherwise) consequences. Under the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995, section 1(3) and 1(4) provides that: > \\"Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995 Section 1(3) Where a contract, > obligation or trust mentioned in subsection (2)(a) [list of situations where > writings are requiredl] above is not constituted in a document complying > with section 2 [written document] or, as the case may be, section 9B > [electronic documents] of this Act, _but one of the parties to the contract_ > , a creditor in the obligation or a beneficiary under the trust (‚Äúthe first > person‚Äù) has _acted or refrained from acting in reliance on the contrac_ t, > obligation or trust _with the knowledge_ and _acquiescence_ of the other > party to the contract, the _debtor_ in the obligation or the truster (‚Äúthe > second person‚Äù)‚Äî (a)the second person shall _not be entitled to withdraw > from the contrac_ t, obligation or trust; and (b)the contract, obligation or > trust _shall not be regarded as invalid_ , on the ground that it is not so > constituted, if the condition set out in subsection (4) below is satisfied. > Section 1(4) (4)The condition referred to in subsection (3) above is that > the position of the _first person_ ‚Äî (a)as a _result of acting or refraining > from acting_ as mentioned in that subsection _has been affected_ to a > _material exten_ t; and (b)as a _result of such a withdrawal_ as is > mentioned in that subsection _would be adversely affected_ to a _material > extent_.\\"[brackets and _underlines_ added] This means where the missives of sale were not created in compliance to the 1995 Act, such as by informal writings or oral agreement, can still be enforceable against a person where the other party has: # Has acted or refrained from acting in reliance on the contract, (e.g.: second party is the seller who has made an offer to purchase a house because he believed his house to be sold, the second party is the buyer who has made arrangements to leave her current property) # the second person knew of the party's actions, (e.g.: the second person (Buyer) was told that the person (Seller) was going to purchase another house, the second person (Buyer) told the person (Seller) that she was going to make arrangements to leave property) # The second person acquiesced to this acting or refraining from acting, (e.g.: the second person (Buyer) did not object to the Seller making a purchase another house, the second person (Seller) did not object to the Buyer quitting her current property and ceasing searching for another property) # as a result of the acting or refraining from acting, the first person has been affected to a _material_ extent. (e.g.: the first person (Seller) has now entered into a contract of sale, the first person (Buyer) has incurred cancellation costs and other fees) The first party then has to prove that if the second party does withdraw from the invalid contract, the first party would be _adversely affected_ to a material extent. As always in Scots civil law, the first person must prove the above statutory burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that it occurred. == References == Category:Scots property law Category:Scotland Category:Scots law ","title":"Missives of Sale (Scots law)"},{"id":"63770131","text":"Chris Claybrooks (born July 17, 1998) is an American football cornerback for the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL).

The first chemotherapy treatment was made available in 1958, and since then, several different types have been considered.

This form of targeted drug delivery makes use of a polymer-based macromolecular prodrug, where antibodies that can identify tumour cells and cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs are attached to the backbone. This allows for the treatment to selectively attack and destroy cancer cells, by using the antibody to tag the tumour, and selectively inducing an immune response.

It is a multivariate extension of the beta negative binomial distribution. It is also a generalization of the negative multinomial distribution (NM(k, p)) allowing for heterogeneity or overdispersion to the probability vector. It is used in quantitative marketing research to flexibly model the number of household transactions across several brands. If parameters of the Dirichlet distribution are \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}, and if : X \\\\mid p \\\\sim \\\\operatorname{NM}(x_0,\\\\mathbf{p}), where : \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\sim \\\\operatorname{Dir}(\\\\alpha_0,\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha), then the marginal distribution of X is a Dirichlet negative multinomial distribution: : X \\\\sim \\\\operatorname{DNM}(x_0,\\\\alpha_0,\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}). In the above, \\\\operatorname{NM}(x_0, \\\\mathbf{p}) is the negative multinomial distribution and \\\\operatorname{Dir}(\\\\alpha_0,\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha) is the Dirichlet distribution. ==Motivation== ===Dirichlet negative multinomial as a compound distribution=== The Dirichlet distribution is a conjugate distribution to the negative multinomial distribution. This fact leads to an analytically tractable compound distribution. For a random vector of category counts \\\\mathbf{x}=(x_1,\\\\dots,x_K), distributed according to a negative multinomial distribution, the compound distribution is obtained by integrating on the distribution for p which can be thought of as a random vector following a Dirichlet distribution: :\\\\Pr(\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\mid x_0, \\\\alpha_0, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha})=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{p}}\\\\Pr(\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\mid x_0, \\\\mathbf{p}) \\\\Pr(\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\mid\\\\alpha_0,\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha})\\\\textrm{d}\\\\mathbf{p} :\\\\Pr(\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\mid x_0, \\\\alpha_0, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha})={\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=0}^m{x_i}\\\\right)}{\\\\Gamma(x_0)\\\\prod_{i=1}^m x_i!}} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{B}(\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha)}\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{p}} \\\\prod_{i=0}^m p_i^{x_i+\\\\alpha_i - 1}\\\\textrm{d}\\\\mathbf{p} which results in the following formula: :\\\\Pr(\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\mid x_0, \\\\alpha_0, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha})={\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=0}^m{x_i}\\\\right)}{\\\\Gamma(x_0)\\\\prod_{i=1}^m x_i!}} \\\\frac{{\\\\mathrm{B}}(\\\\mathbf{x_+}+\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha_+)}{\\\\mathrm{B}(\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha_+)} where \\\\mathbf{x_+} and \\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha_+ are the m+1 dimensional vectors created by appending the scalars x_0 and \\\\alpha_0 to the m dimensional vectors \\\\mathbf{x} and \\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha respectively and \\\\mathrm{B} is the multivariate version of the beta function.

The joint distribution of the remaining random variates is \\\\mathrm{DNM}(x_0,\\\\alpha_0,\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha_{-}}) where \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha_{-}} is the vector with the removed \\\\alpha_i's. ===Conditional distributions=== If m-dimensional x is partitioned as follows : \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{x}^{(1)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{x}^{(2)} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\text{ with sizes }\\\\begin{bmatrix} q \\\\times 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ (m-q) \\\\times 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} and accordingly \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha} : \\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha^{(1)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha^{(2)} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\text{ with sizes }\\\\begin{bmatrix} q \\\\times 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ (m-q) \\\\times 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} then the conditional distribution of \\\\mathbf{x}^{(1)} on \\\\mathbf{x}^{(2)} is \\\\mathrm{DNM}(x_0^{\\\\prime},\\\\alpha_0^{\\\\prime},\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha^{(1)}) where : x_0^{\\\\prime} = x_0 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^{m-q} x_i^{(2)} and : \\\\alpha_0^{\\\\prime} = \\\\alpha_0 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^{m-q} \\\\alpha_i^{(2)} .

That is :\\\\Pr(\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\mid \\\\sum_{i=1}^m x_i =n, x_0, \\\\alpha_0, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha})= \\\\frac{n!\\\\Gamma\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\alpha_i\\\\right)} {\\\\Gamma\\\\left(n+\\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\alpha_i\\\\right)}\\\\prod_{i=1}^m\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(x_{i}+\\\\alpha_{i})}{x_{i}!\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha_{i})} . Notice that the equation does not depend on x_0 or \\\\alpha_0. ===Correlation matrix=== For \\\\alpha_0>2 the entries of the correlation matrix are :\\\\rho(X_i,X_i) = 1. :\\\\rho(X_i,X_j) = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{cov}(X_i,X_j)}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{var}(X_i)\\\\operatorname{var}(X_j)}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\alpha_i \\\\alpha_j}{(\\\\alpha_0+\\\\alpha_i-1)(\\\\alpha_0+\\\\alpha_j-1)}}. ===Heavy tailed=== The Dirichlet negative multinomial is a heavy tailed distribution. It does not have a finite mean for \\\\alpha_0 \\\\leq 1 and it has infinite covariance matrix for \\\\alpha_0 \\\\leq 2. It therefore has undefined moment generating function. ===Aggregation=== If :X = (X_1, \\\\ldots, X_m)\\\\sim\\\\operatorname{DNM}(x_0, \\\\alpha_0, \\\\alpha_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha_m) then, if the random variables with positive subscripts i and j are dropped from the vector and replaced by their sum, :X' = (X_1, \\\\ldots, X_i + X_j, \\\\ldots, X_m)\\\\sim\\\\operatorname{DNM} \\\\left(x_0, \\\\alpha_0, \\\\alpha_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha_i+\\\\alpha_j,\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha_m \\\\right). == Applications == ===Dirichlet negative multinomial as a urn model=== The Dirichlet negative multinomial can also be motivated by an urn model in the case when x_0 is a positive integer. Consider a sequence of independent and identically distributed multinomial trials, each of which has 1+m outcomes. Call one of the outcomes a ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù, and suppose it has probability p_0. The other m outcomes ‚Äì called \\"failures\\" - have probabilities p_1,p_2, \\\\ldots, p_m. If the vector (x_1, x_2, \\\\cdots x_m) counts the m types of failures before the x_0 success is observed, then the (x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_m) have negative mulitnomial distribution with parameters (x_0, p_1, \\\\ldots, p_m). If the parameters (p_0,p_1, \\\\ldots, p_m) are themselves sampled from a Dirichlet distribution with parameters (\\\\alpha_0, \\\\alpha_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_m), then the resulting distribution of (x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_m) is Dirichlet negative multinomial. The resultant distribution has 2+m parameters. ==See also== * Beta negative binomial distribution * Negative multinomial distribution * Dirichlet-multinomial distribution == References == Category:Multivariate discrete distributions ","title":"Dirichlet negative multinomial distribution"},{"id":"63770265","text":"Dustin Woodard (born March 8, 1998) is a former American football center.

DiNucci finished his high school career with 548-of-809 completions for 7,619 yards, 72 touchdowns and 23 interceptions. ==College career== Although he originally intended to enroll at the University of Pennsylvania, he decomitted and accepted a football scholarship from the University of Pittsburgh, after Pat Narduzzi was hired as the new head coach and became interested in recruiting DiNucci . As a redshirt freshman, he was a backup quarterback behind Nathan Peterman. His first game experience came in the final offensive series against Duke University. In the 2016 Pinstripe Bowl, he relieved an injured Peterman late in the third quarter, posting 3-of-9 completions for 16 yards, one touchdown, 2 interceptions and 2 carries for 18 yards in a 24-31 loss against Northwestern University. As a sophomore, he was named the starting quarterback before the seventh game against North Carolina State University, after senior Max Browne suffered a season-ending right shoulder injury. He was platooned during the year and eventually lost the starting position to true freshman Kenny Pickett, for the season finale 24-14 victory against the previously undefeated No. 2 University of Miami. He finished with 88-of-158 completions for 1,091 yards, 5 touchdowns and 5 interceptions. In December, he announced his decision to transfer to James Madison University. As a junior, he started all 13 games at quarterback, posting 211-of-309 completions for 2,275 yards, 16 passing touchdowns, 12 interceptions, 433 rushing yards and 9 rushing touchdowns (led the team). He received third-team All-CAA honors. He had a career-high 316 passing yards against Elon University. He passed for a career-best 4 touchdowns against the University of Rhode Island. He rushed for career highs of 104 rushing yards and 3 rushing touchdowns at Towson University. As a senior, he started all 16 games at quarterback, passing for 3,441 yards, 29 passing touchdowns, completed nearly 71% of his throws, had 122 carries for 569 yards and 7 rushing touchdowns. He earned All-CAA, CAA Offensive Player of the Year and AFCA first-team All-American honors. He led the Dukes to the FCS Championship Game, where the team lost to North Dakota State University.

Saint Thomas Becket window in Chartres Cathedral is a 1215-1225 stained-glass window in Chartres Cathedral, located behind a grille in the Confessors' Chapel, second chapel of the south ambulatory. 8.9 m high by 2.18 m wide, it was funded by the tanners' guild. The furthest left of five lancet windows in the chapel, it is difficult to view and is heavily corroded by glass oxidisation, which has made its left side especially hard to read. It is contemporary with the current cathedral, built after an 1194 fire. It was classed as a monument historique in the first listing in 1840. The window was restored by Gaudin in 1921 and by Lorin's workshop in 1996. It is split vertically into eleven equal registers by ten horizontal leadwork pieces. ==Motifs== The window, hidden behind the right pillar. The window is made up of four main circles, each on two registers. Those registers are made up of square panels showing the story and two border panels. Between each main circle is an intermediate register with a central quatrefoil with a square story panel at its centre, surrounded on both sides by two rectangular panels continuing the border and a half-quatrefoil also showing the story. The four circles with a blue background are bordered by a red \\"orle\\", then a blue \\"orle\\" sown with yellow quatrefoil flowers and by a narrow band of white pearls. == Background == Henry II of England made Thomas Becket chancellor of England in 1155, in which role he lived the life of a great lord. He then made him Archbishop of Canterbury in 1162, hoping he would submit the church to state power, but Thomas took the opposite course and was exiled to France, where he spent several long stays in Chartres, accompanied by his friend and secretary John of Salisbury, who in 1176 became Bishop of Chartres. Vie de Saint Thomas Becket, vitrail 18, La Cath√©drale de Chartres. In the meantime Thomas was murdered in Canterbury Cathedral by four of the king's knights in 1170 and canonised only three years later. The window was made only fifty years after Becket's exile and martyrdom, during the final years of Philip II Augustus's reign, which also saw the struggle against local powers giving rise to the Kingdom of France. Philip had ejected Odo of Sully as archbishop of Paris after the latter spoke against Philip's divorce, leading Odo to put the kingdom under interdict. This gave a contemporary French resonance to the window's portrayal of Becket resisting a 'bad king' interfering in the Church, whereas a 'good king' should protect the Church. ==Differences== The window's composition is very different to others at Chartres, in which the main subject's story was told uninterrupted from bottom to top. That of Becket shows the saint's exile in the first main circle on the bottom two registers, whilst the third register shows the donors in an unusually high position (they were usually shown at the base and sides of the lowest register). The main hagiography of Becket only begins in the fourth register onwards, with a halo only added on his deathbed after his martyrdom, though the exile images also show him with a halo. These anomalies suggest that the first main circle should be read as an independent narrative and a specific memorial to his visit to Chartres, perhaps even drawing on accounts of him by those who saw him there. This interpretation would make the register with the donors a border between the exile window and the main hagiography. == Description == ===Thomas crosses to France=== {  1a : Thomas Becket in Exile : A man holding a club pushes Thomas out of town towards a tree, shown with its crenellations and open gate (opening conventionally shown in red). Thomas is shown with a halo in episcopal vestments with his episcopal mitre and cross. His exile followed Henry II's promulgation on 30 January 1164 of the Constitutions of Clarendon, a collection of juridical procedures controlling the election of new prelates and gave royal courts the right to summon clergy. Becket was the only one to refuse to sign them and - accused of opposing royal authority - he decided to go into exile.  350px ---  1b : Exile of Thomas Becket's Family and Friends : Continuing 1a, it shows two men with clubs herding three men, a woman with a 'touret' hairstyle and two children before them. The first man in the centre carries a rectangular shape, possibly a book or a jewel-box. The treatment of the children's heads is unclear - one may be resting its head on the shoulder of another figure or the piece of glass may have been mis-assembled. The representation suggests an explusion by force as a criticism of Henry, whereas in reality Thomas willingly chose exile. :\\"all the saint's friends and family, without distinction of condition or fortune, dignity or order, age or sex, were exiled like him\\" (from the collected Chartres liturgies ‚Äî actus ergo in exilium).  350px ---  2a : Thomas Becket Meets Louis VII : The collection of liturgies at Chartres states that Thomas disembarked at Wissant, a village to the south-west of Calais on the C√¥te d'Opale and that on his journey from there to Sens he met Louis VII of France at Soissons and talked amicably with him. The panel shows Thomas with his episcopal mitre, vestments and cross at the centre and Louis with his crown and sceptre, contrasting his good kingship with Henry's bad kingship in trying to impose his will on the Church. To the left, behind Thomas, is a tonsured clergyman holding something in his right hand, possibly a gospel (attribute of a bishop, whose main mission was to evangelise) and making what seems to be the sign of peace with his left hand. Behind Thomas and the cleric is a stylised tree, meant to symbolise the meeting taking place outside the city walls, which contradicts the king's masonry throne, thought to symbolise the city of Soissons.  350px ---  2b : Thomas Becket Enters a City : Recognisable by his mitre, Thomas enters the city on horseback through a yellow doorway into the red inner city with a crenellated roof, talking to a man behind him, probably also on horseback. The scene's significance is unclear, possibly showing his entry into Sens, where he placed himself under papal protection; or more probably his re-entry into Canterbury after his return from exile, a scene which also replies to the first panel of the exile account.  350px } === Donors === { class=\\" center\\"  200px  220px  200px } === Life of Thomas Becket === The images quite faithfully follow the text of the office of matins for the feast of Thomas Becket on 29 December.  (i) Thomas, defender of the church  {  4a : Thomas Becket is consecrated archbishop : :\\"Thomas, born in London, in England, succeeded Th√©obald, Archbishop of Canterbury. He had previously honourably exercised the role of chancellor and showed himself strong and invincible in his episcopal duties.\\" Liturgy of the Hours (1960), Deuxi√®me nocturne de la Saint Thomas Becket. Thomas had been a lay archdeacon whilst chancellor and was ordained priest the day before being consecrated as archbishop. To the left is Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester consecrating Thomas archbishop. Both men wear mitres and hold episcopal crosses, whilst Thomas is shown in the pallium, symbolic of his rank as archbishop and his position as Primate of England and actually only sent by the Pope after Thomas's consecration. Behind him two clerks assist in the ceremony, the one on the left holding a gospel (symbolising the bishop's central role of evangelising) and the other holding a box with three jars of holy chrism with which Thomas is about to be anointed. The cathedral interior is symbolised by columns and arcades.  350px -----  4b : Tensions between Thomas and Henry II : :\\"When Henry II, king of England wished to pass laws contrary to the Church's dignity and interest in an assembly of prelates and noblemen of his kingdom, Thomas opposed the king's cupidity\\" The two men's discord arose from the Constitutions of Clarendon, by which Henry attempted to impose his authority on the English church. Behind the mitred Thomas is an albed clerk, again carrying a gospel. To the right Henry is shown higher than the other two figures on his throne, wearing a royal crown and resting his feet on a stool. Behind him, a yellow devil whispers bad advice into his ear, conventional iconography to show bad human behaviour as being guided by demons. The interior's decoration is symbolised by a column and two arcades, supporting a crenellated wall - behind the king is a window (whose opening is shown in red according to convention) through which is seen a covered tower.  350px -----  5a : Thomas Becket Leaves for Exile : } On the left panel, a hard- to-read group of monks assist in the mitred Thomas' departure. He is shown on horseback in the central panel, flanked by two monks also on horseback, riding towards the group on the left to take a last look at those he is leaving. The scene is flanked by two stylised trees representing a forest. Thomas spent two years at Pontigny, ending in 1166, before returning to Sens, where he could spend his exile more safely.Bay 18 - St Thomas Becket , Chartres Cathedral - the Medieval Stained Glass, The Corpus of Medieval Narrative Art. {  6c : Thomas Meets Louis VII : :\\"and at the invitation of Louis, king of France, he went to stay with him\\" The mitred archbishop and crowned king are shown in discussion. The visit was informal - Louis is shown without his sceptre and both figures are seated at the same height.  315px -----  7a : Agreement Between the King of France and the Pope : :\\"He stayed there until, by the intervention of the Sovereign Pontiff and the king, he was recalled from exile\\" From left to right are shown Alexander, Louis and Thomas in tiara, crown and mitre respectively, arranged in formal order, with the pope sitting higher than the king but Thomas sitting lower. The decoration evokes the interior of a palace, with a crenellated wall behind the king. The red panel is for once not an opening but represents the king's warrior role, in contrast to the praying role of the clergymen, represented by a blue background. The king's sceptre is over-large and more resembles a herald's mace, underlining his role as bearer of diplomatic messages. Finally, on 22 July 1170, a patched-up peace was made between Thomas and Henry at Fr√©teval, allowing the archbishop to return to England. The situation still remained tense - Henry held a requiem mass as their mass of reconciliation and refused to give Thomas the symbolic kiss of peace.  350px }  (iii) The conflict escalates  {-  7b : Return to England : :\\"and he returned to England to the great satisfaction of the whole kingdom\\" Getting out of a boat at Sandwich on 3 December 1170, the mitred archbishop this time carries his own gospel, with a clerk behind him. To the left a crowd welcomes him and presents him with a large processional cross, which recurs in the martyrdom scene. The boat is the same as that in the fifth register, with a cross at the top of its mast, its pilot and its monstrous figurehead. However, the panel is still ambiguous - a logical reading would be that it shows Thomas' return to England (the wind- filled sail propels the boat towards the left), but the pilot would then be in the front of the boat, whereas he is shown at the back, though that may have been switched to accentuate the panel's symmetry with the image in the fifth register and thus emphasise Thomas returning the way he had come. He arrived in Canterbury two days later  350px -  8a : Henry II and a Bishop : \\"As he applied himself fearlessly to fulfilling the duties of a good shepherd, slanderers came to tell the king that he planned many things against the kingdom and the public peace - as a result this prince often complained that, in this kingdom, there was a bishop with whom he could not be at peace\\" At the left the crowned Henry is seated on a throne speaking to a mitred bishop carrying a gospel, with a tonsured priest behind the bishop holding his episcopal cross. Two columns support two arches and a crenallated frieze, whilst to the left is a roofed and crenallated tower. The bishop shown may be the Archbishop of York, whom Henry commanded to crown his son during his lifetime, a major cause of controversy with Thomas since royal coronations were normally the prerogative of the Archbishop of Canterbury. However, that coronation occurred on 14 June 1170, long before Thomas' return to England, leading him to excommunicate the Archbishop of York and the Bishops of London and Salisbury who had taken part. It is more likely that the bishop shown is one of these three bishops complaining to Henry of his excommunication.  350px -  8b : Henry's Anger : Thomas is shown in his mitre, his left hand open and the index finger of his right hand pointing in a gesture of request. A figure to the right with a crown and sceptre turns away in anger. Two figures stand between them, the one in the foreground showing the king to the archbishop, perhaps introducing him or perhaps telling him of the king's refusal to meet with him. The crowned figure may be Thomas' former pupil Henry III or Henry II, but it is more likely the scene continues the previous one, showing Henry II still furious at the bishops' excommunication and making the outburst which led the four knights to head for Canterbury. This latter interpretation would make the middle figures two of the four knights. Whichever interpretation is correct, panels 8a and 8b both show the leading English clergy's role in the tensions, with Henry II refusing to receive Thomas but welcoming the excommunicated bishops.  350px -  9a : Four Knights Menace Thomas : :\\"These words of the king made some detestable hangers-on believe they would give great pleasure to the king by killing Thomas, and so they secretly went to Canterbury\\" Thomas is shown mitred and enthroned, with his feet on a stool. Two men point a finger at him in challenge, with a third figure behind them. They are three of the four Anglo- Norman knights (Reginald Fitzurse, Hugh de Morville, William de Tracy and Richard the Breton) who went to Canterbury to demand that Thomas appear before the king to answer for his actions - Thomas refused.  315px }  (iv) Murder in the Cathedral  {  9b&c; : The knights ambush Thomas : :\\"and they went to attack the Archbishop, in the same church where he was celebrating the Office of Vespers. The clerks wanted to close the church doors, but Thomas ran to open them himself, saying to his own \\"God's church must not be guarded like a camp - as for me, I shall willingly suffer death for God's Church.\\"  350px  315px } The mitred bishop leads a clerk towards the cathedral, which is shown with a red door and double flying buttresses in the Gothic style of the new cathedral at Chartres (in Thomas' time Canterbury Cathedral was still a piece of Romanesque architecture). The scene is outside, as demonstrated by the crenellated ridge on the roof. To the right the knights lie in wait in their helmets, mailcoats and shields without coats of arms. The murder occurred whilst Thomas was on his way to Vespers. { 10: Thomas is murdered : :\\"Then, addressing the soldiers, he said \\"In God's name, I forbid you to touch my people\\". He then fell to his knees, and after entrusting the Church and his soul to God, Blessed Mary, Saint Denis and other patron saints of his cathedral, he offered up his head to the sacrilegious iron, with the same constancy with which he had resisted the king's most unjust laws... This occurred on the fourth day before the Kalends of January, year of Our Lord 1170 ; and the Martyr's brains sprang from the church floor.\\"  350px  350px } These two panels read as a single scene, with Romanesque arches evoking the cathedral interior. To the left is the red door just passed through by the knights, whilst to the far right is an altar, evoking Christ's sacrifice, although the murder actually occurred in a transept near the stairs up to the choir. As conventional in images of the murder, Thomas is shown kneeling, with Fitzurse making the final blow into his head and mitre, slicing off the top of his skull and wounding Edward Grim, shown holding the episcopal cross, who later wrote an account of the murder.Edward Grim's account of the Murder of Thomas Becket. Behind Fitzurse are the other three knights. { 11 : Thomas' tomb : :\\"God soon honoured [Thomas] with a great number of miracles and so the same Pope Alexander inscribed him among the number of the Saints\\" center } The last scene shows not Thomas' burial but the initial miracles at his tomb. He is shown with a halo resting on a tomb supported by columns, allowing pilgrims to pass below it. To the left a sick man rests on his crutches, whilst to the right a blind man holds his hands to his eyes. Above an angel with a red halo (the liturgical colour of martyrdom) censes the saint. In the angel's left hand is a circular loaf, symbolising the \\"bread of angels\\" from Psalm 78, 24 (\\"he rained manna on them for food, he gave them the bread of heaven\\") and thus evoking God's response to the martyr's intercession. == References == ==External links== * Vie de Saint Thomas Becket, vitrail 18, La Cath√©drale de Chartres. * Bay 18 - St Thomas Becket , Chartres Cathedral - the Medieval Stained Glass, The Corpus of Medieval Narrative Art. * Thomas de Cantorbury, La L√©gende dor√©e, Jacques de Voragine.

He was born in Chorlton-on-Medlock and emigrated with his family to Australia in 1884. He joined his father's drapery firm, Wright & Neil, as an accountant in 1895. The company was taken over by Sidney Myer in 1911, and Neil worked for Myer for the rest of his life. He became managing director of Myer Emporium Ltd when it formed in 1925, and took over as chairman on Myer's death in September 1934. Neil himself, however, died a few months later. Neil married Lucy Hunt in 1900, and they had a son and three daughters. Their son, Alan, served as a medical missionary with the South Seas Evangelical Mission and later became co-founder of a group known as the Fellowship. The Australian Dictionary of Biography describes Neil as a \\"tall, careful, religious, conservative man\\" and suggests that his \\"caution, business connexions and experience\\" complemented Sidney Myer's \\"intuitive flair and energy\\". He played the organ at St Hilary's, Kew and served as lay canon at St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne. Wei-Han Kuan notes that Neil was \\"capable and energetic both in mission societies and in diocesan affairs\\". He was also instrumental in Myer's conversion to Christianity.Kuan, Foundations of Anglican Evangelicalism in Victoria, p. 219. Neil was a close friend of C. H. Nash, and he was the prime mover in the establishment of the Melbourne Bible Institute (now the Melbourne School of Theology) in 1920, with Nash as the founding principal. Kuan suggests that Neil considered MBI \\"a necessary institution for the training of overseas missionaries and as an appropriate avenue for the deployment of the exiled Nash's gifts,\\" since Nash had been forced to resign from the Anglican church. Neil was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1926 for his work as Australian Commissioner at the British Empire Exhibition. ==References== Category:1872 births Category:1934 deaths Category:People from Chorlton-on-Medlock Category:English emigrants to colonial Australia Category:Australian businesspeople Category:Australian Anglicans Category:Australian Commanders of the Order of the British Empire ","title":"Lee Neil"},{"id":"63770364","text":"Jashon Cornell (born December 29, 1996) is an American football defensive tackle for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL).

Usually, a census is held in New Zealand every five years, but the 1941 census got postponed due to World War II. The previous census that did proceed had been held in 1936, i.e. nine years earlier. The 1941 census was postponed through section 36 of the Finance Act, 1940, which authorised the census due in 1941 to be taken between 1942 and 1945 (inclusive). As Minister of Industries and Commerce, Dan Sullivan was in charge of the Census and Statistics Department and in 1943, he commented that there was little hope for the census to be taken while the war was still going. In early April 1945, it became known that the government had plans to hold the census later that year and this was confirmed by Walter Nash in his capacity as acting prime minister on 11 April 1945, who confirmed that it would happen during September. One objective with the 1945 date was to be able to redefine electorate boundaries just prior to the 1946 general election. Bringing the census forward affected the census data. With World War II continuing until September 1945, thousands of young men were still overseas and the economy still geared to wartime conditions. There was lobbying from conservative circles, for example the Auckland Chamber of Commerce, the Otago- Southland Manufacturers' Association, and the New Zealand Farmers' Federation, for the census to be held in 1946 as originally scheduled. In an editorial, The New Zealand Herald also argued for adherence to the normal schedule, for example to make it easier for statisticians to provide timeline data (the census had been held every five years since 1851). Census returns were released as they became known, on a city, borough, town district, or county basis. The first preliminary results were those issued for Havelock Town District, which appeared in newspapers on 3 October 1945. The results from the census were an input to the 1946 electoral redistribution. As the government had, in a surprise move, abolished the country quota through the Electoral Amendment Act, 1945, the redistribution changed the boundaries of every electorate prior to the 1946 general election. ==Notes== ==References== * Category:Censuses in New Zealand Census New Zealand ","title":"1945 New Zealand census"},{"id":"63770387","text":"Vernon Keith Scott II (born September 11, 1997) is an American football free safety for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL).

Mrs. Emily Meynell-Ingram at Temple Newsam, organist and choirmaster at St. Chad's Church in Leeds, and deputy organist at Leeds Parish Church. Prior to this he had studied under Dr. Creser, late organist of the Chapel Royal, St. James's. At the age of 18 he had produced at concerts given by himself at Leeds, a quartet for piano and strings, and a trio for piano and strings. In consequence of ill-health he was compelled to seek a warmer climate, and for some years from 1891 resided in Australia, where he devoted himself to composition, with occasional concerts and teaching. ==Musical career== He held various appointments as organist in Melbourne and while in Australia his dramatic work Tegner's Drapa based on the work by Longfellow, for solo-voice, chorus and orchestra, was performed by the Melbourne Liedertafel and the Sydney Philharmonic, and his ballad for male chorus, 'The Battle of the Baltic' by the Royal Metropolitan Liedertafel. While touring in New Zealand he met the soprano Anna Sophie Balmson Steinhauer (1858‚Äì1949), a widow and celebrated Danish lieder singer whom he married in 1894 and returning to Europe toured Denmark and Germany with her, giving song-recitals. The couple also later made several tours in Australia, South Africa and Scandinavia. The two regularly appeared on the concert platform together when he would accompany his wife in concerts dedicated in part or entirely to his compositions. In February 1900 the soprano Olive Rae gave a recital at the Steinway Hall in which she sang three songs by Mallinson. On 22 November 1901 Steinhauer and Mallinson gave the first of several concerts at the Bechstein Hall to feature a selection of Mallinson's works (including his song cycle 'My Garden') in addition to little heard works from the Scandinavian composers Peter Heise and Fritz Arlberg.Concert by Anna Steinhauer Albert Mallinson at the Bechstein hall (1901) ‚Äì Wigmore Hall website He composed over 400 songs.

From 1898 to 1903 Mallinson held the post of private organist to Viscount Portman. A series of organ recitals given by him, on the beautiful Cavaille-Col organ in Jesus Church, Copenhagen, aroused exceptional interest among musicians in that city. From 1904 he resided at Dresden, where he acted as organist at the English Church. He was an admirable accompanist, and visited London every year to give a series of song-recitals together with his wife, which were among the principal events of the musical season.

It was launched in 1903 and sunk during World War I on 26 May 1917 after having collided with a mine off the coast of Cape Town. In the sinking, a total of 134 people died, including both crew and passengers; only 25 people survived. == Construction == The steamship was built in the shipyards of Sir Raylton Dixon & Co. Ltd at Middlesbrough, England. It had two triple expansion engines constructed by The Wallsend Slipway Engineering Co. Ltd, Newcastle. It had achieved a speed of 14.48 knots in favourable seas and 13.9 knots in calm seas or rough seas. The ship was launched on 5 December 1903 with the name Leopoldville, belonging to the Compagnie Maritime Belge du Congo, destined for the route to the Belgian Congo. In 1908, it was purchased by an English company, the African Steamship Company Ltd., and was renamed the Landana. Finally it was acquired by the Compa√±√≠a Trasatl√°ntica in 1910, that changed its name to Carlos de Eizaguirre. It was named after a prominent Spanish banker, and former director of the shipping company, Juan Carlos de Bailly Eizaguirre (1817-1900). It sailed from Cardiff on 9 November 1910 to C√°diz, where it arrived 13 November. After some modifications, it left for Barcelona, where it began sailing along the route to the Philippines in March of 1911. Its first captain was Luis Sopelana Gil Garc√≠a. First class provided a dining room, smoking room, library-writing room, ladies' salon and cabin accommodation for 85 passengers, with bathrooms and toilets. Second class had cabins for 45 passengers, with a dining room and smoking room. In steerage there were two dormitories for third class, one for each sex. First class tickets cost 1680 pesetas, with food and lodging and up to 250 kilos of luggage. For third class, the fare was 605 pesetas, or 455 pesetas for (indigenous servants). == Career == The steamship sailed the route from Barcelona to Manila in the Philippines. The usual route was through the Mediterranean to the Suez Canal, then through the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean to the Philippines, with shore calls in Ceylon and Sumatra. However, in its second voyage, the Suez Canal was closed due to World War I for non-allied ships, resulting in those ships having to sail around Africa via the Cape of Good Hope. == Last Voyage == The ship sailed from Barcelona on its last voyage on 21 April 1917, with scheduled stops at Cadiz, Las Palmas, Cape Town, Durban, Singapore and Manila. There were initially 35 passengers, of which seven were in first class, 23 in second class and five in third class. It put in at Cadiz to pick up more passengers. Fifteen passengers joined the ship, three in first class, one in second class and 11 in third class. It sailed from Cadiz in the morning of 27 April. The ship arrived at Las_Palmas on 30 April 1917 where it had to await supplies of coal. Seven passengers left the ship and two joined. It thus did not leave Las Palmas until 7a.m. on 5 May. The ship was making nine knots per hour with a scheduled arrival in Cape Town of 25 May where it was to pick up more coal. Amongst the passengers at this point were 11 women, of which two were single, and five small children between the ages of three and five. == Sinking == The captain, Ferm√≠n Luz√°rraga, had postponed entry into the port due to a storm which had created rough seas, and he did not want to enter the port before dawn. The ship was proceeding at 5 knots by this stage, partly in an effort to save coal. , as the ship ran into the mine at 3:30a.m. on 26 May 1917, whilst all were sleeping. The steamship collided with a mine some 25 miles off the coast of Cape Town at 33¬∞ 46‚Äô S and 17¬∞ 59‚Äô E. The mine impacted the second hold of the ship, on the starboard side and below the waterline. An explosion split the boat in two and resulted in its sinking in scarcely four minutes. Only one of the eight lifeboats was able to be launched. A total of 134 people died: 84 crew and 50 passengers. Only eight bodies were recovered, some of them having been devoured by sharks. Twenty-five people survived, being the occupants of the number 6 lifeboat and engine room assistant Alejandro Fern√°ndez, who leapt into the water and spent 32 hours clinging to a floating wooden plank. Of the survivors, 23 were crew, and only two were passengers. Amongst the victims was the Spanish consul at Colombo. The news arrived at the shipping company's offices by telegram some eleven hours after the event, but the information was not made public due to the uncertainties of being able to meet potential damages and loss claims, as they did not have insurance against acts of war. They instead sent to their various offices coded telegrams that said: \\"\\" ('Eizaguirre' totally lost near Robben Island). On 28 May, the first rumours of the tragedy began to arrive in Barcelona. One of the directors of the company determined then that \\"we shall treat this with all reserve and we shall say that we are dealing with a normal accident\\". When news was finally published in the press it used the shipping company's version of events. In an internal company memo it was stated that ¬´given the press censorship regime of the government, we can abstain of publishing details of the probable cause of the accident\\". Therefore, La Vanguardia and El Noticiero Universal published that \\"for the most part opinions coincide in not admitting the possibility that the ship collided with a drifting mine taking into account the enormous distance between the site of the accident and the mined areas. In general, it is believed that the 'Eizaguirre' must have found itself in one of those storms that are currently occurring at the Cape of Good Hope, foundering or striking against something underwater\\". == Attribution of blame == Whilst the media repeated the official version, the board of the Trasatl√°ntica ‚Äî lead at the time by the second Marquess of Comillas, Claudio L√≥pez Bru ‚Äî met with the president of the government, the Liberal Manuel Garc√≠a Prieto, to try and present a claim against the United Kingdom on the basis that it was a British defensive mine that caused the sinking. However, the British Admiralty denied this claim and alleged that the sinking was due to a mine laid by the German merchant raider SMS Wolf. As a result they could not undertake more detailed investigations, even though the Times of the 9th of March the First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Edward Carson, admitted that they had placed mines in the region. The shipwreck caused an uproar in the city of Barcelona generating scenes of panic in the port on the part of families of the passengers. == References == Category:Ocean liners Category:1903 ships Category:History of Barcelona Category:Shipwrecks Category:Steamships of Spain ","title":"Carlos de Eizaguirre"},{"id":"63770504","text":"Raymond Calais Jr. (born April 2, 1998) is an American football running back for the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL).http://africa.espn.com/nfl/draft/player/_/id/104508 He played college football at Louisiana-Lafayette, and was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the seventh round of the 2020 NFL Draft. ==High school career== In his last year of high school at Cecilia High School, he was named the Louisiana Boys Track & Field Athlete of the Year after winning state in four different categories at the 4A level: individually in the 100 meter and 200 meter races, and as part of a team in the 4x100 and 4x200 relays.

Skopin-Shuisky also managed to gather the Russian army and achieve falling away from the impostor of a number of northern cities. In early May, advanced Russian‚ÄìSwedish detachments marched from Novgorod to clear the way to Torzhok for the main army. Under their onslaught, the leader of the Polish Hussars detachment Kernozitsky left Russa without a fight, which allies occupied on May 20. After that, the invaders suddenly attacked them, but were repelled. The Russian‚ÄìSwedish detachment, led by Fyodor Chulkov and Evert Horn, continued the offensive and approached Toropets. ==Course of the battle== On May 25, near the village of Kamenka, a battle took place with the hussars and Cossacks of Kernozitsky taken aback. At the first blow of the armored infantry of Horn, Kernozitsky's army fled, and the noble cavalry of Fyodor Chulkov completed the rout. With the remnants of the detachment, Kernozitsky tried to sit outside the walls of the nearby Trinity Nebin Monastery, but was attacked and knocked out of it. The interventionists, leaving artillery, left Toropets, who immediately \\"set aside\\" from the \\"Tushinsky thief\\". ==Aftermath== After the capture of Toropets by the Russian‚ÄìSwedish detachment, a chain reaction began. Torzhok, Staritsa, Ostashkov, Rzhev, Zubtsov, Kholm, Nevel and other northwestern Russian cities \\"set aside\\" from False Dmitry II.

Ownership of the remaining units changed several times over the next few years, and the property had 225 unsold units as of 2017, although sales increased after the Oakland Raiders announced their relocation to Las Vegas. ==History== ===Construction=== One Las Vegas was built near the intersection of South Las Vegas Boulevard and Windmill Lane. It was announced in February 2005, as a joint project between Amland Development and B.S.R. Group, an international developer based in Israel. Chet Nichols, executive vice president for Amland Development, was working with Wells Fargo, Wachovia and Hypo Real Estate Capital to devise a financial package to help build the project. Grading on the 20-acre property was expected to begin in late February 2005, with construction of the first two towers ‚Äì standing 20 stories high ‚Äì expected to begin in July 2005. In February 2005, Amland won the legal rights to use the \\"One Las Vegas\\" name, which had also been chosen by Del American for their own condominium project. Sales began on April 7, 2005. The project was designed by Kobi Karp. The first phase, expected to cost $142 million, was under construction in April 2006, with excavation, grading, and underground utility work occurring on the property. J.E. Dunn Construction of Kansas City served as the general contractor. The first phase consisted of two condominium towers, scheduled for completion in December 2007. Approximately 50 percent of the first phase had been presold up to that point. A total of five towers ‚Äì standing 18 to 21 stories ‚Äì were ultimately planned for the property, with a final total of 890 condominium units. A 200-room boutique hotel and a 200-unit condo hotel ‚Äì both of which would be operated by the same company ‚Äì were also planned at that time. By that point, Amland had gained financing from Corus Bank, which fully financed the project for $142 million. Units ranged in price from the $400,000s for an one-bedroom unit to $1.8 million for a penthouse. Units initially started at $275,000 when the project was announced. In October 2006, construction was underway on the two towers, which were expected to have a total of 359 units, with an ultimate total of 960 units when all five towers were completed. The 182-unit first tower was topped off on January 19, 2007, with completion scheduled for late 2007. Construction on the second tower was up to the 16th floor. Approximately 400 construction workers were on the project. The second tower was topped off in April 2007, and was expected to be completed in early 2008. Opening delays were attributed to excessive construction activity in Las Vegas, and to the fact that inspections of safety systems did not occur as initially scheduled. ===Operation and sales=== In June 2008, certificates of occupancy were issued for the two towers, which cost $150 million to construct. At the time, discussions were underway with two hotel companies for the 220-room boutique hotel. There were also plans for office and retail space. In April 2009, One Las Vegas entered foreclosure because of low sales, caused by the Great Recession. The property was taken over by Corus Bank, which planned to offer units at a 50 percent discount. After Corus Bank failed in September 2009, Starwood Property Trust (also known as ST Residential) acquired the project a month later and began renting the units in 2010, because of poor sales; less than 75 of the 359 units had closed on their sales. The other three towers were not built. In 2013, ST Residential sold the remaining 295 units to DK Las Vegas: a partnership between KRE Capital, based in California, and Dune Real Estate Partners, based in New York. Upgrades totaling $2 million were completed in 2015. As of 2017, there were still 225 unsold units in One Las Vegas. Sales increased during 2017 and 2018, after the Oakland Raiders announced their relocation to Las Vegas. ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Photo gallery at VegasTodayAndTomorrow.com Category:Buildings and structures in Enterprise, Nevada Category:Residential buildings in the Las Vegas metropolitan area Category:Buildings and structures in Las Vegas Category:Residential buildings completed in 2008 Category:2008 establishments in Nevada ","title":"One Las Vegas"},{"id":"63770624","text":"The Yakovalƒ± Hasan Pa≈üa Mosque (, ) is a late 16th-century mosque in P√©cs, southern Hungary. It was constructed when the region was part of the Turkish Ottoman Empire, around the same time as the main mosque of P√©cs, the Mosque of Pasha Qasim (which has since been consecrated as a cathedral). It was named after the local government official who commissioned the mosque, Yakovalƒ± Hasan Pa≈üa (Hasan Pa≈üa of Gjakova). It is thus one of the oldest mosques existing in Hungary today. The mosque is still active as a Muslim place of worship, and also houses a small exhibition centre for Turkish handicraft and historical artifacts documenting Hungary's Ottoman past. ==History== The mosque was built some decades after the Ottoman conquest of central Hungary. Its architect and exact date of construction are unknown. It was in use for more than a century before being presumably abandoned from late 1686 when P√©cs was captured by Austrian forces, after which it served as a hospital. Between 1702 and 1732, it was converted into a Catholic chapel by the Bishop Wilhelm Franz von Nesselrode. During this time, the minaret was turned into a bell tower, with the ruined spire being replaced with a belfry. Its interior was decorated with Baroque carvings which were then in fashion. The mosque was first restored in the 1960s, when the minaret was repaired and the Baroque ornamentation removed to restore the mosque to its original condition.The Mosque and Minaret of Yakovali Hassan.

Brought up by Ginestra Bianconi in 2007, the entropy of a network ensemble measures the level of the order or uncertainty of a network ensemble. The entropy is the logarithm of the number of graphs. Entropy can also be defined in one network. Basin entropy is the logarithm of the attractors in one Boolean network. Employing approaches from statistical mechanics, the complexity, uncertainty, and randomness of networks can be described by network ensembles with different types of constraints. ==Gibbs and Shannon entropy== By analogy to statistical mechanics, microcanonical ensembles and canonical ensembles of networks are introduced for the implementation. A partition function Z of an ensemble can be defined as: Category:Entropy and information entropy statistical mechanics \\\\quad{Z}=\\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{a}}\\\\delta[\\\\vec{F}(\\\\mathbf{a})-\\\\vec{C}]\\\\textrm{exp}\\\\Big(\\\\sum_{ij}h_{ij}\\\\Theta(a_{ij})+r_{ij}a_{ij}\\\\Big) where \\\\vec{F}(\\\\mathbf{a})=\\\\vec{C} is the constraint, and a_{ij} (a_{ij} \\\\geq {0}) are the elements in the adjacency matrix, a_{ij} > 0 if and only if there is a link between node i and node j. \\\\Theta(a_{ij}) is a step function with \\\\Theta(a_{ij})=1 if x > 0, and \\\\Theta(a_{ij})=0 if x = 0. The auxiliary fields h_{ij} and r_{ij} have been introduced as analogy to the bath in classical mechanics. For simple undirected networks, the partition function can be simplified as \\\\quad{Z}=\\\\sum_{\\\\\\\\{a_{ij}\\\\\\\\}}\\\\prod_{k}\\\\delta(\\\\textrm{constraint}_{k}(\\\\\\\\{a_{ij}\\\\\\\\}))\\\\textrm{exp}\\\\Big(\\\\sum_{i where a_{ij}\\\\in\\\\alpha, \\\\alpha is the index of the weight, and for a simple network \\\\alpha=\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}. Microcanonical ensembles and canonical ensembles are demonstrated with simple undirected networks. For a microcanonical ensemble, the Gibbs entropy \\\\Sigma is defined by: \\\\quad\\\\Sigma=\\\\cfrac{1}{N}\\\\mathrm{log}\\\\mathcal{N} \\\\qquad=\\\\cfrac{1}{N}\\\\mathrm{log}Z_{h_{ij}(\\\\alpha)=0\\\\forall(i,j,\\\\alpha)} where \\\\mathcal{N} indicates the cardinality of the ensemble, i.e., the total number of networks in the ensemble. The probability of having a link between nodes i and j, with weight \\\\alpha is given by: \\\\quad\\\\pi_{ij}(\\\\alpha)=\\\\cfrac{\\\\partial{\\\\mathrm{log}}Z}{\\\\partial{h_{ij}}(\\\\alpha)} For a canonical ensemble, the entropy is presented in the form of a Shannon entropy: \\\\quad{S}=-\\\\sum_{i ==Relation between Gibbs and Shannon entropy== Network ensemble G(N,L) with given number of nodes N and links L, and its conjugate-canonical ensemble G(N,p) are characterized as microcanonical and canonical ensembles and they have Gibbs entropy \\\\Sigma and the Shannon entropy S, respectively. The Gibbs entropy in the G(N,p) ensemble is given by: \\\\quad{N}\\\\Sigma=\\\\mathrm{log}\\\\Bigg(\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\cfrac{N(N-1)}{2}\\\\\\\\\\\\L\\\\end{matrix}\\\\Bigg) For G(N,p) ensemble, \\\\quad{p}_{ij}=p=\\\\cfrac{2L}{N(N-1)} Inserting p_{ij} into the Shannon entropy: \\\\quad\\\\Sigma=S/N+\\\\cfrac{1}{2N}\\\\Big[\\\\mathrm{log}\\\\Big(\\\\cfrac{N(N-1)}{2L}\\\\Big)-\\\\mathrm{log}\\\\Big(\\\\cfrac{N(N-1)}{2}-L\\\\Big)\\\\Big] The relation indicates that the Gibbs entropy \\\\Sigma and the Shannon entropy per node S/N of random graphs are equal in the thermodynamic limit N\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty. ==Von Neumann entropy== Von Neumann entropy is the extension of the classical Gibbs entropy in a quantum context. This entropy is constructed from a density matrix \\\\rho with the expression of Laplacian matrix L associated with the network. The average von Neumann entropy of an ensemble is calculated as: \\\\quad{S}_{VN}=-\\\\langle\\\\mathrm{Tr}\\\\rho\\\\mathrm{log}(\\\\rho)\\\\rangle For random network ensemble G(N,p), the relation between S_{VN} and S is nonmonotonic when the average connectivity p(N-1) is varied. For canonical power-law network ensembles, the two entropies are linearly related. \\\\quad{S}_{VN}=\\\\eta{S/N}+\\\\beta Networks with given expected degree sequences suggest that, heterogeneity in the expected degree distribution implies an equivalence between a quantum and a classical description of networks, which respectively corresponds to the von Neumann and the Shannon entropy. Von Neumann entropy can also be calculated in multilayer networks with tensorial approach. ==See also== * Canonical ensemble * Microcanonical ensemble * Maximum-entropy random graph model * Graph entropy == References == ","title":"Entropy of network ensembles"},{"id":"63770650","text":"Megapitaria squalida, the chocolate clam, is a species of bivalve mollusc in the family Veneridae. It was first described to science by George Brettingham Sowerby, a British conchologist, in 1835. The type specimen was collected by Hugh Cuming.MolluscaBase eds. (2020). MolluscaBase. Megapitaria squalida (G. B. Sowerby I, 1835). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=714777 on 2020-05-01 Fossil evidence suggests that this species may be as old as 2.5 million years. == Description == The valves are thick and of equal size. In life, the valves are covered by a grayish-brown periostracum. The external surface of the shell is smooth. It is tan to brown in color, sometimes with bands or speckles of different intensity. The interior of the shell is white, sometimes with bands of purple. The shell can reach long, wide, and deep. Weight may reach for live individuals. == Range and habitat == Chocolate clams are found in the eastern Pacific Ocean from Ojo de Liebre Lagoon in Baja California south to Mancora, Peru, and in the Gulf of California. This species is also found in the Galapagos Islands. These clams live buried in sandy sediments from the intertidal zone to deep. In a study performed in Magdelena Bay, the average density was 2.01 individuals per square meter. Larger clams are found in deeper water. == Life history == Megapitaria squalida is gonochoric, which is to say that there are two sexes, and individuals are either male or female. Some populations show significantly higher numbers of females than males. Hermaphrodites, individuals containing both types of sex organs, are present, and even common in some populations. One study suggests that differing sex ratios and the amount of hermaphroditism in various populations may be the result of fishing pressures. Megapitaria squalida reproduces by broadcast spawning. Spawning occurs all year, with seasonal peaks. Oocytes measure between and . Females were observed to contain as many as 1,214 oocytes at any one time. Chocolate clams are filter feeders. They extend their siphons up through the sand to suck in and expel sea water. They strain out nutrients from the incoming flow and then expel waste products with the outgoing flow. Chocolate clams can live as long as ten years, while the mode in populations that have been studied is four years. == Human consumption == There are both commercial and recreational harvests of chocolate clams. They are collected by hand on the beach at low tide, by free divers, and by scuba and hookah- equipped divers. The commercial harvest in Mexico grew from 125 metric tons in 1985, to 1,400 metric tons in 2006, and to 4,272 metric tons in 2014. Mexican fishery regulations require chocolate clams to exceed in length before they can be harvested. Chocolate clams are eaten marinated on the half-shell, as ceviche, in chowders, baked, steamed, and in salads. Chocolate clams are filter feeders and can concentrate heavy metals from the environment. The concentration of heavy metals in clam meat varies by season. Similarly, these animals can sometimes concentrate the neurotoxins of paralytic shellfish poisoning. Chocolate clams are not actively marketed in the United States. They do not appear on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Seafood List. == References == Category:Veneridae ","title":"Megapitaria squalida"},{"id":"63770651","text":"Christopher D'Wayne Jackson (born April 13, 1998) is an American football cornerback for the Tennessee Titans of the National Football League (NFL).

It features six residential buildings, including a 15-story condominium tower, in addition to restaurants and retailers. Groundbreaking took place in 2006, but construction delays pushed the opening back more than a year. It opened in June 2009, with 341 condominium units, but buyers had difficulty finalizing their condo purchases due to the effects of the Great Recession. In 2013, Juhl's 306 unsold units were sold to a partnership of companies, which turned them into rentals. In 2017, the rental units went back up for sale as condominiums. ==History== ===Construction=== The property, located in downtown Las Vegas, was initially occupied by four houses. The Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency solicited proposals from approximately a dozen companies across the United States to develop the land. CityMark Development, of San Diego, was ultimately chosen in 2004. CityMark purchased the property for $5.2 million in 2005, and planned to build Juhl, a $167 million mixed-use and condo project. Juhl would include six towers, standing between six and 15 stories, with a total of 341 condominium units. The project would include of retail space, while parking would be located on the first five floors. CityMark had previously reinvigorated San Diego's downtown Gaslamp Quarter area. Groundbreaking took place in mid-March 2006, with the opening scheduled for April 2008. The houses on the property were demolished, and by April 2006, $600,000 of underground work and the relocation of utilities had begun on the site. Turner Construction was the general contractor, while San Diego-based Martinez + Cutri Corporation was the architect. Glotman Simpson of Vancouver was the structural engineer. Corus Bank provided $106 million to fund the project. In August 2006, 600 cubic yards of concrete were delivered by more than 75 trucks for the foundation of the project. The target demographic consisted of young professionals who desired to live near the Las Vegas Arts District. In December 2006, approximately 60 percent of Juhl's units had been sold through binding purchase agreements. Many of the buyers were people who worked downtown, such as lawyers and judges. That month, construction crews poured the third and fourth floors of the residential and parking structures for the project. Approximately 115 construction workers were on the site at that time, with the number expected to increase to 200 to 225 within the following 15 to 18 months. In July 2007, several businesses were being planned for the new project, including a bar, a coffee shop, and a jewelry store. Three cranes were used during construction of the 15-story tower, which was topped off in August 2007, with the first residents expected to move in by May 2008. At that time, 70 percent of Juhl's units had been sold. Juhl remained under construction in June 2008. The planned opening was delayed by more than a year, due to construction issues. A person involved in the project said there were significant engineering issues on the project: \\"There was no post- tensioning or reinforcing steel to support the concrete. The floor slabs deflected two to three inches between the columns. It was so bad that the glass didn't fit, the interior walls were cracking, and water lines were breaking.\\" CityMark said the delay was due to \\"typical\\" project delays, while the Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency said that minor and major structural modifications were made to the project. ===Operation=== Juhl ultimately opened in June 2009, with little fanfare. The project was valued at $178 million. As a result of its delayed opening, the project suffered the effects of the Great Recession. Juhl featured 341 units, but only 21 units (six percent) had closed escrow, and CityMark began offering discounts to buyers who did finalize their purchases. Much of Juhl's retail space was also vacant. ST Residential, at a cost of $14 million, purchased the project after the failure of Corus Bank in September 2009. In August 2011, Juhl still had 307 units left unsold. In 2013, ST Residential sold Juhl's 306 unsold units to a partnership between KRE Capital, based in California, and Dune Real Estate Partners, based in New York. The companies purchased the units under the name DK Las Vegas. Juhl's unsold units were turned into rentals, and the property was 95 percent occupied as of 2015. In 2016, the Juhl began offering an artist-in-residence program. On March 23, 2017, it was announced that Juhl's unsold units would be put on sale in late April 2017, while renewing some rental agreements to keep the building occupied. In 2018, the Juhl partnered with The Believer to begin a writer-in-residence program on the property. The program allowed writers to live and work in a Juhl loft with an attached studio. ==Features== Juhl has a total of six residential buildings, which connect to each other. The Juhl property spans a city block, and includes 344 condominium units, some of which are located within the 15-story tower, the tallest building on the site. Units range from to nearly . The 10th floor features a lounge known as Vino Deck. Juhl also includes a pool, an outdoor movie theater, and a CrossFit gym. A bike store opened at Juhl in 2013. In 2015, lease agreements were signed for six businesses ‚Äì including restaurants and retailers ‚Äì to open at the base of the complex. A area on the ground floor, known as The Promenade at Juhl, celebrated its opening on November 17, 2016. It contains various businesses, including restaurants and retailers. ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Downtown Las Vegas Category:Residential buildings in the Las Vegas metropolitan area Category:Buildings and structures in Las Vegas Category:Mixed-use developments in the United States Category:Residential buildings completed in 2009 Category:2009 establishments in Nevada ","title":"Juhl (Las Vegas)"},{"id":"63770659","text":"Nina Davis (born December 7, 1994) is an American women's basketball player.

Cody, M.D., is an American doctor, epidemiologist and public health official serving as the health officer and public health director of Santa Clara County, California, at the time of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak. Her timely implementation of stay-at-home orders in coordination with other San Francisco Bay Area health officials is credited with preventing an estimated 188,000 hospitalizations and 19,000 deaths in major Bay Area cities. Cody continues to maintain a regular presence in the media to communicate COVID-19 news and policy. ==Education== Cody graduated from Stanford University, receiving a degree in human biology, and subsequently completing her Doctor of Medicine at Yale School of Medicine. Following an internship and residency in internal medicine at Stanford University Medical Center, Cody completed a two- year fellowship in epidemiology and public health, as an Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) officer with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ==Career== During her fellowship as epidemic intelligence service officer, she investigated an international E. coli outbreak that was linked to unpasteurized apple juice. She also led an investigation into a salmonella outbreak in Santa Clara County which was traced to raw milk. After completion of this fellowship, Cody joined the Public Health Department of Santa Clara County. In 1998, she became the deputy health officer for the county. In this role she oversaw surveillance and investigation of 83 reportable diseases, conducted investigations on outbreaks, and responded to SARS, H1N1 and other public health emergencies. In the years after the September 11 attacks, Cody worked with the then county health officer Marty Fenstersheib to model Santa Clara County's emergency response to a bioterrorism attack or pandemic. This model included such measures as social distancing, shutting schools and at its most extreme, mandating that people stay home. In 2013, Cody moved into the role of county health officer. In 2015, she was also appointed to the position of director of public health for the county and has since maintained the dual role. ===COVID-19 outbreak=== Along with other public health officers in the region, Cody was largely credited for promptly advocating for measures that would limit the spread of COVID-19 when the pandemic reached the United States in 2020. She led the Santa Clara County Public Health Department to establish an incident command center on January 23, three days after the first confirmed case in the country, then established a contact tracing mechanism in an effort to stop the propagation of the disease. Cody issued the first guidelines on the closure and cancelation of public gatherings on March 3, extending them to sporting events, festivals and bars on March 9. She was an early advocate of requiring residents to \\"shelter-in-place\\", which was put in effect on March 16 in seven counties of the Bay area., with California Governor Gavin Newsom adopting that policy for the whole state three days later. Cody explained that \\"If you are going to do something really drastic like shelter-in-place, you want to do it as early as you possibly can. Because if you wait to do it, you get all the harms, all of the social and economic disruptions, but you miss a lot of the benefit.\\" Cody has made regular appearances on Bay Area press and video conferences, explaining county health policy and reminding residents that the COVID-19 battle is a long-term health concern: \\"Because we flattened the curve, it doesn‚Äôt mean that we are done. Because we are far, far, far from done.\\" In a press conference in April, Cody confirmed that the first United States COVID-19 death had actually occurred in the Bay Area on February 6, some 23 days prior to the previously known first death. This was the first of three early COVID-19 deaths, which Cody described as \\"iceberg tips\\", suggesting that there was a vast and unseen propagation. Following one news conference, she became the subject of a viral meme, after she implored citizens to refrain from touching their faces, then licked her finger to turn a page. Cody received threats from residents unhappy with the drastic nature the measures put in place. In late August, the Santa Clara County Sheriff‚Äôs Office announced they arrested a man suspected of sending her several threatening letters, which used language typical of far-right movements. Police found 138 firearms at his residence. Charged with stalking and threatening a public official, he remained in jail while waiting for court proceedings. The police maintains 24-hour protection around Cody. ==Personal life== Cody is a resident of Palo Alto. ==References== Category:American physicians Category:Living people Category:People from Palo Alto, California Category:American epidemiologists Category:Stanford University alumni Category:Yale School of Medicine alumni Category:COVID-19 pandemic in California Category:Government of Santa Clara County, California Category:Women epidemiologists Category:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Sara Cody"},{"id":"63770684","text":"Erica Erinma Ogwumike (born September 26, 1997) is a Nigerian-American professional basketball player.

The property consists of two seven-story buildings with a total of 378 units. Construction began in 2004, and the property opened in mid-2007. A second phase, consisting of two additional buildings, was canceled due to poor sales in the original buildings, a result of the Great Recession. ==History== ===Construction=== In January 2004, Las Vegas-based Palm Beach Resort Condominiums LLC purchased of land at the southwest corner of South Las Vegas Boulevard and Serene Avenue, at a cost of $12.8 million. Unlike other condominium projects in the Las Vegas area, Palm Beach Resort received county approval for Boca Raton, had the project designed, and began construction before taking reservations. Stewart Simpson, the senior vice president of development for the project, said at the start of construction, \\"Most of these projects, they have a concept, they option for a piece of land and go out and start explaining it. Instead of saying we have this dream and hope we can make it happen, we had a dream and we didn't tell anyone about it and did our homework.\\" The project was designed by Pierce Goodwin Alexander and Linville (PGAL). Groundbreaking for the first phase began on November 17, 2004, with completion expected for February 2006. Boca Raton was planned to ultimately consist of four seven-story towers, with a total of 756 units. Prices were expected to start at $200,000. The project was also planned to include a two- story underground parking garage. Las Vegas-based Wright Engineering was the project engineer, while UPA Resort Construction Group was the general contractor. JPMorgan Chase provided a $134 million construction loan for the project. Martin Harris Construction became the general contractor in 2005, and Boca Raton's opening was delayed several times because of construction. By December 2005, the mid-rise project had sold 270 units in its first two buildings, which contained a total of 378 units. The February 2006 opening had been delayed by that point. Following the completion of the underground parking garage, upward construction was underway as of January 2006, with the first 172 units scheduled to open in December 2006. By May 2006, basketball player Paul Pierce had purchased a unit in the project. Both buildings had been topped out by August 2006. The buildings used 16,000 cubic yards of concrete and 2,000 tons of steel, with 250,000 hours spent working on them up to that point. Completion of the first phase was scheduled for January 2007, and would include a clubhouse. Construction was nearing completion in late May 2007, and residents were expected to move in by June. The second phase was to be finished by late 2009. ===Opening and sales=== Approximately 70 people moved in during July 2007, and the 378-unit first phase was entirely finished in October. It was announced that construction for the second phase was 12 to 18 months away. Approximately 160 units were sold in 2007, but sales decreased the following year due to the Great Recession. Unit purchases stopped entirely in 2009, and the other two buildings were canceled before the start of construction, due to the poor economy. JPMorgan Chase sued Boca Raton's developer in 2010, alleging default of the construction loan. In 2011, an investment group purchased Boca Raton. In December 2017, the group listed the remaining 210 unsold units for sale in a bulk offer. Joseph Daneshgar, a southern California investor and the founder of 3D Investments, purchased the units in August 2018, at a cost of $44 million. ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Residential buildings in the Las Vegas metropolitan area Category:Buildings and structures in Enterprise, Nevada Category:Residential buildings completed in 2007 Category:2007 establishments in Nevada ","title":"Boca Raton (condominiums)"},{"id":"63770699","text":"Dequartavous \\"Tae\\" Crowder (born March 12, 1997) is an American football linebacker for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL).

C. et Autres c. Italie) is a case decided by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) on 3 September 2013 in which Article 1 of Protocol 1 (A1P1) was engaged due to the applicants not being afforded annual uprating which the court deemed damage to their property of a disproportionate character in the form of an exorbitant charge. ==Background== The applicants were 162 Italian nationals who had either received blood transfusions or blood products contaminated with various blood- borne viruses. The applicants, all of whom were given anonymity, complained that part of the compensation they received because of the contamination was not being afforded an annual reassessment according to the inflation rate. Following transfusions or the administration of blood derivatives, the applicants were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and/or hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C. Forty of the applicants or their relatives suffered from haemophilia, a condition that requires frequent infusions of blood products. The other applicants were infected through blood transfusions carried out during hospital treatment. The compensation was to include a supplementary indemnity, in Italian ‚Ä≥indennit√† integrativa speciale‚Ä≥, abbreviated to ‚Ä≥IIS‚Ä≥. This indemnity component (IIS) was to be subject to reassessment based on the annual rate of inflation and was intended to prevent or reduce the effects of currency devaluation. However, the Italian government made interventions as to the re-assessment of this supplementary allowance (the IIS) as they believed that it was not possible to uprate the amount in line with inflation. In the absence of the annual revaluation, the monetary value of the IIS was fated to gradually decrease. In addition, the IIS was thought to represent between 90% and 95% of the total amount of the compensation. The applicants presented accountancy expertise demonstrating that those who had a right to the revaluation of the IIS were being deprived every month of around 200 euros. ===Applicant's situation=== During the case, the health of several of the applicants suffered serious deterioration due to the viruses with which they were infected. The infection with contaminated blood and blood products had led to some suffering liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, or a combination of several pathologies, in some, both AIDS and hepatitis. In some cases, this was often accompanied by the underlying condition of haemophilia. One applicant suffered from a nervous breakdown leading to several suicide attempts. From the point the case application had been communicated to the Italian government, six applicants unfortunately died. Their heirs were then established in the Court proceedings. The applicants provided medical certificates and expert medical reports showing the reduced life expectancy of people infected with the hepatitis virus and HIV. The expert evidence made out a strict link between the applicant‚Äôs prognosis of survival and the beneficial effect of the compensation allowances in question. The Court considered that they were obligated to take the pathologies of the applicants into account. In particular, how during the proceedings, six of them had died. The judges also attached particular importance to the fact that the annual reassessment (the IIS) represented more than 90% of the total amount of the compensation paid to the applicants. ==Relevant law== Under Law No. 210/1992, the applicants received compensation from the Italian Ministry of Health for the permanent damage they suffered as a result of their contamination. Law No. 210/1992 stated that additional compensation, ‚Ä≥indennizzo ulteriore‚Ä≥, is to be granted to persons who have suffered damage as a result of compulsory vaccinations and that this additional compensation should be subject to an annual reassessment based on the rate of inflation. The applicant's arguments relied on various articles and protocols of the European Convention on Human Rights as follows: Article 6 section 1, Article 13, Article 14, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 12. ==Judgment== The judges decided that the applicants had suffered damage to their property of a disproportionate character due to the adoption by the Italian government of Legislative Decree No. 78/2010. This decree placed an ‚Ä≥abnormal and exorbitant charge‚Ä≥ (‚Ä≥charge anormale et exorbitante‚Ä≥) on the applicants, and in the opinion of the court upset the fair balance between the demands of the general interest and the safeguarding of individual‚Ä≤s fundamental rights. The judges were unanimous in finding that there had been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention along with a declaration that the application was admissible under A1P1 (Article 1 of Protocol No. 1). By way of remedy, the Italian government was required by the ECHR to set, within 6 months, a time‚Äìlimit by which the State must undertake to guarantee the payment of the re‚Äìassessed IIS to any applicant entitled to the compensation under Law no. 210/1992 and that the payments should be back- dated to the point from which it had been granted to them. ==See also== * A and Others v National Blood Authority and Another (UK Consumer law case involving claimants infected with hepatitis C) * R (March) v Secretary of State for Health, 2010 judicial review by a claimant treated with contaminated blood products. * Contaminated blood scandal in the United Kingdom * Contaminated haemophilia blood products (mentions contaminated blood in Italy) ==References== Category:2013 in case law Category:European Court of Human Rights cases involving Italy Category:Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights Category:Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights ","title":"M.C. and Others v Italy"},{"id":"63770739","text":"Lorete was a trouv√®re, one of only eight women composers of Old French lyric poetry known by name.

Besides residential units, other features would include office space, retail, and restaurants. The project was announced in January 2005, and construction was originally scheduled to begin later that year. Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman initially praised the project for its affordability, noting the $150,000 starting price of its condo units, although he later threatened to revoke approval of the project in 2007, as construction had yet to begin. The project was ultimately canceled following financial issues. ==History== Marketing of Club Renaissance began in December 2004. The project was officially announced the following month, by developers Diversified Real Estate Group and Downtown Redevelopment Group. Club Renaissance would consist of a 60-story condominium tower with 950 units. Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman noted the $150,000 starting price for condominiums in the project, saying, \\"I like the affordability of it.\\" Philippe Pageau- Goyette, the president of Diversified Real Estate Group, planned for Club Renaissance to be the least-expensive high-rise condominium in the Las Vegas Valley, and said 95 percent of the project's inhabitants would be local residents: \\"I don't want to go after luxury, I want to go after locals. As of right now, we have no competition in the locals affordable market. A lot of guys are doing luxury.\\" The project was planned for a 1.5-acre parcel owned by Diversified, located at the southeast corner of Casino Center Boulevard and Bonneville Street in downtown Las Vegas. The target demographic consisted of young professionals who wanted to live in the downtown area. Club Renaissance was one of several new projects being built in the downtown area, which was seeing a surge in redevelopment. Downtown Las Vegas was chosen for the project because of the area's large employee base, including lawyers. The entire project would cost $300 million, and would include of retail space, located on the first floor. Other amenities on the lower floors were to include restaurants, a food market, child day care, and dry cleaners. An additional of office space would be located on the 13th and 14th floors, with condominium units beginning on floor 15. The top two floors were to include a private club and fitness center. The building would include several floors of parking, with a total of 1,400 spaces. Construction was originally scheduled to begin in July 2005, and was expected to last about 18 months, with completion by 2007. The project received approval from the Las Vegas City Council in February 2005. Several historic railroad cottages located on the property were expected to be relocated to the Springs Preserve. The tower, expected to be 702 feet high, was one of the taller high-rise projects to be approved for downtown Las Vegas. Sales began in October 2005, at which point the starting price for units had increased into the $400,000 range because of rises in steel, concrete and labor costs. As of February 2006, the cottages remained on the site, with little progress on Club Renaissance. Gilles Pageau, a Canadian developer and the uncle of Philippe Pageau-Goyette, said he had invested $60 million of his money into the project and that he had been offered an additional $400 million from various banks to cover the construction costs. Pageau said at the time that the project would still be built. In February 2007, Goodman gave the developers two weeks to demonstrate to the Las Vegas City Council that the project was nearing construction; otherwise, he said the approval for the project would be revoked. Leanord Mussina, a spokesman for the project, had told the city council, \\"We're just a victim of construction costs. Financing has dried up to a large extent for Las Vegas. We're redesigning, trying to value engineer, to do something affordable. We're in negotiations with some large construction companies to joint venture at this point, because that's the only way to finance it.\\" Mussina estimated that it could be up to a year before the start of construction, to which Goodman responded, \\"I'm not interested in a year. I've been to three groundbreakings there so far and haven't seen ground broke.\\" Approximately $8 million or $9 million had already been spent on the project up to that point. The city council ultimately granted the project a six-month extension. At the time, part of the property that was to be used for the project was in foreclosure. By March 2007, the project had been purchased out of foreclosure by Los Angeles architect Mark Vaghei and engineer Nabih Yousseff for nearly $3.5 million. The pair had previously placed $1.2 million in liens on the property. After their purchase, they began redesigning the project to be smaller, but Club Renaissance ultimately did not materialize. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Las Vegas Category:Downtown Las Vegas Category:Unbuilt buildings and structures in the United States Category:Proposed skyscrapers in the United States ","title":"Club Renaissance"},{"id":"63770796","text":"Yevgeny Leonidovich Yuryev (; 28 March 1951 ‚Äì 25 April 2020) was a Russian officer in the Soviet and Russian Air Defence Forces. Over his military career Yuryev served in various positions, commanding brigades, divisions, corps, and finally the 5th Air and Air Defence Forces Army, before retiring in 2006 with the rank of lieutenant general. Born in Novorossiysk in 1951, Yuryev embarked on a career in the Soviet Armed Forces in 1968, attending the Engels Anti- Aircraft Missile School, and on graduation, was assigned to the Siberian Military District for service with an anti-aircraft missile division.

He was then appointed senior engineer of a mobile radar complex in the Siberian Military District, holding the position until 1977, when he became head of a regimental command post and deputy chief of staff, still within the Siberian Military District. In 1979 he enrolled in the Military Command Academy of Air Defence, graduating in 1982. The building of the Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia. Yuryev studied at the academy between 1992 and 1994, prior to being appointed to senior staff posts. After completing his studies at the Academy, Yuryev was appointed the commander of an anti-aircraft missile division in the Odessa Military District, before, in 1984, becoming chief of staff and deputy commander of an anti-aircraft missile brigade stationed in Leipzig, as part of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. This posting lasted until 1985, when he became commander of the brigade, before returning to the Soviet Union in 1988 to take up the post of chief of staff and deputy commander of an air defence division in Leningrad Military District. From 1989 to 1991 Yuryev was chief of staff and deputy commander of the air defence division in the Transcaucasian Military District, and then from 1991 to 1992 he was deputy commander of the air defence corps in the North Caucasus Military District. In 1992 Yuryev enrolled in the Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia, specialising in the study of command and staff-level operational and strategic issues. He graduated in 1994 and became a division commander in the Far Eastern Military District. From 1997 until 2001 he served as commander of the Separate Air Defence Corps, part of the Air Defence Forces, based in Yekaterinburg. In 2001 he became commander of the 5th Air and Air Defence Forces Army. During his time in command the 5th Army's area of responsibility included twenty-two subjects of the Russian Federation: five republics, four autonomous okrugs, and thirteen oblasts. During time in command the Kant air base in Kyrgyzstan was established as an overseas base of the 5th Army, as part of the aviation component of the Collective Security Treaty Organization. The 5th Air and Air Defence Forces Army also had responsibility for the launch and recovery of manned and unmanned space objects, with Yuryev and his personnel achieving good results in this work. Between 2003 and 2005 the 5th Air and Air Defence Forces Army was recognized as the best in Russia's Air Forces for combat readiness, combat training, the state of military discipline and the rule of law. For this the Army and its personnel received the thanks of the President of Russia. Yuryev served as the Army's commander until retiring in April 2006 with the rank of lieutenant general. ==Retirement and political career== Following his retirement, Yuryev was hired in June 2006 by the automobile manufacturer AvtoVAZ to be its Deputy General Director for Social and Economic Development and Cooperation with Government Agencies.

The HK97-fold major capsid protein (HK97-MCP) is the primary component of the viral capsid, which stores the viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Viruses in the realm also share a number of other characteristics, such as an icosahedral capsid, an opening in the viral capsid called a portal, a protease enzyme that empties the inside of the capsid prior to DNA packaging, and a terminase enzyme that packages viral DNA into the capsid. Duplodnaviria was established in 2019 based on the shared characteristics of viruses in the realm. There are two groups of viruses in Duplodnaviria: tailed bacteriophages of the order Caudovirales, which infect prokaryotes, and herpesviruses of the order Herpesvirales, which infect animals. Tailed bacteriophages are very diverse and ubiquitous worldwide, and they may be the oldest lineage of viruses. Herpesviruses either share a common ancestor with tailed bacteriophages or are a breakaway group from within Caudovirales. Tailed bacteriophages are important in marine ecology by recycling nutrients in organic material from their hosts and are the focus of much research, and herpesviruses are associated with a variety of diseases in animals, including humans. A common feature among viruses in Duplodnaviria is that many are able to persist in their host for long periods of time without replicating while still being able to resurface in the future. Example of this include the herpes simplex virus, which causes recurring infections, and the varicella zoster virus, which initially causes chickenpox early in life then shingles later in life. ==Etymology== The name Duplodnaviria is a portmanteau of duplo, the Latin word for double, dna, from deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), referencing that all members of the realm at founding had double-stranded DNA genomes, and -viria, which is the suffix used for virus realms. Duplodnaviria is monotypic, having only one kingdom, Heunggongvirae, so both the realm and kingdom have the same definition. Heunggongvirae takes the first part of its name from Cantonese È¶ôÊ∏Ø [Hƒìungg√≥ng], meaning and approximately pronounced \\"Hong Kong\\", which is a reference to Escherichia virus HK97, the founding member of the HK97 (Hong Kong 97) fold MCP viruses, and the suffix -virae, which is the suffix used for virus kingdoms. ==Characteristics== All viruses in Duplodnaviria contain a distinct icosahedral capsid that is composed of a major capsid protein that contains a unique folded structure, called the HK97 fold, named after the folded structure of the MCP of the bacteriophage species Escherichia virus HK97. Despite having significant variation across Duplodnaviria, the base structure of the protein is retained among all species in the realm. Other shared proteins that involve the structure and assembly of capsids include a portal protein that the opening of the capsid is made of, a protease that empties the capsid before DNA is inserted, and the terminase enzyme that inserts the DNA into the capsid. After HK97-MCP has been synthesized by the host cell's ribosomes, the viral capsid is assembled from it with the proteins bonding to each other. The inside of the capsid contains scaffold proteins that guide the geometric construction of the capsid. In the absence of separate scaffolding proteins, the delta domain of HK97-MCP, which faces toward the inside of the capsid, acts as a scaffold protein. A cylindrical opening in the capsid, called a portal, that serves as the entrance and exit for viral DNA is created with portal proteins at one of the 12 vertices of the capsid. The scaffold protein, which may be the delta domain of HK97-MCP, is removed from the inside of the capsid by the capsid maturation protease, which may also be a part of the scaffolding, breaking it and itself down to smaller molecules in a process called proteolysis that leaves the inside of the capsid empty. At the same time as capsid assembly, replication of the viral DNA occurs, creating concatemers, long molecules of DNA containing numerous copies of the viral genome. The enzyme terminase, made of two subunits, large and small, finds the viral DNA inside of the cell via the small subunit, cuts the concatemers, and creates the termini, or endings, of the genomes. Terminase recognizes a packaging signal in the genome and cuts the nucleic acid, creating a free end that it binds to. The terminase, now bound to the concatemer, attaches itself to the capsid portal and begins translocating the DNA from outside the capsid to the inside, using energy generated from ATP hydrolysis by the large subunit. As more DNA is inserted into the capsid, the capsid expands in size, becomes thinner, and its surface becomes flatter and more angular. Once the genome is completely inside, terminase cuts the concatemer again, completing packaging. Terminase then detaches itself from the portal and proceeds to repeat this process until all genomes in the concatemer have been packaged. For tailed bacteriophages, after DNA packaging, the tail of the virion, which was assembled separately, is attached to the capsid, commonly called the \\"head\\" of tailed bacteriophages, at the portal. Tailed bacteriophages also sometimes have \\"decoration\\" proteins that attach to the capsid's surface in order to reinforce the capsid's structure. After the virion is fully assembled inside the host cell, it leaves the cell. Tailed bacteriophages leave the cell via lysis, rupturing of the cell membrane, that causes cell death, and herpesviruses leave by budding from the host cell membrane, using the membrane as a viral envelope that covers the capsid. ==Phylogenetics== Tailed bacteriophages are potentially the oldest lineage of viruses in the world because they are ubiquitous worldwide, only infect prokaryotes, and have a high level of diversity. Their highly divergent virion structures may point to this or may indicate separate origins. The origin of Herpesvirales is unclear, but there are two likely scenarios. First, ancestral lineages of Caudovirales may have produced clades at various times that were capable of infecting eukaryotes, and the strong similarity that Herpesvirales has with Caudovirales may indicate that it is a more recent descendant of one such lineage. The second likely scenario is that Herpesvirales is a breakaway clade from within Caudovirales, which is supported by the Caudovirales family Myoviridae, and especially one of its subfamilies, Tevenvirinae, showing a relatively high genetic relation to herpesviruses based on certain protein amino acid sequences. It has been suggested that Duplodnaviria predates the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of cellular life and that viruses in the realm were present in the LUCA. Outside of Duplodnaviria, an HK97-like fold is only found in encapsulins, which are prokaryotic nanocompartments that encapsulate a variety of cargo proteins that are related to the oxidative stress response. High resolution images of encapsulins have also shown that they assemble into icosahedrons like the capsids of viruses in Duplodnaviria. However, the HK97-MCP in viruses is much more divergent and widespread than encapsulins, which form a narrow monophyletic clade. As such, it is more likely that encapsulins are derived from viruses than vice versa. An exception to this viewpoint is that encapsulins have also been identified in archaea of the phylum Crenarchaeota, which are not known to be infected by tailed bacteriophages, so the relation between encapsulins and Duplodnaviria remains unresolved. The ATPase subunit of Duplodnaviria terminases that generates energy for packaging viral DNA has the same general structural design of the P-loop fold as the packaging ATPases of double jelly roll viruses in the realm Varidnaviria but are otherwise not directly related to each other. While viruses in Duplodnaviria make use of the HK97 fold for their major capsid proteins, the major capsid proteins of viruses in Varidnaviria instead are marked by vertical single or double jelly roll folds. ==Classification== Duplodnaviria contains only one kingdom, and this kingdom is subdivided into two phyla that are monotypic down to the rank of order. This taxonomy can be visualized as follows: * Realm: Duplodnaviria :* Kingdom: Heunggongvirae ::* Phylum: Peploviricota :::* Class: Herviviricetes ::::* Order: Herpesvirales ‚Äì the herpesviruses, which only infect animals (eukaryotes) ::* Phylum: Uroviricota :::* Class: Caudoviricetes ::::* Order: Caudovirales ‚Äì the tailed bacteriophages, which only infect archaea and bacteria (prokaryotes) As all viruses in the realm are double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses, the realm belongs to Group I: dsDNA viruses of Baltimore classification, a classification system based on a virus's manner of messenger RNA (mRNA) production, often used alongside standard virus taxonomy, which is based on evolutionary history. Realms are the highest level of taxonomy used for viruses and Duplodnaviria is one of four, the other three being Monodnaviria, Riboviria, and Varidnaviria. ==Interactions with hosts== ===Viral shunt=== Tailed bacteriophages are ubiquitous worldwide and are a major cause of death among prokaryotes. Infection may lead to cell death via lysis, the rupturing of the cell membrane. As a result of lysis, organic material from the killed prokaryotes is released into the environment, contributing to a process called viral shunt. Tailed bacteriophages shunt nutrients from organic material away from higher trophic levels so that they can be consumed by organisms in lower trophic levels, which has the effects of recycling nutrients and promoting increased diversity among marine life. ===Disease=== Herpesviruses are associated with a wide range of diseases in their hosts, including a respiratory tract illness in chickens, a respiratory and reproductive illness in cattle, and tumors in sea turtles. In humans, herpesviruses usually cause various epithelial diseases such as herpes simplex, chickenpox and shingles, and Kaposi's sarcoma. Initial infection causes acute symptoms and leads to lifelong infection via latency. Herpesviruses may emerge from their latency to cause illnesses, which may have severe symptoms such as encephalitis and pneumonia. ===Latency=== Lytic and lysogenic cycles of tailed bacteriophages Viruses in Duplodnaviria have two different types of replication cycles, called the lytic cycle, whereby infection leads directly to virion formation and exit from the host cell, and the lysogenic cycle, whereby a latent infection retains the viral DNA inside of the host cell without virion formation, either as an episome or via integration into the host cell's DNA, with the possibility of returning to the lytic cycle in the future. Viruses that can replicate through the lysogenic cycle are called temperate or lysogenic viruses. Tailed bacteriophages vary in their temperateness, whereas all herpesviruses are temperate and able to avoid detection by the host's immune system, causing lifelong infections. ==History== Tailed bacteriophages were discovered independently by Frederick Twort in 1915 and F√©lix d'H√©relle in 1917, and they have been the focus of much research since then. Diseases in humans caused by herpesviruses have been recognized for much of recorded history, and person-to-person transmission of the herpes simplex virus, the first herpesvirus discovered, was first recognized in 1893 by √âmile Vidal.Wildy P (1973) Herpes: history and classification. In: Kaplan AS, ed. The herpes-viruses. New York: Academic Press: 1-25. Accessed 15 June 2020. Over time, the two groups were increasingly found to share many characteristics, and their genetic relation was formalized with the establishment of Duplodnaviria in 2019. The creation of the kingdom, phyla, and classes of the realm in the same year has also created a framework to more easily allow major reorganization of Caudovirales, which is growing in size significantly and which may require tailed bacteriophages to be promoted to the rank of class or higher. ==See also== * List of higher virus taxa ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Viruses ","title":"Duplodnaviria"},{"id":"63770817","text":"John Patrick Metke (May 27, 1922 ‚Äì September 8, 2013) was an American businessman and politician who served as an Oregon state legislator.

Reservations for the project's condominium units began in 2004, and construction was scheduled to start later that year, with the opening planned for 2006. Krystle Sands would have replaced the Algiers Hotel, although the project was canceled in March 2005, when developer F.W. \\"Freddie\\" Schinz sold the property to Turnberry Associates. Several people who bought units in the project filed lawsuits against Schinz and Turnberry over the cancellation. The land later became the site of Turnberry's Fontainebleau resort. ==History== Krystle Sands was being planned by F.W. \\"Freddie\\" Schinz, a Florida developer. The project was to consist of a 45-story, 510-foot condo hotel. On April 1, 2004, reservations opened for condominium units on floors 4 to 38 of the tower. The Krystle Sands project was to replace the 105-room Algiers Hotel, located on a 3.6-acre site on the Las Vegas Strip, adjacent to the Turnberry Place complex and to the former site of the El Rancho Hotel and Casino. At the time of the announcement, 70 percent of the project's 600 units had been reserved. Most units would range from to , with prices from $400,000 to more than $700,000. Although the tower was to be 45 stories high, it would skip the 13th floor. The tower's penthouses, starting at $1 million, would be located from floors 39 to 44, and would range from to more than . Restaurants and retail were planned for the tower's first and second floors. The third floor was to consist of a recreation center and pool for condominium owners and renters. A rooftop restaurant was also planned. JMA Architecture Studios was the architect. Perini Building Company was to be the general contractor. Krystle Sands was to cost $400 million, and was to begin construction in October 2004, with an opening in summer 2006. Schinz paid more than $26.2 million for the land, and closed on the deal in July 2004. The project was to be handled by Krystle Sands LLC, a limited liability company formed by Schinz in Florida. The company name was later changed to Krystle Towers LLC. In March 2005, Schinz sold Krystle Towers LLC and the property for $97 million to Turnberry Associates, which owned the Turnberry Place complex and the former land of the El Rancho. To avoid paying a real estate transfer tax, Turnberry purchased the Krystle Sands project in addition to the property on which it was to be built. Turnberry announced the cancellation of Krystle Sands to buyers in a letter on March 25, 2005, stating that it was unable to receive construction financing to build the project. A condominium boom was underway in Las Vegas at the time, and Krystle Sands was the first of the newly proposed projects to be canceled. Shortly after the cancellation was announced, some buyers of the project's condominium units filed five lawsuits against Schinz, Krystle Sands LLC, Krystle Towers LLC, and Fidelity National Title Agency of Nevada. One lawsuit sought class-action status. Each lawsuit alleged that Schinz never planned to build the tower and was in the process of seeking a buyer for the property while selling the project's 600 units, in an alleged attempt to make what would ultimately become a $70 million profit. Other claims in the lawsuits included allegations of fraud, deceptive trade practices and civil conspiracy. Plaintiffs sought at least $70 million in damages, as well as the return of escrow money to the buyers. One lawsuit alleged that Turnberry had made false statements regarding its reason for cancelling Krystle Sands, noting that four days earlier, Turnberry had announced that it received construction financing for a separate 636-unit tower at its Turnberry Place complex. A class action lawsuit consisting of 150 buyers was underway by June 2006, alleging that Turnberry had an obligation to provide condominium units to buyers who signed purchase and sale agreements and placed 10 percent of the purchase price in escrow. Turnberry stated that all deposits made on Krystle Sands units had been returned and that the company had no intention of building the project. A lawyer representing the buyer group alleged that Turnberry lied to buyers about being unable to obtain construction financing for Krystle Sands as part of an attempt to build its Fontainebleau resort (later known as \\"The Drew Las Vegas\\") on the property: \\"They had to figure a way to lie to buyers and not tell the truth that they're going to jettison the project to build Fountainbleu [sic].\\" The case was expected to go to trial in March 2007. ==References== Category:Las Vegas Strip Category:Buildings and structures in Winchester, Nevada Category:Unbuilt buildings and structures in the United States Category:Proposed skyscrapers in the United States ","title":"Krystle Sands"},{"id":"63770837","text":"Sequences is a mathematical monograph on integer sequences. It was written by Heini Halberstam and Klaus Roth, published in 1966 by the Clarendon Press, and republished in 1983 with minor corrections by Springer-Verlag. Although planned to be part of a two-volume set, the second volume was never published. ==Topics== The book has five chapters, each largely self-contained and loosely organized around different techniques used to solve problems in this area, with an appendix on the background material in number theory needed for reading the book. Rather than being concerned with specific sequences such as the prime numbers or square numbers, its topic is the mathematical theory of sequences in general. The first chapter considers the natural density of sequences, and related concepts such as the Schnirelmann density. It proves theorems on the density of sumsets of sequences, including Mann's theorem that the Schnirelmann density of a sumset is at least the sum of the Schnirelmann densities and Kneser's theorem on the structure of sequences whose lower asymptotic density is subadditive. It studies essential components, sequences that when added to another sequence of Schnirelmann density between zero and one, increase their density, proves that additive bases are essential components, and gives examples of essential components that are not additive bases. The second chapter concerns the number of representations of the integers as sums of a given number of elements from a given sequence, and includes the Erd≈ës‚ÄìFuchs theorem according to which this number of representations cannot be close to a linear function. The third chapter continues the study of numbers of representations, using the probabilistic method; it includes the theorem that there exists an additive basis of order two whose number of representations is logarithmic, later strengthened to all orders in the Erd≈ës‚ÄìTetali theorem. After a chapter on sieve theory and the large sieve (unfortunately missing significant developments that happened soon after the book's publication), the final chapter concerns primitive sequences of integers, sequences like the prime numbers in which no element is divisible by another. It includes Behrend's theorem that such a sequence must have logarithmic density zero, and the seemingly-contradictory construction by Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch of primitive sequences with natural density close to 1/2. It also discusses the sequences that contain all integer multiples of their members, the Davenport‚ÄìErd≈ës theorem according to which the lower natural and logarithmic density exist and are equal for such sequences, and a related construction of Besicovitch of a sequence of multiples that has no natural density. ==Audience and reception== This book is aimed at other mathematicians and students of mathematics; it is not suitable for a general audience. However, reviewer J. W. S. Cassels suggests that it could be accessible to advanced undergraduates in mathematics. Reviewer E. M. Wright notes the book's \\"accurate scholarship\\", \\"most readable exposition\\", and \\"fascinating topics\\". Reviewer Marvin Knopp describes the book as \\"masterly\\", and as the first book to overview additive combinatorics. Similarly, although Cassels notes the existence of material on additive combinatorics in the books Additive Zahlentheorie (Ostmann, 1956) and Addition Theorems (Mann, 1965), he calls this \\"the first connected account\\" of the area, and reviewer Harold Stark notes that much of material covered by the book is \\"unique in book form\\". Knopp also praises the book for, in many cases, correcting errors or deficiencies in the original sources that it surveys. Reviewer Harold Stark writes that the book \\"should be a standard reference in this area for years to come\\". ==References== Category:Additive combinatorics Category:Integer sequences Category:Mathematics books Category:1966 non-fiction books Category:1983 non-fiction books ","title":"Sequences (book)"},{"id":"63770854","text":"Monodnaviria is a realm of viruses that includes all single-stranded DNA viruses that encode an endonuclease of the HUH superfamily that initiates rolling circle replication of the circular viral genome. Viruses descended from such viruses are also included in the realm, including certain linear single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses and circular double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses. These atypical members replicate through means other than rolling circle replication. Monodnaviria was established in 2019 and contains four kingdoms: Loebvirae, Sangervirae, Trapavirae, and Shotokuvirae. Viruses in the first three kingdoms infect prokaryotes, and viruses in Shotokuvirae infect eukaryotes and include the atypical members of the realm. Viruses in Monodnaviria appear to have come into existence independently multiple times from circular bacterial and archaeal plasmids that encode the HUH endonuclease. Eukaryotic viruses in the realm appear to have come into existence multiple times via genetic recombination events that merged deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from the aforementioned plasmids with capsid proteins of certain RNA viruses. Most identified ssDNA viruses belong to Monodnaviria. The prototypic members of the realm are often called CRESS-DNA, or CRESS DNA, viruses. CRESS-DNA viruses are associated with a wide range of diseases, including diseases in economically important crops and a variety of diseases in animals. The atypical members of the realm include papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses, which are known to cause various cancers. Members of Monodnaviria are also known to frequently become integrated into the DNA of their hosts as well as experience a relatively high rate of genetic mutations and recombinations. ==Etymology== Monodnaviria is a portmanteau of mono, from Greek ŒºœåŒΩŒøœÇ [m√≥nos], meaning single, DNA from deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), referencing single-stranded DNA, and the suffix -viria, which is the suffix used for virus realms. The prototypic members of Monodnaviria are often called CRESS-DNA, or CRESS DNA, viruses, which stands for \\"circular Rep- encoding ssDNA\\" viruses. ==Characteristics== ===Endonuclease-initiated replication=== All prototypical viruses in Monodnaviria encode an endonuclease of the HUH superfamily.The only exception to this is that certain inoviruses do not encode the HUH endonuclease. Endonucleases are enzymes that can cleave phosphodiester bonds within a polynucleotide chain. HUH, or HuH, endonucleases are endonucleases that contain a HUH motif made of two histidine residues separated by a bulky hydrophobic residue and a Y motif that contains one or two tyrosine residues. The HUH endonuclease of ssDNA viruses is often called the replication initiation protein, or simply Rep, because its cleavage of the viral genome initiates replication. Once the viral ssDNA is inside of the host cell, it is replicated by the host cell's DNA polymerase to produce a double- stranded form of the viral genome. Rep then recognizes a short sequence on the 3'-end (usually pronounced \\"three prime end\\") at the origin of replication. Upstream from the recognition site, Rep binds to the DNA and nicks the positive-sense strand, creating a nic site. In doing so, Rep binds to the 5'-end (usually pronounced \\"five prime end\\") via a tyrosine residue that covalently bonds to the phosphate backbone of DNA, creating a phosphotyrosine molecule that connects Rep to the viral DNA. The 3'-end of the nicked strand remains as a free hydroxyl (OH) end that acts a signal for the host DNA polymerase to replicate the genome. Replication commences at the 3'-OH end and is performed by extending the 3'-end of the positive strand using the negative strand as a template for replication. During replication, the original positive strand is gradually displaced by the newly replicated positive strand. After one cycle of replicating the genome, Rep is able to recognize the newly replicated recognition and nic sites on the extended positive strand. Rep may nick the positive strand a second time, doing so with a second tyrosine residue, or a new Rep may nick the DNA. Multiple copies of the genome may be produced in a single strand. After the positive strand is completely detached from the negative strand and nicked, the 3'-OH end bonds to the phosphotyrosine of the 5'-end, creating a free circular ssDNA genome that usually is either converted into dsDNA for transcription or further replication or is packaged into newly constructed viral capsids. The replication process can be repeated numerous times on the same circular genome to produce many copies of the original viral genome. Atypical members While the prototypical viruses in Monodnaviria have circular ssDNA genomes and replicate via RCR, some have linear ssDNA genomes with different replication methods, including the families Parvoviridae and Bidnaviridae, assigned to the phylum Cossaviricota of the kingdom Shotokuvirae. Parvoviruses and bidnaviruses use rolling hairpin replication, in which each end of the genome has a hairpin loop, a palindromic structure in which nucleotides are not placed into base pairs. For parvoviruses, the DNA is repaired by the host DNA polymerase to form dsDNA. One end of each hairpin loop is then nicked from the coding portion of the genome by Rep, and the hairpin loop is then replicated by the DNA polymerase. The two strands are then split apart, and hairpin loops are formed at both ends of both strands. In place of the HUH endonuclease, bidnaviruses encode their own protein-primed DNA polymerase that replicates the genome, which is bipartite and packaged into two separate virions, instead of using the host cell's DNA polymerase for replication. Additionally, some viruses in the realm are dsDNA viruses with circular genomes, including Polyomaviridae and Papillomaviridae, also assigned to the phylum Cossaviricota. Instead of replicating via RCR, these viruses use bidirectional DNA replication. Bidirectional DNA replication begins by unwinding the dsDNA at a site called the origin, creating a fork in the DNA molecule where both strands are separated from each other. Each strand is replicated separately at the fork by extending one strand while using the other as a template, replication moving in opposite directions along the genome until the opposite side of the circular genome is reached as replication is completed. ===Other characteristics=== Apart from the aforementioned replication methods, ssDNA viruses in Monodnaviria share a number of other common characteristics. The capsids of ssDNA viruses, which store the viral DNA, are usually icosahedral in shape and composed of either one type of protein or, in the case of parvoviruses, multiple types of proteins. All ssDNA viruses that have had the structure of their capsid proteins analyzed in high resolution have shown to contain a single jelly roll fold in their folded structure. Nearly all families of ssDNA viruses have a positive-sense genome, the sole exception being viruses in the family Anelloviridae, unassigned to a realm, which have a negative-sense genome. In any case, ssDNA viruses have their genomes converted to a dsDNA form prior to transcription, which creates the messenger RNA (mRNA) needed to produce viral proteins from ribosomal translation. CRESS-DNA viruses also have similar genome structures, genome lengths, and gene compositions. Lastly, ssDNA viruses have a relatively high rate of genetic recombinations and substitution mutations. Genetic recombination, or mixture, of ssDNA genomes can occur between closely related viruses when a gene is replicated and transcribed at the same time, which may cause the host cell's DNA polymerases to switch DNA templates (negative strands) during the process, causing recombination. These recombinations usually occur in the negative strand and either outside of or at the peripheries of genes rather than toward the middle of genes. The high substitution rate seen in ssDNA viruses is unusual since replication is performed primarily by the host cell's DNA polymerase, which contains proofreading mechanisms to prevent mutations. Substitutions in ssDNA viral genomes may occur because the viral DNA may become oxidatively damaged while the genome is inside the capsid. The prevalence of recombinations and substitutions among ssDNA viruses means that eukaryotic ssDNA viruses can emerge as threatening pathogens. ==Phylogenetics== Comparison of genomes and phylogenetic analyses of the HUH endonucleases, superfamily 3 helicases (S3H), and capsid proteins of viruses in Monodnaviria have shown that they have multiple, chimeric origins. HUH endonucleases of CRESS-DNA viruses are most similar to those found in small, RCR bacterial and archael plasmids, extra-chromosomal DNA molecules inside bacteria and archaea, and appear to have evolved from them at least three times. HUH endonucleases of prokaryotic CRESS-DNA viruses seem to have originated from plasmid endonucleases that lacked the S3H domain, whereas eukaryotic CRESS-DNA viruses evolved from ones that had S3H domains. The capsid proteins of eukaryotic CRESS-DNA viruses are most closely related those of various animal and plant positive-sense RNA viruses, which belong to the realm Riboviria. Because of this, eukaryotic CRESS-DNA viruses appear to have emerged multiple times from recombination events that merged DNA from bacterial and archaeal plasmids with complementary DNA (cDNA) copies of positive-sense RNA viruses. CRESS-DNA viruses therefore represent a notable instance of convergent evolution, whereby organisms that are not directly related evolve the same or similar traits. Linear ssDNA viruses, specifically parvoviruses, in Monodnaviria are likely to have evolved from CRESS-DNA viruses via loss of the joining activity used by CRSS-DNA viruses to create circular genomes. In turn, the circular dsDNA viruses in Monodnaviria appear to have evolved from parvoviruses through inactivation of the endonuclease's HUH domain. The HUH domain then became a DNA-binding domain, switching these viruses' manner of replication to bidirectional replication. The capsid proteins of these circular dsDNA viruses are highly divergent, so it is unclear if they evolved from parvovirus capsid proteins or through other means. Bidnaviruses, which are linear ssDNA viruses, appear to have been created as a result of a parvovirus genome becoming integrated into the genome of a polinton, a type of self-replicating genomic DNA molecule, which replaced the HUH endonuclease with a polinton's DNA polymerase. ==Classification== Monodnaviria has four kingdoms: Loebvirae, Sangervirae, Shotokuvirae, and Trapavirae. Loebvirae is monotypic down to the rank of order, and Sangervirae and Trapavirae are monotypic down to the rank of family. This taxonomy is described further as follows: *Kingdom: Loebvirae, which only infect bacteria, have filamentous or rod-shaped virions formed from an alpha-helical capsid protein, and encode a morphogenesis protein that is an ATPase of the FtsK-HerA superfamily **Phylum: Hofneiviricota ***Class: Faserviricetes ****Order: Tubulavirales *Kingdom: Sangervirae, which only infect bacteria, have a capsid protein that contains a single jelly roll fold, and have a pilot protein required for transferring DNA across the cell envelope. The endonuclease of Sangervirae may also be a unifying trait since it appears to be monophyletic. **Phylum: Phixviricota ***Class: Malgrandaviricetes ****Order: Petitvirales *****Family: Microviridae *Kingdom: Shotokuvirae, which encode an endonuclease containing an endonuclease domain, or a derivative of one, at the start of the protein's amino acid sequence and a superfamily 3 helicase domain at the end of the protein's amino acid sequence. Shotokuvirae notably includes linear ssDNA and circular dsDNA viruses, assigned to its phylum Cossaviricota, that are descended from CRESS-DNA viruses, assigned to the kingdom's other phylum Cressdnaviricota. *Kingdom: Trapavirae, which only infect archaea and which have a viral envelope that contains a membrane fusion protein **Phylum: Saleviricota ***Class: Huolimaviricetes ****Order: Haloruvirales *****Family: Pleolipoviridae Monodnaviria includes the vast majority of identified ssDNA viruses, which are Group II: ssDNA viruses in the Baltimore classification system, which groups viruses together based on how they produce mRNA, often used alongside standard virus taxonomy, which is based on evolutionary history.. Of the 16 ssDNA virus families, three are not assigned to Monodnaviria, all three being unassigned to a realm: Anelloviridae, Finnlakeviridae, a proposed member of the realm Varidnaviria, and Spiraviridae. The dsDNA viruses in Monodnaviria are assigned to Baltimore Group I: dsDNA viruses. Realms are the highest level of taxonomy used for viruses and Monodnaviria is one of four, the other three being Duplodnaviria, Riboviria, and Varidnaviria. Although Anelloviridae is currently unassigned to a realm, it is a potential member of Monodnaviria since it appears to be morphologically similar to circoviruses. It has been suggested that anelloviruses are essentially CRESS-DNA viruses with negative sense genomes, unlike the typical positive sense genomes. ==Interactions with hosts== ===Disease=== The eukaryotic CRESS-DNA viruses are associated with a variety of diseases. Plant viruses in the families Geminiviridae and Nanoviridae infect economically important crops, causing significant damage to agricultural productivity. Animal viruses in Circoviridae are associated with many diseases, including respiratory illness, intestinal illness, and reproductive problems. Bacilladnaviruses, which primarily infect diatoms, are thought to have a significant role in controlling algal blooms. The atypical members of the realm are also associated with many widely known diseases. Parvoviruses are most widely known for causing a lethal infection in canids as well as causing fifth disease in humans. Papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses are known to cause different types of cancers and other diseases. A polyomavirus is responsible for Merkel-cell carcinoma, and papillomaviruses cause various genital and other cancers as well as warts. ===Endogenization=== The Rep protein lacks homologues in cellular organisms, so it can be searched for within an organism's genome to identify if viral DNA has become endogenized as part of the organism's genome. Among eukaryotes, endogenization is most often observed in plants, but it is also observed in animals, fungi, and various protozoans. Endogenization can occur through several means such as the integrase or transpose enzymes or by exploiting the host cell's recombination machinery. Most endogenized ssDNA viruses are in non-coding regions of the organism's genome, but sometimes the viral genes are expressed, and the Rep protein may be used by the organism. Because viral DNA can become a part of an organism's genome, this represents an example of horizontal gene transfer between unrelated organisms that can be used to study evolutionary history. By comparing related organisms, it is possible to estimate the approximate age of ssDNA viruses. For example, comparison of animal genomes has shown that circoviruses and parvoviruses first integrated into their hosts' genomes at least 40-50 million years ago. ==History== The earliest reference to a virus in Monodnaviria was made in a poem written in 752 by Japanese Empress Shotoku, describing a yellowing or vein clearing disease of Eupatorium plants that was likely caused by a geminivirus. Centuries later, a circovirus infection that caused balding in birds was observed in Australia in 1888, marking the first reference to ssDNA viruses in modern times. The first animal CRESS-DNA virus to be characterized was the porcine circovirus in 1974, and in 1977, the first genome of an ssDNA virus, the Bean golden mosaic virus, was detailed. Beginning in the 1970s, the families of related members in Monodnaviria began to be organized, Parvoviridae becoming the first ssDNA family recognized with additional families being continually discovered. In recent years, analyses of viral DNA in various contexts such as fecal matter and marine sediments have shown that ssDNA viruses are widespread throughout nature, and the increased knowledge of their diversity has helped to greater understand their evolutionary history. The relation between CRESS-DNA viruses was resolved from 2015 to 2017, leading to the establishment of Monodnaviria in 2019 based on their shared relation, including viruses descended from them. Despite appearing to have polyphyletic origins, the similar genome structure, genome length, and gene compositions of CRESS-DNA viruses provided the justification to unite them under a realm. ==See also== * List of higher virus taxa ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Viruses ","title":"Monodnaviria"},{"id":"63770870","text":"Tubulavirales is an order of viruses. ==Taxonomy== The following families are recognized: *Inoviridae *Plectroviridae ==References== Category:Virus orders ","title":"Tubulavirales"},{"id":"63770871","text":"Pinnacle was a proposed two-tower condo hotel project that was to be built near the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. The project was announced in 2005, and would have included 1,104 units across two 36-story towers. Construction was to begin in 2006, but was delayed several times. Pinnacle was ultimately canceled in March 2008, due to financing issues caused by the Great Recession. ==History== Plans were announced for Pinnacle in March 2005, when the Las Vegas Valley was experiencing a condominium boom. The mixed-use project would include two condominium towers, to be built on a property at the southwest corner of West Tropicana Avenue and Cameron Avenue, across from The Orleans hotel-casino. It would be located a mile and a half west of the Las Vegas Strip. The land was occupied at that time by the Falconi Honda automobile dealership, which closed in October 2004. The property had been owned since 1987 by Angelo Falconi, a Pittsburgh businessman. The Pinnacle project was being planned by The Falcon Group, led by Falconi in partnership with Elysium Enterprises, a Las Vegas consulting firm, and Praxis Resources Inc., a Pittsburgh development company. Pinnacle was to include 1,104 condominium units, located across two 36-story gold glass towers that would be adjoined by three sky bridges, which would contain units themselves. The towers would measure 410 feet in height. Condominium buyers would be given the option of combining units into a single unit. Other plans included retail, office, and restaurant space. As of November 2005, the project was expected to cost $650 million. A search for a general contractor was underway at the time, with New York-based Turner Construction ultimately being chosen. In addition to condo unit sales, the project would also receive financing from Marshall & Stevens, a New York firm. In March 2006, Falcon chose Youngblood Wucherer Sparer Architects to design the project, which was now expected to cost $850 million. In May 2006, it was announced that Interstate Hotels & Resorts would manage a portion of Pinnacle, as condo owners would have the option of putting their unit into a condo hotel rental program. In June 2006, The Falcon Group began negotiations with Berkshire Capital Financial of New York for a $550 million loan, while Pinnacle's sales office was scheduled to open later that month. Berkshire agreed to provide $40 million in interim financing. Groundbreaking was initially to take place around November 2006, with completion scheduled for the second quarter of 2009. Hawaiian residents were among the target demographic. The Falconi Honda dealership was demolished in July 2007, to make room for the new project. Up to that time, Falcon Group had spent two years to plan the project and to obtain entitlements and zoning. At the time, the property for Pinnacle was valued at approximately $8 million per acre. By the time of demolition, Marnell Corrao Associates had been chosen as the new general contractor. Groundbreaking was now scheduled for later in 2007, with the opening planned for spring 2010. Approximately 2,000 construction jobs would be created by the project, which would ultimately employ 500 people upon opening. At that time, condominium prices were from the $400,000 range to more than $1.4 million. Amenities were to include a wet deck, a movie theater, a health and fitness center, restaurants, a spa, and an office and business center. Michael Bellon, managing partner for The Falcon Group, said, \\"We wanted to create something that single-handedly redefined the standard of Las Vegas condominium living.\\" By September 2007, Marnell Corrao had been replaced by Dick Pacific Construction, which also became a partner in the project. In October 2007, after repeated delays, groundbreaking was announced to begin by mid-2008. In January 2008, Green Cable LLC filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of Pinnacle condominium buyers. Green Cable sued the development team for an alleged breach of contract, as construction had yet to begin after three years. The lawsuit stated that buyers initially purchased units with the belief that Pinnacle would be opened by August 2008. The suit sought at least $5 million in returned deposits, damages and attorney's fees. It also alleged that the property site was contaminated with high benzene levels because of dropping ground water levels. Sam Schwartz, a principal for Green Cable, said, \\"Generally, we believe Pinnacle is an excellent project. At this point in time, however, due to the construction delays the project has endured, the buyers I represent, including myself, believe it is in the best interests of all the parties that we go our separate ways.\\" Pinnacle's sales gallery closed on February 22, 2008, and the project's cancellation was announced on March 3, 2008. The cancellation was the result of financial issues brought on by the Great Recession, as the project did not pre-sell enough units to qualify for its first round of loan money. The project had pre-sold about 48 percent of its units, although 55 percent was required to qualify for the financing. The land was later sold through foreclosure in 2013, and plans were approved in 2017 for a five-story apartment building to be constructed on the site. However, the property remained vacant as of 2019. ==References== ==External links== * Official website, archived via the Wayback Machine Category:Buildings and structures in Paradise, Nevada Category:Unbuilt buildings and structures in the United States ","title":"Pinnacle (Las Vegas)"},{"id":"63770880","text":"Sofija ≈Öesterova (born 6 August 2001) is a Latvian footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Sievie≈°u Futbola Lƒ´ga club Rƒ´gas FS and the Latvia women's national team. ==References== Category:2001 births Category:Living people Category:Women's association football goalkeepers Category:Latvian women's footballers Category:Latvia women's international footballers Category:Rƒ´gas FS players ","title":"Sofija ≈Öesterova"},{"id":"63770881","text":"is an unreleased platform video game that was in development for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 by Namco Bandai Games. It was intended as a modernized sequel to the arcade game Metro-Cross, and the third released under the Namco Generations series of video game remakes. Players control a runner through each level in an effort to get to the end stage goal before the timer runs out. Levels feature hazards that must be overcome, and there are also power-ups that grant player with different abilities, such as a speed boost or being able to glide over the level. Aero-Cross was produced by Hideo Yoshizawa, the creator of Klonoa and Mr. Driller. Yoshizawa liked the original Metro-Cross for having the player try to find the fastest possible route to the goal at the end of each level, and wanted to expand on this concept in Aero-Cross. He also focused on stage hazards, player acceleration, and co- operative play. The game was announced in October 2010 and cancelled in December 2012 following a lack of updates on its production. Compared to the other cancelled Namco Generations game, a reboot of the infamous puzzle game Dancing Eyes, critics felt that Aero-Cross had potential. They praised its gameplay and evolution on the original Metro-Cross gameplay, and showed disappointment in its cancellation. ==Gameplay== The player gliding across the level with the hoverboard. The player's score is displayed at the top right, and the timer at the bottom. Aero-Cross is presented as an arcade-style platform game, with emphasis on speed and acceleration. Players control a runner through each course, with the goal being to reach the end before the timer runs out. The end of each level is indicated by a large circular goalpost, with a map being provided at the bottom that shows how far they have reached. Levels feature different themes, such as futuristic cities, deserts, and factories. In these levels, players will need to overcome different stage hazards that will cause their runner to be temporarily stunned and their timer to deplete further. Hazards include giant steel cylinders, tiles that slow down the player if touched, walls that emerge from the ground, and computer- controlled opponents. There are item capsules placed through stages as well, each containing power-ups that grant different abilities. Three items were revealed: a speed boost, a clock that stops time, and a hoverboard that allows players to glide over the level. Running behind opponents creates an effect called a \\"slipstream\\", allowing players to run faster than usual. Players can also perform an \\"air dash\\" that grants them a temporary boost in speed. Air dashing can also be used to knock opponents off of the map and destroy incoming obstacles. ==History== ===Development and promotion=== Aero-Cross was intended as the third game under the Namco Generations label, a brand created by Namco Bandai Games for use on modernized remakes of their older titles. The first of these was Pac-Man Championship Edition DX, a critically acclaimed follow-up to Pac-Man Championship Edition. Aero-Cross was produced by Hideo Yoshizawa, the creator of Namco's Klonoa and Mr. Driller franchises and the chief producer of the Namco Generations series. It was intended as the sequel to Metro-Cross, a 1985 platform arcade game that was popular in Japan. Yoshizawa appreciated the game for having the player try to find the fastest possible route to the goal at the end of each level, and wanted to expand on this concept in Aero-Cross. He also wanted to focus on co-operative play, player acceleration, and variations in stage hazards. Many of the game's mechanics and concepts were kept secret. A trademark for the game was filed in Germany and Australia in August, followed by a rating by the Entertainment Software Rating Board. Namco Bandai officially announced Aero-Cross in October 2010, alongside Galaga Legions DX. Due to the obscurity of the original Metro- Cross, and for it being released alongside more recognizable series like Pac- Man and Galaxian, the reveal was met with confusion from publications. The company described it as a \\"dynamic running action\\" game, and advertised its speed and acceleration. Namco Bandai also said that it would be published for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as a digital download. ===Cancellation=== As the years progressed, Namco Bandai remained relatively silent towards Aero- Cross and the Namco Generations series itself. This was met with confusion from video game news sites, who were speculating if the game was even in production or not. On December 6, 2012, the company announced that Aero-Cross was officially cancelled, alongside the indefinite discontinuation of the Namco Generations brand. They cited \\"various circumstances\\" as the reason for its cancellation. Publications showed interest in Aero-Cross. Writing for Engadget, JG Fletcher said that compared to the other cancelled Namco Generations game, a remake of Dancing Eyes (1996), Aero-Cross had potential. Describing it as \\"a much more sensible update\\", Fletcher commented on the game's new features and for building upon the original Metro-Cross gameplay in an interesting manner, writing: \\"I do wish I'd had the opportunity to play that, as I spent a few really happy hours in college working through the arcade original on PlayStation. Unlike Dancing Eyes, I can admit to wanting to play that without ending up on some list.\\" Game Watchs Kenji Saeki and Game*Sparks Rikusyo stated that the game's cancellation was disappointing to hear. Jordan Devore of Destructoid believed that the game would likely never have had that large of an audience, and would have made much more sense as a mobile phone title than a console game. He concluded in his article: \\"Considering how much we've actually seen of the project (very little), it shouldn't be too heartbreaking to hear that Aero-Cross has been canceled. If I'm being generous, I could maybe see this type of game performing decently on mobile devices, but it was likely never destined to have a huge audience no matter the platform. Bummer, though -- Metro-Cross was great.\\" ==Notes== ==References== Category:Cancelled Xbox 360 games Category:Cancelled PlayStation 3 games Category:Namco Generations Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Platform games ","title":"Aero-Cross"},{"id":"63770904","text":"The Bhadra dynasty () was a South Asian royal house which had reigned over the kingdom of Samatata, located in what is present-day Bangladesh. Of Brahmin origin, their rule flourished during the first half of the 7th century, though little is known about their history. The kings of the dynasty bore names with the suffix \\"Bhadra\\", leading to suggestions of familial links with the vassal chiefs Samanta Narayanabhadra and Jyeshthabhadra, who find mention in the Vappaghosavata grant of Jayanaga and the Nidhanpur grant of Bhaskaravarman respectively. Deddadevi, the wife of the first Pala emperor Gopala I and mother to his successor Dharmapala, is believed to have been the daughter of a Bhadra monarch. Additionally, the Chinese traveller Xuanzang described ≈öƒ´labhadra, a prominent scholar at Nalanda Monastery, as being a scion of this family. In relation to the latter, the historian P. L. Paul suggests that the \\"Bhadra\\" name only became associated with the dynasty as a result of the fame of ≈öƒ´labhadra. Paul posits that the family were in fact identical to the Khadga dynasty, who ruled Samatata during the remainder of the 7th century. Alternatively, it may be that the Bhadras were overthrown by the latter. ==References== Category:Dynasties of Bengal Category:History of Bengal Category:History of Bangladesh ","title":"Bhadra dynasty"},{"id":"63770926","text":"The Teita mabuya or African red-sided skink (Trachylepis perrotetii) is a species of skink found in Africa. ==References== Category:Trachylepis Category:Reptiles described in 1839 Category:Taxa named by Andr√© Marie Constant Dum√©ril Category:Taxa named by Gabriel Bibron ","title":"Trachylepis perrotetii"},{"id":"63770931","text":"The following is a list of all reported tropical cyclones within the Australian region between 90¬∞E and 160¬∞E in the 1950s. ==1950-51== *December 10 ‚Äì 11, 1950 ‚Äì A tropical cyclone passed overland to the west of Groote Eylandt, where hurricane-force winds generated a storm surge. *January 10 ‚Äì 24, 1951 ‚Äì During January 10, a tropical cyclone moved into the Gulf of Carpentria near Karumba.

The Town Hall was constructed in 1838 and significantly extended and altered in 1845, 1897 and 1923. The Town Hall building was designed by Weightman and Hadfield of Sheffield for the 12th Duke of Norfolk. It is constructed from millstone grit ashlar and topped with a distinctive circular cupola and clock. It is Grade II listed in a group with the market and Municipal Buildings to the south, and rows of shops either side which were also part of Hadfield's design, and which marked the transition of Howard Town from a satellite industrial village to a freestanding urban entity. It lies in the Norfolk Square Conservation Area which includes a number of other listed buildings around the square. The main elevation, intact with many surviving architectural details, forms an important part of the composition of the historic Norfolk Square. A blue plaque was erected by Glossop Heritage Trust in 2015 to commemorate its architect Matthew Ellison Hadfield and his contribution to the area. ==Description== The building is Italianate in style and designed in its original form as a T-plan. The north elevation fronts High Street West opposite Norfolk Square with the taller town hall block surrounded by four shops either side. One of the domed pavilions on the ends has now been demolished. The ground floor has vermiculated rustication and a central five-bay open arcade (leading to the market hall) with round arches and Tuscan Doric columns, flanked by single doorways with double doors and moulded ashlar surrounds and bracketed hoods. There is a square clock turret on the roof with a circular cupola. Glossop Municipal Buildings and council car park Facing south, connected to the market hall and Town Hall, is the Municipal Buildings of 1923, which still serves as council offices, a function shared with Buxton Town Hall at the other end of the borough, and also as an information centre. This is in a different, more Classical, style with further use of Tuscan Doric columns, but also gables and vermiculated quoins, topped by a parapet with Vitruvian scroll motif. To the south of the Municipal Buildings and outdoor market, there is a large public car park surfaced with asphalt, beneath which runs the culverted Glossop Brook. ==History== A postcard of Norfolk Square and Glossop Town Hall, c.1910 A shop inside the downstairs arcade The town of Glossop began to develop on the junction of two roads in a fairly remote location as activity was stimulated in the 16th and 17th centuries by the expansion of the wool and cotton industries which expanded further in the 18th century by industrialisation. As the mill's trade grew, the population rose rapidly, as did demand for housing and services. The new community became known as Howardtown ‚Äì named after the Lords of the Manor who were at that time the Howards, Dukes of Norfolk ‚Äì and was the most populated and important township within Glossop. No elected administration existed and all communal facilities such as roads and public buildings were the responsibility of the landowner, the Duke. In 1838, Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk, commissioned the building of the Town Hall to provide an administrative centre to the thriving township. The foundation stone of the Town Hall was laid with much ceremony, on Queen Victoria's coronation day, 28 June 1838. The two-storey building was designed by the locally born Matthew Ellison Hadfield with his partner John Grey Weightman. It was completed by the end of 1842 and the scheme cost ¬£8,500 (). The square clock turret to the roof was added in 1897 and is topped with a circular cupola. The form of the Town Hall ‚Äì an arcaded space open to front and rear, and two rooms upstairs, facing onto the High Street ‚Äì was similar to those found in many English towns from the late Middle Ages up to the Georgian era, and designed to provide a meeting place above and a covered market area below. Its Italian Renaissance style, which had been popular, was somewhat out of date for its time, with public buildings having been adopting the Classical style, with tastes turning towards the Gothic Revival. Matthew Ellison Hadfield was one of the pioneers of the Gothic Revival, and it is not clear why he adopted the Italian style for this building. A possibility is that he was just conforming to the conservative tastes of his client, the Duke, then aged 73. Had Hadfield had free rein, Glossop's town hall might have been in the much more modern Gothic style. The good proportions of the \\"Georgian Italianate\\", while distinguishing, are faintly out of place in the otherwise plainly 19th-century setting. In the middle of the century, the chaotic development and resulting squalor and disorder of local mill towns such as Ashton and Stalybridge led to a drive in such towns to establish specific urban governance arrangements in the form of borough or urban district status, which came with new town halls in part to accommodate the new paid administrators. Until 1866, about 40 years after most towns of a similar size, Glossop continued to be run by the parish and manor, as the Howard estate owned virtually all the land and its agents controlled the local governance. There was, therefore, no need for offices within the Town Hall, as the administration was based at the Estate Office at Glossop Hall half a mile away. When a Borough Council was finally established, it held its meetings in the Town Hall, but its offices were scattered around the town. The primary function of the upstairs rooms was as a home for the courts. Before the Victoria Hall was opened in the town in 1888, the Town Hall was practically the only place where balls, bazaars, sales of work, concerts, and public meetings could be held. It has also been the object of attack by-election rioters. It also had an important educational function; on 15 January 1856, Edmund Potter, owner of the largest calico printworks in the world and grandfather of Beatrix, gave a lecture there, to the Littlemoor & Howard Town Mechanics' Institution, on his researches into the town, entitled \\"A Picture of a Manufacturing District\\". Henry Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk, came into possession of the manor of Glossop on the death of his father and during his time he made many improvements in the town. One of his first acts was to obtain the Glossop Market Act in 1844, as the informal weekly market had grown steadily in size and was clearly meeting a local need, but required larger accommodation. The market hall, to the south of the Town Hall and connected to its arcade, was opened on 12 July 1845 and proved such a success that it was enlarged in 1854. Subsequent to the market opening, the arcade was used as the home of the Glossop Dale Savings Bank. Another new function was for some prison cells; although the magistrates‚Äô court, and most of the offenders, were now in Howard Town, the cells were still over in Old Glossop, and in 1841 Hadfield submitted plans for a cell block, but they were not completed until 1847. In 1853, 20 years after Stalybridge, Glossop got its own paid police force, volunteer constables having been keeping law and order up to that point. White's Directory in 1857 recorded a superintendent and four assistant constables based in the Town Hall. The cells were underground on the west side, but were soon closed after a county police station was built on Ellison Street. In 1875, ready for the creation of a Rifle Volunteer Corps in the town, one half of the market hall was turned into a drill hall by Lord Howard for a nominal rental. The 23rd Glossop RVC was attached to the 6th Battalion, Cheshire Regiment even though it was in the adjacent county of Derbyshire;Ian F.W. Beckett, Riflemen Form: A Study of the Rifle Volunteer Movement 1859‚Äì1908, Aldershot: Ogilby Trusts, 1982, . volunteers attended the Town Hall on 10 January 1865 to enroll. Bronze plaque on Glossop Town Hall marking its purchase and donation in 1919 In 1896, the Borough of Glossop acquired the leases, having rejected as \\"too expensive\\" Lord Howard's offer to sell the buildings outright for ¬£10,000 (). The following year, as part of a package of improvements, the Borough replaced Hadfield's Italianate clock tower with a much larger structure complete with Baroque cupola and weather vane, which has since become a key town landmark. The successful local industrialists Isaac and Harriet Jackson, who started as saddlers in Victoria Street, bought the Town Hall and market rights from Lord Howard in 1919 and presented them to the people of Glossop in honour of the fallen of the town in the Great War, with a bronze memorial plaque. This gave the Council the chance to bring its various offices and meeting rooms into one place, and it built and opened the Municipal Buildings at the south end of the Market Hall in 1923. This included a new purpose-built council chamber, formally marking the end of aristocratic dominance of the town and its affairs. The Howards sold all of their Glossop property and left, two years later. Because the new Municipal Buildings had no suitable event facilities, the Council upgraded the Town Hall to make it a worthy venue for civic hospitality, adding flat-roofed, rendered extensions to either side of the smaller room at the rear, containing toilets, a kitchen and a Mayor's Parlour in which to entertain the Council's guests. In 1927, the jewellers and clock-makers Henry Fielding and Son paid for the clock tower, originally plain sandstone, to be ‚Äúgilded and redecorated‚Äù, although the white paint on the dome is much more recent. In 1974, Glossop became part of the Borough of High Peak, bringing to an end the Town Hall's role of hosting grand civic functions, as they moved to Buxton Pavilion Gardens. Social uses of the rooms continued, but alternative venues with more modern facilities now competed. Control of the magistrates' court also passed away from the local authority, and the rooms were unable to meet the requirements of the government Courts Service. The age of the fabric combined with lack of maintenance also began to take a visible toll, with water from the leaking gutters pouring down the walls of the stairwells and mouldy plaster falling away. Finally, in 2008, the court moved out after 165 years, and the building was closed. Subsequently, it was discovered that, as a result of earlier works to seal the leaking slates, the roof space was full of loose asbestos fibres, so it was impossible to gain access to the clock when it developed a fault, leaving the hands stuck at 12. The complex is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II listed building, having been designated on 4 December 1958. Grade II is the lowest of the three grades of listing, and is applied to \\"buildings that are nationally important and of special interest\\". The listing also includes the overall High Street West terrace of which the Town Hall is the centrepiece, and the iron railings and boundary piers to the market ground. ==Present use== Scaffolding around the clock during restoration works, 2019 The Municipal Buildings is used as office accommodation and a base for High Peak Borough Council, and the Market Hall still trades as a market three days a week. The Town Hall, which has been out of use since 2008 due to accessibility issues and limited use, has seen investment to conserve the building. A plan by the development trust Locality to turn Glossop Town Hall into arts venue was reported in 2013. The roof was replaced in 2012, and the clock was repaired and refurbished in 2019 by HPBC and Smith of Derby. A multi-million pound external refurbishment of the Town Hall and market hall was undertaken through 2019, by G F Tomlinson Group of Derby. A further ¬£2 million renovation was announced in August 2020 for the whole of the Town Hall, Market Hall and Municipal Buildings complex. It will create a business start-up space, with a focus on creative industries and multi-use event space accommodating food and drink and retail businesses. Additional sustainability features for energy and carbon reduction are included. ==References== Category:Glossop Category:Government buildings completed in 1838 Category:Grade II listed buildings in Derbyshire Category:Buildings and structures in Derbyshire Category:City and town halls in England ","title":"Glossop Town Hall"},{"id":"63771107","text":"Geplafuvirales is an order of viruses. ==Families== The following families are recognized: * Geminiviridae * Genomoviridae ==References== Category:Viruses ","title":"Geplafuvirales"},{"id":"63771124","text":"Phantasmo, Master of the World is a fictional superhero who appeared in Dell Comics' The Funnies from 1940 to 1942, during the Golden Age of Comic Books. He was Dell Comics' first original superhero feature, and was created by E.C. Stoner, the first known African-American comic book artist. The character, introduced in The Funnies issue #45 (July 1940) as \\"the world's greatest magician,\\" is an American adventurer named Phil Anson, who traveled to Tibet and learned the secrets of body and spirit from the High Lamas. Returning to America, he takes up residence in a posh hotel in New York City, where he enlists bellhop Whizzer McGee to be his partner. Anson can separate his mind from his body, and in spectral form he can accomplish almost anything ‚Äî fly through the air, turn invisible, grow to enormous size, and push with tremendous force. Phantasmo's only weakness is that while he's in ethereal form, his body is motionless and vulnerable to attack, so he relies on Whizzer to guard his physical form. The character was the cover star on The Funnies through issue #58 (Aug 1941), and made his last appearance in issue #63 (March 1942). It has been noted that, clad in nothing but golden shorts, boots and a transparent cape, Phantasmo often appears to be nearly naked during his adventures. ==History== The cover of The Funnies #45 (July 1940) heralds, \\"Introducing Phantasmo, Master of the World\\". Phantasmo is seen on the cover as a giant figure, barely dressed in shorts and a transparent cape, grasping a crumbling city building as a crowd of tiny onlookers flees from the area. A profile of Stoner in Alter Ego says, \\"His Phantasmo covers often showed the awesomely powered hero as a giant, perhaps owing something to Bernard Baily's contemporary Spectre covers at DC. The over-sized hero motif appeared on many of his covers throughout his career.\\" The scene, which does not appear in the comic itself, establishes the unparalleled might of the new hero. The comic's origin story skips over the main character's earthbound, mortal existence, and takes the reader directly to \\"the top of the world's highest mountain\\", where Phantasmo bids farewell to the High Lama who's been teaching him magical secrets for twenty-five years. \\"Thou hast learned all mastery of body and mind, Phantasmo,\\" the Lama says. \\"Wield thy power well!\\" Many of the era's superheroes, including Phantasmo, Captain Marvel and Green Lantern, were given explicitly magical origins like this, drawing on themes from pulp magazines. In fact, three other heroes introduced that year ‚Äî the Flame, Amazing-Man and the Green Lama ‚Äî also gained their powers from the apparently magical region of Tibet. Phantasmo flies under his own steam back to America, where he appears hovering above a New York City street. Aware that he's causing a scene, he turns invisible, takes a suit from a clothing store, and disguises himself as human. He checks into a fancy hotel as Phil Anson ‚Äî and when the bellhop brings him to his room, he gives the boy fifty dollars and asks if he can keep a secret. Separating his spirit from his body, the hero towers over the boy and explains, \\"I am Phantasmo, master of space. I can fly on the wings of thought! I can grow small or huge! I can put the Empire State Building on my shoulder and walk with it to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean! But I need your help, Whizzer, to keep my physical body safe when I am away from it ‚Äî understand?\\" Whizzer says that he does. Then they're abruptly interrupted by noises coming from a nearby room, where a professor is being held by a group of spies who are trying to steal his invention that can turn salt water into engine fuel. From then on, Whizzer stays close to his friend, who can use his extra-sensory vision to spot trouble anywhere in the world, and may have to leave his earthly form at any moment. In some cases, Anson collapses in full view of the public, leaving Whizzer to explain his sudden loss of consciousness to onlookers. For the next year and a half, Phantasmo and Whizzer faced a variety of different challenges. In one story, Phantasmo stops a gang of criminals who are planning to blow up a dam and flood New York City; in another, he might fight a forest fire, or stop a gang of pirates who are smuggling jewels. One critic complains that \\"his fantastic powers [were] all too often squandered on mundane crimes like cattle-rustling and counterfeiting, though in one story the Master of the World saved said world from a doomsday meteor in spectacular fashion.\\" Phantasmo was the sole cover feature on The Funnies from his first appearance in #45 (July 1940) until issue #56 (June 1941). He shared the cover of issue #57 with radio adventure hero Captain Midnight, who was featured in a new comic book adaptation. In issue #58, Phantasmo was pushed to the secondary feature, with his last story appearing in issue #63 (March 1942). Over the next two issues, the book was relaunched as a funny-animal comic called New Funnies. The first six Phantasmo stories were also reprinted in black-and-white in an issue of Dell's Large Feature Comic #18 (1941), a full-length comics series with each issue devoted to a single character. ==Costume== In the 2016 anthology Super Weird Heroes: Outrageous But Real!, editor Craig Yoe introduces a story featuring \\"the almost naked Phantasmo, with plenty of suggestive poses and phallic symbols galore!\\" In a 2018 newspaper article about the series' second volume, Yoe said, \\"The Super Weird Heroes weren‚Äôt afraid to show a little skin, even a lot! Or not even be shy about being totally naked like Phantasmo in the first volume of Super Weird Heroes. We were originally going to have Phantasmo on the cover of the first book, but decided he might not fly in Peoria. So weird- in-his-own-way Nature Boy was our main cover boy. But, Phantasmo was between the covers fighting criminal types in his birthday suit.\\" On the cover of issue #47, the coloring makes it appear as if Phantasmo isn't wearing his shorts as he destroys a warplane, and on issue #48, it appears as if Phantasmo's bare buttocks are on display as he swims effortlessly past a battleship. ==See also== * Another character named Phantasmo was seen in DC Comics' Young All-Stars in 1989, as part of a group called the Young Allies. ==References== Category:Golden Age superheroes Category:Dell Comics characters Category:Comics characters introduced in 1940 ","title":"Phantasmo"},{"id":"63771142","text":"Pleolipoviridae is a family of DNA viruses that infect archaea. ==Taxonomy== The following genera are recognized: *Alphapleolipovirus *Betapleolipovirus *Gammapleolipovirus ==References== Category:Viruses ","title":"Pleolipoviridae"},{"id":"63771196","text":"Varidnaviria is a realm of viruses that includes all DNA viruses that encode major capsid proteins that contain a vertical jelly roll fold. The major capsid proteins (MCP) form into pseudohexameric subunits of the viral capsid, which stores the viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and are perpendicular, or vertical, to the surface of the capsid. Apart from this, viruses in the realm also share many other characteristics, such as minor capsid proteins (mCP) with the vertical jelly roll fold, an ATPase that packages viral DNA into the capsid, and a DNA polymerase that replicates the viral genome. Varidnaviria was established in 2019 based on the shared characteristics of the viruses in the realm. There are two groups of viruses in Varidnaviria: viruses that have a double vertical jelly roll (DJR) folds in the MCP, assigned to the kingdom Bamfordvirae, and viruses that have a single vertical jelly roll (SJR) fold in the MCP, assigned to the kingdom Helvetiavirae. The DJR-MCP lineage is thought to be descended from the SJR-MCP lineage via a gene fusion event, and the SJR- MCP shows a close relation to nucleoplasmins, pointing to a possible origin of the realm's jelly roll fold MCP. Most identified eukaryotic DNA viruses belong to Varidnaviria. Marine viruses in the realm are highly abundant worldwide and are important in marine ecology. Many animal viruses in the realm are associated with disease, including adenoviruses, poxviruses, and the African swine fever virus. Poxviruses have been prominent in the history of medicine, especially smallpox, caused by Variola virus, which was the target of the first vaccine and which later became the first disease eradicated. The realm also notably includes giant viruses that are physically larger and contain a much larger number of genes than typical viruses. ==Etymology== The name \\"Varidnaviria\\" is a portmanteau of various DNA viruses and the suffix -viria, which is the suffix used for virus realms. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses in the realm are often called non-tailed or tailless dsDNA viruses to distinguish them from the tailed dsDNA viruses of Duplodnaviria. ==Characteristics== A pseudohexameric trimer of DJR-MCPs formed into a hexagonal shape. Jelly roll folds of each MCP are colored in red and blue, and the loops and helices of each MCP are colored differently to distinguish the three MCPs. ===MCP, mCP, and ATPase=== Most viruses in Varidnaviria contain a capsid that is made of major capsid proteins that contain vertical single (SJR) or double jelly roll (DJR) folds. The major capsid proteins are named so because they are the primary proteins that the capsid is made of. A jelly roll fold is a type of folded structure in a protein in which eight antiparallel beta strands are organized into four antiparallel beta sheets in a layout resembling a jelly roll, also called a Swiss roll. Each beta strand is a specific sequence of amino acids, and these strands bond to their antiparallel strands via hydrogen bonds. The difference between SJR and DJR folds is that a DJR fold is simply two SJR folds in a single protein. Vertical folds are those that are perpendicular to the capsid surface, in contrast to horizontal folds that are parallel to the capsid surface. During the process of assembling the viral capsid, MCPs self-assemble into hexagonal structures, called hexons, containing multiple copies of the MCP. Hexons then bond to form the relatively flat triangular sides of the icosahedral capsid. All viruses in Varidnaviria that encode a DJR-MCP that have been analyzed in high resolution also encode a minor capsid protein (mCP) that contains an SJR fold. These mCPs assemble into pentagonal structures called pentons that form the pentagonal vertices of the icosahedral capsid. Most members of the realm also encode genome packaging ATPases of the FtsK-HerA superfamily. The ATPases in Varidnaviria are enzymes that package the viral DNA into the capsid during the process of assembling virions. FtsK is a family of proteins that contains a transmembrane protein with four membrane-spanning helices at the start of the protein's amino acid sequence and an ATPase with a P-loop fold at the end of the protein's amino acid sequence, and the HerA family is homologous to FtsK. The exact function of the ATPase for some viruses in Varidnaviria is unclear since morphological features, such as the circular, supercoiled genome of Pseudoalteromonas virus PM2, seemingly prohibit translocation by the ATPase of DNA from outside the capsid to the inside. The subset of the FtsK-HerA superfamily found in Varidnaviria is often called the A32 clade, named after the ATPase-encoding A32(R) gene of Vaccinia virus. ===Other characteristics=== Apart from the core morphogenetic triad of genes, the MCP, mCP, and ATPase, certain other characteristics are common or unique in various lineages within Varidnaviria, listed hereafter. * Many members of the realm encode a type B DNA polymerase, which copies the viral DNA, and often additional components of the DNA polymerase, such as superfamily 3 helicases, or replication initiation proteins, in the case of the family Corticoviridae. An exception is the family Sphaerolipoviridae, whose members do not encode any recognizable replication enzymes. * Many eukaryotic DJR-MCP viruses encode a capsid maturation protease that is involved in assembling the capsid. * Some members of the realm encode integrase, an enzyme that integrates the viral genome into the genome of the host. * Most members of the realm have capsids in the shape of an icosahedron, containing 20 triangular faces and 12 vertices. * In various lineages, including ascoviruses and poxviruses, the ancestral icosahedral shape of the capsid has been lost and replaced with other shapes, such as ovoids and brick- like shapes. * Poxviruses encode a scaffold protein, which guides the geometric construction of the viral capsid, that also folds into DJR pseudo- hexamers. * Some viruses have special vertices in their icosahedral capsids for transporting the genome out of the capsid and for making virus factories. * For certain viruses, the genome inside the capsid is surrounded by a lipid membrane. * Nearly all recognized DJR-MCP viruses encode an ATPase of the FtsK-HerA superfamily. Adenoviruses are the exception, instead encoding their own distinct ATPase that has the same role as the FtsK-HerA ATPase. * The family Finnlakeviridae and a provisional group called the Odin group, both proposed members of Varidnaviria, lack the signature FtsK-HerA superfamily ATPase. * All members of Varidnaviria except for Finnlakeviridae, a proposed member family, have dsDNA genomes. Viruses in Finnlakeviridae instead have single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes. ==Phylogenetics== It has been suggested that Varidnaviria predates the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of cellular life and that viruses in the realm were present in the LUCA. The vertical SJR-MCPs of Sphaerolipoviridae, assigned to the kingdom Helvetiavirae, unlike SJR folds found outside of Varidnaviria, show a relation to a group of proteins that includes the Cupin superfamily and nucleoplasmins, pointing to a possible origin of the major capsid protein of Varidnaviria among this group. The DJR-MCP lineage, assigned to the kingdom Bamfordvirae, thereafter appears to have come into existence by means of a gene fusion event that merged the two SJR-MCPs into one, indicated by the two SJR-MCPs forming a lattice in the capsid that structurally resembles the DJR-MCP capsid lattice. Viruses in Bamfordvirae appear to have made crossed from prokaryotes to eukaryotes early in eukaryotic history, via infection by a tectivirus or tectivirus-like virus of a bacterium that became a bacterial symbiont in a proto-eukaryote. From there, based on phylogenetic analysis of the viral DNA polymerase and other characteristics, eukaryotic viruses in Bamfordvirae appear to have formed a complex relationship with various selfish genetic elements, including polintons,The exact nature of polintons is uncertain. While they encode many viral genes, including the MCP and mCP, and appear to both be partially descended from and the ancestors of certain viruses, their other ancestors being transposons, they have not been observed to form virions. It is therefore unclear if they are viruses or if they are a type of transposon. Reflecting this uncertainty is that polintons are sometimes called polintoviruses. a type of transposon, portions of DNA that can self-replicate and integrate themselves into other parts of the same DNA molecule, and certain types of plasmids, which are extra-chromosomal DNA molecules that self-replicate inside of the cell or organelle that they occupy. The initial bacterial symbiont is likely to have become mitochondria, with mitochondrial linear plasmids descended from tectiviruses remaining. Another divergent lineage reached the nucleus and recombined with transposons, becoming polintons, which may have been the first eukaryotic viruses in Bamfordvirae or related to the first ones. Polintons then gave rise to multiple lineages by various mechanisms. Among these lineages are full-fledged viruses, including adenoviruses and giant viruses, cytoplasmic linear plasmids, virophages, which are satellite viruses of giant viruses, transpovirons, which are linear plasmid-like DNA molecules found in giant viruses, and bidnaviruses via genetic recombination with a parvovirus, both of which are classified in the realm Monodnaviria. While the jelly roll fold is found in other realms, including the family Microviridae in Monodnaviria and various single-stranded RNA viruses in Riboviria, the jelly roll fold found in Varidnaviria is vertical, i.e. perpendicular to the capsid surface, contrary to the jelly roll folds in other realms, which are horizontal, i.e. parallel to the capsid surface. In general, the other virus realms have no apparent relation based on common descent to Varidnaviria. ==Classification== Varidnaviria has two kingdoms: Bamfordvirae and Helvetiavirae, the latter of which is monotypic down to the rank of family. This taxonomy can be visualized as follows: * Kingdom: Bamfordvirae, which encode a major capsid protein that contains a vertical double jelly roll fold * Kingdom: Helvetiavirae, which encode a major capsid protein that contains a vertical single jelly roll fold ** Phylum: Dividoviricota *** Class: Laserviricetes **** Order: Halopanivirales ***** Family: Sphaerolipoviridae All recognized members of Varidnaviria belong to Group I: dsDNA viruses of the Baltimore classification system, which groups viruses together based on how they produce messenger RNA. The family Finnlakeviridae, a proposed family of Varidnaviria, belongs to Group II: ssDNA viruses and would be the only ssDNA virus in the realm. Most identified DNA viruses that infect eukaryotes belong to Varidnaviria, the other major lineages of eukaryotic DNA viruses being the order Herpesvirales, which infect animals, in Duplodnaviria, and the class Papovaviricetes, which infect animals, in Monodnaviria. Realms are the highest level of taxonomy used for viruses in and Varidnaviria is one of four, the other three being Duplodnaviria, Monodnaviria, and Riboviria. The unassigned family Portogloboviridae is a proposed family of the realm since its capsid proteins appear to be homologous to those of viruses in Varidnaviria. ==Interactions with hosts== ===Disease=== Bacteriophages in Varidnaviria, including the proposed family Autolykiviridae, are potentially a major cause of death among marine prokaryotes. This viewpoint is based on autolykiviruses having broad host ranges, infecting and killing many different strains of various bacteria species, in contrast to tailed bacteriophages, which have more limited host ranges, as well as on the apparently large number of marine non-tailed dsDNA viruses. Algal viruses of the family Phycodnaviridae play an important role in controlling algal blooms as well as, with many marine viruses in general, contributing to a process called viral shunt, whereby organic material from killed organisms are \\"shunted\\" by viruses away from higher trophic levels and recycled for consumption by those at lower trophic levels. The most notable disease-causing viruses in Varidnaviria are adenoviruses, poxviruses, and the African swine fever virus (ASFV). Adenoviruses typically cause mild respiratory, gastrointestinal, and conjunctival illnesses, but occasionally cause more severe illnesses, such as hemorrhagic cystitis, hepatitis, and meningoencephalitis. Poxviruses infect many animals and typically cause non- specific symptoms paired with a characteristic rash that is called a pox. Notable poxviruses include Variola virus, which causes smallpox, and Vaccinia virus, which is used as the vaccine against smallpox. ASFV is usually asymptomatic in its natural reservoirs but causes a lethal hemorrhagic fever in domestic pigs that is a concern for agricultural production. ===Endogenization=== Many viruses in Varidnaviria encode the enzyme integrase, allowing them to integrate their genome into their host and behave like transposons. The closely related polintons are apparently always endogenized in their hosts. This integration of viral DNA into the host's genome is a form of horizontal gene transfer between unrelated organisms, although polintons are typically transmitted vertically from parent to child. Adapative immunity A peculiar example of endogenization in Varidnaviria are virophages, satellite viruses that are dependent on giant virus infection to replicate. Virophages replicate by hijacking the replication apparati of giant viruses, thereby suppressing the number of giant virus virions produced, increasing the likelihood of host survival. Some virophages are able to become endogenized, and this endogenization can be considered a form of adaptive immunity for the host against giant virus infection. ==History== Diseases caused by poxviruses have been known for much of recorded history. Smallpox in particular has been highly prominent in modern medicine; the first vaccine to be invented targeted smallpox, and smallpox would later become the first disease to be eradicated. Human adenoviruses were the first DJR-MCP viruses in Varidnaviria to have their MCPs analyzed, standing out for having jelly roll folds that were perpendicular, rather than parallel, to the capsid surface. In 1999, the structure of the MCP of Pseudomonas virus PRD1 was resolved, showing that the DJR-MCP lineage included prokaryotic viruses. Haloarcula hispanica virus SH1 would later, in 2003, become the first SJR-MCP discovered. Over time, the use of metagenomics has allowed for the identification of viruses in the environment even without identification of the host or laboratory specimens, leading to the discovery of many additional members of the realm. Morphological surveys of marine samples suggest that non-tailed dsDNA viruses may be more numerous than the tailed dsDNA viruses of Duplodnaviria, which, as of 2019, are the largest and most diverse lineage of viruses documented. With the increased knowledge of the viruses of the realm, Varidnaviria was established in 2019 based on the shared traits of viruses in the realm. The establishment of Varidnaviria allows for newly discovered and related, yet divergent, viruses to be included. This includes proposed families such as Finnlakeviridae, which would be the only family in the realm with a single- stranded DNA genome, Autolykiviridae, which have a broad host range and which may play a major role in the deaths of marine bacteria, and the \\"Odin\\" group, which encode a protein that has no known relation to any other proteins in place of the FtsK-HerA superfamily ATPase. ==See also== * List of higher virus taxa ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Viruses ","title":"Varidnaviria"},{"id":"63771226","text":"McGinnis Peak is an elevation glaciated summit located at the head of McGinnis Glacier in the eastern Alaska Range, in Alaska, United States.Dictionary of Alaska Place Names, Donald J.

Positron emission tomography is a functional imaging technique that uses [18F]NaF radiotracer to visualise and quantify regional bone metabolism and blood flow. [18F]NaF has been used for imaging bones for the last 60 years. This article focuses on the pharmacokinetics of [18F]NaF in bones, and various semi-quantitative and quantitative methods for quantifying regional bone metabolism using [18F]NaF PET images. == Why [18F]NaF PET? == The measurement of regional bone metabolism is critical to understand the pathophysiology of metabolic bone diseases. * Bone biopsy is considered the gold standard to quantify bone turnover; however, it is invasive, complex and costly to perform and subject to significant measurement errors. * Measurements of serum or urine biomarkers of bone turnover are simple, cheap, quick, and non-invasive in measuring changes in bone metabolism, but only provide information on the global skeleton. * The functional imaging technique of dynamic [18F]NaF PET scans can quantify regional bone turnover at specific sites of clinical importance such as the lumbar spine and hip and has been validated by comparison with the gold standard of bone biopsy. ==Pharmacokinetics of [18F]NaF== The chemically stable anion of Fluorine-18-Fluoride is a bone-seeking radiotracer in skeletal imaging. [18F]NaF has an affinity to deposit at areas where the bone is newly mineralizing. Many studies have [18F]NaF PET to measure bone metabolism at the hip, lumbar spine, and humerus. [18F]NaF is taken-up in an exponential manner representing the equilibration of tracer with the extracellular and cellular fluid spaces with a half-life of 0.4 hours, and with kidneys with a half-life of 2.4 hours. The single passage extraction of [18F]NaF in bone is 100%. After an hour, only 10% of the injected activity remains in the blood. 18F- ions are considered to occupy extracellular fluid spaces because, firstly, they equilibrate with transcellular fluid spaces and secondly, they are not entirely extracellular ions. Fluoride undergoes equilibrium with hydrogen fluoride, which has a high permeability allowing fluoride to cross the plasma blood membrane. The fluoride circulation in red blood cells accounts for 30%. However, it is freely available to the bone surface for uptake because the equilibrium between erythrocytes and plasma is much faster than the capillary transit time. This is supported by studies reporting 100% single-passage extraction of whole-blood 18F- ion by bone and the rapid release of 18F- ions from erythrocytes with a rate constant of 0.3 per second. [18F]NaF is also taken-up by immature erythrocytes in the bone marrow, which plays a role in fluoride kinetics. The plasma protein binding of [18F]NaF is negligible. [18F]NaF renal clearance is affected by diet and pH level, due to its re- absorption in the nephron, which is mediated by hydrogen fluoride. However, large differences in urine flow rate are avoided for controlled experiments by keeping patents well hydrated. The exchangeable pool and the size of the metabolically active surfaces in bones determines the amount of tracer accumulated or exchanged with bone extracellular fluid, chemisorption onto hydroxyapatite crystals to form fluorapatite, as shown in Equation-1: Ca_{10}(PO_4)_6(OH)_2 + 2F- => Ca_{10}(PO_4)_6F_2 + 2.OH- Equation-1 Fluoride ions from the crystalline matrix of bone are released when the bone is remodelled, thus providing a measure of the rate of bone metabolism. == Measuring SUV == === Definition === The two image in the top row (the image on the left hand side is plotted on log scale and on the right hand side is plotted on linear scale) show the output of the spectral analysis showing its frequencies components grouped around three clusters, referred to as high, intermediate and low frequencies, supporting the assumption of three compartments in the Hawkins model corresponding to plasma, bone ECF and bone mineral compartment respectively. The image at the bottom row shows the IRF plotted using the frequency components obtained previously.The standardized uptake value (SUV) is defined as tissue concentration (KBq/ml) divided by activity injected normalized for body weight. === Appropriateness === The SUV measured from the large ROI smooths out the noise and, therefore, more appropriate in [18F]NaF bone studies as the radiotracer is fairly uniformly taken up throughout the bone. The measurement of SUV is easy, cheap, and quicker to perform, making it more attractive for clinical use. It has been used in diagnosing and assessing the efficacy of therapy. SUV can be measured at a single site, or the whole skeleton using a series of static scans and restricted by the small field-of-view of the PET scanner. === Known Issues === The SUV has emerged as a clinically useful, albeit controversial, semi- quantitative tool in PET analysis. Standardizing imaging protocols and measuring the SUV at the same time post-injection of the radiotracer, is necessary to obtain a correct SUV because imaging before the uptake plateau introduces unpredictable errors of up to 50% with SUVs. Noise, image resolution, and reconstruction do affect the accuracy of SUVs, but correction with phantom can minimize these differences when comparing SUVs for multi- centre clinical trials. SUV may lack sensitivity in measuring response to treatment as it is a simple measure of tracer uptake in bone, which is affected by the tracer uptake in other competing tissues and organs in addition to the target ROI. == Measuring Ki== The quantification of dynamic PET studies to measure Ki requires the measurement of the skeletal time- activity curves (TAC) from the region of interest (ROI) and the arterial input function (AIF), which can be measured in various different ways. However, the most common is to correct the image-based blood time-activity curves using several venous blood samples taken at discrete time points while the patient is scanned. The calculation of rate constants or Ki requires three steps: * Measurement of the arterial input function (AIF), which acts as the first input to the mathematical model of tracer distribution. * Measurement of the time-activity curve (TAC) within the skeletal region of interest, which acts as the second input to the mathematical model of tracer distribution. * Kinetic modelling of AIF and TAC using mathematical modelling to obtain net plasma clearance (Ki) to the bone mineral. alt= === Spectral method === The method was first described by Cunningham & Jones in 1993 for the analysis of dynamic PET data obtained in the brain. It assumes that the tissue impulse response function (IRF) can be described as a combination of many exponentials. Since A tissue TAC can be expressed as a convolution of measured arterial input function with IRF, Cbone(t) can be expressed as: C_{bone}(t) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\alpha_i . \\\\bigl ( C_{plasma}(t) \\\\otimes exp(-\\\\beta_i . t) \\\\bigr) where, \\\\otimes is a convolution operator, Cbone(t) is the bone tissue activity concentration of tracer (in units: MBq/ml) over a period of time t, Cplasma(t) is the plasma concentration of tracer (in units: MBq/ml) over a period of time t, IRF(t) is equal to the sum of exponentials, Œ≤ values are fixed between 0.0001 sec‚àí1 and 0.1 sec‚àí1 in intervals of 0.0001, n is the number of Œ± components that resulted from the analysis and Œ≤1, Œ≤2,‚Ä¶, Œ≤n corresponds to the respective Œ±1, Œ±2,‚Ä¶, Œ±n components from the resulted spectrum. The values of Œ± are then estimated from the analysis by fitting multi-exponential to the IRF. The intercept of the linear fit to the slow component of this exponential curve is considered the plasma clearance (Ki) to the bone mineral. === Deconvolution method === The method was first described by Williams et al. in the clinical context. The method was used by numerous other studies. This is perhaps the simplest of all the mathematical methods for the calculation of Ki but the one most sensitive to noise present in the data. A tissue TAC is modelled as a convolution of measured arterial input function with IRF, the estimates for IRF are obtained iteratively to minimise the differences between the left- and right-hand side of the following Equation: C_{bone}(t) = C_{plasma}(t) \\\\otimes IRF(t) where, \\\\otimes is a convolution operator, Cbone(t) is the bone tissue activity concentration of tracer (in units: MBq/ml) over a period of time t, Cplasma(t) is the plasma concentration of tracer (in units: MBq/ml) over a period of time t, and IRF(t) is the impulse response of the system (i.e., a tissue in this case). The Ki is obtained from the IRF in a similar fashion to that obtained for the spectral analysis, as shown in the figure. === Hawkins model === alt=The measurement of Ki from dynamic PET scans require tracer kinetic modelling to obtain the model parameters describing the biological processes in bone, as described by Hawkins et al. Since this model has two tissue compartments, it is sometimes called a two-tissue compartmental model. Various different versions of this model exist; however, the most fundamental approach is considered here with two tissue compartments and four tracer-exchange parameters. The whole kinetic modelling process using Hawkins model can be summed up in a single image as seen on the right-hand-side. The following differential equations are solved to obtain the rate constants: {\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\! C_{e}(t) \\\\over\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\! t } = K_1* C_p(t) - (k_2+k_3)*C_e(t) + k_4*C_b(t) {\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\! C_{b}(t) \\\\over\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\! t } = k_3*C_e(t) - k_4*C_b(t) The rate constant K1 (in units: ml/min/ml) describes the unidirectional clearance of fluoride from plasma to the whole of the bone tissue, k2 (in units: min‚àí1) describes the reverse transport of fluoride from the ECF compartment to plasma, k3 and k4 (in units min‚àí1) describe the forward and backward transportation of fluoride from the bone mineral compartment. Ki represents the net plasma clearance to bone mineral only. Ki is a function of both K1, reflecting bone blood flow, and the fraction of the tracer that undergoes specific binding to the bone mineral k3 / (k2 \\\\+ k3). Therefore, K_i = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{K_1 * k_3}{k_2 + k_3} \\\\right ) Hawkins et al. found that the inclusion of an additional parameter called fractional blood volume (BV), representing the vascular tissue spaces within the ROI, improved the data fitting problem, although this improvement was not statistically significant. === Patlak method === Patlak method is based on the assumption that the backflow of tracer from bone mineral to bone ECF is zero (i.e., k4=0). The calculation of Ki using Patlak method is simpler than using non-linear regression (NLR) fitting the arterial input function and the tissue time- activity curve data to the Hawkins model. It is crucial to note that Patlak method can only measure bone plasma clearance (Ki), and cannot measure the individual kinetic parameters, K1, k2, k3, or k4. The concentration of tracer in tissue region-of-interest can be represented as a sum of concentration in bone ECF and the bone mineral. It can be mathematically represented as \\\\frac{C_{bone}(T)}{C_{plasma}(T)} = K_i * \\\\frac{\\\\int\\\\limits_{0}^{T} C_{plasma}(t) dt}{C_{plasma}(T)} + V_o where, within the tissue region-of- interest from the PET image, Cbone(T) is the bone tissue activity concentration of tracer (in units: MBq/ml) at any time T, Cplasma(T) is the plasma concentration of tracer (in units: MBq/ml) at time T, Vo is the fraction of the ROI occupied by the ECF compartment, and \\\\int\\\\limits_{0}^{T} C_{plasma}(t) dt is the area under the plasma curve is the net tracer delivery to the tissue region of interest (in units: MBq.Sec/ml) over time T. The Patlak equation is a linear equation of the form Y = m*X + c Patlak analysis where a linear regression is fitted between the data on y- and x-axis to obtain the estimates of the Ki, which is the slope of the fitted regression line. Therefore, linear regression is fitted to the data plotted on Y- and X-axis between 4‚Äì60 minutes to obtain m and c values, where m is the slope of the regression line representing Ki and c is the Y-intercept of the regression line representing Vo. === Siddique-Blake method === The calculation of Ki using arterial input function, time-activity curve, and Hawkins model was limited to a small skeletal region covered by the narrow field-of-view of the PET scanner while acquiring a dynamic scan. However, Siddique et al. showed in 2012 that it is possible to measure Ki values in bones using static [18F]NaF PET scans. Blake et al. later showed in 2019 that the Ki obtained using the Siddique-Blake method has precision errors of less than 10%. The Siddique- Blake approach is based on the combination of the Patlak method, the semi- population based arterial input function, and the information that Vo does not significantly change post-treatment. This method uses the information that a linear regression line can be plotted using the data from a minimum of two time-points, to obtain m and c as explained in the Patlak method. However, if Vo is known or fixed, only one single static PET image is required to obtain the second time-point to measure m, representing the Ki value. This method should be applied with great caution to other clinical areas where these assumptions may not hold true. == SUV vs Ki== The most fundamental difference between SUV and Ki values is that SUV is a simple measure of uptake, which is normalized to body weight and injected activity. The SUV does not take into consideration the tracer delivery to the local region of interest from where the measurements are obtained, therefore, affected by the physiological process consuming [18F]NaF elsewhere in the body. On the other hand, Ki measures the plasma clearance to bone mineral, taking into account the tracer uptake elsewhere in the body affecting the delivery of tracer to the region of interest from where the measurements are obtained. The difference in the measurement of Ki and SUV in bone tissue using [18F]NaF are explained in more detail by Blake et al. It is critical to note that most of the methods for calculating Ki require dynamic PET scanning over an hour, except, the Siddique-Blake methods. Dynamic scanning is complicated and costly. However, the calculation of SUV requires a single static PET scan performed approximately 45‚Äì60 minutes post-tracer injection at any region imaged within the skeleton. Many researchers have shown a high correlation between SUV and Ki values at various skeletal sites. However, SUV and Ki methods can contradict for measuring response to treatment. Since SUV has not been validated against the histomorphometry, its usefulness in bone studies measuring response to treatment and disease progression is uncertain. == See also == *Bone *Positron Emission tomography *Time-activity curve *Arterial input function *Medical Imaging *Radiology *Molecular Imaging *Medical Imaging *Bone scintigraphy ==References== * Category:American inventions Category:Antimatter Category:Neuroimaging Category:Radiation therapy Category:3D nuclear medical imaging Category:Medical physics Category:Medicinal radiochemistry Positron emission tomography Category:Armenian inventions ","title":"PET for bone imaging"},{"id":"63771264","text":"Nucleocytoviricota is a phylum of viruses. Members of the phylum are also known as the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV), which serves as the basis of the name of the phlyum with the suffix -viricota for virus phylum. These viruses are referred to as nucleocytoplasmic because they are often able to replicate in both the host's cell nucleus and cytoplasm. The phylum is notable for containing the giant viruses. There are nine families of NCLDVs that all share certain genomic and structural characteristics; however, it is uncertain whether the similarities of the different families of this group have a common viral ancestor. One feature of this group is a large genome and the presence of many genes involved in DNA repair, DNA replication, transcription, and translation. Typically, viruses with smaller genomes do not contain genes for these processes. Most of the viruses in this family also replicate in both the host's nucleus and cytoplasm, thus the name nucleocytoplasmic. There are 47 NCLDV core genes currently recognised. These include four key proteins involved in DNA replication and repair: the enzymes DNA polymerase family B, the topoisomerase II A, the FLAP endonuclease and the processing factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Other proteins include DNA dependent RNA polymerase II and transcription factor II B. ==Taxonomy== The following classes are recognized, under which are orders that contain families mentioned in this article: * Megaviricetes ** Pimascovirales *** Ascoviridae *** Iridoviridae *** Marseilleviridae *** (Pithoviridae?) - by etymology of Pimascovirales *** (Mininucleoviridae?) - by phylogeny ** Imitervirales *** Mimiviridae ** Algavirales *** Phycodnaviridae *** (Pandoraviridae?) - by phylogeny * Pokkesviricetes ** Asfuvirales *** Asfarviridae ** Chitovirales *** Poxviridae The unrecognized families are parenthesized and placed in the most likely location. == Examples == ===Ascoviridae=== Members of the family Ascoviridae come in different shapes. Some can be rod-shaped, while others are oval. They measure up to 130 nm wide and 400 nm long. Theses viruses have circular double stranded DNA that have a length of about 100‚Äì200 kilobase pairs. They infect lepidopteran insect larvae and can infect through parasitoid wasps. Once they infect they replicate and cause death in insect pest. This allows them to control insect populations. Ascoviridae can have up to 180 genes in its genome. The replication of this virus takes place in the nucleus of the host cell. When it replicates, it causes the nucleus to increase in size and eventually burst. After, the virion starts to form and spread. ===Asfarviridae=== A member of the family Asfarviridae is a known as an asfarvirus. This virus is the cause of African swine fever. Some of the symptoms for this flu include fever, high pulse, fast breathing, and it can cause death. These symptoms can be similar to those from hog cholera, the difference is that the African swine flu can not be cured. There is no vaccine developed to fight this virus. ===Iridoviridae=== The Iridoviridae have linear double stranded DNA genomes up to 220 kilobases long and can code for about 211 proteins. The capsid of this virion is icosahedral shaped and can be up to 350 nm wide. The replication cycle of this virus begins in the nucleus of the host and end in the cytoplasm. Some viruses of this family are often found infecting amphibians while other are found in insect and crustaceans. ===Marseilleviridae=== The Marseilleviridae viruses have double stranded DNA genomes that are about 372 kilobases long. Members of the family can have about 457 open reading frames (ORFs) in its genome. The host organisms are amoebae. Once it infects, viral replication takes place in the cytoplasm. It was found that the genome of the family Marseilleviridae codes for about 28 different proteins. The capsid of the marseillevirus is about 250 nm wide with a geometry shape of an icosahedral. The replication of this virus usually occurs near the nucleus once it infects the amoeba. Once the virus infects it can cause a shape change in the host‚Äôs nucleus. ===Mimiviridae=== The Megaviridae contains some of the largest viruses ever discovered. They have linear double stranded DNA genomes with the length of 1,259,197 base pairs, which is larger than some small bacteria. Within in this genome 1,100 proteins are coded. 74.76% of the base pairs are represented by thymine and adenine. The Megaviridae virus can be found infecting acanthamoeba or other protozoan clades. Once the virus infects the host, the replication cycle takes place in the cytoplasm. Within the genome, DNA repair enzymes can be found. These are used when the DNA is harmed such as when it is exposed to ionizing radiation or UV light. Traditionally these viruses have been grouped into a family Mimiviridae. Later it appeared that the viruses of the Organic Lake Phycodna Group (OLPG) are more related to Mimiviruses than to Phycodnaviruses. For this reason it has been proposed adding them to legacy Mimiviridae as new subfamily Mesomimivirinae in order to form the more comprehensive family Megaviridae. However, the term Mimiviridae nowadays is used sensu lato synonymous with Megaviridae., UCPMS ID: 1889607, PDF Figure 3Blog of Carolina Reyes, Kenneth Stedman: Are Phaeocystis globosa viruses (OLPG) and Organic Lake phycodnavirus a part of the Phycodnaviridae or Mimiviridae?, on ResearchGate, Jan. 8, 2016 Figure 6 ===Pandoraviridae=== Pandoraviridae Discovered in 2013 from a coastal water sample in Chile. It is mostly found infecting amoebae. It has a length of 1 micrometer long and .5 micrometer wide. Its genome can be up to 2.5 million base pairs long. The replication of this virus take place in the cytoplasm. Like other giant viruses, it affect the host‚Äôs nucleus and can take up to 15 hours to start infecting. Although it is found in water, it does not affect humans, it may actually help us by increasing the production of oxygen in aquatic environments. ===Phycodnaviridae=== The Phycodnaviridae are icosahedral in shape with a double-stranded DNA molecule. Some members of this family can have a linear double stranded DNA while others have a circular double stranded DNA. The genome has been found to be up to 560 kilobases in length. Up to 50% of the DNA can be represented by guanine or cytosine. This virus is known to infect algae, which means it is found in the ocean. ===Pithoviridae=== The Pithoviridae have only two known representatives. These viruses infects amoebas and can survive in low temperatures. For years this virus was believed to be frozen, but due to climate change it has begun to show up again. This is a double stranded DNA virus with its size being 610 kilobases long. The genome is estimated to code for 476 open reading frames. The viron is rod shaped with a length of 1,100 nm long and 500 nm in diameter. ===Poxviridae=== The Poxviridae have a linear double-stranded DNA molecule that can have a length of up to 230 kilobases. The replication of these viruses takes place in the cytoplasm. Smallpox, cowpox, and other pox viruses belong to this family. ===Mininucleoviridae=== A new family has been proposed - Mininucleoviridae - for a family of large viruses that replicate in crustacea. Members of this proposed family include Carcinus maenas virus 1, Dikerogammarus haemobaphes virus 1 and Panulirus argus virus 1. ===Unclassified taxa=== * Cedratvirus - now under Pithoviridae * Choanovirus - part of extended Mimiviridae, a clade distinct from Mimiviridae proper * Dinodnavirus - possibly under Asfarviridae * Faustovirus - now under Asfarviridae * Kaumoebavirus - clusters under Asfarviridae * Klothovirus casanovai, Megaklothovirus horridgei - no sequences available * Medusavirus - proposed to be its own family, close to Mollivirus * Meelsvirus - no sequences available * Mollivirus - close to Pandoravirus * Namao virus * Orpheovirus - likely under Pithoviridae; sister group to Cedratvirus * Pacmanvirus - likely under Asfarviridae * Platanovirus - similar to Megavirus * Tupanvirus - possibly under Mimiviridae ==Phylogenetics== The general consensus is that Iridoviridae-Ascoviridae are closely related sister taxa in a clade. Pithovirus, Iridoviridae-Ascoviridae and Marseillevirus form a PIM or MAPI clade (Pimascovirales) in trees built from conserved proteins. The sister clade to PIM/MAPI is a clade made out of Algavirales (Phycodnaviridae, Pandoraviridae), and possibly Imitervirales/Mimiviridae (\\"P2\\" thereafter).PDF Poxviridae is consistently treated as a basal branch. Asfarviridae is either a sister group to Poxviridae (building together Pokkesviricetes) or a member of the P2 clade. The ICTV classification, as of 2019, matches the general shape of the tree. The origin of the NCLDVs may predate that of their eukaryotic hosts, judging from their RNA polymerase structures. ==See also== * Viral eukaryogenesis ==References== ==External links== * Category:Nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses Category:Viruses ","title":"Nucleocytoviricota"},{"id":"63771276","text":"Burton \\"Bud\\" David Rose (November 19, 1942 ‚Äì April 24, 2020) was an American nephrologist and the creator of the UpToDate medical software application.

Her works are held in the Hocken Collections. == Biography == Geisow was born in Queenstown in 1876, the third daughter of Franz William Frederick Geisow, an emigrant from Frankfurt-on-Main, and Mary Fraser, daughter of Robert Fraser, of Melbourne. Fraser and Geisow were married in 1871 in Invercargill by the Reverend A.H. Stobo. Geisow's mother was born in Alloa, Scotland, and emigrated with her family to Victoria, Australia. She died of cancer in Queenstown in 1907, aged 69. Geisow's father was an insurance agent, the town clerk, and a Justice of the Peace by the time he died in 1904, and was well-known in Queenstown. After his death, his three daughters took over the insurance agency, but by 1913 only Kitty Geisow is listed as the agent, and she remained as such until her death in 1958. From May 1928 until March 1950, Geisow owned a cottage on Park Street, Queenstown, opposite the Queenstown Gardens. Writer and poet Charles Brasch was believed to have stayed at the cottage with Geisow and her sister Gertie. When the land was subdivided in 1950, one lot was sold to Peter William Fels, a relative of Brasch. In his memoir, Brasch recalls Geisow and her sister: > Gertie and Kitty Geisow came from Queenstown for their Dunedin season; two > aged countrywomen as I saw them now, in whose slow quiet kindly voices, > patient and humorous, I heard half my own past, and knew again the rock and > tussock, the gums and pines and matagouri, the shining pebbles of the lake > shore and Queenstown's old limestone schist houses ‚Äî all Wakatipu almost > except the lake water.

He was one of the group's founding members along with Georges Henein and Ramses Younan. His nephew is the famed Egyptian cinematographer Tarek el-Telmissany. == Early life and education == Kamel el-Telmissany was born, in 1915, into a poor family in Al-Qalyubiya, north of Cairo. In 1925, his family moved to Cairo after he completed his primary school education. He lived in several places within Cairo such as Helwan, el-Saliba and Giza. He then entered the el-Saidia Secondary School and, in 1930, received his baccalaureate degree. However, while in school he became interested in the arts and began drawing under the instruction of professor Youssef el-Afifi, the school's drawing teacher. Drawing remained only a hobby while he was enrolled in The Faculty of Veterinary Medicine for five years, \\"during which he failed more than once.\\" He was unable to obtain his degree and eventually left in 1941 because of his interest in the arts. El-Telmissany was especially distracted by his love for art during his time in veterinary school. Gharieb explains that on the day of the year's final exam in veterinary medicine, he was visiting an art exhibition in Cairo. == Artistic and writing career == In Cairo, el-Telmissany met Georges Henein and Ramses Younan and, together, established the Art and Liberty group. His painting career is described as being short lived, spanning only ten years which corresponds to his time as a member of Art and Liberty. El-Telmissany's work \\"depended on the shock-value and expression of reality through surrealism.\\" However, when he realized surrealism would never be viable in Egypt and successful among the Egyptian public masses, el-Telmissany retreated and turned to filmmaking. While in school, el-Telmissany sold his artwork and wrote for newspapers and magazines in order to support his family. During his ten years with Art and Liberty, he wrote several articles for Al- Tatawwur (Evolution), the group's Arabic-language monthly journal, and for Don Quichotte, \\"a French-language artistic and literary review established by Henri and Raoul Curiel with several Art and Liberty members and affiliates including Georges Henein serving on its editorial board.\\" He also wrote a series of articles for Don Quichotte titled \\"LArt en √âgypte\\" in \\"which he showcased the work of a fellow Art and Liberty member.\\" == Filmmaking == After his break from surrealism, el-Telmissany turned to cinema in 1945 as a medium for spreading Marxist ideologies. He knew that his message through painting would never be able to reach the masses, especially since surrealism was unpopular with the Egyptian public and government. He embraced cinema because of its ability to reach an even greater number of people. He describes cinema as \\"the magic of the twentieth century\\" in Dear Charlie, his book dedicated to the genius of Charlie Chaplin. His brother, Hassan el-Telmissany (who was also an artist and a member of the Art and Liberty Group), was also involved with cinema, specifically documentary filmmaking, after abandoning \\"a professional career in painting.\\" Hassan explained that his brother's painting style was influenced by George Rouault, \\"a realist, a revolutionary and a socialist.\\" With a growing interest in revolutionary Marxism, communism, and overall leftist ideas, in 1945 el-Telmissany directed and released the \\"neo-realist,\\" \\"highly controversial and anti-capitalist 'Al-Souq Al-Sawda'\\" (The Black Market). As a critique of capitalism, the film depicted lower-class life in Egypt's most populated city: Cairo.

It consists of a single molecule of covalently closed circular single stranded DNA of 4.5-6 kilobases as well as a segment of linear ssDNA of ~1 kilobase. The linear segment is complementary to a portion of the closed circle creating a partially double stranded region. There are at least three major open reading frames in the genome. Similar to other eukaryotic ssDNA viruses, bacilladnaviruses are likely to replicate their genomes by the rolling-circle mechanism, initiated by the virus-encoded endonuclease (Rep). However, the latter protein of bacilladnaviruses displays unique conserved motifs and in phylogenetic trees forms a monophyletic clade separated from other groups of ssDNA viruses. The capsid protein of bacilladnaviruses has the jelly-roll fold and is most closely related to the corresponding proteins from members of the family Nodaviridae, which have ssRNA genomes.

Sound scenography (also known as acoustic scenography) is the process of staging spaces and environments through sound. It combines expertise from the fields of architecture, acoustics, communication, sound design and interaction design to convey artistic, historical, scientific, or commercial content or to establish atmospheres and moods. == Definition == Initially developed as a sub-discipline of scenography, it is now primarily used in the context of exhibitions, museums, media installations and trade fairs, as well as shops, adventure parks, spas, reception areas, and open-plan offices. Distinct from other applications in sound design, spatial localisation plays a central role in sound scenography. Sound in contexts such as film soundtracks has a synchronised and standardised listening experience. The sound experience should be the same for every visitor at every position (and in every cinema). Because exhibition spaces are freely traversable and show audio-visual content at various stations across the room, sound scenography aims at providing every visitor with an individual listening experience with distinct start and end points as well as a distinct progression. Thus, the dramaturgy of the sound experience is no longer determined by the timeline of the soundtrack, but by the position and movement of the visitor. == Methods of Sound Scenography == Spaces can be staged with sound in various ways. Rooms have different tonal properties and acoustics depending on their architecture and interior design. Live musicians can spread across the room or play in motion, which is especially common in spatial music. The reproduction of sounds via loudspeakers, offers a wide range of possibilities for integrating sound into spaces and is therefore the most commonly used method. In that context, sound scenography is influenced from various practices in the wider field of sound design and composition, such as generative music, sonic interaction design, and sound masking. Loudspeaker systems used to distribute sound range from standard spatial audio setups to the more customised distributions common in sound installation, such as the Acousmatic Room Orchestration System. The spatial integration of sound delivered via headphones is a defining feature of interactive soundwalks. Leveraging technologies such as geolocation and head tracking, sounds are used to augment real environments in what the BBC's R&D; department calls \\"Audio AR\\". In the more controlled environment of an exhibition, this approach has been used to create fully virtual sound environments. == Functions of Sound Scenography == Sound scenography performs many of the established functions of sound in film soundtracks. It gives emotional connotations to spaces, exhibits or even individual interactions through the use of sound. Soundscapes are used to establish atmospheres and moods with varying degrees of realism. Sound content is also used to evoke memories and associations. Soundscapes and musical accents clarify visual content or re-contextualise it. Content can also be conveyed purely sonically without accompanying visual media. Especially in connection with large-scale video projection, sound is used to direct the viewer's attention. In all these application areas, sound scenography relates the different sonic components of an exhibition to one another in order to create a coherent overall soundscape. == See also == *Spatial music *Exhibit design *Sound Art *Acoustical engineering == References == == Further reading == * Franinoviƒá, K. & Serafin, Stefania (2013) Sonic Interaction Design, Cambridge: Massachusetts Institute of Technology * Atelier Br√ºckner (2010) Scenography / Szenografie ‚Äì Making spaces talk / Narrative R√§ume, Stuttgart: avedition * Minard, Robin (1993) Sound Environments ‚Äì music for public spaces, Berlin: Akademie der K√ºnste * Kiefer, Peter (2010) Klangr√§ume der Kunst, Heidelberg: Kehrer Verlag * Cancellaro, Joseph (2006) Sound Design for Interactive Media, New York: Thomson Delmar Learning * Metzger, Christoph (2015) Architektur und Resonanz, Berlin: jovis Verlag GmbH * Plot #10 The Power of Sound, 2013 Category:Design Category:Sound production Category:Film sound production ","title":"Sound scenography"},{"id":"63771711","text":"Calder is a rural locality in the local government area of Waratah-Wynyard in the North West region of Tasmania.

They encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which is used to transcribe the viral RNA genome into messenger RNA (mRNA) and to replicate the genome. Viruses in the group share a number of characteristics involving evolution, including high rates of genetic mutations, recombinations, and reassortments. RNA viruses constitute the kingdom Orthornavirae in the realm Riboviria. They are descended from a common ancestor that may have been a non-viral molecule that encoded a reverse transcriptase instead of an RdRp for replication. The kingdom is subdivided into five phyla that separate member viruses based on their genome type, host range, and genetic similarity. Viruses with three genome types are included: positive-strand RNA viruses, negative-strand RNA viruses, and double-stranded RNA viruses. Many of the most widely known viral diseases are caused by RNA viruses, which includes coronaviruses, the Ebola virus, influenza viruses, the measles virus, and the rabies virus. The first virus to be discovered, tobacco mosaic virus, is an RNA virus. In modern history, RNA viruses have caused numerous disease outbreaks, and RNA plant viruses infect many economically important crops. Most eukaryotic viruses, including most human, animal, and plant viruses, are RNA viruses. In contrast, there are relatively few prokaryotic RNA viruses. ==Etymology== The first part of Orthornavirae, the kingdom that RNA viruses belong to, comes from Greek ·ΩÄœÅŒ∏œåœÇ [orth√≥s], meaning straight, the middle part, rna, refers to RNA, and -virae is the suffix used for virus kingdoms. ==Characteristics== ===Structure=== retroviruses RNA viruses typically do not encode that many proteins, but most positive-sense, single-stranded (+ssRNA) viruses and some double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses encode a major capsid protein that has a single jelly roll fold, so named because the folded structure of the protein contains a structure that resembles a jelly roll. Many RNA viruses also encode an envelope, a type of lipid membrane that typically surrounds the capsid. In particular, the viral envelope is near-universal among negative-sense, single-stranded (-ssRNA) viruses. ===Genome=== Viruses in Orthornavirae have three different types of genomes: dsRNA, +ssRNA, and -ssRNA. Single-stranded RNA viruses have either a positive or negative sense strand, and dsRNA viruses have both. This structure of the genome is important in terms of transcription to synthesize viral mRNA as well as replication of the genome, both of which are carried out by the viral enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), also called RNA replicase. ===Replication and transcription=== Positive-strand RNA viruses Positive-strand RNA viruses have genomes that can function as mRNA, so transcription is not necessary. However, +ssRNA will produce dsRNA forms as part of the process of replicating their genomes. From the dsRNA, additional positive strands are synthesized, which may be used as mRNA or for genomes for progeny. Because +ssRNA viruses create intermediate dsRNA forms, they have to avoid the host's immune system in order to replicate. +ssRNA viruses accomplish this by replicating in membrane-associated vesicles that are used as replication factories. For many +ssRNA viruses, subgenomic portions of the genome will be transcribed to translate specific proteins, whereas others will transcribe a polyprotein that is cleaved to produce separate proteins. Negative-strand RNA viruses Negative-strand RNA viruses have genomes that function as templates from which mRNA can be synthesized directly by RdRp. Replication is the same process but executed on the positive sense antigenome, during which RdRp ignores all transcription signals so that a complete -ssRNA genome can be synthesized. -ssRNA viruses vary between those that inititate transcription by the RdRp creating a cap on the 5'-end (usually pronounced \\"five prime end\\") of the genome or by snatching a cap from host mRNA and attaching it to the viral RNA. For many -ssRNA viruses, at the end of transcription, RdRp stutters on a uracil in the genome, synthesizing hundreds of adenines in a row as part of creating a polyadenylated tail for the mRNA. Some -ssRNA viruses are essentially ambisense, and have proteins encoded by both the positive and negative strand, so mRNA is synthesized directly from the genome and from a complementary strand. Double-stranded RNA viruses For dsRNA viruses, RdRp transcribes mRNA by using the negative strand as a template. Positive strands may also be used as templates to synthesize negative strands for the construction of genomic dsRNA. dsRNA is not a molecule produced by cells, so cellular life has evolved mechanisms to detect and inactive viral dsRNA. To counter this, dsRNA viruses typically retain their genomes inside of viral capsid in order to evade the host's immune system. ===Evolution=== RNA viruses experience a high rate of genetic mutations, higher than DNA viruses, because RdRp is prone to making errors in replication since it typically lacks proofreading mechanisms to repair errors.The exception is that some members of the order Nidovirales encode proofreading exoribonuclease activity as part of a protein that is distinct from RdRp. Mutations in RNA viruses are often influenced by host factors such as dsRNA-dependent adenosine deaminases, which edit viral genomes by changing adenosines to inosines. Mutations in genes that are essential for replication lead to a reduced number of progeny, so viral genomes typically contain sequences that are highly conserved over time with relatively few mutations. Many RNA viruses also experience a high rate of genetic recombination, though rates of recombination vary significantly, with lower rates in -ssRNA viruses and higher rates in dsRNA and +ssRNA viruses. There are two types of recombination: copy choice recombination and ressortment. Copy choice recombination occurs when the RdRp switches templates during synthesis without releasing the prior, newly created RNA strand, which generates a genome of mixed ancestry. Reassortment, which is restricted to viruses with segmented genomes, has segments from different genomes packaged into a single virion, or virus particle, which also produces hybrid progeny. For reassortment, some segmented viruses package their genomes into multiple virions, which produces genomes that are random mixtures of parents, whereas for those that are packaged into a single virion, typically individual segments are swapped. Both forms of recombination can only occur if more than one virus is present in a cell, and the more alleles are present, the more likely recombination is to occur. A key difference between copy choice recombination and reassortment is that copy choice recombination can occur anywhere in a genome, whereas reassortment swaps fully-replicated segments. Therefore, copy choice recombination can produce non-functional viral proteins whereas reassortment cannot. The mutation rate of a virus is associated with the rate of genetic recombinations. Higher mutation rates increase both the number of advantageous and disadvantageous mutations, whereas higher rates of recombination allows for beneficial mutations to be separated from deleterious ones. Therefore, higher rates of mutations and recombinations, up to a certain point, improve viruses' ability to adapt. Notable examples of this include reassortments that enable cross-species transmission of influenza viruses, which have led to numerous pandemics, as well as the emergence of drug-resistance influenza strains via mutations that were reassorted. ==Phylogenetics== Phylogenetic tree with phylum branches highlighted. Negarnaviricota (brown), Duplornaviricota (green), Kitrinoviricota (pink), Pisuviricota (blue), and Lenarviricota (yellow) The exact origin of RNA viruses is not well established, but their RdRp shows a relation to the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzymes of group II introns that encode RTs and retrotransposons, the latter of which are self-replicating DNA sequences that integrate themselves into other parts of the same DNA molecule. Within the kingdom, +ssRNA viruses are likely to be the oldest lineage of RNA viruses, dsRNA viruses appear to have emerged on multiple occasions from +ssRNA viruses, and -ssRNA viruses in turn appear to be related to reoviruses, which are dsRNA viruses. ==Classification== RNA viruses are assigned to the kingdom Orthornavirae, which contains five phyla and several taxa that are unassigned to a phylum due to lack of information. The five phyla are separated based on the genome types, host ranges, and genetic similarity of member viruses. *Phylum: Duplornaviricota, which contains dsRNA viruses that infect prokaryotes and eukaryotes, which do not cluster with members of Pisuviricota, and which encode a capsid composed of a 60 homo- or heterodimers of capsid proteins organized on a lattice with pseudo T = 2 symmetry *Phylum: Kitrinoviricota, which contains +ssRNA viruses that infect eukaryotes and which do not cluster with members of Pisuviricota *Phylum: Lenarviricota, which contains +ssRNA viruses that infect prokaryotes and eukaryotes and which do not cluster with members of Kitrinoviricota *Phylum: Negarnaviricota, which contains all -ssRNA viruses *Phylum: Pisuviricota, which contains +ssRNA and dsRNA viruses that infect eukaryotes and which do not cluster with other phyla The unassigned taxa are listed hereafter (-viridae denotes family and -virus denotes genus). * Birnaviridae * Permutotetraviridae * Botybirnavirus The kingdom contains three groups in the Baltimore classification system, which groups viruses together based on their manner of mRNA synthesis, and which is often used alongside standard virus taxonomy, which is based on evolutionary history. Those three groups are Group III: dsRNA viruses, Group IV: +ssRNA viruses, and Group V: -ssRNA viruses. ==Disease== RNA viruses are associated with a wide range of disease, including many of the most widely known viral diseases. Notable disease-causing viruses in Orthornaviriae include: * coronaviruses * Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus * Dengue virus * Ebolavirus * hantaviruses * Hepatitis A virus * Hepatitis C virus * Hepatitis E virus * Human orthopneumovirus * influenza viruses * Japanese encephalitis virus * Lassa mammarenavirus * Measles morbillivirus * Mumps orthorubulavirus * Norovirus * Poliovirus * Rabies lyssavirus * Rhinoviruses * Rift Valley fever phlebovirus * Rotavirus * Rubella virus * West Nile virus * Yellow fever virus * Zika virus Animal viruses in Orthornavirae include orbiviruses, which cause various diseases in ruminants and horses, including Bluetongue virus, African horse sickness virus, Equine encephalosis virus, and epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus. The vesicular stomatitis virus causes disease in cattle, horses, and pigs. Bats harbor many viruses including ebolaviruses and henipaviruses, which also can cause disease in humans. Similarly, arthropod viruses in the Flavivirus and Phlebovirus genera are numerous and often transmitted to humans. Coronaviruses and influenza viruses cause disease in various vertebrates, including bats, birds, and pigs. Plant viruses in the kingdom are numerous and infect many economically important crops. Tomato spotted wilt virus is estimated to cause more than 1 billion USD in damages annually, affecting more than 800 plant species including chrysanthemum, lettuce, peanut, pepper, and tomato. Cucumber mosaic virus infects more than 1,200 plant species and likewise causes significant crop losses. Potato virus Y causes significant reductions in yield and quality for pepper, potato, tobacco, and tomato, and Plum pox virus is the most important virus among stone fruit crops. Brome mosaic virus, while not causing significant economic losses, is found throughout much of the world and primarily infects grasses, including cereals. ==History== Diseases caused by RNA viruses have been known throughout much of history, but their caused was only discovered in modern times. As a whole, RNA viruses were discovered during a time period of major advancements in molecular biology, including the discovery of mRNA as the immediate carrier of genetic information for protein synthesis. Tobacco mosaic virus was discovered in 1898 and was the first virus to be discovered. RNA viruses that are transmitted by arthropods have been a key target in the development of vector control, which often aims to prevent viral infections. In modern history, numerous disease outbreaks have been caused by RNA viruses, including outbreaks caused by coronaviruses, ebola, and influenza. Orthornavirae was established in 2019 as a kingdom within the realm Riboviria, intended to accommodate all RdRp-encoding RNA viruses. Prior to 2019, Riboviria was established in 2018 and included only RdRp-encoding RNA viruses. In 2019, Riboviria was expanded to also include reverse transcribing viruses, placed under the kingdom Pararnavirae, so Orthornavirae was established to separate RdRp-encoding RNA viruses from reversing transcribing viruses. ==Notes== ==References== Category:RNA Category:RNA viruses Category:Viruses ","title":"Orthornavirae"},{"id":"63771728","text":"During the 1931‚Äì32 season Foot-Ball Club Juventus competed in Serie A and the Mitropa Cup. ==Summary== The club transferred new players in to the roster such as Enzo Rosa and Brazilian Pietro Sernagiotto (who had an agreement with Genova).

Described as an \\"anti-slut-shaming\\" podcast by the show's hosts, Guys We Fucked (GWF) deals with issues around sex-positivity and politics and features frank and open conversations with comedians, actors, musicians, sex workers, sexual health professionals and activists. GWF was touted as one of \\"22 Podcasts That You Should Be Subscribing To In 2016\\" by BuzzFeed News and one of the \\"15 Best Sex Podcasts\\" by Esquire in 2019. ==History== GWF podcast creators and hosts, Corinne Fisher and Krystyna Hutchinson, first met in New York City when Hutchinson became an intern at a talent management company where Fisher worked as a talent manager's assistant. Prior to moving to New York, Hutchinson lived in Pennsylvania and Fisher grew up in New Jersey. In 2010, Hutchinson landed an internship at Saturday Night Live and a writer for the show suggested that if Hutchinson wanted to eventually perform on SNL she should try stand-up comedy. Hutchinson invited Fisher to her first stand-up set; Fisher was already performing stand-up comedy at the time. Consequently, Fisher asked Hutchinson if she would be interested in working on a comedy act and later that year they launched a live comedy show called Sorry About Last Night, a name they would also adopt for their comedy duo. During the Sorry About Last Night shows, the hosts would invite an audience member onstage to tell a story about how someone did them wrong, with the requirement that the audience member had this other person's phone number. After telling the story, the hosts and guest would prank call that person. In 2013, Fisher had what she described to Mother Jones as a \\"nervous breakdown\\" after an unexpected breakup with a man she had hoped to marry. Fisher sought Hutchinson for solace and got the idea to have a show where she could interview her ex-boyfriends and lovers to find out where things went wrong, similar to John Cusack's character in the 2000 film High Fidelity. In December of that year the duo launched the GWF podcast. What started as a forum for Fisher and Hutchinson to interview their former sex partners later evolved into a show featuring a variety of guests, including sex columnist Dan Savage, The Daily Show co-creator Lizz Winstead, model and actress Amber Rose, former president of the American Civil Liberties Union Nadine Strossen, and pornographic actor Stoya. From 2014 to 2015 Fisher and Hutchinson also hosted a web series on YouTube called Girls On Girls, where they would recap and comment on episodes of the comedy-drama television series Girls. In 2016, the comedy duo embarked on Guys We Fucked: Live Experience an interactive comedy tour of several cities across both the United States and Canada. The GWF tour included two shows at the Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal and where they managed to sell the most tickets out of any other performer at the festival that year. Guests included fellow comedians Ms. Pat and Big Jay Oakerson. The GWF live show appeared at the JFL42 festival in Toronto in 2017. That same year also saw the release of Fisher and Hutchinson's first book, F*cked: Being Sexually Explorative and Self- Confident. In 2018, Fisher and Hutchinson hosted Guys We Fest, a live comedy charity benefit show held at the Brooklyn Studio. Guests of the show included comedians Michael Che, Harrison Greenbaum, Mehran Khaghani and Jessica Kirson. The show managed to raise $8,000 for the Reproductive Health Access Project and New Alternatives, a nonprofit that works with homeless youth in the LGBTQ+ community. ==Format== Each episode of the podcast starts with Hutchinson and Fisher discussing the events of the past week, followed by an interview with the week's guest. The show wraps up with Hutchinson and Fisher responding to listener emails, often giving advice in the realm of sex and relationships. GWF initially featured interviews with former and current sexual partners of Fisher and Hutchinson. The hosts' intent was to combat slut-shaming by engaging in open and frank dialogue about their own sex lives. As the popularity of their show increased their selection of guests expanded to include interviews with professionals in the world of sex and sexual health. The show has covered topics such as dirty talk, bad one-night stands, feminism, sexual health, racial discrimination, domestic violence, and rape. ==Bibliography== *F*cked: Being Sexually Explorative and Self-Confident (2017), ==References== ==External links== * Category:Comedy and humor podcasts Category:Audio podcasts Category:2013 podcast debuts Category:Stand-up comedy Category:Interview podcasts ","title":"Guys We Fucked"},{"id":"63771786","text":"Dhananjoy Roy was a Member of the 1st National Assembly of Pakistan as a representative of East Pakistan. ==Career== Roy was a Member of the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan.

Moutsopoulos () is a Greek periodontist and immunologist. She is a senior investigator in the oral immunity and infection section at the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. Moutsopoulos specializes in oral immunology and periodontitis. Her research program focuses on host- microbial interactions that can drive chronic inflammatory responses and tissue destruction in the oral cavity. == Education == Moutsopoulos received a DDS degree from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 1998. In 2003, she completed a certificate in periodontics at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry where she completed a PhD in immunology in 2006 in the department of diagnostic sciences and pathology. Her dissertation was titled Dissection of factors contributing to HIV susceptibility in mucosal associated lymphoid tissues. She completed graduate research in the laboratory of her doctoral advisor Sharon Wahl at the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR). She was a research fellow at NIDCR from 2006 to 2008. Her doctorate and post doctorate work focused on immune-mediated pathologies that present in the oral cavity including Sj√∂gren syndrome, periodontal disease and chronic wound healing. While these are distinct disease entities, they share as a salient feature non-resolving inflammation and immune mediated tissue destruction of which the mechanisms have been in the center of her research interest. Activation of chronic inflammatory pathways in various disease entities have been linked to genetic susceptibility of the host, though emerging evidence implicates microbial factors for the initiation of disease pathogenesis for the majority of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune pathologies. == Career and research == Moutsopoulos is a periodontist, trained in immunology. Moutsopoulos has worked as a clinical fellow at the NIH under the mentorship of Steven Holland from 2008 to 2010. In 2007, she became an adjunct clinical assistant professor in the department of periodontics at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry. Since 2010, she has been an independent investigator at NIDCR building a clinical and translational program focused on basic oral immunology and susceptibility to periodontitis through the study of patients with monogenic immune defects. She is a senior investigator in the oral immunity and infection section at NIDCR. Moutsopoulos's program focuses on host-microbial interactions that can drive chronic inflammatory responses and tissue destruction in the oral cavity. In her laboratory host-microbial interactions are interrogated through the use of in vitro culture systems and animal models, but her primary focus is on the study of immune-microbial interactions in humans. For this her laboratory is interrogating the oral microbiome and immune responses in the oral cavity in patient populations with oral inflammatory conditions. Moutosopoulos researches oral-barrier immunity. Her studies implement a bench to bedside approach and aim to understand the molecular and cellular basis of oral immunity in health, and in the common inflammatory disease of periodontitis. Understanding the mechanisms that microbial triggers and host elements use to regulate oral immunity in health and disease is the focus of her research program. == See also == *List of female scientists in the 21st century *Timeline of women in science in the United States *Women in dentistry in the United States == References == ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:National Institutes of Health people Category:21st- century Greek scientists Category:21st-century women scientists Category:Greek medical researchers Category:Women medical researchers Category:Greek women scientists Category:Periodontists Category:Women dentists Category:Greek dentists Category:21st-century Greek physicians Category:21st-century women physicians Category:Expatriate academics in the United States Category:Greek emigrants to the United States Category:Greek immunologists Category:Women immunologists Category:Aristotle University of Thessaloniki alumni Category:University of Maryland School of Dentistry alumni ","title":"Niki Moutsopoulos"},{"id":"63771902","text":"Hepelivirales is an order of viruses. ==Taxonomy== The following families are recognized: *Alphatetraviridae *Benyviridae *Hepeviridae *Matonaviridae ==References== Category:Viruses ","title":"Hepelivirales"},{"id":"63771915","text":"2020‚Äì21 Eerste Klasse is an upcoming Eerste Klasse season.

Doctor Nauk in Philological Sciences. ==Biography== Nikolaev graduated from the philological faculty of Tver State University and Moscow State University. Since 1986, he works at the Institute for Slavic and Balkan studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Since 1987, he has been the head of regular dialectological expeditions in the area of East Slavic subdialects. In 1992, he received a doctoral degree with a dissertation comprising the totality of his works, and now heads the group of Slavic glottogenesis. ==Contribution to linguistics== Sergei Nikolaev is a specialist in Slavic and Indo-European comparative historical linguistics. The scope of studies covers Slavic, Balto-Slavic and Indo-European historical accentology, comparative grammar of North Caucasian languages, hypothetical Sino-Caucasian macro-family of languages, hypothetical Amerindian macro- family. Nikolaev connects the linguogeography and historical dialectology of Slavic languages with the problems of . In East Slavic dialectology, he established a number of the oldest (Late Proto-Slavic) dialect isoglosses. Reconstruction of the placement of these isoglossae on the territory of the oldest Slavic settlement showed their connection with the archaeological areas of large Proto-Slavic tribal associations. As a result of the field studies of the East Slavic dialects, the Institute has collected an East Slavic phonetic library and an archive of dialect recordings. Experimental research of phonetics and prosody of East Slavic dialect systems on a computer allowed Nikolaev to discover a number of new and poorly studied phenomena in modern East Slavic dialects. Nikolaev published and prepared for printing more than 80 works with a total volume of more than 240 author's sheets. He is the author of the etymological dictionary of North Caucasian languages (together with Sergei Starostin, 70 author's sheets), one of the authors of the series \\"Fundamentals of Slavic accentology\\", a participant in the international Internet projects \\"Evolution of language\\" and \\"tower of Babel\\" (etymological databases; he created a comparative database on Indo-European languages, which is based on the project of a new Indo-European dictionary, databases on Finno- Ugric and Amerindian languages). For more than 20 years, Nikolaev has been the leader and organizer of complex linguistic expeditions to the East Slavic dialects (the Carpathians, the Russian Northwest, Belarus, Polesie) and to the archaic Old Shtokavian dialects of the Serbo-Croatian language (Slavonia, together with Croatian colleagues), author of special field programs on East Slavic historical dialectology. He made presentations at four International Congresses of Slavists, a number of International and Russian conferences, for 10 years taught a course and led a seminar on ‚ÄúHistorical Linguogeography of East Slavic Languages‚Äù at the Faculty of Philology of Moscow State University. Nikolaev was nominated three times as a Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences (in 2003 and 2016 ‚Äî by the Institute of Slavonic studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, in 2006 ‚Äî personally by Vladimir Dybo).

The fog woodlands lie on mountainsides which slope southeastwards towards the Arabian Sea. The mountains intercept moisture-bearing winds from the Arabian Sea, creating orographic precipitation and frequent fogs that sustain unique woodlands and shrublands in a desert region. ==Geography== The ecoregion occupies an area of 19,913 km¬≤ (7,688 sq mi) in eastern Yemen and southern Oman's Dhofar Governorate. The ecoregion covers four separate areas. The westernmost is the Ureys (or Areys) range, a coastal mountain range that rises east of the town of Shuqrah, 150 km northeast of Aden. The range is made up of dark igneous rock, extending about 65 km east and west parallel to the coast. It is named for its tallest peak, Jabal Ureys (1735 m), which lies at the western end of the range close to the coast. The rest of the range is an east‚Äìwest ridge 1500 to 1600 meters high, dropping to a dissected plateau 1200‚Äì1350 meters elevation and 2‚Äì3 km wide on the seaward (southern) side.

It acts as the conveyancing stage as the second of three stages required in order to voluntarily transfer ownership of land in Scotland. The three stages are: # The Contractual Stage (The Missives of Sale) # The Conveyancing Stage #The Registration Stage In the conveyancing stage of the transfer of ownership of land, a formal document called a disposition, is created and subscribed by the Disponer (the person granting the disposition or 'the Seller') and the Disponee (the person receiving the disposition or 'the Buyer'). Example dispositions are available to view on the Property Standardisation Group website. == Principles of transfer: why dispositions are required in Scots Law == === An absolute singular (unititular) right of ownership === Scots law follows the Roman law principle that the right of ownership in _property_ (for definition of term see above) is absolute. Other legal systems such as United States jurisdictions consider ownership as a 'bundle of rights' which can be separated into different components and separated amongst different individuals.Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) Property, Trusts and Succession 3rd edn., page 24. Instead in Scots law, ownership is a singular unitary right, that cannot be broken down into different components, it can only be transferred to another in whole or be encumbered through the creation of inferior real rights.Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) Property, Trusts and Succession 3rd edn., page 24. The owner of a 'thing' has the right to usus, fructus, abusus - the right to use, to the fruits (enjoyment) and the right to abuse or destroy the property.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, para 5. In contrast to historically feudal systems such as England & Wales or Scotland (Davidian Revolution - 28 November 2004), ownership is not split among individuals, such as interests held by a feudal superior. Because ownership is a single right, when it is transferred, it transfers instantaneously, with the previous Owner being deprived of all ownership in the property, at the moment of registration in the Land Register. === Principle of traditio === Scots law follows the principle that traditionibus non nudis pactis dominia rerum transferuntur: ownership is transferred by delivery (or other conveyance) and not by bare contract.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia,PROPERTY - PART I: GENERAL LAW (Volume 18), Ch. 13. TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP, para 606. As discussed above, a contract or delict only creates binding personal obligations, rights in rem (real rights) are not capable of transfer by contract alone. Instead a conveyance (Ie: a formal transfer of the property) is required. Personal rights, rights in personam, such as those like the Missives of Sale (ie: a contract for the sale of corporeal heritable property) alone does not transfer the real right of ownership in itself.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Transfer of Ownership, para 642. Without a conveyance, ie: the deed of disposition, and public act (see below), real rights cannot be validly created in Scots law.  Intent and consent  Where a voluntary transfer is made, the conveyance itself must be made with the intent and consent of both parties. The disponer (usually a Seller under a prior contract of sale) must have the intention to be divested of ownership and the disponee (usually a Buyer under a prior contract of sale) must have the intent to acquire the property. The intent and consent of both parties will be expressed in the disposition deed itself. === Principle of abstraction === Only a conveyance, as a separate legal legal act, can effect the transfer agreed to by contract between the parties. Scotland has an abstract property legal system, meaning the conveyance does rely on the cause of the transfer. In Scots law the recognised causa for transfer of property are: * loan for consumption (deriving from the Roman mutuum), * gift * barter (an exchange is termed a Contract of Excambion) * sale * ex facie absolute transfer in security * transfer in trust, expressly or otherwise. Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, para 609. The validity of the conveyance (ie: the transfer of property) does not depend on the validity of these causa, as Viscount StairViscount Stair is an institutional writer and as such is an authoritative source of law in Scots law. describes: > \\"We do not follow that subtility of annulling deeds, because they are sine > causa [ie: wiithout a cause (see above)] ‚Ä¶ and therefore narratives > expressing the cause of the disposition, are never inquired into, because, > though there were no cause, the disposition is good.‚ÄôStair, II, 3.14. > [Brackets added] Therefore, Scotland differs from common-law jurisdictions such as England & Wales, who operate on a causal system where the cause of the transfer is capable of annulling the transfer overall. By requiring a conveyance stage as well as the formation of a contract, Scots law adopts the traditio system where the cause of the transfer may be void or voidable, but the conveyance remains legally valid. Areas of Scots law, such as the law of sale in contract law have been, what is termed by some Scots legal academics as, \\"anglicised\\",van Vliet, Lars (May 2008). \\"The Transfer of Moveables in Scotland and England\\". Edinburgh Law Review. 12 (2): 173‚Äì199. doi:10.3366/E1364980908000309. ISSN 1364-9809. as a result of UK parliament legislation that was based on English law principles but introduced into Scots law: such as the introduction of the floating charge or the sale of moveable property into Scots law. In all other cases bar the sale of corporeal moveable property, the principle of abstraction is evident in Scots law.  Labes reales or vitium reale (a real vice)  While a conveyance may be valid irrespective of the causa, the reasons for the causa's invalidity under the law of obligations, succession, etc. may also extend to invalidate the intent to transfer as a vitium reale or labes reales (ie: a 'real vice') in property law.T. B. Smith, 'Error and transfer of title' (1967) The journal of the Law Society of Scotland. A contract may fail for numerous reasons, eg: it may not be formally valid, the parties may lack capacity or some other mental defect affecting capacity generally or there may be no consensus in idem (ie: a meeting of the minds in which the parties agree on the essential elements of the contract). However, only such defect in the contract, that are capable of being a vitium reale can serve to invalidate the transferStair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, para 600.. Therefore, it is often termed that 'a good conveyance is capable of saving a bad contract' because property continues to be owned by the disponee irrespective of the failure of the causa.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, para 600.  Absolutely good, void and voidable transfers  Accordingly, a transfer of ownership of property can therefore be (1) absolutely good, (2) void or (3) voidable. (1) An absolutely good transfer will give the disponee (or Buyer) an absolutely good title. This means that an Owner with absolutely good title will be immune from challenge of his ownership.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, para 601. (2) A void title is one where the ostensible (ie: the apparent) Owner has no legal basis for ownership. A void voluntary transfer commonly occurs where the granter (ie: the Seller) has no ownership of the property sold or he lacks transactional capacity and has transferred the property to the grantee (ie: the Buyer). The term void transfer can be characterised as a void ab initio (ie: void from the beginning) and is null and no effect. The effect of a transfer or other act that is void with null and no effect can be explained as if the documents of the transfer _were blank pieces of paper._ [2019] UKSC 41, Lady Hale at 69. (3) A voidable transfer results in the grantee (typically a Buyer or receiver of a gift, a giftee) obtaining a valid title, a subsistent title, to the property but this title can be defeated by challenge in court, ie: it can be reduced (judicially terminated by court order), by someone of a better legal claim to the property. This arises typically where there is a vice of consent. === Publicity principle === A large feature of Scots property law, is the publicity principle and the legal doctrine surrounding it. The publicity principle requires that in transfers of all property, there is a need for an external (ie: public) act in order to create or transfer real rights (or rights in rem). In Scots law, the publicity principle has not been analysed in great detail. However, the Scottish Law Commission have noted that the reliance on the public register provides certainty and security for the parties engaging the sale of land.Discussion Paper on Sharp v Thomson (Scot Law Com DP No 114, 2001), para 2.14. The rationale for the requirement of an external act is subject to academic debate but it is broadly recognised that the publicity principles serves the purposes of (1) providing legal certainty of ownership without reliance on litigation, (2) securing an Owner's real right (or right in rem) by way of reference to a recorded public act and, (3) protects third parties who may be unaware of any private agreements an Owner may be subject to.Sharp v Thomson (Scot Law Com DP No 114, 2001).  The race to the registers  Historically in Scotland, it was common for Sellers to grant multiple dispositions in one piece of land, often as an attempt to defraud multiple Buyers. The passage of the Registration Act 1617 by the estates of parliament of the Kingdom of Scotland was as an attempt to curtail this fraud by placing a registration requirement on transfers of ownership; allowing Buyers to act on reliance of the public register when they contracted. Importantly, the Real Rights Act 1693 provided that dispositions would rank in order of the date of registration'. This legal rule, still in force today, gives rise to the concept of the 'race to the registers in which the disponee (commonly, the Buyer following the conclusion of missives of sale) must record the disposition granted to him in the Land Register, thwarting all other potential third party claims to ownership.[2019] UKSC 41. The race has been characterised by the distinguished judge, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: > \\"a struggle in deadly earnest with the aim of destroying the other > competitor's chance to obtain the real right by recording the relevant deed > and infefting himself first. Those taking part in this race are no > Corinthians and swear no Olympic oath of sportsmanship. If your opponent is > slow off the mark, mistakes the way or stumbles, you do not chivalrously > wait for him to catch up: you take full advantage of his mistakes. _Nice > guys finish last and don't get the real right._ \\"Burnett's Trustee v > Grainger and Another [2004] UKHL 8, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 141. In practice, the introduction of Advance Notices under the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012 has reduced the 'struggle' in the race to the register. However, it still remains valid that only registration in the Land Register is capable of transferring or creating real rights (or rights in rem).Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012 s.50 The above three principles together create three stages of transfer: # The Causa # The Conveyance # The Public Act All three steps must be fulfilled in order to validly transfer real rights in Scots law. == Prior communings rule and clauses == At common law, following Winston v Patrick,1980 SC 246 the delivery of a disposition to a disponee supersedes any personal obligations in the contract, even if collateral in nature under operation of the prior communings rule. The Contract (Scotland) Act 1997 altered this common law rule, so that the missives are no longer superseded by the disposition.Contract (Scotland) Act 1997 s.2 However, many conveyancers still include the use of a 2-year supersession clause in the Missives of Sale to ensure that contractual obligations come to end after 2 years rather than the running the full statutory 20-year period under the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Conveyancing (2nd reissue), Ch 3, Structure and Form of Deeds, para 81. It is important to note that the use of this clause will apply to both Buyer's and Seller's obligations under the contract.Pena v Ray 1987 SC 1, 1987 SLT 609, OH. == Disposition (deed) == Historically, under the feudal system, the conveyancing stage was carried out by feudal deed such as feu dispositions or Charters of Novodamus but their usage as a means of transferring ceased on 28 December 2004. Example current dispositions for both commercial and residential property can be found on the Property Standardisation Group website. Instead the legal transfer is carried through the issuance of a formal document by the Seller (the Granter of the disposition) called a disposition when discussing heritable property in favour of the Buyer (the grantee of the disposition).Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Transfer of Ownership, para 642. Dispositions must be in writing and be formally subscribed under the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995. An example of a modern disposition can be found on the Property Standardisation Group website: > \\"2 Narrative 2.1 The Seller is the proprietor of the Property. 2.2 The > Seller has sold the Property to the Purchaser for the Price. 2.3 The Seller > acknowledges receipt of the Price. 3 Disposition The Seller DISPONES the > Property to the Purchaser.\\" As shown, the disposition acts in furtherance of the causa of the transfer, commonly a contract of sale, and effects the transfers (the disponement) of the property itself . However, a disposition still requires registration in the Land Register of Scotland.Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012 s.50 The Inner House of the Court of Session notes that a disposition: > ‚Äúoperates as an actual alienation of the subject to the disponee; and it > vests in him most of the essential attributes of ownership. In particular it > vests in him not only a right to possess the subject and to reap its fruits > but also a power to sell it; to dispone it for either onerous or gratuitous > causes; and to settle the estate by mortis causa dispositions ....The right > so created is transmissible from one person to another by voluntary > disposition; and on the death of any person, in whom it is vested, it is > transmissible to his heir by general service; and each person in whom it is > vested successively has the powers and privileges of ownership above > mentioned.\\"Earl of Fife v Duff (1862) 24 D 936 at 941. == Other functions of a disposition == Contractual Provisions A disposition may contain contractual obligations which become a binding contract on acceptance of the disposition by the Buyer.Hunter v Boog (1834) 13 S 205. Under the operation of the prior communings rule, see above, the disposition _may_ supersede any previous contractual obligations found in the Missives of Sale. Assignations (In common law jurisdictions, termed assignment) The disposition may also assign ancillary rights to the Buyer.Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979 s.16. This includes any rents payable to the Seller as a landlord and any writs or deeds concerning the property. Express assignations can also be made under Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1874.Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1874 s.50. As with all assignations, they still require to be intimated (notified) to the debtor of the rights assigned. The Scottish Parliament is currently considering the reform of moveable transactions, including assignations, following the publication of the Scottish Law Commission's Report on Moveable Transactions (2017, SLC Report No 249). This may include the creation of a Register of Assignations and further reform the law in this area. == Warrandice (guarantees) of dispositions == A full and absolute warrandice (in other jurisdictions called a warranty) is implied in law in the granting of a disposition.Stair Institutions II,3,46; Bankton Institute II,3,121 and 122; Erskine Institute II,3,25; Bell Principles s 894 Even a simple usage of \\"I grant warrandice\\" in the disposition is enough to make a full and absolute warrandice in a disposition.Titles to Land Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1868 s.8 However, it should be noted that where the property is a gift, the giftee only receives simple warrandice in the disposition covering (3), below, alone. A further exception is where the property is acquired _under-value_ and only a fact and deed warrandice is granted under the disposition (covering (1), (2) and (3) below). Typically, when the Seller grants the disposition, the Seller therefore will warrant (ie: guarantee) the following four warranties: # Absolute Good Title # No lesser real rights (ie: no liferent or security etc. in the land) # No unusual real conditions (ie: no unusual burdens or servitudes attached to the land) # No future acts will be made prejudicial to the Buyer's title (ownership) to the land. In practice, these warranties are often expressly granted, which will vary or add to the implied warranties of the Seller, such as the use of the Scottish Standard Clauses. In the unlikely event that the missives are silent as to warranties, those implied by law will apply. === Warrant 1: Absolute good title === The Seller warrants that he is able to convey ownership validly to the Buyer.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Transfer of Ownership, para 708. The warrant also covers that the Seller's right of ownership (title) is absolutely good, and not voidable or excluded from the Keeper of the Register of Scotland's indemnity.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Transfer of Ownership, para 708.Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012 s.73: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2012/5/part/7/enacted Hume, the institutional writer, and source of law in Scotland, says the Seller must furnish the Buyer with evidence that the title is good.Hume Lectures vol II (Stair Soc vol 13, 1949 ed G C H Paton) p 38. The warrant must cover the whole of the property transferred, ie: the Seller must own all of the land that is agreed to be transferred under the Missives of Sale. An example of this can be commonly found in case law where the Seller contracts to transfer the entire land, that is to say a coele usuque ad centrum (from the heavens to the centre of the Earth) but the mineral rights, found in the strata of the land as a separate conventional tenement, are not owned by the Seller but by a third party but would be warranted to be transferred to the Buyer.Whyte v Lee (1879) 6 R 699; Crofts v Stewart's Trustees 1927 SC (HL) 65, 1927 SLT 362; Mossend Theatre Co Ltd v Livingstone 1930 SC 90, 1930 SLT 108; Campbell v M'Cutcheon 1963 SC 505, 1963 SLT 290 Following Holms v Ashford Estates Ltd,[2009] CSIH 28, 2009 SCLR 428, 2009 SLT 389. it is settled that a warrant that the land transferred is fit for the purpose the Buyer has informed the Seller it was to be used does not fall within this warranty. === Warrant 2: No lesser real rights === The Seller warrants that there are no lesser real rights held in the land that is to be transferred, excluding leases.Hume Lectures vol IV (Stair Soc vol 17, 1955 ed G C H Paton) p 150; Bell Principles s 895; Dewar v Aitken (1780) Mor 16637 Leases have conflicting legal authority on whether they are covered by the Seller's no lesser real rights warranty. Older legal authorities from the 16th and 17th century Kingdom of Scotland courts appear to suggest that the implied warranty does not cover leases. The rationale for this was that historically, feudal owners would rarely occupy the land they owned, which was often leased or given to vassals through subinfeudation so a warranty that land has no lesser real rights was not relevant.Early case law: Simpson v Zoung (1563) Mor 16565; Lady Pitferran (1629) Mor 16577.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Transfer of Ownership, para 703. However, Hume, the institutional writer, and source of law in Scotland, wrote that only leases of a very long duration, at low rent, or where the lease gives the tenant large-ranging powers over the land, would be covered by this warranty.Hume vol IV,149. The modern source of authority in this area is Lothian and Border Farmers Ltd v M'Cutcheon1952 SLT 450, OH. which followed the old authorities that a lease was not covered by warranty. However, there is academic criticism that this decision was incorrect, and remains a first instance judgment of the Outer House of the Court of Session.J M Halliday Conveyancing Law and Practice in Scotland vol I (1985) para 4-38(6). In any event, conveyancers will often add a clause to the missives, as is done in the Scottish Standard Clauses, that the property will be provided to the seller for entry and vacant possession. The occupancy rights of a spouse under the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981 are akin to a statutory quasi-real right and it is uncertain whether this is included in the warranty.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Transfer of Ownership, para 709. In any event, it is standard practice to include a term in the missives concerning occupancy rights, as is done in the Scottish Standard Clauses in the Missives of Sale. === Warrant 3: No unusual real conditions === It was established definitively in 1835 that real conditions, such as servitudes and burdens, were covered by the absolute warranty made by the Seller.Urquhart v Halden (1835) 13 S 844. It is now implied in law that a Seller warrants that there are no real conditions on the property where:Welsh v Russell (1894) 21 R 769, 1 SLT 594; M'Connell v Chassells (1903) 10 SLT 790, OH; Armia Ltd v Daejan Developments Ltd 1978 SC 152, 1977 SLT (Notes) 9, 49, revsd 1979 SC (HL) 56, 1979 SLT 147; Morris v Ritchie 1992 GWD 33-1950, OH. # that the condition was _unknown_ to the Buyer at the time when the missives concluded; # that the condition is _unusual_ either generally or in relation to the _type_ and _location_ of the property in question; and # that the condition results in a _material diminution in the value_ of the property. All three tests must be satisfied for a claim in warrandice to succeed against an unknown real condition.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Transfer of Ownership, para 705. In practice, due diligence checks by each parties' agents should identify any previously unknown real conditions prior to the conclusion of missives.When determining knowledge, the court will look at whether by the Buyer's \\"negligence and inexcusabill ignorance\\"Drummond v Steuart (1549) Mor 16565 (translated from Scots: negligence and inexcusable ignorance) prevented him from having actual knowledge, if it did the court may hold the Buyer had constructive knowledge, knowledge based on the exercise of reasonable care.Drummond v Steuart (1549) Mor 16565 Therefore, a Buyer is deemed to know of and to expect real conditions of a standard type.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Transfer of Ownership, para 705. If the Seller avers, ie: makes a factual submission to the court, that the Buyer knew of the condition at the date of the conclusion of missives, the Seller alone must prove this evidential onus.M'Connell v Chassells (1903) 10 SLT 790 at 793, OH, per Lord Kincairney. Where the court finds that a Buyer acted with negligence and inexcusabill ignorance, thereby rejecting the warranty claim; parties who acted through a solicitor may pursue a claim against the agent handling the sale for professional negligence, as a more appropriate and effective remedy where the solicitor failed to exercise reasonable care. === Warrant 4: No future acts will be made prejudicial to the Buyer's title to (ownership of) the land === See also: Offside Goals Rule (Scots Law) The fourth warranty guarantees that the Seller will take no future acts that would prejudice the Buyer's contractual right to ownership. A Seller would breach their warranty where they grant a subsequent disposition to another individual or subsequently grant lesser real rights in the land to third parties after the Buyer has received their disposition. This warranty ceases to be relevant once ownership validly transfers to the Buyer, following the registration of the disposition.Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012 s.50. Where land is given gratuitously (ie: a gift), the giftee only receives a simple warrandice covering no future prejudicial acts. === Breach and enforcement of warrandice in a disposition claim === Where the holder of a warranty believes there to be a breach, it might prove impossible to trace the Seller or their predecessors following the completion of the transfer process. The remedy for breach of warrandice of disposition is damages. As such their efficacy as a legal remedy for Buyers later discovering latent defects in the property's title is limited. In warrandices of a disposition, there is generally no requirement for eviction. However, if the Buyer wishes to rely on the Seller's warranty that the title conveyed was absolutely good, see _warrandice 1 above_ , he must prove he has been judicially evicted or has a serious threat of judicial eviction. The warrandice of a disposition has been given recent treatment by the Supreme Court in Morris v Rae, which now requires eviction (interference with the Buyer's right of ownership) or the threat of eviction by someone who has a better title (right) to the land.Morris v Rae [2011] CSIH 30; 2011 S.C. 654; 2011 S.L.T. 701 (Inner House); [2012] UKSC 50; 2012 S.L.T. 88 (Supreme Court)R. Rennie, 'Warrandice - the threat of the threat of eviction' (2013) Scots Law Times Issue 4, 27-29. Requirement for Judicial Eviction Judicial Eviction in the Scots law definition, deriving from Roman law, is not the laymen sense of the word eviction, whereby a tenant is removed from the property of the landlord. Instead judicial eviction is where the true owner of the property asserts their right of ownership. An action of eviction must be raised in the court by the true Owner of the land and cannot be raised by the Buyer or by the Buyer raising a declarator (ie: a legal action requesting the Court to make a legal finding in a matter). If the Keeper of the Registers of Scotland exercises her power of rectification of the Land Register, this is also presumed to be considered a judicial eviction for the purposes of warrandice.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Transfer of Ownership, para 707. In effect the warrant of good title is reduced to a warrant against eviction.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Transfer of Ownership, para 708. === Supersession of Disposition Warrandice over Missives Warrandice === Typically, the delivery of a disposition will supersede the warranties given by the Seller under the contract in the Missives of Sale. However, there are three scenarios where the Warrandice of Missives of Sale continue to be relevant: 1) Delayed settlement - Without the disposition being issued, the Buyer can only rely on the warrandice in the missives of sale. 2) Abandoned transaction following Missives of Sale - After the missives of sale, if the transaction is abandoned (ie: no disposition issued), the Buyer is still able to use the Missives of Sale 3) Contractual clause in Missives preventing non-supersession of the warrandice. Remedy The only remedy for enforcement of warrandice of a disposition is damages.Welsh v Russell (1894) 21 R 769. If the breach is that the Seller has _no right of ownership_ to _all or part_ of the subjects conveyed, damages are calculated by reference to the current value of the land, without regard to whether that value is greater or smaller than the original price. If the breach is that the title is encumbered _by a real right or a real condition_ , the normal basis of damages is the resultant difference in market value that the real condition/real right has on the property value. == References == Category:Scots law Category:Scotland Category:Scots property law ","title":"Disposition (Scots law)"},{"id":"63772119","text":"Belippo eburnensis is a jumping spider species in the genus Belippo that lives in Ivory Coast.

Fish across all taxa vary greatly in their coloration through special mechanisms, mainly pigment cells called chromatophores. Fish can have any colors of the visual spectrum on their skin, evolutionarily derived for many reasons. There are three factors to coloration, brightness (intensity of light), hue (mixtures of wavelengths), and saturation (the purity of wavelengths). Fish coloration has three proposed functions: thermoregulation, intraspecific communication, and interspecific communication. Fishes' diverse coloration is possibly derivative of the fact that \\"fish most likely see colors very differently than humans\\". == Mechanisms == 216x216px Fish coloration is produced through specialized cells called chromatophores. The dermal chromatophore is a basic color unit in amphibians, reptiles, and fish which has three cell layers: \\"the xanthophore (contains carotenoid and pteridine pigments), the iridophore (reflects color structurally), and the melanophore (contains melanin)\\". The pigments in the chromatophores are generally classified into two groups: melanin (makes browns, grays, and blacks), and carotenoids (makes reds, oranges, and yellows). Xanthophores, iridophores, and melanophores \\"originate from neural crest‚Äêderived stem cells associated with the dorsal root ganglia of the peripheral nervous system\\". === Specific mechanisms by color === * Black: produced by melanin granules dispersing inside the melanophore * Gray and brown: produced by melanin granules concentrating inside the melanophore * White: appears from light reflected by crystals of guanine in iridophores and leucophores * Red, orange, yellow: produced by carotenoids that come from fish's diet * Green, blue, violet: (generally) structural colors produced by the reflection and refraction of light by the skin and scale layers Thalassoma purpureum, of the family Labridae showing bright and varied coloration.An example of a family of fish that is widely known for their highly varied and bright coloration are the Labridae (wrasses) and Scaridae (parrotfish).

Different wavelengths, and thus different colors, travel differently and therefore appear differently depending on the depth of the water and the things on which they are reflecting. == Evolutionary function == Ex. of dynamic display in a blue Betta splendens flaring its gills in an aggressive display to show the bright red coloration inside. === Signalling === One way that fish coloration can be categorized is into \\"static\\" or \\"dynamic\\" coloration/displays. _Static coloration_ often serves as an \\"identification badge\\" for information such as species, reproductive condition, sex, or age. An example of a type of static coloration that conveys clear information to predators of different species is aposematic coloration. An example of aposematic coloration is in the lionfish (Pterois sp.). _Dynamic displays_ consist of either changes of color or \\"rapid exposure of colored, previously hidden structures\\" such as colored fins that can be erected at will, colored mouth opening and closing, or flaring gills with bright coloration on the gill margins. For example, grunts have a bright red lining on their mouth that they can show by opening it in a head-to-head encounter. Another common example is the betta fish, or Siamese fighting fish, that will flare its gills as an aggressive behavior. These gills have brightly colored margins that contrast the rest of the body. === Camouflage === Some fish are famous for their camouflage, and it comes in many forms. Camouflage is when a fish is trying to blend in with its background, or not look obvious. Some major forms of camouflage in fish include protective resemblance, disruptive coloration, countershading, mirror-siding, and transparency. === Protective resemblance === Protective resemblance is blending in, or resembling an object that is not of interest to a predator and is thus inconspicuous. One example is the juvenile Platax orbicularis that resembles a leaf floating in the water. Another example is the Hippocampus bargibanti that resembles the coral it hooks to. 160x160px === Disruptive coloration === Disruptive coloration in fish functions to break up the fishlike outline. This can be done with stripes, bars, or spot patterns on the fish. _Bars_ are lines that go dorsal to ventral, for example in the blackbanded sunfish. _Stripes_ are lines that go from the snout to the tail, such as in Aeoliscus strigatus. Stripes and bars often continue through the eye to break up the easily recognized vertebrate eye. === Countershading === Countershading (dark on top and light on the bottom) in fish works well in conjunction with how light comes into the water from above. Looking from below up at a countershaded fish, the light belly will blend in with the light surface of the water. Looking from above down at a countershaded fish, the dark back will blend with the dark water below. An example of countershading in fish is the Atlantic bluefin tuna. Some fish are even known to have reverse countershading, being light on the dorsal side and dark on the ventral side. An example of this is Tyrannochromis macrostoma, which turns upside-down right before it strikes, essentially disappearing. === Mimicry === alt= Mimicry is defined as an animal resembling a different animal that is avoided or not commonly preyed upon and is thus conspicuous. There are two types of mimicry: Mullerian mimicry and Batesian mimicry. An example of Batesian mimicry in fishes are the Centrogeniidae (false scorpionfishes), that resemble the Scorpaenidae (scorpionfishes). Another example of Batesian mimicry is the ringed snake eel (Myrichthys colubrinus) that mimics the venomous sea snake Laticauda colubrina. An example of Mullerian mimicry is in saber-toothed blennies. The Meiacanthus atrodorsalis and the Plagiotremus laudandus, both venomous, resemble each other and the Meiacanthus oualanensis and the Plagiotremus laudandus flavus, also both venomous, resemble each other. === Color change === Midas cichlid with the gold polymorphism. Color change in fishes can be roughly divided into two categories: physiological color change and morphological color change. _Physiological color change_ is considered to be more rapid and consist of motile chromatophore responses, while _morphological color change_ consists of the density and morphology of chromatophores changing. Overall, morphological color changes are considered to be a \\"physiological phenomena involved in the balance between differentiation [of melanophores] and apoptosis of chromatophores\\" but are still being studied; that is to say it has to do with the synthesis of pigment. The genetic factors behind natural morph variants of color in fish are still mostly undiscovered. Some hormonal factors of morphological color change in fish include Œ±-MSH, prolactin, estrogen, noradrenaline, MCH, and possibly melatonin. Some of these are also involved in physiological color change. In physiological color change, there is also neurohumoral regulation of chromatophores in fish. Additionally, there have been found to be \\"differences at the intracellular level where fish chromatophores show smaller, better coordinated, and higher speed of the pigment organelles\\" in comparison to color-changing frogs. An example of physiological color change is found in the black-spotted rockskipper (Entomacrodus striatus). They are known to change color rapidly using their chromatophores, which is thought to enhance their crypsis in the \\"high-contrast environment of the rock wall\\". Another example of physiological color change is in the body and the eyes of guppy juveniles and Nile tilapia. An example of morphological color change is in the Midas cichlid (Amphilophus citrinellus), that has \\"normal\\" and \\"gold\\" polymorphisms. Most of these cichlids maintain a \\"normal\\" grayish color pattern from juvenile to adult. However some of these species undergo morphological color change over their lifetimes, growing to be a gold or white color pattern as an adult. Another example of a fish that undergo morphological color change is the Hyphessobrycon myrmex sp. nov.. Juveniles are pale yellow and females maintain that color as adults. Males undergo morphological color change and become red or orange == References == == External links == *https://reefci.com/2013/10/31/significance-of-colors-and-patterns-of-coral- reef-fishes-an-overview/ *https://www.jstor.org/stable/2407979?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents *https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13180 *https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pcmr.12040 Category:Evolution of vertebrates Category:Zoology Category:Fish Category:Mimicry Category:Warning coloration Category:Camouflage Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Fish coloration"},{"id":"63772135","text":"Carolyn Law (born 1951) is an American artist known for her mixed media and public artworks. ==Public art== *2011, Social Intricacy/The Beach, Kirkland Transit Center, Seattle *2010, Wenatchee Sewage Treatment Plant, Wenatchee, Washington *2006, Before Now, Depot Park, Santa Cruz, California *2001 Tonalea Landmarks, Scottsdale, Arizona ==Collections== Works by Law are included in the collections of the Seattle Art Museum and the Washington State Arts Commission. ==References== Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American women artists Category:21st-century American women artists ","title":"Carolyn Law"},{"id":"63772142","text":"London Live may refer to: * London Live (TV programme), a long-running UK live music programme shown on Channel 4 and 4Music * London Live (TV channel), a local television channel in London, England * \\"London Live\\", a track on the 2001 So Far So Good DVD by Atomic Kitten * London: Live, a 2009 live album by An Albatross * London Live '68, a 1998 live album by Fleetwood Mac * London beHofaah (London ‚Äì Live), a 1995 album by Chava Alberstein ==See also== * * * Live in London (disambiguation) ","title":"London Live (disambiguation)"},{"id":"63772144","text":"Pisuviricota is a phylum of RNA viruses, which includes all positive-strand and double-stranded RNA viruses, which infect eukaryotes and are not members of the phylum Kitrinoviricota, Lenarviricota, or Duplornaviricota.

He also played one test for the New Zealand rugby league team in 1924 becoming Kiwi number 159. == Early life == Wiremu Te Whata was born in Northland, New Zealand in 1893. His father was Eru Te Whata, and mother Ripeka Ruku Kaihe. He had a brother, John William Te Whata. In the 1910s Wiremu (also known as William, or Bill) moved to live in Tokomaru Bay on the East Coast of the North Island. ==Playing career== ===Rugby Union playing days=== Bill Te Whata began playing rugby on the East Coast of the North Island. He played for the Waima Rugby Club from 1918 to 1921. On 28 August 1920 he played for ‚ÄòWaiapu County‚Äô (situated near Ruatoria) against Hawkes Bay. After a ‚Äúforward sweep‚Äù Te Whata \\"got over and scored\\" their only try in a 12‚Äì3 loss where a trumpet was blown to announce the end of the match. When they played four days later against a Hawke‚Äôs Bay MƒÅori side their manager told the Hastings Standard that they were in fact a ‚Äúcountry team, picked in Tokomaru, from a population of from 1000 to 1500 people‚Äù rather than the Waiapu district. They were therefore called Tokomaru for this match which was drawn 9 all after they scored a try on full-time. Te Whata had earlier scored a try following ‚Äúa splendid bit of passing‚Äù among his teammates. In 1921 Te Whata again turned out for the Tokomaru side. They played a match against the visiting Tolaga Bay side which saw a 6‚Äì6 draw with Te Whata continuing his try scoring feats notching a try for the hosts. Te Whata was then named in the East Coast side to play against Poverty Bay on August 13 at the Childers Road Reserve. East Coast was just beginning as combined rep team with players made up from Te Araroa, Tokomaru, Tolaga Bay, Tikitiki, and Ruatoria. Te Whata‚Äôs weight was listed as 13 stone. East Coast won the match 8‚Äì6 in front of a big crowd. A week later Te Whata was to gain selection for his opponent when he was picked in the Poverty Bay side to play against Hawkes Bay on August 27. The East Coast team he had played for was not a fully fledged union and therefore the players from there were eligible to play for Poverty Bay. Poverty Bay lost the match 12 points to 3 with Te Whata scoring their only points after a scrum on the Hawke‚Äôs Bay line. The game saw considerable interest because the match was essentially a trial to see who would be picked in the combined team to play against the touring Springboks. This saw a crowd of around 2,500 in attendance though the game was generally regarded as disappointing. Te Whata was then selected for the combined Poverty Bay & Hawke‚Äôs Bay side to play against the Springboks on September 3 at McLean Park in Napier. The Springboks won 14‚Äì8 in front of a crowd of between 7 and 8 thousand with Te Whata playing in the forwards. He was then picked in the New Zealand MƒÅori team to play the Springboks at the same venue four days later on September 7. The Springboks won by a solitary point 9‚Äì8 in front of 6,000. ===Switch to Rugby League=== In 1922 Bill Te Whata made the move to rugby league. A story is related where George Gillett, the famous All Black and New Zealand rugby league player was working as a publican in the Gisborne area at the time. He approached Joe Lockwood, his twin brother Mason, and Te Whata and asked them if they would go to Auckland ‚Äúfor a trial of league‚Äù.John Oliver Coffey, Bernie Wood 100 Years MƒÅori Rugby League, Wellington, Huia, 2008, p.75 It is unclear if there was a trial but Te Whata was to play for New Zealand MƒÅori against Auckland on May 20 at Carlaw Park as part of their build up to their Australian tour. The MƒÅori side won by 28 points to 18 against a strong Auckland team which featured 12 current or future Kiwi internationals. Te Whata was listed as being 26 years of age at the time. He was to score a try which sealed the game which he also converted in front of 7,000 spectators. The match also saw ¬£297 2s 6d raised at the gate. They then played an inter squad exhibition match before the departure of the team for Australia. The match was described as ‚Äúmore or less of a scramble‚Äù with the A team winning 44 points to 14 despite many tries not even seeing a conversion attempted and Te Whata scoring 5 tries for the winning side. Many spectators who had paid for admission asked for their money refunded and the Auckland Rugby League decided to recommend to New Zealand Council that the gate money be donated to charity. Te Whata was then officially named in the touring side alongside the likes of Huatahi Paki, George Gardiner, Sam Lowrie, George Paki, and Craddock Dufty. In their first tour match they were destroyed by the Metropolis team at the Sydney Cricket Ground in front of an enormous crowd of 35,000. At the end of the match the scoreboard read ‚ÄòMetroplis 77 New Zealand MƒÅori 13‚Äô while a headline read ‚ÄúDefence shattered like chaff before a storm‚Äù. Te Whata played in the second row but went off injured just after halftime. They had a much better time of it in their next match against the New South Wales 2nd XIII, this time losing by the more respectable margin of 31 points to 14 in front of a 30,000 strong crowd with Te Whata again playing in the second row. The side then moved to Queensland where they met the Queensland side at Davies Park in Brisbane. Te Whata played his third consecutive match in the second row and he scored a try. New Zealand MƒÅori won 23 points to 22 after a storming comeback. They had fallen behind 5-22, and a try on full-time snatched victory in front of 7,000 spectators. The 4th tour match was against Toowoomba at Athletic Oval in Toowoomba where he was again in his customary position of the second row. The local side won 26 to 6 with Te Whata scoring a try and his line kicking being ‚Äúa feature of the game‚Äù. Just one day later the New Zealand MƒÅori side played Ipswich and were defeated 20 points to 3 with several of the touring side backing up, including Te Whata. The team was coming in for a lot of criticism for its lack of team work and unusual selection policies though Te Whata was described as a ‚Äúfine individual player‚Äù He scored his third try of the tour in a 31‚Äì19 loss to Queensland in their second match with that opponent on Davies Park in Brisbane. There were 6,000 spectators at the match which saw New Zealand MƒÅori ‚Äúshow improvement in combination‚Äù. Te Whata‚Äôs try came in the second half which also saw Craddock Dufty ordered off for insulting the referee. The New Zealand MƒÅori side then secured their second win of the tour when they beat Stanthorpe 6 points to 3 with Te Whata scoring New Zealand's second try. They then rounded out the tour with a 32‚Äì0 loss to the Metropolis team who had trounced them at the beginning of the tour, Te Whata again lining out in the second row, before a final match with Orange which they won 25-15 before they returned to New Zealand. He had ultimately played in at least 7 of the 9 matches. At the end of the season Te Whata was awarded a gold medal, which was presented to him by Mr. W. Pascoe of Auckland ‚Äúfor the best all-round player‚Äù of the Australian tour. In the meantime he had returned to Auckland where he joined the Fire Brigade rugby league club who had recently joined Auckland‚Äôs first grade competition. Te Whata was to play alongside his MƒÅori teammates George Gardiner, B Pitman, and Moses Yeats in the side to play on 8 July against City Rovers. Towards the end of the season on September 20 he was selected for the Auckland Provincial team to play the touring New South Wales side. They were beaten 21‚Äì20 on the Auckland Domain in front of 5,500. Te Whata was then selected to play in a combined New Zealand and New South Wales team to play against the touring ‚ÄòAustralian‚Äô side (New South Wales in reality). This team became known as ‚ÄúAustralasia‚Äù and because of an unsurprising lack of combination were thrashed in both matches they played against some of the best players in the world. They were composed of seven Auckland club players including Te Whata and six players from Australia. On the Auckland Domain before 12,000 spectators Te Whata‚Äôs Australasian team was beaten by New South Wales 65 to 27, though he did score three tries for the ‚Äòhome‚Äô side. Te Whata‚Äôs first try came after he broke away with Nelson Bass and Johnson, the second when he broke away with Bert Avery ‚Äúscoring brilliantly‚Äù, and the third in the second half when the match became very loose. Both teams had a player ordered off (Wally Somers and Alf O'Connor), and lost a player through injury (Dick Vest and George Davidson) thus finishing with 11 men aside. The same two teams met on September 29 in Taumarunui however the score line was even more lopsided and the newspaper headline which said it was a ‚ÄúHigh Scoring Match‚Äù was not exaggerating. The New South Wales team winning by the incredible score of 87 to 16 in front of 2,000 spectators. Te Whata contributed 4 points as he converted 2 tries. ===Rugby Union reinstatement controversy=== At the start of the 1923 season Bill Te Whata attempted to be reinstated into the rugby union ranks. He appeared before the New Zealand Rugby Union Executive to state his case on May 23. In what was to become a somewhat infamous case that was widely reported in newspapers throughout New Zealand Te Whata admitted to receiving money to play rugby league. This was a moment that New Zealand Rugby had been waiting for years to substantiate their consistent allegations that the rugby league code in New Zealand had been paying its players. What Te Whata did not make clear until much later however was that the money he was referring to had largely come from the New South Wales Rugby League body, and not from New Zealand Rugby League. The later organisation only paying him for out of pocket expenses as was what they maintained was the case for all representative players throughout this period. Te Whata was asked if he had received money and replied ‚ÄúYes, ¬£4 10s a week, a total of ¬£73 10s. For two months in Australia ¬£36, and a bonus of ¬£24 (1922), and while with the New Zealand League representatives between 9th September, 1922, and 6th October, 1922, the sum of ¬£13 10s‚Äù. He went on to say in his application that he realised he had ‚Äúmade a mistake in playing League, but I have left the League, and wish to rejoin my old club or any club‚Äù. His appeal was endorsed by the East Coast Rugby Union. The NZ Rugby Union rather matter of factly refused his application with Mr. A. C. Kitto stating ‚Äúhe has expelled himself. We cannot admit him‚Äù. ===Continuation in Rugby League=== Te Whata was to try to appeal again three more times but was knocked back each time including in June of the 1924 season. They did however state that if he wished he could appeal again in 12 months time. It appears that rather than miss another year of playing when he would have been in his prime oval ball playing years he decided to return to the rugby league field. In a story in the Gisborne Herald on June 26 it was said that he was ‚Äújoining the ranks of the Benedict‚Äôs on Wednesday‚Äù, and ‚Äúafter going to Timaru for his honeymoon, Mr Te Whata goes to Auckland, where he is to play against the English League team‚Äù. It was noted in the same story that other players on the same tour had been re-instated. Te Whata said that he was disappointed and could not understand the attitude of the rugby union and said ‚Äúplay league again; Can you blame me?‚Äù. Rather astonishingly the match Te Whata was referring to was the first test between New Zealand and England at Carlaw Park. Considering the match was 5 weeks away and the team was a similar number of weeks away from being selected this claim was somewhat interesting. His statement did however turn out to be true. On July 4 Te Whata had to appear before the New Zealand Council to explain his application to be reinstated into rugby union and the remarks he had made about receiving money to play rugby league. Te Whata said ‚ÄúI stated clearly on the application I sent in that I received money from the New South Wales League‚Äù. He went on to sign a declaration that he had not received money from the New Zealand League, and ‚Äúthat he had never received any money other than out of pocket expenses while playing under the League‚Äôs jurisdiction‚Äù. He then had his application approved by the council. He joined the Athletic club after being granted a transfer by the Auckland Rugby League subject to approval by the New Zealand Council. And on July 5 Te Whata was named to play in the Athletic team against City Rovers and he was to score a try in a 6‚Äì6 draw. He was on the end of a pass from his former New Zealand MƒÅori teammate Craddock Dufty and ‚Äúliterally dived over and scored Athletic‚Äôs first try‚Äù. He played a second match against Ponsonby United before being selected in the Auckland B team to play against Hamilton. Te Whata scored 2 tries in a 28‚Äì18 win in the match played at Carlaw Park. The following weekend he scored a further try for Athletic in a 25‚Äì0 win over Richmond Rovers. The England team then arrived in New Zealand. Te Whata was selected to play for the Auckland Provincial team to meet them in their 3rd tour match on July 30. England won by 28‚Äì3 in front of 7,000 spectators at Carlaw Park. Te Whata played in the front row alongside Bert Avery and Hec McDonald. He was heavily involved in the match where he ‚Äúdistinguished himself in smothering movements by the visitors‚Äù and ‚Äúworking hard‚Äù, he also took a long pass and passed on to Hec Brisbane who ran in for a try. The Auckland Star also noted that in ‚ÄúTe Whata and McDonald we had two forwards as good as the visitors‚Äù. Following this match Te Whata was selected to play in the first test match against England. This was to be his one and only appearance in the New Zealand jersey. The test was played at Carlaw Park in front of 22,000 spectators, where unfortunately the ground was covered in mud and the players struggled in the conditions. New Zealand prevailed with an historic 16‚Äì8 victory. Te Whata was to play in his more familiar position of the second row where he was supported by Neil Mouat, and Bert Avery. He broke through with the ball at his feet and from the resulting play Ernie Herring picked the ball up and scored queuing ‚Äúdeafening cheers‚Äù which put New Zealand 11-3 ahead. Te Whata was then named in the squad to play in the second test won by New Zealand 13-11 but did not take the field and the same happened for the third test won by England 31‚Äì18. Te Whata did not return to play for Athletic until midway through the 1925 season. Like he often did he returned to Tokomaru in the off season. He caught the Wainui ship to Auckland on May 24. In 1925 Te Whata was first named to play in the round 6 match with Ponsonby United on May 30 where he was to play in the unfamiliar position of centre where he was said to have been only ‚Äúfair‚Äù. He scored his only try of the season in a 50‚Äì23 loss in the Roope Rooster to Ponsonby. Te Whata missed selection for the New Zealand team to tour Australia but was picked for the Auckland B team to embark on a southern tour of the West Coast, Canterbury, and Wellington. His weight was listed at 13 stone, 10 pounds and his age 29 which would mean he was born around 1896, not the 1893 that other records show. Auckland defeated West Coast 22-15 before a 6‚Äì5 loss to Canterbury where Te Whata scored Auckland B‚Äôs only try. He then had a field day against Wellington with a 5 try performance in a 68 to 9 win at Newton Park. The Evening Post described Te Whata as ‚Äúone of the sturdiest of the Auckland team‚Äù and when compared to Ben Davidson who scored 3 tries and who would soon go on to play for Wigan as being ‚Äúeasier to catch, but harder to stop‚Äù. When Te Whata returned to Auckland he made his debut in the full Auckland team to play in a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against South Auckland. Auckland had won the trophy off South Auckland six weeks earlier and were seeking to retain it and they did so with a comfortable 36‚Äì19 win. Then on October 10 Te Whata played for the Auckland Province team against the touring Queensland side. He was named in the reserves but took the field when the Auckland fullback Raynor was carried off on a stretcher just before halftime. At the start of the second half Te Whata surprisingly took the field in the wing three-quarter position. The match was already over from a competitive stand point as Queensland led by 28 points to 6 at halftime and they went on to win 54‚Äì14. He was beaten by Cecil Aynsley who scored a try shortly before halftime but later got revenge of a sort when ‚Äúhe beat Aynsley for possession, and nearing the twenty-five passed to Singe, who ran over to score‚Äù. In 1926 Te Whata again turned out for the Athletic team who had now assumed the name of Grafton Athletic. He scored a try in a 13‚Äì6 win over Devonport United on the Devonport Domain. It seems that this was to be the last time that Bill Te Whata put on either a rugby league or a rugby union jersey. He returned to Tokomaru Bay and 7 years later in 1934 the East Coast Rugby Union was asked by the Tokomaru Bay sub-union to recommend the reinstatement of W. Te Whata with the New Zealand Rugby Football Union. The East Coast Union‚Äôs management committee gave strong support to the proposal. It was said in the Poverty Bay Herald that as the league game was not played on the East Coast he had no opportunity to play and had been ‚Äúout of football for several years‚Äù. The application was refused and the East Coast Rugby Union decided ‚Äúafter considerable discussion‚Äù to apply once again. It is unclear if he ever was reinstated but there is no link with him and the rugby game after this time though he remained active in athletics, cycling and bowls throughout the 1930s and 40s in the Poverty Bay area. ===Personal life=== Bill (Wiremu) Te Whata married Irene Mary Potaka on June 25, 1924. They had 3 children, Douglas William Te Whata who was born on April 7, 1928, Clarence Clair Te Whata, and Philip Te Whata. After retiring from rugby league Te Whata spent many years involved in sport such as Athletics and cycling in the Poverty Bay area as well as being on the Tokomaru Bay Public School committee. On February 7, 1945 Bill Te Whaka‚Äôs brother Johnny died as the result of an accident in Gisborne. His death notice in the Gisborne Herald stated that he was the ‚Äúbeloved son of Edward and Repeka Te Whata, of Hokianga‚Äù and was aged 40 years. He was driving a tractor along the river bank between Peel Street and Lowe Street when under the employ of the Gisborne Borough Council. The tractor rolled over and pinned him underneath it. He was said to have come to live on the East Coast after leaving Hokianga 23 years earlier with a party of NgƒÅpuhi bushfellers. His funeral took place at Poho-o-rawiri Pa, Kaiti on February 10. ===Death=== Bill Te Whata died on 19 September 1957 aged 64. ==References== Category:MƒÅori All Blacks players Category:New Zealand rugby league players Category:New Zealand national rugby league team players Category:New Zealand MƒÅori rugby league players Category:Auckland rugby league team players Category:1893 births Category:1957 deaths ","title":"Bill Te Whata"},{"id":"63772380","text":"Hezekiah Ranney Dewey (April 14, 1838?) was a Michigan politician. ==Early life== Dewey was born on April 14, 1838 in Rochester, New York. ==Career== Dewey was a farmer for most of his life.

It continued to expand and by the early 2000s it had a 2000 square foot premises; it has by now largely taken over the Cornstore Mall. ==Style== Charlie Byrne's is spread across multiple floors of the Cornstore. It avails of publisher's overstock to provide new books at a reduced price, though these are carefully chosen. It sources books from university presses and foreign publishers to provide titles not otherwise often found in Irish bookshops.

B 2, 1841‚Äì1851, Holy Cross Church, Bergen. was a Norwegian mezzo-soprano and voice teacher. ==Family== Camilla Wiese was the daughter of the Indonesian military surgeon Erling Anton Onthong Wiese (1799‚Äì1860) and Catharina Petronelle Albrechtsen (1805‚Äì1850). She was the sister of the actress Helene Wiese (1828‚Äì1862), who was married to the actor Jacob Prom, and the singer Eugenie Wiese Rosenkilde (1837‚Äì1909). Camilla Wiese did not marry and she had no descendants. ==Career== Wiese appeared at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm on May 28 and June 2, 1873 in the role of Nancy in Martha by Friedrich von Flotow. In March and April 1874 she performed at the same venue as Pierotto in Linda di Chamounix by Gaetano Donizetti. Wiese performed at the theater in Bergen in 1874, and received an engagement at the Christiania Theatre in 1875, where she performed as Hedwige in Gioachino Rossini's opera Wilhelm Tell. She received a state scholarship and used this to travel to Paris, where she studied under Pauline Viardot. At the first performance of Henrik Ibsen's play in verse Peer Gynt at the Christiania Theatre, Camilla Wiese, Amalie D√∏vle, and Hanna Ehn played the three alpine dairymaids. The premiere took place on February 24, 1876. More memorably, she is said to have later hid behind the curtains in Act Four and performed \\"Solveig's Song\\" because Thora Hansson, who played the role of Solveig, had a rather rough voice. Hansson sat on a rock and lip-synced while the audience wondered how she was able to sing with such a clear voice. It was the head of the Ibsen Museum in Oslo, Erik Henning Edvardsen, who told the author Lucinda Riley in the 2010s how Wiese stood in the curtains and performed Hansson's song. The story thus took its fictionalized literary form in the novel The Storm Sister. Throughout her career, Wiese held a number of concerts in Norway. She was particularly noted as a performer of Romantic songs and a singer at church concerts, and she was dubbed Norges st√∏rste romansesangerinne 'Norway's greatest Romantic singer'. Wiese was a soloist at the celebration of Edvard Grieg's 25th anniversary as a pianist and composer in Kristiania with two concerts on November 14 and 21, 1891. Other performers at the concert were Ellen Gulbranson, Thorvald Lammers, the choir of the Oslo Music Society, the Choir Society, the Christiania Theatre Orchestra, the Tivoli Orchestra, and Johan Hennum as concertmaster. Edvard Grieg conducted the concerts himself. ==References== Category:Norwegian operatic mezzo-sopranos Category:Musicians from Bergen Category:1845 births Category:1938 deaths ","title":"Camilla Wiese"},{"id":"63772708","text":"Vinh is the capital of Ngh·ªá An Province in Vietnam.

In 1974, he graduated with a degree in organic engineering at the Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko University of Technology in Krak√≥w. He enjoyed success in his field of chemistry and claims to have taken out several \\"profitable\\" chemistry-related patents over the years. Wegrzyn has served on the board of directors of Gamrat SA, one of Poland's largest manufacturers of plastics, and has also served as the president of Organika Vilniu in Lithuania. In 1993, became the founder and the first president of the Union of Employers of Defense and Aviation Industry Enterprises. From 10 May 10, 1996 to 17 November 1997, he served as Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of National Defence, responsible for armaments and infrastructure. As deputy defense minister, he played a key role in preparing Poland to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) by buying weapons from the Western nations. His notable act as deputy defense minister was to buy 29 PT-91 Twardy tanks from the state-owned defense company Bumar. In 1996, during a visit to the United States to purchase American aircraft for the Polish Air Force, he stated: \\"We simply cannot afford to buy arms in such a way that we just take cash out of the bank. The euphoria of suddenly getting modern aircraft has subsided. We have now become very calculating.\\" In 1997, he stated it would cost the Treasury some 10 billion zlotys per year for the next five years to make the Polish armed forces ready for NATO, but that he had only a tenth of what was required, thus requiring careful investments. Wegrzyn stated his focus was on improving command and control in the armed forces by buying communications gear compatible with other NATO forces. After leaving public office, he became a manager in TopGaN, a company that produces specialized lasers. In 2005, Wegrzyn was named in a public letter by the Sejm MP Zygmunt Wrzodak concerning allegations of financial improprieties. Wegrzyn is active in the defense industry and has attracted controversy by investing in Rosevar Holdings, a company registered in Cyprus, which was managed by the arms dealer Pierre Dadak. Besides for being Dadak's business partner, Wegrzyn has been described in the media as his patron who introduced him to influential figures. From October 2014 onward, Dadak who lived in Ibiza was under investigation by the Spanish National Police Corps under the suspicion of fraud, money laundering and gunrunning into South Sudan (which placed under a European Union embargo in 2011). Dadak's phone was taped and police records showed that he often called Wegrzyn. In one phone call, Dadak told Wegrzyn \\"The merchandise is there and we can act\\" and spoke about \\"cars and ammunition\\". In an interview, Wegrzyn denied that he still doing business with Dadak or being involved in gunrunning into the South Sudanese civil war; when asked what the phone calls were about, Wegrzyn claimed not to remember. In March 2017, an investigation was started concerning allegations of internal theft at Bumar. The investigators believe that the stolen arms may have been sold by Rosevar Holdings. The investigators received threatening text messages warning both they and their families would be killed if they did not cease the investigation.The investigators believe that the stolen arms may have been sold by Rosevar Holdings. Wegrzyn has been described in media reports as an associate of Dadak with Newsweek Polska writing: \\"Throughout Pierre Dadak's activity in Poland and his work for Bumar, Wƒôgrzyn was somewhere next to him.

He was the 4th generation of well known klezmer dynasty in Ia»ôi; his father, Avram David Bughici, was a violinist, and his grandfather a cellist. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the Bughici klezmer family was among the most well known in the region (alongside the Segal and Lemish dynasties); they were highly in demand for wedding and Jewish theatre performances and often toured in Balkan countries and in Istanbul. (Another member of the Bughici family, Simion Bughici, became involved in Communist politics and was the Romanian Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1952‚Äì55.) Bughici studied music at the Ia»ôi Conservatory from 1935 to 1938 under such instructors as Alexandru Zirra, Antonin Ciolan, and Radu Constantinescu.

The early activities of the monks of Villeneuve included helping to drain the surrounding marshes, with advice from engineers of the Poitevin Marshes, and also helping to dig a canal between Messan and the Loire. The abbey's church was consecrated on 25 October 1223, when the bodies of Constance, her last husband Guy of Thouars (died 1213), and their daughter Alix (died 1221), were transferred into it, with √âtienne de La Bru√®re, Bishop of Nantes, officiating, supported by Guillaume de Beaumont, Bishop of Angers, in the presence of several important noblemen, including Aimery VII of Thouars and Amaury of Craon, Viscount of Beaumont, Seneschal of Angers.

As with other monasteries, this hastened the decline. The new commendatory abbots received about half of the monastery's income, leaving less for the monks, who now had a lower status, and fewer remained. Jean d'Estr√©es, in office from 1677, was the first abbot of this new kind.Historical at abbayedevilleneuve.com, accessed 27 April 2020 In 1726, the Abbot of Villeneuve had an annual income of ten thousand livres, equivalent to 417 Louis d'or. In 1789, during the French Revolution, with only eight monks remaining, Claude-Fran√ßois Lysarde de Radonvilliers, the last commendatory abbot, died, and the abbey was immediately nationalized and sold. The eight monks, who included a prior and a sub-prior, were all priests and all remained in the parish of le Bignon.Charles Dugast-Matifeux, Nantes ancien et le pays nantais, p. 68 The buyer of the abbey's agricultural land and buildings was a M. Blanchard, Clerk of the Presidial court of Nantes. The new owner was only interested in the abbey's land and its former hostelry, which he put into use as a house, and speedily demolished the Abbey church. However, Blanchard was soon disturbed by the War in the Vend√©e, when Villeneuve was turned into a stronghold of the Whites and was attacked by the Blues, its buildings burned out, and the trees surrounding the property cut down. Many tombs were profaned, and the human remains in them scattered. Blanchard returned after the war and restored the hostelry, dating from the early 18th century, renaming it ‚Äúch√¢teau de Villeneuve‚Äù. This is still the present main house, but is much altered since the time of the monks. Abandoned since the Second World War, it was restored in 1977 and is now a luxury hotel and restaurant.

Her main area of expertise is philosophy of science, in particular philosophy of modern physics. == Education and career == Ben-Menahem earned a B.Sc. in physics and mathematics in 1969 and an M.Sc. (summa cum laude) in philosophy of science in 1972, both from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. She earned her PhD in 1983 with a dissertation entitled \\"Paradoxes and Intuitions\\", under the direction of Hilary Putnam of Harvard University and Mark Steiner of the Hebrew University. In 2001, Ben-Menahem founded the Journal Aleph: Historical Studies in Science and Judaism, which is a biannual, peer-reviewed academic publication. She served as Director of the Edelstein Center for the History and Philosophy of Science, Technology and Medicine at the Hebrew University. Since 2006, she has been member of the Academic Board of the Einstein Papers Project. In 2007, she curated the exhibition Newton's Secrets at the National Library of Israel. == Philosophical work == ===Conventionalism=== Ben-Menahem devoted several papers and a book to conventionalism, a position first articulated by Henri Poincar√© in the context of geometry. According to conventionalists, many of the assertions we take to express objective truths, are in fact conventions in disguise, derived from definitions or methodological decisions that are not forced on us by logic, mathematics, or empirical fact, and about which we have discretion. Ben-Menahem reads twentieth century science and philosophy from the perspective of the impact of conventionalism on these fields. The pronounced influence of conventionalism, according to her, is manifest in the philosophy of logic and mathematics, the theory of relativity, and the writings of leading twentieth century philosophers including Carnap, Wittgenstein, Putnam, and Quine. ===Causation=== In Causation in Science, Ben- Menahem offers a novel account of causation, centered on the notion of causal constraint rather than the common notion of causal relation. The book analyses the interrelations between constraints such as determinism, locality, conservation laws, and variation principles. In response to the classic problem of human freedom, Ben-Menahem expounds a concept of lawlessness that permits human action to be subject to causes, without being derivable from, and predictable by, laws of nature. ===The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics=== Ben-Menahem addresses several controversial issues in the history and philosophy of quantum mechanics. She analyses the relation between quantum nonlocality and indeterminism, arguing that the payoff relation between these characteristics secures the compatibility of quantum mechanics with the special theory of relativity. She takes issue with the common understanding of the PBR theorem and with the received account of Schr√∂dinger's position and the Bohr-Einstein controversy. ===The Philosophy of History=== Ben-Menahem sees the notion of contingency as crucial to the philosophy of history and to the possibility for human beings to make a difference in the course of historical events. Her analysis of the concepts of necessity and contingency in history draws on an analogy with the notions of stability and instability in science, where they play a prominent role in many areas, for instance, statistical mechanics and chaos theory. ===General Philosophy of Science=== One of the most debated subjects in contemporary philosophy of science is scientific realism, a position committed to the possibility of scientific truth and scientific knowledge. Realism is commended by its proponents as the only philosophy that can explain the impressive success of science and critiqued by its opponents for disregarding the underdetermination of science as well as its numerous failures. Ben-Menahem contributions to the debate around realism include her critique of the argument from success, her analysis of underdetermination and equivalent descriptions, her defense of the pragmatist concept of truth, and her highlighting the description-sensitivity of scientific laws. ===Interpretative Work=== Ben-Menahem has written on (among others) Jorge Luis Borges, Donald Davidson, Michel Foucault, William James, Emil Meyerson, Henri Poincar√©. == Books == Conventionalism (Cambridge University Press, 2006) Causation in Science (Princeton University Press, 2018) === Books edited === Hilary Putnam (Cambridge University Press, 2005) Probability in Physics (with Meir Hemmo) (Springer, 2012) == Selected articles == * \\"Natural Laws and Human Language\\" in Engaging Putnam J.

After Pym's death, her literary executors were her sister, Hilary Pym, and her good friend and fellow novelist Hazel Holt. They aimed to release much of Pym's unpublished material. This included three complete novels, An Unsuitable Attachment, Crampton Hodnet and An Academic Question. Pym's notebooks and diaries were published in 1984. Civil to Strangers and other Writings was the final volume released, collecting some of her remaining material. It was released by Macmillan in England, and E.P. Dutton in the United States, both in 1987. The volume contains one full-length novel, three incomplete novellas, and a transcript of a radio talk, as well as four short stories. Civil to Strangers was positively reviewed by the New York Times O'Conner, Patricia T., Romance Comes Up Callow, New York Times, 17 January 1988,retrieved 26 April 2020 as a volume that \\"can take its place alongside [Pym's] others with no apology\\". Anita Brookner, reviewing for The Spectator, found the early novels to be \\"formulaic\\" but praised Pym's distinctive voice.Brookner, Anita, A Singular Voice, The Spectator, 30 July 2011, retrieved 26 April 2020 The collection was published in France in 1989 as Adam et Cassandra in Italy in 1999 as Tutte le virt√π (All the Virtues), and in 2019 in Spain as Extranjeros, bienvenidos (Welcome, Foreigners). ==Contents== ===Civil to Strangers=== Civil to Strangers was written in 1936, with the working title of Adam and Cassandra. Pym's first novel, Some Tame Gazelle had been rejected by publishers in 1935. She felt that Civil to Strangers was not \\"really as good as Some Tame Gazelle but it may stand a better chance of getting accepted\\". The novel's title is taken from a poem, The Choice, by 17th century English poet John Pomfret. Each chapter of the novel features an epigraph using quotes from the 1730 poem cycle The Seasons by James Thomson. The novel is set primarily in a village in Shropshire where the obscure novelist Adam Marsh-Gibbon lives a routine life with his overly-doting wife Cassandra, who has put her needs second to ensure his career, although it is her family money on which they live. A handsome and single Hungarian man, Stefan Tilos, arrives in town, creating an aura of romance in the dull lives of the villagers, including Cassandra. When Stefan returns home, a feeling of yearning remains. As their desires follow separate paths, Adam takes a holiday to Oxford for research while Cassandra travels solo to Budapest. Cassandra's solo travel - as a woman in the 1930s - causes consternation among some of her acquaintances, and Adam is forced to realise how much he needs his wife, pursuing her to Hungary. The climactic scenes in Budapest were inspired by a visit Pym took to the city with her sister Hilary in 1935. ===Gervase and Flora=== Pym wrote Gervase and Flora in 1938. The novel is set primarily in Finland, telling the story of two young English people traveling in the country. It was based on the travels of Henry Harvey, a man whom Pym had had a relationship during the 1930s, and with whom she regularly exchanged letters. Pym finished the draft of the novel however when she learned that Harvey had married in late 1938, she put it aside, not wanting to work on it further due to her strong feelings. Pym did not title the novel; this was done by Holt after Pym's death.Pym 1987, p.173 The completed manuscript was 216 pages, however the volume only includes polished excerpts, rendering this a novella. ===\\"Home Front Novel\\"=== Pym wrote this unfinished, untitled novel in 1939. The 28-year-old Pym had finished studying at St Hilda's College, Oxford and returned home to Oswestry to live with her parents and participate in voluntary work before and during the commencement of World War II. The novel chronicles life in a village during 1939, based on Pym's own experiences as she was writing. Holt 1990, pp.76-77 Pym abandoned the manuscript to write Crampton Hodnet in 1940, and was then distracted by her war service, leaving the manuscript finished. In the 1960s, she considered updating the manuscript, since she thought its wartime setting might be attractive to publishers, but ultimately did no more work on it.Pym 1987, p.218 The incomplete manuscript is 195 pages, however this volume only includes polished excerpts from it. ===So Very Secret=== Pym's only spy novel, So Very Secret features an ordinary unmarried woman, Cassandra Swan, who is the daughter of an Anglican canon. When Cassandra's friend Harriet disappears, Cassandra discovers that her friend did secret work for the Foreign Office, and sets out to find her, becoming entangled in an espionage plot amongst the usual Pym cast of priests and academics.Holt 1990, p.99 Pym wrote the novel while living in Oswestry in 1940 and 1941. However, she found herself struggling with the need for such a strong plot, writing in a letter that \\"I don't quite know what I'm driving at\\".Pym 1984, p.95 It was the observational humour that was most notable about the text. Pym completed the first draft, however she had to register for formal military service in October 1941, and had no more time to write due to her war service.Pym 1987, pp.271-272 The complete manuscript is 227 pages, however this volume only includes polished excerpts. The story was adapted for BBC Radio 4 in 1998 BBC Genome Listings, accessed 1 May 2020 ===Short Stories=== This volume includes four of Pym's 27 short stories. Her complete manuscripts are collected in the archives at the Bodleian Library, but most were incomplete or not of a finished quality. Holt selected the strongest stories.A Few Green Leaves: The Journal of the Barbara Pym Society, Vol 11, No. 1, May 2005 * So, Some Tempestuous Morn - unpublished short story from the 1950s. This features the characters of Miss Morrow and Miss Doggett, who had previously featured in the 1940 novel Crampton Hodnet (not published in Pym's lifetime), and would be resurrected for her third published novel, Jane and Prudence. * The Christmas Visit - commissioned for The Church Times in December 1978. This novel features the characters of Mark and Sophia Ainger, and their cat Faustina, who were the lead roles in Pym's novel An Unsuitable Attachment, which had been rejected for publication in 1963 and was only published after her death. * Goodbye Balkan Capital - unpublished short story from 1941. Pym submitted the story to Penguin New Writing but it was rejected. It was inspired by a news article about life in Belgrade during the War. * Across a Crowded Room - commissioned by The New Yorker in July 1979. This story includes an appearance by the American character Ned, who first appeared in Pym's 1978 novel The Sweet Dove Died. ===Finding a Voice=== A transcript of a radio talk given by Pym on BBC Radio 3 on 4 April 1978. Pym discusses the circumstances of finding her authorial voice during her early success (1950-1961) and the challenge of being asked to change her voice, when her novels started being rejected by publishers in the 1960s. She also recounts her \\"rediscovery\\" in 1977, that led to her fame and international success. ==Footnotes== Category:1987 British novels Category:Novels by Barbara Pym ","title":"Civil to Strangers"},{"id":"63773457","text":"A portrait sketch, 1842 Emilio Joaquim da Silva Maia (8 September 1808 ‚Äì 21 November 1859) was a Brazilian physician and naturalist who founded the Vellosiana Society which ran the first journal in the region that carried notes on natural history, O Guanabara. He was also one of the founders of the Instituto Hist√≥rico e Geogr√°fico Brasileiro. Silva Maia was born in Salvador, son of Joaquim Jos√© da Silva Maia a Portuguese trader and Knight of the Order of Christ. The Brazilian struggle for independence led the family to move to Porto and Silva Maia received a bachelor's degree from the University of Coimbra in January 1824. Even before the Liberal Wars he fought alongside the constitutionalists against the absolutists and he was forced to flee when the constitution was revoked and returned to Brazil in 1829. He soon returned to Europe to the University of Paris to study medicine and received a degree in 1833 with a dissertation titled Essai sur les dangers de l'allaitement par les nourrices. In 1834 he became a member of the Academy of Medicine in Rio de Janeiro and was a full professor in the Col√©gio Pedro II. He became director of comparative anatomy and zoology at the National Museum in 1842. He also edited the Minerva Brasiliense periodical. He helped reorganize the museum. He played a major role in fighting deforestation in Rio de Janeiro and saw the value of mangroves. He corresponded with Geoffroy and Isidore Saint-Hilaire on matters of natural history. The hummingbird species Polytmus theresiae was described and named by Silva Maria in an article in the Minerva Brasiliense. He named the species after the Empress of Portugal. He also edited a journal called O Guanabara from 1849 to 1850 which was an eclectic mix of literary pieces and scientific essays. The journal ran into trouble after a yellow fever outbreak. Influenced by Georges Cuvier, under whom he had studied, he sought to explain biogeographic patterns based on initial Creation followed by dispersal of organisms within limits set by the habitats of species. He also accepted the view that cataclysmic events had caused many species to go extinct. He accepted Humboldt's idea that there were more species in the tropics. He also recognized the endemism of groups such as hummingbirds and tried to explain it in terms of species creation in multiple geographic centres, recognizing 14 of them based on the work of De Candolle and Karl Willdenow. Silva Maria did not read many English language works and died a few days before the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species. Silva Maia died just in 1859 and was buried at Sao Francisco de Paula cemetery. == References == == External links == * Discurso sobre os males que tem produzido no Brasil (1835) (Discussions on forest destruction in Brazil) * Elogio Historico do illustre Jose Bonifacio de Andrada e Silva (1838) Category:Brazilian physicians Category:Brazilian naturalists Category:1808 births Category:1859 deaths ","title":"Emilio Joaquim da Silva Maia"},{"id":"63773464","text":"The Landwind CV9, sometimes also called Landwind Fashion, is a compact MPV produced by the Chinese manufacturer Landwind.

The album was released in July 2000. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001, the album was nominated for ARIA Award for Best World Music Album. The Times voted the album as 'Best Pop Album of 2000. ==Reception== Diana Potts from AllMusic said \\"Translated, most of the songs on Serious Tam are about the common themes of daily life and passionate love. This a definite global pop album with an ethnic twist. Serious Tam's tribal drum sounds and simplicity will take the listener to a better, more serene place.\\" Josef Woodard from Jazz Times said \\"Producer David Bridie brings Telek into popish relief, layering on guitars, backbeats and synth sounds on the album Serious Tam. A singer of no small talents, Telek shows his interest in exploring indigenous roots, but there are genuine Beatlesque roots, as well, and enough echoes of Peter Gabriel to make one wonder about a trickle-down 'company sound' over at Realworld. Most of the lyrics are in the Tolai tongue, Kuanuan and Tok Pisin (Pidgin English) and recount the life of the Tolai people, then and now.\\" In a review by The Times, the reviewer said \\"One phenomenal song follows another...Telek's voice on its own is a thing of rare beauty...a magical album\\". Li Robbins said \\"Telek takes the music of Papua New Guinea's Tolai people, and updates it with keyboards, electric bass and guitar, and ambient sounds. The hybrid is for the most part executed with a sure hand, excepting the track Waitpela Gras, where vestiges of prog rock suddenly make an unwelcome visit -- a heavy-handedness sadly all too regular a feature of Realworld recordings. Overall though, it's charming, and sweetly evocative music.\\" Billboard said \\"The songs speak of common experiences, love, and magic charms. Once some conventional, and not-so-conventional, Western instrumentation was added to this music, the arrangements emerged as a very appealing traditional/world pop fusion.\\" ==Track listing== # \\"Midal\\" - 4:12 # \\"Bunaik\\" - 5:13 # \\"To Pol\\" - 4:05 # \\"Serious Tam\\" - 2:14 # \\"Boystown\\" - 4:48 # \\"Iamagit\\" - 2:35 # \\"Barturana (Duke of Yorks)\\" - 3:10 # \\"Tolili\\" - 2:19 # \\"Balamaris\\" - 4:04 # \\"Go Ralom\\" - 3:43 # \\"Tolili Kundu\\" - 2:27 # \\"Waitpela Gras\\" - 3:02 # \\"Lili\\" - 4:18 # \\"Tutana Kuraip\\" - 2:43 # \\"Talaigu\\" - 2:26 # \\"Ririwon\\" - 1:46 # \\"Sori Tru\\" - 3:31 (Australian only bonus track) # \\"Paska\\" - 3:22 (Australian only bonus track) # \\"Paliwo\\" - 3:35 (Australian only bonus track) ==Release history== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Region ! scope=\\"col\\" Date ! scope=\\"col\\" Format ! scope=\\"col\\" Label ! scope=\\"col\\" Catalogue -  Australia  17 July 2000   ORIGiN  OR055 -  United States  August 2000   Real World Records  CDRW90 } ==References== Category:2000 albums ","title":"Serious Tam"},{"id":"63773483","text":"Ron Stehouwer (February 4, 1937 ‚Äì January 18, 2007) was an American football guard.

Brault served in the U.S. Navy in the North Atlantic during World War II. == Career == After his military service, Brault settled in Fairfax, Virginia, and represented insurance companies in his legal practice. He became active in the Democratic Party as well as the local bar association and was president of the Fairfax Bar Association when appointed to the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in 1962. In 1965 Brault won election to the Virginia Senate, so that he and Omer Hirst both represented Fairfax County in the (multi-member) 24th senatorial district, and both were re-elected in 1967 and John N. Beall Jr. also added to the Fairfax county delegation following court decisions which required Virginia districts to represent roughly equal number of voters (contrary to the Byrd Organization redistrictings which led to under-representation in the growing northern Virginia suburbs of northern Virginia).https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/search/year_from:1965/year_to:1985/office_id:9/district_id:27287 Brault continued to win re-election, although the creation of single member districts for the 1971 election changed the number of his district to the 34th and he faced Republican opponents.https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/search/year_from:1965/year_to:1985/office_id:9/district_id:27297 Fellow Democratic state senators elected Brault as their majority leader in 1976, but he only held that position for four years, succeeded by fellow (but more conservative) Democrat Hunter Andrews of the state's Hampton Roads region in 1980. Although sometimes at odds with fellow Fairfax Democrat Clive DuVal, Brault cooperated extensively with fellow state senator Omer Hirst to construct the Dulles Toll Road, which was completed in 1984 and officially renamed to honor both men in 1991 (although the lengthy name never became popular among commuters).

It was fought between the Maratha Empire led by Sambhaji and Siddis of Janjira, allies of the Mughal Empire. Maratha emperor Sambhaji personally besieged the fort of Janjira in 1682 to stop Siddi's intrusions into Maratha Territories and to capture the strategically important fort of Janjira. == Background == Mughal emperor Aurangzeb had arrived in the Deccan to conquer the Deccan Plateau in 1681. His first goal was to conquer the newly established Maratha Empire in Maharashtra. Aurangzeb wanted to encircle the Maratha Empire from all sides. He ordered his allies and enemies of Maratha Empire such as Siddis of Janjira, Wodeyars of Mysore and Portuguese of Goa to attack the Maratha Empire. The Siddis of Janjira responded and started plundering Maratha countryside from Pen to Roha. Siddis took many villagers as slaves and they were sold in the slave market of Mumbai. Siddis destroyed the crops, pulverized the region and raped women in these villages. The Siddis defeated and killed 80 Maratha soldiers in a battle at Underi. In addition Sambhaji knew the strategic importance of Janjira, he had an ambition to capture it. Hence, Sambhaji decided to capture Janjira personally. == Plan of Marathas == Sambhaji had planned to win Janjira by ruse, he had sent a party in early 1681 under the leadership of senior Maratha General Kondaji Farzand under the pretext of a fake fight with Sambhaji. Kondaji and his men told Siddi about their fight with Sambhaji and asked for a post in his army. Siddi Khairiyat was happy at the defection of Kondaji at his side. The Siddi brothers made Kondaji a sardar in their army. But actually Sambhaji had sent Kondaji and his men to light the ammunition storage on the fort in order to capture the fort. == Siege of Janjira == Sambhaji personally attacked Janjira in 1682. He had a 20,000 strong army, 300 ships of the Maratha navy and Maratha artillery assisting him. Maratha admirals Mainak Bhandari, Dariya Sarang and Daulat Khan were commanding the navy. Arab admiral Jange Khan was also helping the Marathas. Siddi forces in the Maratha territories retreated to Janjira fort after seeing such a large army. Sambhaji recaptured the villages surrounding Janjira. Sambhaji then launched a fierce attack on Janjira. Maratha artillery started to damage the fort walls. The Siddis were also responding strongly with their artillery. Meanwhile, on the Janjira fort, Kondaji and his men were looking for an opportunity to light the ammunition storage on the fort so as to allow Sambhaji to attack the fort using the ensuing panic on the fort. However one of the female defectors involved in the plot told about the plan to Siddi Khairiyat. The Siddis immediately arrested and beheaded Kondaji and his party. Only two members of the party made it back to Sambhaji's camp on the shore. 300 ships of the Maratha navy were trying to attack the fort but the strong artillery of Siddis somehow managed to defend the fort. Both sides had suffered great losses and nobody was able to gain an upper hand. Sambhaji had maintained a constant pressure on Janjira and his artillery managed to inflict heavy damage to the fort walls. The siege continued for thirty days. Maratha Navy had blockaded Janjira from three sides cutting of any supplies to the fort. Maratha forces started constructing a bridge from shoreline to the fort. The bridge had started to take shape. Siddis were caught in a dire situation and were battling a severe food shortage. The Siddis realised that if the same situation continues for a few days then Sambhaji will capture the fort in a matter of 4‚Äì5 days. Hence they pleaded to Aurangzeb for help. Aurangzeb was well aware of the strategic importance of Janjira. He immediately sent his General Husain Ali Khan to destroy Kalyan and Bhiwandi regions with a 35,000 strong force to divert Sambhaji's attack on Janjira. Husain Ali Khan destroyed Kalyan and Bhiwandi was threatening to attack Raigad, the Maratha Capital. Sambhaji had almost captured Janjira but he was forced to retreat from Janjira to check Husain Ali Khan's advance. In absence of Sambhaji his naval commander Dadaji Raghunath Deshpande of Mahad took control of the siege. Sambhaji later on defeated and pushed back Husain Ali Khan to Ahmadnagar but Janjira was saved due to his advance on Kalyan-Bhiwandi. Sambhaji was unable to capture the Janjira fort. Nevertheless, he was able to inflict heavy damage to fort. It was an important strategic victory for the Marathas as the Siddis stopped their activities in the Maratha territories and never ventured against the Marathas in Sambhaji's reign. == Aftermath == Siddis had suffered great losses in the siege. They got to know about the superior strength of the Marathas under Sambhaji. They decided not to venture out against the Marathas. In the next few years Aurangzeb repeatedly pleaded them to open a campaign against the Marathas but the Siddis were not ready to fight against the Marathas. == See also == Mughal-Maratha Wars Sambhaji Murud Janjira Battles involving the Maratha Empire == References == Category:Conflicts in 1682 Category:Battles involving the Maratha Empire Category:Battles fought by Marathas under Sambhaji ","title":"Siege of Janjira (1682)"},{"id":"63773590","text":"Reverend William J. Watkins, Sr. (1803 1858) was a Black abolitionist, educator, and minister from Baltimore, Maryland. == Early life == Watkins was born in 1803 in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of William Watkins, a founding trustee of the Sharp Street Methodist Church. Watkins attended the Bethel Charity School, which Daniel Coker founded as a school for Black children in 1807, despite Maryland laws forbidding the education of Black people. At the age of 19, Watkins became a teacher at the school. This followed the departure of Coker to be part of the colonization movement, moving to Liberia. == Personal life == Watkins married Henrietta Russell in the mid-1820s. Following the death of her family, Watkins and Russell raised his niece, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, exposing her to ideas of abolition, and also teaching her in his school until the age of 13. Watkins and Russell had eight children, including William J. (1826), Richard R. (1827), George T. (1828), John L. (1831), Henry G. (1834), Henrietta (1836), Robert P. (1841), and Lloyd N. (1845). William J., like his father, became a prominent abolitionist, at one time writing for Frederick Douglass's The North Star. In 1852, Watkins moved to Toronto, Canada, followed by his son William J.. He died in Canada in 1858. Watkins also raised his niece Francis Ellen Watkins Harper (orphaned at a young age), who became one of the co-founders of the American Women's Suffrage Association (AWS) during the mainstream Women's Suffrage Movement, in 1869. Francis was also an accomplished and well published African American poet. == Career == Watkins is noted as having had a variety of positions, including teacher, newspaper correspondent, minister for the Sharp Street A.M.E. Church, founder of a Black Literary Society, and a \\"self-taught practitioner of medicine.\\" As a teacher, Watkins merged the Bethel Charity and Sharp Street schools, creating Watkins' Academy for Negro Youth, between 1820 and 1828. It ran for over twenty years, providing free education for Black children, teaching between 50 and 70 students per year. Watkins' work as a teacher and abolitionist were tied together, holding the conviction that education was essential in the freedom of African Americans. == Abolition work == Watkins was a staunch slavery abolitionist, as well as an opponent to the colonization movement, whose proposed solution to slavery was to send Black people back to Africa in order to Christianize Africa. He wrote antislavery and anti- colonization pieces, presented in writing and as speeches, making points that the colonization movement was more to serve white people than it was to free Black people. With his work beginning in the 1820s and continuing until the end of his life, his writings appeared in Freedom's Journal, William Lloyd Garrison's The Liberator, Benjamin Lundy's Genius of Universal Emancipation, and, later in life, Frederick Douglass's The North Star. Watkins met Garrison shortly before he began The Liberator, shaping Garrison's views on colonization. Watkins would later become a subscription agent for The Liberator, which helped spread abolitionist ideas within Baltimore. == Legacy == Watkins is the namesake of The William J. Watkins, Sr. Educational Institute, whose stated mission is to \\"ensure that ALL children, especially those in under-served and under-resourced communities, receive the BEST education possible.\\" ==References== Category:1803 births Category:1858 deaths Category:American abolitionists Category:African-American educators Category:African-American religious leaders Category:African-American writers Category:African-American history in Baltimore ","title":"William J.
