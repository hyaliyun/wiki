The tour supported his sixth studio album, Blurred Lines (2013). The tour traveled to North America and Europe, playing over 30 concerts. ==Background== Thicke first mentioned tour shortly following the release of the album. He stated he wanted to spend of the rest of the year promoting the album internationally. The end of 2013 saw the singer performing at many radio festivals, followed by a guest spot on Maroon 5's 2014 UK tour. The tour was announced in September 2013. Before the tour began, it was faced it many challenges. In January 2014, opening act Jessie J dropped out of the tour, stating she wanted to focus on making new music. The following month, the singer revealed his separation from this wife, Paula Patton. Shortly after, the first three shows of the tour was rescheduled, citing vocal stress as the reasoning. Thicke was photographed in Canada and Disneyland during the cancelled shows. The tour kicked off Fairfax, Virginia. At each show, Thicke dedicated \\"Lost Without U\\" to his estranged wife. The Humanists of Boston University petitioned to have Thicke's concert at the Agganis Arena cancelled. The group stated the album's lead single promoted misogyny and rape culture. The university responded the school is not in correlation with the concert, with the show being organized by Live Nation. The group created a petition on Change.org, getting over a three-thousand signatures. The concert proceeded as scheduled, with the group stating a small protest outside the arena. During a break in the tour, Thicke recorded his next studio album, Paula. This saw the singer adding songs from the new album to the tour's setlist. The album was released in July 2014 and performed poorly. ==Opening acts== *DJ Cassidy *K.

In order to understand patternation, we need to consider the role sprays play in our daily lives.Prociw, Lev Alexander., Shafique, Harris.& Fiset, Patrice. (2007). Method of Computing Spray Parameters from Optical Patternation. US 2007/0242871 A1. http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&lr;=&vid;=USPATAPP11386941&id;=ywKlAAAAEBAJ&oi;=fnd&dq;=definition+of+patternation&printsec;=abstract#v=onepage&q;&f;=false == Uses of sprays == Sprays have a number of uses. In its natural form, sprays appear in waterfall mists, rains and ocean sprays, according to Arthur Lefebvre, in his book, Atomization and Sprays. Within the household sphere, sprays are used in showers, garden hoses, spray paint cans, hair spray, deodorant sprays and more. Industrial uses of sprays include spray drying, coating, washing, and irrigating. Sprays are also used in many internal combustion engines to directly disperse the fuel into the combustion chamber and mix it with air so that either spontaneously ignite under high pressure and temperatures or they can be ignited using spark plugs.Lefebvre, Arthur, H. (1989) Atomization and Sprays, NY: Taylor & Francis. ==Understanding the importance of spray patternation== Patternation of sprays is important in a variety of applications including IC engines, turbines, spray coating, spray drying, agriculture, and consumer products. For example, asymmetries in patternation directly affect surface finish quality during painting and poor product quality during spray drying.Ullom, M. J., and Sojka, P. E. (2001). \\"A Simple Optical Patternator for Evaluating Spray Symmetry,\\" Review of Scientific Instruments, vol. 72, pp. 2472-2477. Similarly, in gas turbines, variation in the spray pattern leads to fuel lean and fuel rich pockets resulting in excessive turbine wear and increased particulate emission.A. H. Lefebvre and J. Ortman. \\"Fuel distributions from pressure-swirl atomizers\\", Journal of Propulsion and Power, Vol. 1, No. 1 (1985), pp. 11-15. doi: 10.2514/3.22752 For metered-dose inhalers, the pattern of the spray is very important to ensure that the maximum amount of the drug goes through the throat passageways into the lungs.Smyth, H., Hickey, A. J., Brace, G., Barbour, T., Gallion, J., and Grove, J., (2006). Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm., vol. 32, pp. 1033-1041. In agricultural nozzles the pattern of the spray is important so as to optimize the delivery of pesticides and fertilizers to the plants. Spray drying requires that the droplet sizes be closely controlled. In general, increasing the total drop surface area within the dryer will lead to higher evaporation rates and greater efficiency for the process.Yudaya Sivathanu, Jongmook Lim, Henrik Linden and Preben Noerskov, \\"Pressure Effects on Drop Diameters and Surface Areas in Oil Nozzles,\\" ILASS Americas, 19th Annual Conference on Liquid Atomization and Spray Systems, Toronto, Canada, May 2006. Similarly, pharmaceutical tablets owe their thin film surface coating to an atomizer produced spray that needs to be perfect. The coating not only masks taste but also performs key functions such as sealing the tablet from moisture to improve shelf life, controlling drug release rates to get slow and extended release tablets.Muliadi, Ariel, R., & Sojka, Paul E. (2012). Nondimensional scaling laws for controlling pharmaceutical spray uniformity: Understanding and scale up. Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Vol. 101, 2213–2219 ==How scientists study spray patterns== Spray patterns are studied using diagnostic tools known as patternators. A patternator quantifies the spatial location of the drops emitted from a sprayer and visualizes the patterns of sprays. There are different types of patternators, mechanical and optical. == Mechanical patternators == Mechanical patternators are called intrusive patternators. They typically collect the mass flux of liquid in small containersBayvel, L, and Orzechowski, Z. (1993).

Proceedings of ILASS Americas, San Francisco, CA. pp. 328-330 that are then weighed to provide local information. Mechanical patternators are not very accurate and suffer from a number of systematic and random errors Ullom, M. J., and Sojka, P. E. (2001). “A Simple Optical Patternator for Evaluating Spray Symmetry,’ Review of Scientific Instruments, vol. 72, pp. 2472-2477. In addition, they interfere with the spray pattern itself, and are generally not suitable for obtaining accurate data on spray patterns. Photograph showing mechanical patternation being performed on a spray nozzle (Courtsey En’Urga Inc.) == Optical patternators == To avoid the errors in mechanical patternation, it is generally accepted that the patternation technique has to be optical. Picture of an Optical Patternator based on Laser Extinction Tomography. Optical patternators provide the distribution of drop surface areas rather than the mass flux. In many instances, this is advantageous as all local transfer phenomena, such as mass; momentum; energy and species are directly proportional to the surface area density of the droplets in the spray.Yudaya Sivathanu and Jongmook Lim, Paul G. Hicks. (2007). Optical and Mechanical Patternation of an High Flow Rate Industrial Gas Turbine Nozzle, ILASS Americas, 20th Annual Conference on Liquid Atomization and Spray Systems, Chicago, IL, May 2007 There are three principal types of optical patternators: (a) those that use laser sheets, (b)those that use planar liquid laser induced fluorescence and (c) those that use laser extinction tomography. === Using a laser sheet === The first is based on using a laser sheet to illuminate a plane orthogonal to the spray direction or along the spray direction and capturing the image of the scattered light using an off-axis camera.G.Wang, R.Deljouravesh, R.W.Sellens, M.J.Olesen, and M.F.Bardon, Proceedings of ILASSAmericas’97~ National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, ON, 1997, pp.261–265 It is assumed that the scattered intensity is proportional to the local drop surface area density. === Using planar liquid laser induced fluorescence === A second type of patternators are based on using planar liquid laser induced fluorescence. The liquid is mixed with some fluorescent material and illuminated with a high power laser sheet. The resulting fluorescence image is captured and analyzed to provide the local mass concentrations within the spray.D.Talley and J.Verdieck,(1996). Proceedings of ILASS Americas’96~ Coen Co., San Francisco, CA,1996, pp.33–37 Both these methods have significant errors due to laser extinction, signal attenuation, and secondary emissionC. T.

Accounting for Laser Extinction, Signal Attenuation, and Secondary Emission while Performing Optical Patternation in a Single Plane, Proceedings of ILASS Americas ’00, Madison, Wisconsin, pp. 195-199. === Using laser extinction tomography === The third set of optical patternators is based on laser extinction Ullom, M.

In 1852 he won the Prix de Rome (Belgium) for his painting Coriolanus at Rome and was able to spend four years studying in Italy. From 1862 to 1872, he was the Professor of History Painting at the Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School. Leon Pohle, Max Liebermann and Carl Rodeck were among his students there. This period was especially productive for him and he completed seven large wall panels at the Wartburg, depicting the life of Martin Luther. After a short stay in Belgium, he returned to Germany where he became a Professor at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. His students there included Ludwig von Hofmann, Osmar Schindler, Paul Thumann and Oskar Zwintscher. During this period he also executed six large historical wall panels at the Fürstenschule in Meissen. From 1870 to 1881, he produced what was considered his greatest work: twelve frescoes in the upper part of the Ypres Cloth Hall, which had been left incomplete by Charles de Groux. They depicted scenes of Ypres' history from 1187 to 1383. Unfortunately, these works (and most of the Cloth Hall) were destroyed during World War I. In 2000, the city of Ypres acquired six paintings by Pauwels for their Municipal Art Museum at a cost of 3,250,000 Belgian Francs (approximately 80,565 Euros) In 1930, Ekeren named a street in his honor and installed a memorial stone.Todtenschau.

Natural gas burns cleanly as a fuel, making it useful in many vehicles and applications such as cooking, heating or running generators. It contains mostly methane and ethane. These light gases have very high vapor pressure at ambient temperatures, and their storage requires either high-pressure compression, adsorbent systems or an extreme reduction of temperature. In the ANG process, natural gas adsorbs to a porous adsorbent at relatively low pressure (100 to 900 psi) and ambient temperature, solving both the high-pressure and low- temperature problems. If a suitable adsorbent is used, it is possible to store more gas in an adsorbent-filled vessel than in an empty vessel at the same pressure. The amount of adsorbed gas depends on pressure, temperature and adsorbent type. Since this adsorption process is exothermic, an increase in pressure or a decrease in temperature enhances the efficiency of the adsorption process. Activated carbon is an adsorbent with high surface area that can be used in ANG storage tanks. Currently, researchers are developing new adsorbents with higher adsorption ratio to optimize this process. ==References== Category:Natural gas storage ","title":"Adsorbed natural gas"},{"id":"42075660","text":"In signal processing, a filter's frequency response comprises regions of frequency called passbands, stopbands, and transition regions.

It raised $7.6 million in venture capital in its first round of financing. The company spent $1.6 million to secure a 30-second ad during Super Bowl XXXIV.

According to the 1936 Survey of London, a pub known as The Flask has stood on this spot since \\"at least as early as 1663\\". The present buildings probably date from the early 18th century, and were partially rebuilt in about 1767 by William Carpenter. A Manorial court met there in the eighteenth century. The Flask is currently owned and operated by the London-based Fuller's Brewery. ==History== The pub is believed to have been named after the flasks of Hampstead mineral water that could be purchased here when Hampstead was popular for its wells in the 18th century,Duncan, Andrew. (2006) Andrew Duncan's favourite London walks. London: New Holland Publishers, p. 80. and The Flask, Flask Walk, Hampstead, is another pub nearby.The Flask, Hampstead. Retrieved 1 March 2014. Like all good pubs, The Flask has its own legends which may or may not be true. It is said that the highwayman Dick Turpin hid from the law in the stables there, that the artist William Hogarth drank at the bar and even that Karl Marx was a customer. For good measure, the pub is also said by some to have a female ghost.Richard, Jones. (2007) Walking haunted London. London: New Holland Publishers, p. 43. Hibbert, Christopher. et al. (2008) \\"FLASK\\" The London encyclopaedia. 3rd edition. London: Macmillan, p. 296. It was also reported in 1736 a 64 year- old man, accompanied by a hairdresser, ran from the Bull's Head in St Giles to The Flask in just 45 minutes, \\"To the Surprize of every Body who was present\\". The pub was used in a Christmas 1995 television commercial for Carlsberg Lager, the 60-second film \\"Last Orders\\" opens at The Flask and shows two men drinking and laughing as the minutes fly by to closing time. As they emerge from the pub, they literally stop in their tracks as they realise there has been a major snowfall. The commercial’s soundtrack also stops for a second as the camera surveys the whitened scene. The subtitle asks ‘The best closing time in the world?’ before both of the men agree that it is as they hare off into the snow like excited children. ==Interior== English Heritage note that in the original building (the unexpanded pub), the lower bars, named the \\"Snug\\" and \\"Committee Room\\" respectively contain 1930s fireplaces and matchboard panelling, and that between these two areas lies a central bar, which is enclosed by sliding sashes with glazing bars, and are \\"perhaps a mixture of late C18 and 1930s work\\". Behind this lies a circa 1700 dog-leg stairway \\"with turned balusters on a closed string\\". ==\\"Swearing on the horns\\"== The FlaskWalford, E.

Having so sworn they must kiss a pair of horns, or a pretty girl if they saw one, and were then free of Highgate.Brewers dictionary of phrase & fable. 16th edition. London: Cassell, 1999, p. 1143. The ritual is said to have been the source of the expression that a man was \\"Sworn at Highgate\\", meaning that he was a man of the world. Lord Byron took the oath, though not necessarily at The Flask, and devoted a verse of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage to it.Tucker, David. (2009) London walks: London stories Random House, p. 74. The Flask was one of the pubs that used a pair of ram's horns, but other pubs in Highgate used either stag's or bullock's horns. In its modern incarnation, the ritual has been performed at The Flask by Hornsey Round Table for 49 years (as of 2019) to raise money for charity. ==See also== *The Flask, Hampstead ==References * Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Camden Category:Grade II listed pubs in London Category:Reportedly haunted locations in London Category:Highgate Category:Pubs in the London Borough of Camden ","title":"The Flask, Highgate"},{"id":"42075787","text":"In the Western Aden Protectorate Bidwell served as Political Officer and started to become an expert for Yemen and the Arab World.

The first European owner of the land was Captain Charles Simeon. In 1851, he chose of land and had frontages with Wilderness Road, the road leading to the Heathcote River, and the road leading from Christchurch to Halswell. The land was numbered in the order of it having been chosen, and his land was thus known as Rural Section 154. Simeon died in 1867 and his widow requested through land agents Richard J. S. Harman and Edward Cephas John Stevens that Wilderness Road be renamed Barrington Road in honour of her grandfather, Sir Fitzwilliam Barrington, 10th Baronet. This request was granted in 1885, and it is today known as Barrington Street. For census purposes, Statistics New Zealand has created two areas and named them Barrington South and Barrington North. These administrative areas lie predominantly within the suburbs of Spreydon and Somerfield, but they both also include the part of the locality of Barrington that lies to the west of Barrington Street. ==References== Category:Suburbs of Christchurch ","title":"Barrington, New Zealand"},{"id":"42075793","text":"Deformer is a music project led by Dutch music producer Mike Redman since the early nineties. They were amongst the first generation of Jungle producers in the Netherlands and are known for merging different music genres that would later be described as Breakcore.Concrete Jungle on Deformer They pioneered with using Sranan Tongo in their Jungle productions as well as primarily using Gabber sounds.Electronic Exploirations on Deformer Their experimental electronic (dance) music is often Horror influenced. ==Career== Deformer first started producing tracks under the name FXecute. In 1995 they changed their name to Deformer. All tracks during that period were produced on Amiga 2000 and Atari computers using Akai S950 samplers. Jungle, Breakbeat and Rave music were primary and samples from cult and obscure horror films were used to create a rather dark atmosphere which became a Deformer signature. To create a unique sound within Jungle music production, Deformer mostly avoided to use the famous ‘Amen Break’ and Mike Redman recorded his own live drums which he later sampled in a similar tradition. Deformer performed in underground clubs, creating a buzz in the alternative dance scene after the mid nineties.PRSPCT Recordings on Deformer In 1999 that some of their tracks were officially released. Their debut ‘FXecutioners’, released on Mike Redman’s independent record label Redrum Recordz received critical acclaim.Redrum Recordz Discogs It was a mixture between jungle, progressive drum and bass and dark trip hop. Around 2000 Redman asked members of the Rap group Redrum Squad to take part during the live performances of Deformer. Turntablist Eni-Less, MC P-Mode and DJ Mack completed the line up accompanied by mostly two dancers they call ‘Freaqks‘ and occasional guest artists. The Deformer live shows were very horror influenced. During the bigger live shows the Freaqks would often spray fake blood into the audience, dance with prosthetics like chopped off heads and the stage would be decorated with fake corpses. Deformer also used a giant gorilla prop on stage with a person in it to move it across the stage. The show element was of great importance and no other act within their field has previously done such a thing. Deformer were resident during the popular ‘Illy Noiz’ Drum and Bass parties in Rotterdam led by DJ Mack. Hailing from Rotterdam city Deformer integrated the local Gabber sound to their formula and the track ‘Slasher’ became a blueprint for future productions.Electronic Exploirations on Deformer The sound was different at the time and during that period the artwork for Drum and Bass records was usually very clean and mostly consisted of abstract computer graphics. Deformer took an opposite approach and made record sleeves that would more easily be associated with the artwork of Death Metal records. The cover for the maxi single ‘Meatcleaver’ was banned in several countries; it shows a monkey’s head composed of pornographic images. Due to the unorthodox record sleeves Deformer often failed to reach the more mainstream audience that buy Drum and bass records. Deformer is known for going against the grain and also like to induct hidden messages in their recordings and artwork. For example; in their 2005 album ‘Revolution Theory’ there is a hidden track before position 1 on the CD. This can only be found when rewinded in an external cd player. ‘Meatcleaver’ has reversed speech in the track, the artwork contains almost unrecognizable pop icons.Meatcleaver on Discogs The Deformer logo is a monkey with six arms. Inspired by the Asian ‘three wise monkeys’ proverb. Where the monkeys originally cover their eyes, ears and mouth (see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil) Deformer’s monkey accents the eyes, ears and mouth distorting the proverb to ‘See, hear, scream!’ combining the three wise monkeys into one furious ape. In 2006 Deformer won a prize for Best Dance Act and in 2008 they released a record with Rap group Public Enemy. They collaborated with DJ Starscream (Slipknot), 6Blocc and Heavy metal band Living Colour. They performed at renowned festivals like; LowlandsLine-up Lowlands Festival with Deformer and Outlook. Deformer shared the stage with sounding names like: Amon Tobin, Venetian Snares, Andy C, Technical Itch and many others. In 2009 Deformer introduced the subgenre ‘Defcore’ with the track ‘Extreme Deformity’, a mixture of Dubstep and Gabber. In 2011, they developed an audiovisual project called ‘Videopacolypz’ and released an accompanying album. Videopacolypz was created with the minimal sounds coming from the Videopac game console that was originally released in 1978. Mike Redman has previously collaborated with Dutch Breakcore producer Bong-Ra on his acclaimed ‘Bikini Bandits Kill Kill Kill’ album, but in 2011 Deformer and Bong-Ra joined forces and founded the group Wormskull. They released the album entitled ‘Sound of Hell’ on German record label Ad Noiseam the same year.Review of Wormskull album Sound of Hell The band Wormskull, with Balázs Pándi on drums, combines live music with electronica and like Deformer, uses obscure cult, horror and exploitation film samples.Review of Wormskull album Sound of HellWormskull website Deformer currently consists of just Mike Redman and occasional guest artists during live shows.

His work has earned him the title of “grand master” from the Fomento Cultural Banamex. Reyes Juárez is from a small community called Tlatempan, in the municipality of San Pablo Apetatitlán, Tlaxcala. The making of masks is a family tradition, begun when his grandfather went to Huejotzingo, Puebla to learn how to make them. This knowledge was passed on to Reyes Juárez’s father, then down to him. For some time, the family was the only one in Tlaxcala that made traditional masks. The artisan has had a career of over forty years and the family is well known for their work, masking the masks for almost all of the carnival celebrations in the state of Tlaxcala. His techniques are very similar to those of the colonial period and does not use molds or models, rather he sculpts designs from memory. Most of the masks are related to traditional dances such as the Danza de Cuadrillas, Cuatro Estaciones, Taragotas, Francesas, Los catrines de levita and La gota. The last two are danced only in San Juan Totolac. He uses wood from a pine called ayacahuite bought locally. After the mask is sculpted, it is covered in plaster painted then varnished.

This field of research aims at improving the usability of products, services, or processes by incorporating experimental and observational research methods to guide the design, development, and refinement of a product. User researchers often work alongside designers, engineers, and programmers in all stages of product creation and idealization. User research is an iterative, cyclical process in which observation identifies a problem space for which solutions are proposed. From these proposals, design solutions are prototyped and then tested with the target user group. This process is repeated as many times as necessary. Mike Kuniavsky further notes that it is “the process of understanding the impact of design on an audience.” The types of user research you can or should perform will depend on the type of site, system or app you are developing, your timeline, and your environment. ==Applications== *Software Development *User experience Design User research is interrelated with the field of design. In many cases, someone working in the field can take on both roles of researcher and designer. Alternatively, these roles may also be separated and teams of designers and researchers must collaborate through their projects. ==Methods== A wide range of research methods are available in the field of user research. To better understand when to use which method, it is helpful to view them along a 3-dimensional framework with the following axes: * Attitudinal vs. behavioral * Qualitative vs. quantitative * Context of use With respect to user research in the field of design, research is typically approached with an empathetic perspective in order to humanize data collected about people. This method can also be referred to a human-centred approach to problem solving. User researcher aims to uncover the barriers or frustrations users face as they interact with products, services, or systems. A unique facet of user research is the brand of user experience (UX) research which focuses on the feelings, thoughts, and situations users go through as they interact with products, services, and systems.

Most of the suburb is covered by Bottle Lake Forest, which has since the mid-1970s become a popular recreation area. The area was known as Waitikiri to Māori and the swamplands around a lake was a traditional mahinga kai (food gathering place). Bottle Lake was first granted for grazing in 1853. The area was bought as a sheep run by John McLean in 1860. He sold the land after only two years to Edward Reece, who named his homestead Waitikiri after the Māori name for the area. Reece commissioned John Gibb to paint Bottle Lake about 20 years after he purchased the land. Reece died in 1885, and the painting was gifted to the Canterbury Society of Arts in 1902 by his son, William Reece. The oil painting is today owned by the Christchurch Art Gallery. Most of the area was purchased in 1878 by Christchurch City Council for waste disposal, but grazing continued into the next century. The pine plantation was begun in 1912, and the land was drained. By the late 1930s, the lake had dried up. The name of the lake was used for other purposes. The hospital board looked for a remote area where an infectious diseases hospital could be set up, and they established the Bottle Lake Hospital. This has since been renamed Burwood Hospital. The road leading to the hospital was originally called Bottle Lake Road and has since been changed to Burwood Road. The suburb that formed around the hospital took its later name—Burwood. The production forest was out of bounds, and the area was virtually unknown to Christchurch people. This changed in 1975, when the forest was given park status. It has since developed into a recreation area, with mountain biking, horse riding, and walking all very popular. There is some housing on the fringes of Bottle Lake Forest, and Waitikiri Drive is a reminder of the area's original name. The former landfill site within Bottle Lake was reopened after the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake to take an estimated 4.5 million tonnes of demolition material. ==References== Category:Suburbs of Christchurch ","title":"Bottle Lake, New Zealand"},{"id":"42076007","text":"arches and capitals for Grand Trianon by Jean Joly, Palace of Versailles Jean Joly (April 16, 1650 – 1740) was a French sculptor.

In his first season, he showed promising form in National Hunt Flat races, winning on his debut and finishing second in the Champion Standard Open NH Flat Race. In the following year he was one of the best novice hurdlers in the British Isles, winning the Betfair Hurdle against more experienced rivals and the Top Novices' Hurdle at Aintree. In the 2013/2014 National Hunt season he won the Fighting Fifth Hurdle and the Christmas Hurdle and finished runner-up in the Champion Hurdle. His later career was interrupted by injury but he returned to finish second in the Champion Hurdle in 2016 and 2017. In December 2017 he returned to Cheltenham to win the International Hurdle on his seasonal debut after a protracted battle with The New One.On 9 December 2018 it was announced that My Tent or Yours was retiring to JP McManus's Martinstown Stud. ==Background== My Tent Or Yours is a bay gelding bred in Ireland by Frank Dunne. He was sired by Desert Prince, one of the best European-trained colts of his generation who won the Irish 2,000 Guineas, Prix du Moulin and Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 1998. He has not been a particularly successful breeding stallion, but has sired the Scottish Derby winner Oriental Magic. His dam Spartan Girl won one minor race and came from a very well-regarded family, being a half-sister of Conduit and a close relative of Petrushka, Spectrum and Millenary. As a foal in November 2007 My Tent Or Yours was consigned by the Irish National Stud to the Goffs sale where he was sold for €2,000 to Tiger Bloodstock. In May 2010, My Tent Or Yours, still an entire colt, was offered for sale at the Doncaster Spring Stores sale and was bought for £12,000 by a partnership of Highflyer Bloodstock and the trainer Nicky Henderson. He subsequently entered the ownership of The Happy Campers syndicate and was trained by Henderson at Upper Lambourn in Berkshire. ==Racing career2011/2012 National Hunt season: National Hunt Flat races=== My Tent Or Yours began his racing career in National Hunt Flat races, also known as \\"bumpers\\", beginning at Ludlow Racecourse on 21 December 2011. Ridden by A. P. McCoy, he started 10/11 favourite and took the lead approaching the final furlong and won very easily by nine lengths from Rainbow Haze. Barry Geraghty took over the ride when My Tent Or Yours started 8/11 favourite for a bumper at Newbury Racecourse on 3 March. He finished strongly but failed by a neck to catch Up To Something. On his final appearance of the season, the gelding was moved up in class for the Grade II Champion Standard Open NH Flat Race at Aintree Racecourse in April. Starting at odds of 5/1, he took the lead approaching the final furlong but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten by the four-year-old The New One, to whom he was conceding six pounds. At the end of the season, My Tent Or Yours was bought privately by J. P. McManus. ===2012/2013 National Hunt season: Novice hurdles=== In the following season My Tent Or Yours competed mainly in novice hurdle races. He made his debut over obstacles at Ascot Racecourse in November, when he was ridden by McCoy and started 4/7 favourite against five opponents. He was restrained in the early stages before taking the lead at the last hurdle and won by one and three quarter lengths from the French-bred Taquin Du Seuil who went on tho win the Grade I Challow Novices' Hurdle a month later. On 29 December he started 4/7 favourite for a minor novice event at Newbury but was never able to reach the lead, and was beaten four and a half lengths by his stable companion Chatterbox. Two weeks later the gelding returned to winning form at Huntingdon Racecourse, starting 4/7 favourite against twelve opponents and winning by seven lengths from Population despite being eased down by McCoy in the closing stages. On 9 February at Newbury, was matched against more experienced hurdlers in the Grade III Betfair Hurdle at Newbury. Ridden as usual by McCoy, he started the 5/1 joint-favourite in a field of twenty-one runners, despite carrying a weight of 156 pounds. He was always travelling well before taking the lead after the second last hurdle and going clear of the field to win impressively by five lengths from Cotton Mill. His win came five days after the stable's leading hurdler Darlan had been killed in a fall at Doncaster. Henderson said that the winner was \\"terribly keen... a stronger pace would have helped. He has gears and can quicken up\\". McCoy commented \\"that was a very good performance off a high mark for a novice on testing ground. He takes a keen hold and I thought the ground may catch us out\\", before adding \\"I'd rather wait until next season for the Champion Hurdle\\". My Tent Or Yours was sent to the Cheltenham Festival for the first time when he contested the Grade I Supreme Novices' Hurdle on 12 March. He was made the 15/8 favourite against eleven rivals, including Champagne Fever and Cheltenian, the last two winners of the Champion Bumper as well as Jezki, who had defeated Champagne Fever in the Royal Bond Novice Hurdle. My Tent Or Yours tracked the leader before taking a narrow lead at the last but was overtaken by the rallying Champagne Fever on the run-in and beaten half a length into second place. Only three horses, including the Dovecote Novices' Hurdle winner Forgotten Voice, appeared to oppose My Tent Or Yours in the Top Novices' Hurdle at Aintree in April. Starting the 4/11 favourite, he took the lead three hurdles from the finish and went clear of his rival to win very easily by sixteen lengths. After the race, Henderson commented \\"When you've had a hard race at Cheltenham it's nice to just come back and get confidence and go to bed for the summer happy and relieved. We know he's good. He's got to be in the ‘contenders' bracket for next year's Champion Hurdle. He's becoming very professional. That is what this season has been all about\\". ===2013/2014 National Hunt season=== My Tent Or Yours began his third season in the Grade I Fighting Fifth Hurdle at Newcastle Racecourse on 30 November and started 8/11 favourite ahead of Melodic Rendezvous who had won the Elite Hurdle three weeks earlier. The gelding fought against McCoy' attempts to restrain him in the early stages, but moved into the lead two hurdles out and won by three lengths from the mare Cockney Sparrow. McCoy described the victory as \\"a good performance, a good starting point\\" but pointed out that the gelding was much the best horse in the race on previous form and was expected to win easily. On 26 December at Kempton Park Racecourse My Tent Or Yours faced The New One in a race for the Grade I Christmas Hurdle. Since beating My Tent Or Yours at Aintree in 2012, The New One had won six races including the Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle and the International Hurdle and was favoured in the betting at 5/6 while My Tent Or Yours starting at 11/8 in a field of six. My Tent Or Yours was restrained by McCoy in the early stages and survived a mistake at the fifth hurdle before moving up into second place behind The New One before the second last. The two leading contenders drew away from the other runners in the straight with My Tent Or Yours gaining the advantage in the last 100 yards to win by half a length after what Daily Telegraph described as \\"the best hurdle race run in England or Ireland this season\\". My Tent Or Yours prepared for the 2014 Champion Hurdle with a run in a two-mile flat race on the Polytrack surface at Kempton on 19 February. He took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish and won easily by four and a half lengths from Ranjaan and ten others. On 11 March, My Tent Or Yours, ridden by McCoy, started 3/1 second favourite behind Hurricane Fly for the 2014 Champion Hurdle. He tracked the leaders for most of the race before producing a strong late run but failed by a neck to catch Jezki. The New One and Hurricane Fly finished third and fourth respectively. The gelding ended his season in the Scottish Champion Hurdle (a handicap race) at Ayr Racecourse on 12 April. He started favourite, but after taking the lead two hurdles out he was overtaken in the closing stages and finished third behind Cockney Sparrow and Court Minstrel, to whom he was conceding six and sixteen pounds respectively. In October 2014 it was announced that My Tent Or Yours had undergone surgery for a tendon injury and would miss the whole of the 2014/2015 National Hunt season. Henderson said \\"It's very frustrating for everyone involved\\" but added that \\"there is no reason why he should not come back as good as ever next season\\".Racing Post ===2015/16 National Hunt season=== My Tent Or Yours came second to Annie Power by four and a half lengths in the 2016 Champion Hurdle after a 703-day absence. He done this while conceding a seven pounds Mares allowance. In the Aintree Hurdle My Tent Or Yours again came second to Annie Power this time by 18 lengths. In his last race of the season My Tent Or Yours came third in the Punchestown Champion Hurdle behind winner Vroum Vroum Mag and second place Identify Thief. ===2016/17 National Hunt season=== On My Tent Or Yours first start of the season he was third of four runners at haydock. On his next start he was second to The New One by three and a half lengths in the International Hurdle. In his third race of the season My Tent Or Yours was fourth in the Christmas Hurdle, a race won by Yanworth. In the 2017 Champion Hurdle My Tent Or Yours was second to Buveur d'Air by four and a half lengths. In the Aintree Hurdle he was second to Buveur d'Air by five lengths. In his last race of the season My Tent Or Yours came second to Wicklow Brave by one and a half lengths in the Punchestown Champion Hurdle. ==Pedigree== *My Tent Or Yours is inbred 4 x 4 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree. ==References * Career 1-2-3 Colour Chart – My Tent Or Yours Category:2007 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 1-l ","title":"My Tent Or Yours"},{"id":"42076022","text":"Ramón Balcells Rodón (17 November 1919, in Valls – 31 March 1999, in Barcelona) was a sailor from Spain.

Removal of this structure can result in the inability to form new memories (i.e. anterograde amnesia) as most famously demonstrated in a patient referred to as HM. The unique morphology of the hippocampus can be appreciated without the use of special stains and this distinct circuitry has helped further the understanding of neuronal signal potentiation. The following will provide an introduction to hippocampal development with particular focus on the role of glucocorticoid signaling. ==Hippocampal DevelopmentOverview=== The hippocampus arises from the medial telencephalon. In lower mammals, the hippocampus is located dorsally. Considerable expansion of the cerebral cortex in higher mammals (e.g. humans) displaces the hippocampus ventrally where it protrudes inferiorly into the lateral ventricles. (More complete discussion of hippocampal anatomy is found here). ===Principal Cells=== Neural progenitors that become hippocampal principal neurons (pyramidal and granular cells) arise from the ventricular zone of the lateral ventricle. In contrast to neural proliferation that leads to cortical formation, hippocampal precursors are produced directly in the ventricular zone because there is no subventricular zone or outer subventricular zone adjacent to the hippocampus. Pyramidal CA1 and CA3 precursor cells, therefore, do not have to migrate far to reach their final destination. The figure to the right indicates migration of pyramidal neurons forming the CA3 (orange) and CA1 (red) cell body layers. These cells populate the hippocampus early in development and can be morphologically distinguished from one another in the embryo by 4 months. Granular cells populate the hippocampus slightly after pyramidal cell migration. These cells have farther distance to travel and follow along the pyramidal cells before entering the hilus; this is represented in the figure as the continuation of migration with the green arrows. Granular cell precursors that will populate the dentate gyrus proliferate locally in the hilus. This area, also known as the subgranular zone, retains a portion of neurogenic precursors in the adult. ===Role of Reelin=== As in the cortex, it is believed that reelin plays an important role in layering of hippocampal neurons through inhibition of migration. Reelin knockout mice lack a single, distinct pyramidal cell body layer due to excess migration. Unexpectedly, these mice have reduced migration into dentate gyrus. The mechanism of this is involve disruption in radial glial scaffolding. ==Glucocorticoid SignalingOverview=== Cortisol is the primary glucocorticoid produced in humans (equivalent to rodent corticosterone). This steroid hormone is both synthesized and released from the adrenal cortex in response to physical or emotional stress. Additionally, basal serum levels of cortisol display circadian variations. Cortisol receptors are located throughout the body and are involved in a variety of processes including inflammation and lung maturation. ===Adult Hippocampus=== The adult hippocampus is highly enriched in type I (mineralocorticoid, MR) and type II (glucocorticoid, GR) glucocorticoid receptors. Despite receptor name, cortisol has ten times greater affinity for MRs than GRs. At basal GC levels, most MRs are activate. Therefore, increasing concentrations of cortisol will preferentially activate GRs. The role these receptors play in cognition is discussed elsewhere. ===Developing Hippocampus=== Despite having a high level of receptor expression, the physiological role of glucocorticoid signaling in the developing hippocampus is not well defined. Animal studies have shown fetal exposure to elevated levels of GCs(either by direct corticosterone mimetic injection or stressing of the mother) has adverse outcomes. In addition to having reduced birth weights, stressed rat pups have a decreased ability to regulate the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. The hippocampus provides negative feedback to this loop and stressed pups have less sensitive glucocorticoid signaling resulting in elevated levels of glucocorticoids basally and an exaggerated response during stress. As adults, these rats can have impaired cognitive function. Understanding the role of glucocorticoid exposure is important; mothers at risk of preterm delivery are commonly given dexamethasone, a GR agonist, to accelerate fetal lung development and reduce morbidity associated with prematurity. These animals studies have found that postnatal care to prenatally stressed animals can reverse the adverse effects of glucocorticoid signaling. More research is needed to understand the role of glucocorticoids in the context of human hippocampal development. ==References== Category:Glucocorticoids Category:Hippocampus (brain) ","title":"Glucocorticoids in hippocampal development"},{"id":"42076042","text":"Ruslan Koshulynskyi in 2014 Ruslan Koshulynskyi (born 9 September 1969) is a Ukrainian politician, soldier and former Member of Parliament who served as the 9th Deputy Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada (2012-2014).

Rogerson and Tuxford, 1857. p. 1 He was considered as \\"one of the leaders in a movement which, by bringing the science of the engineer to bear on the manufacture of implements for tilling the ground, has wrought, during the present century, an almost complete revolution in the practice of agriculture.\\"\\"James Allen Ransome: Obituary\\", Institution of Civil Engineers: Obituaries, 1875. == Biography == James Allen Ransome was born in 1806 in Great Yarmouth as eldest son of the agricultural-implement maker James Ransome (1782–1849), and grandson of Robert Ransome (1753–1830), who co-founded Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies. In 1809 he moved with his father's family to Ipswich, dating from which town as his home, he completed his education at Colchester in 1820, after having spent four years there.\\"James Allen Ransome\\" in: The Farmer's Magazine, Rogerson and Tuxford, Vol. 11th, 3rd Series, January to July 1857. p. 1-2. After leaving school, he became apprenticed to his grandfather, father, and uncle, who were then carrying on business in Ipswich as Ransome and Sons. From 1826 to 1839 he resided at Yoxford, Suffolk, where a branch of the business was established that he managed. He started a farmers' clubLeonore Davidoff. Family Fortunes: Men and Women of the English Middle Class, 1780–1850. University of Chicago Press, 1991. p. 255-56 there which was the precursor of many similar institutions, notably the Farmers' Club of London, of which Ransome was one of the founders. In 1829 he became partner in the firm then trading under the altered title of J. R. and A. Ransome, and he married. In 1839 he moved permanently to Ipswich to reside as one of the leading partners of a firm now written as Ransomes and Sims. Under his direction the business assumed huge proportions. In 1843 he published an excellent history of 'The Implements of Agriculture,' part of which had been prepared as a prize essay for the Royal Agricultural Society. He had joined the society in 1838, served on its council, and was one of the most popular figures at its annual shows (cf. Farmers' Magazine, 1857, with portrait). He was alderman of Ipswich from 1865 until his death in 1875. Ransome died 29 April 1875 at his house in Carr Street, Ipswich. By his wife Catherine (d. 17 April 1868), daughter of James Neave of Fordingbridge, Hampshire, whom he married on 4 September 1829, he left two sons, Robert James and Allen Ransome, and three daughters, one of whom married J. R. Jefferies, an active member of the firm.Suffolk Chronicle for 1 and 8 May 1875Journals of Royal Agricultural Society, 1st ser. passim, 3rd ser. vol. v. (1894)Annual Monitor, 1869 p. 147, 1876 p. 146. == Work  Yoxford Farmers' Club === The energetic character of Ransome's labours first began to fairly develop itself during his second sojourn in Yoxford. Thoroughly feeling the advantages which should come from such associations, he became mainly instrumental in establishing the Yoxford Farmers' Club. He attempted this on something of a new, or at any rate on a principle very rarely tried up to that time. As secretary he organised the discussion, by the members, of questions of practical agriculture, with the view of publishing reports as to reliable results. The success of such plan is now well known. In his own and the adjoining counties it was almost immediate. Closely following his example, and chiefly through his assistance, similar clubs were soon brought into action at Harleston, Beccles, Halesworth, Wrentham, Framlingham, Wickham Market, Hadleigh, and Ipswich. The good thus achieved was at once apparent; and similar institutions began to spring up, all over the county. Amongst the best of these, such clubs as the Harleston, the Hadleigh, and the Halesworth have always held a very high position. But Ransome did not stop here. In conjunction with the agricultural writer William Shaw (1797–1853),The Farmer's almanac and calendar by Cuthbert W. Johnson and William Shaw, 1841–50, at catalog.hathitrust.org Robert Baker, and one or two others, he set the London Farmers' Club first going, the main features of which still very much resemble those of the little Yoxford club, as established some ten years earlier—the discussion of practical results, and reporting the meetings. It was in this district, too, that he was one of the first to introduce the \\"allotment system\\" for labourers; a means, which, however coolly received at the outset, has also come to be gradually adopted. Need it to be told that when Ransome left Yoxford, in 1839, his friends and neighbours—and with Allen Ransome the terms are synonymous—presented him with a handsome and becoming testimonial in plate. Some few years before this, Ransome had directly assisted in forming a Society of still greater influence in its effect on the agriculture of this country. He was one of the little knot from which it sprung; he was one of the first members enrolled; and he still continues to take his seat as one of the Council of the Royal Agricultural Society of England. There is no frequenter of its meetings but must know him. Indeed, there have been few of any importance in the three kingdoms but which he has visited, and at which we trust he may be greeted for many years yet to come. === Ransomes and Sims === Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies Ltd. advertising poster, c. 1875 Very many who read this will themselves be able to speak to Allen Ransome as a man of business, who by his integrity and ability has justly reached the highest position. Many more will remember him, perhaps, as the most agreeable of companions and the most welcome of friends. Others, again, will associate his presence with those fluent, happy addresses he now and then rattles off; speeches so perfect in their style and delivery as to generally defy the art of the reporter. To appreciate such orations you must hear \\"Allen's\\" own musical voice, and watch the lighting up of his pleasant countenance. All, however, may not have enjoyed, as we have, the opportunity of seeing him in his own home, or following him through his own town. The kindly greeting and good word to everybody, and the deeds which carry out all these words imply. We question very much whether there be such another happy family in England as the thirteen or fourteen hundred men constantly employed in Messrs. Hansomes' works at Ipswich. What a treat it is to go over these—especially if you have the head of the house himself to guide you—and to note not only all the triumphs of art and skill, but to mark also how the heart has its due share in the business. To see, as you do, at every turn and in every face that the profits of the master are nowhere more studied than the comforts of his men! If we say more, we shall but make our hero mortal, and chronicle him, like most of us, as not proof against some little weakness or other. That of Allen Ransome, if such it be, is a national one – the love of a horse. The neatest hack at the Suffolk shows is almost sure to be \\"Ransome's.\\" Himself a good horseman, and a good judge, no wonder he confessed, in the openness of his heart, as we once heard him, that \\"much as he loved a steam-engine, he loved a horse still more!\\" The firm of Ransomes was established in the last century by Mr. Robert Ransome, the grandfather of the subject of this notice. It was Robert Ransome who took out the first patent for manufacturing cast-iron chilled ploughshares, and thus by making the under-side much harder than the upper, preserving a sharp cutting edge to the share. The use of this process in turning out ploughshares is now almost universal, both in this country and America. The chief business of the establishment is still the manufacture of agricultural implements and machinery; although the firm is also extensively recognised in conjunction with railway works and improvements. Upwards of three thousand miles of \\" line\\" in the United Kingdom, and nearly two thousand more in other parts of the world, are now laid down and maintained on the patent known as Ransome and May's. == Selected publications == * James Allen Ransome.

His younger brother, Dennis Bonnen, is the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives. ==Background and personal life== A native of Angleton, the county seat of Brazoria County in southeastern Texas, Bonnen is a son of David and Matina Bonnen. He graduated in 1988 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biochemistry from Texas A&M; University in College Station. He subsequently received his M.D. degree from the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, where he is an assistant professor, also.

He is active in the faith-based organization, the Medical Strategic Network. He is a counselor for handicapped children at the Texas Camp of Lions Clubs International; in that capacity he met his wife, the former Kimberly Ann Durst. The Bonnens have two children. ==Political life== When Republican Representative Larry Taylor vacated the District 24 House seat to run successfully for the Texas State Senate, Dr. Bonnen and two other Republicans entered the primary contest to succeed Taylor. Bonnen led the field with 6,951 votes (45.1 percent) and was placed into a runoff election with Ryan Sitton of Friendswood, who trailed with 5,035 votes (32.6 percent). In 2014, Sitton rebounded to become the successful Republican nominee for the Texas Railroad Commission. Heidi Thiess held the remaining but critical 3,440 votes (22.3 percent). In the second round of balloting on July 31, 2012, Dr. Bonnen prevailed with 8,608 votes (57.7 percent) to Sitton's 6,305 (42.3 percent). In the general election on November 6, 2012, coinciding with the U.S. presidential election, Bonnen defeated Democrat H. C. \\"Rusty\\" Cates of Galveston, 48,177 votes (73.3 percent) to 17,565 (26.7 percent). Defeated runoff candidate Ryan Sitton ran in 2014 for the Republican nomination for the Railroad Commission seat vacated by Barry Smitherman, who instead sought, unsuccessfully, the position of state attorney general. Bonnen is a member of the House committees on (1) Appropriations and (2) Insurance. In the 2013 legislative session, Bonnen supported a ban on abortion after twenty weeks of gestation; the bill passed the House, 96–49. He sponsored companion legislation to increase medical and licensing requirements of abortion providers. Texas Right to Life rated him 84 percent. Bonnen voted against a taxpayer-funded breakfast program for public schools; the measure passed the House, 73–58. He co-sponsored legislation to provide marshals for school security. He opposed the bill requiring the immunization of minors without parental consent, a measure which the House nevertheless approved, 71–61. He co-sponsored the law to extend the franchise tax exemption to certain businesses. Bonnen supported the measure to prohibit texting while driving. He voted to require testing for narcotics of those receiving unemployment compensation. He voted against an \\"equal pay for women\\" measure, which passed the House, 78-61. He voted to forbid the state from enforcing federal regulations of firearms and co-sponsored another law allowing college and university officials to carry concealed weapons in the name of campus security. He co-sponsored legislation to reduce the time required for an individual to procure training to obtain a concealed handgun license; the measure cleared the House 116–30. He voted for the redistricting bills for the state House, the Texas Senate, and the United States House of Representatives. He opposed term limits for certain state officials, and the resolution failed on the House floor. In 2013, Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum, managed in Texas by Cathie Adams, a former state chairman of the Texas Republican Party, rated Bonnen 98 percent favorable. The Young Conservatives of Texas rated him a cumulative career score of 82 percent. He ranked 50 percent from the Texas League of Conservation Voters. Another interest group, Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, founded by Michael Quinn Sullivan, rated him 82 percent. The Texas Association of Business and the National Rifle Association rated him 93 percent and 92 percent, respectively. In 2014, Bonnen was unopposed for House re-nomination in the Republican primary. In the general election held on November 6, 2018, he won his fourth legislative term with 47,209 votes (69.8 percent) to 19,054 (28.2 percent) for Democrat John Y. Phelps. Dick Illyes received another 1,384 votes (2 percent) as the Libertarian Party nominee. ==Election history== {class=\\"navbox collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"text- align:left; border:0; margin-top:0.2em;\\" - ! cff; font- weight:normal;\\" Greg Bonnen electoral history -  style=\\"border:solid 1px silver; padding:8px; background:white;\\" ;2014 ;2012 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  } ==References * Campaign website * State legislative page * Greg Bonnen at the Texas Tribune Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Texas House of Representatives Category:Texas Republicans Category:People from Angleton, Texas Category:People from Friendswood, Texas Category:Texas A&M; University alumni Category:University of Texas Medical Branch alumni Category:University of Texas Medical Branch faculty Category:American neurosurgeons Category:American Christians Category:21st-century American politicians ","title":"Greg Bonnen"},{"id":"42076081","text":"The Fairmont Opera House in Fairmont, Minnesota was built in 1901. Frank A. Day, editor of the Fairmont Sentinel, prodded local businessmen to establish an opera house starting in 1899. The Fairmont Opera House Company acquired the land in July, 1901 and began construction. The first grand opening was on February 11, 1902, with the opening show being \\"The Chaperone\\" performed by the Frank L. Perley Singing Comedians. From 1902 through 1912, it housed a variety of events such as traveling stock companies, local talent shows, graduation ceremonies, musicals, conventions, and political meetings. In 1912, W.L. Nicholas and Billy Hay became the managers, changed its name to the Haynic Theater, and began to show movies there. In 1926, the house was remodeled to accommodate live stock companies, road shows, and movies. Billy Hay died in 1926, and the opera house was rechristened the Nicholas Theatre, with a grand opening on July 27, 1927. The 1927 opening introduced an organ by Marr and Colton, complete with sound effects such as drums, a xylophone, car horns, horses' hoof beats, cymbals, and other novelties. The Nicholas Theater was used exclusively as a movie house until 1980.

A nonprofit group bought the building for $51,000 in November 1980, and organized efforts to remodel and repair the building. ==References * Fairmont Opera House Category:Music venues completed in 1901 Category:Buildings and structures in Martin County, Minnesota Category:National Register of Historic Places in Martin County, Minnesota Category:Opera houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:Opera houses in Minnesota Category:1901 establishments in Minnesota ","title":"Fairmont Opera House"},{"id":"42076135","text":"In AMO physics, synthetic gauge fields (or artificial gauge fields) are effective gauge fields which, by experimental design, affect the dynamics of atoms in ultracold quantum gases. Most commonly, the simulated gauge field is an effective electromagnetic field (an example of an Abelian gauge field) that has been introduced either by rotation of a quantum gas (resulting from the correspondence between the Lorentz force and the Coriolis force) or by imprinting a spatially varying geometric phase through an atom-laser interaction scheme. Recently, some attention has turned toward the possibility of realizing synthetic dynamical gauge fields with quantum gas apparatus, with the long-term goal of leveraging the platform for quantum simulations of problems relevant to Standard Model physics.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. ==Provisions of the bill== This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Preventing Government Waste and Protecting Coal Mining Jobs in America would amend the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 to require state programs for regulation of surface coal mining to incorporate the necessary rule concerning excess spoil, coal mine waste, and buffers for perennial and intermittent streams published by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement on December 12, 2008. The bill would require the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) publish notice of a determination when all states that wish to assume exclusive jurisdiction of such mining regulation have incorporated the rule in their programs; (2) assess the effectiveness of the rule's implementation during the five-year period following such notice; and (3) report to Congress an evaluation of the rule's effectiveness, any ways in which it inhibits energy production, and any proposed changes to the rule. The bill would prohibit issuance of any regulations regarding stream buffer zones or protection before publication of the report, other than a rule necessary to implement incorporation of the December 2008 rule described in this Act. Requires each state with an approved program for regulation of surface coal mining to submit program amendments incorporating such rule within two years of enactment of this Act. ==Congressional Budget Office report== This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on November 14, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 2824 would require certain states to implement, within two years, a rule published in 2008 by the Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation, and Enforcement (OSM) regarding the disposal of mine waste near streams (the stream buffer zone rule). The bill also would require OSM to assess the effectiveness of that rule after five years of implementation and to report its findings to the Congress. Finally, the bill would prevent OSM from issuing a new rule regarding stream buffer zones until the agency completes the report required under the bill. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the bill would have no significant impact on the federal budget. Enacting the bill could affect offsetting receipts, which are treated as reductions in direct spending; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. However, CBO estimates that any such effects would be negligible. Enacting H.R. 2824 would not affect revenues. Under the 2008 stream buffer zone rule, which CBO expects would be implemented through 2021 under the bill, firms would be allowed to dispose of mine waste near streams if regulators determine that avoiding disturbance of the streams is not reasonably possible. Under the rule OSM is currently implementing, firms are prohibited from disposing of mine waste within 100 feet of streams; however, according to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OSM is in the process of preparing a new rule to govern such disposal. CBO has no information regarding the content of the new rule or when it might be implemented. The budgetary impact of enacting H.R. 2824 would depend, in part, on whether the stream buffer zone rule implemented under the bill would be more or less restrictive than the rule implemented under current law. If the rule implemented under the bill imposed relatively fewer restrictions on the disposal of mine waste, coal producers would use less costly methods to dispose of such waste and CBO expects that firms producing coal would increase their valuation of coal leases affected by the rule, including leases on federal lands. Under such a rule, CBO expects that proceeds to the federal government would increase from the sale of federal coal leases. Conversely, a relatively more restrictive disposal rule would reduce the value of coal leases and thus the proceeds from the sale of coal leases on federal lands. Based on information provided by OSM, CBO expects that implementing a new stream buffer zone rule would primarily affect coal mining that requires the removal of mountaintops in the Appalachian Mountains. In 2012, the federal proceeds from activities related to coal mining on federal lands in that area totaled $1.5 million. Because the existing federal proceeds from the area affected by this bill are small, and because it is unclear whether the rule imposed by this bill would be more or less restrictive than the rule that OSM will impose under current law, CBO expects that firms in the coal industry would not significantly change their valuation of coal leases under the bill, and therefore, that enacting H.R. 2824 would have a negligible impact on the federal budget. H.R. 2824 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). The bill would impose additional requirements on states and tribal governments that choose to apply for exclusive jurisdiction—or \\"primacy\\"—in regulating surface mining operations within their jurisdiction. However, those requirements would be conditions of participating in a voluntary federal program and thus not mandates as defined in UMRA. ==Procedural history== The Preventing Government Waste and Protecting Coal Mining Jobs in America was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on July 25, 2013 by Rep. Bill Johnson (R, OH-6). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources. On February 28, 2014, the committee reported the bill alongside House Report 113-364. On February 29, 2014, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 2824 would be considered on March 4, 2014. However, due to a snowstorm, consideration of the bill was delayed until March 25, 2014, another day on which it snowed. ==Debate and discussion== Majority Leader Eric Cantor described the bill as needed to stop \\"excessive and unnecessary\\" regulation. Rep. Bill Johnson indicated that the bill was in response to changes in coal mining rules proposed by the Obama Administration. Supporters of the bill argue that it will be good for jobs, save the government money, and improve U.S. energy production by preventing the Obama Administration from introducing more coal regulations. The bill is a reaction to actions taken by the Obama Administration to rewrite a regulation called the 2008 Stream Buffer Zone Rule. According to one source, \\"the Administration has spent nearly $9 million taxpayer dollars working to rewrite this rule, including hiring new contractors, who were dismissed once it was publicly revealed that the Administration's proposed regulation could cost 7,000 jobs and cause economic harm in 22 states.\\" The National Mining Association supported the bill, with its President, Al Quinn, saying \\"this bill accomplishes the important task sometimes lacking in public policy: it balances the needs of the economy with the needs of the environment.\\" The Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council (SBEC) also supported the bill. According to the SBEC's President, Karen Kerrigan, \\"impractical and excessive regulations are certainly hurting the coal industry, and by extension the many small businesses who need affordable electricity to remain competitive.\\" Opponents of the bill described it as a bill that would require \\"OSM to implement the flawed 2008 Stream Buffer Zone rule and prevent the agency from improving that rule for a minimum of seven years.\\" Opponents also claimed that Republicans were using \\"fear mongering\\" to argue in favor of the bill. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) opposed the bill, arguing that it should be opposed because the supporters \\"believe coal companies should be allowed to blow the tops off mountains and dump the waste into streams, no matter what the science says about the consequence for our environment and the public health.\\" ==See also== *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Environmental impact of mining ==Notes/References *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 2824 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 2824 *GovTrack.us H.R. 2824 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 2824 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 2824 *Hearing Testimony from the Dept of the Interior *Congressional Budget Office report on H.R. 2824 *House Report 113-364 on H.R. 2824 Category:Coal mining in the United States Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"Preventing Government Waste and Protecting Coal Mining Jobs in America"},{"id":"42076161","text":"Ramón Balcells Comas (born 6 August 1951, in Barcelona) is a sailor from Spain.

It was first named by David Meredith Seares Watson in 1912 and the type species is Eosuchus colletti. The generic name Eosuchus is preoccupied by the generic name of Eosuchus lerichei Dollo, 1907, a gavialoid crocodilian known from northern France. Thus, an alternative generic name, Noteosuchus, was proposed by Robert Broom in 1925. The generic name erected by Broom (1925) is a compound, meaning \\"Not Eosuchus\\", while \\"Eosuchus\\" is derived from the name of Eos, the goddess of the dawn in Greek mythology, and suchus, Latinized from the Greek souchos, an Egyptian crocodile god, thus meaning \\"dawn crocodile\\". The specific name, colletti, honors Mr. Collett for the discovery of the holotype and only known specimen. == Discovery == Noteosuchus is known solely from the holotype AM 3591, a well-preserved partial postcranial skeleton, missing the head, which is currently housed at the Albany Museum in South Africa. It was collected from a hill slope at Grassy Ridge locality, from the Katberg Formation of the Beaufort Group. This horizon belongs to the Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone, dating to the early Induan stage of the Early Triassic period. Thus, Noteosuchus represents the geologically oldest known rhynchosaur species. == Classification == David M. Dilkes (1998) suggested that Noteosuchus colletti may be a junior synonym of Mesosuchus browni, and thus this species has been widely ignored since. However, Ezcurra, Scheyer and Butler (2014) noted that this synonymy was based only on generalized rhynchosaur plesiomorphic similarities rather than autapomorphies. They found this to be unlikely because the temporal gap between the two species spans most of the Early Triassic, as Mesosuchus is otherwise known only from the Middle Triassic. Additionally, their phylogenetic analysis recovered Noteosuchus and Mesosuchus in a polytomy with Howesia browni, a result which is inconsistent with such synonymy. == References == Category:Rhynchosaurs Category:Early Triassic reptiles of Africa Category:Induan genera Category:Fossils of South Africa Category:Fossil taxa described in 1912 Category:Fossil taxa described in 1925 ","title":"Noteosuchus"},{"id":"42076184","text":"Nancy Marie Amato is an American Computer Scientist noted for her research on the algorithmic foundations of motion planning, computational biology, computational geometry and parallel computing.

By being involved in historic events in the Indian Wars of the western frontier, the Far West became an iconic symbol of the shallow draft steamboat plying the upper Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers in the era before railroads dominated transport in these areas. The Far West was light, strong and speedy. She was initially owned by the Coulson Packet Line who contracted with the Army in the 1870s to provide steamboats to support Army expeditions on the Yellowstone River in the Montana Territory. The Far West was used in this capacity, along with its sister riverboat the Josephine. The Far West was often piloted by the famous river boat captain and pilot, Grant Marsh. The Far West was known as a fast boat because she had powerful engines, a hull with limited water resistance, and a low profile that reduced wind resistance. She set a number of speed records for both upstream and downstream travel on the Missouri and the Yellowstone. By virtue of her shallow draft and her ability to \\"grasshopper\\" over sand bars (using spars and steam capstans on the front of the boat to lift the boat and swing it forward a few feet at a time) she was famous for being able to get through shallow channels and low water conditions on the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers that turned back other steamboats. Far West gained a place in military and steamboat history during the Great Sioux War of 1876. The Far West was under contract to support a military column of infantry and cavalry units under General Alfred Terry, Colonel John Gibbon and Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The column was advancing up the Yellowstone, seeking a large Sioux and Cheyenne encampment which was moving along the river drainages to the south. The Far West brought supplies to the column, and it was used by Terry as a headquarters and also to ferry and move troops on the river. On June 21, the Far West was moored on the Yellowstone at the mouth of Rosebud Creek and was the site of the fateful meeting of officers after which Custer and the 7th Cavalry was dispatched south up the Rosebud seeking the Indian encampment. On June 25, 1876, the 7th Cavalry under Custer suffered a disastrous defeat at the Battle of the Little Bighorn . Five of the companies of the 7th were annihilated along with Custer, and the remaining companies suffering significant numbers of dead and wounded. Far West made her way from the Yellowstone up the Bighorn River to the mouth of the Little Bighorn where she was loaded with the wounded from the battle. Traveling night and day, she returned downriver to Bismarck, Dakota Territory, making the run in the record time of 54 hours and bringing the first news of the military defeat which came to be popularly known as the \\"Custer Massacre\\". After 1876 Far West was sold by the Coulson Packet Line. She continued to work on the Yellowstone and the Missouri Rivers for other owners until 1883 when she struck a snag and sank, near St. Charles, Missouri. ==Construction and specifications== The Far West was built in Pittsburgh in 1870 for the Coulson Packet Company. The Far West was long with a beam of and had three decks, a cupola like pilot house and two tall smoke stacks. She drew only of water unloaded and fully loaded with 200 tons of freight. Between her first and second decks were two powerful high- pressure steam engines built by Herbertson Engine Works of Brownsville, Pennsylvania, each with pistons and a stroke. The engines were powered by steam from three boilers that consumed as many as 30 cords of wood a day. The engines drove a single stern wheel. The Far West also had two steam capstans, one on each side of the bow, being the first boat built with more than one. ==Description of decks== The steamboat rested in the water on its hull. The hull of the boat was hollow and was used to store cargo. Cargo was often contained in casks or barrels. This storage could only be reached through hatches on the deck, and men working in the hull to store or move cargo could not stand up, but had to work while hunched over or crawling through the hull space. The platform that closed the top of the hull was the main deck, and the name applied not only to the floor of this space, but also the space between the main deck and the cabin deck, just above the main deck. The main deck had the boilers and the two steam engines which powered the paddle wheel at the rear of the boat. Wood for the boilers was stacked on the main deck. Freight was carried on the main deck. The cheapest passenger accommodations were on the main deck, but the passengers had to find their own space. Above the main deck on the Far West was the cabin deck. Each side of the boat had a row of small cabins with doors that opened to the outside where there was a covered walkway. Inside the two rows of cabins and between them there was a central cabin — like a long wide hallway running from the front of the boat to the back. Here there was a long table where the cabin passengers and the ships officers were fed, and where they could spend leisure time. Above the main deck was its roof, known as the hurricane deck, because it was unprotected from the elements. The Far West had no structures on this deck, other than the pilot house. On the Far West the hurricane deck had no cabins, and no \\"Texas deck\\" structures. The pilot house was a cupola like box, with glass-paned windows on all four sides, that perched on the hurricane deck. From this vantage point the river pilot (who has often the captain, in a smaller steamship like the \\"Far West\\") guided the boat, while also regulating the power applied to the paddle wheel. The pilot guided the boat using a large spoked wheel, which was connected by a series of ropes or chains to the rudders at the rear of the boat. The pilot also regulated the power applied to the stern paddle wheel, using a voice tube to talk to the engineer, telling him when and in what amount to provide steam to power the stern wheel, and when to stop or reverse the paddle wheel. Two tall smoke stacks towered above the forward part of the hurricane deck and the 'scape pipes were in the rear, venting steam from the engines. ==Capabilities== The Far West was neither graceful nor grand in appearance, but she was strong, powerful, fast, durable and had an enormous capacity for hard work. She had limited accommodation for passengers on her second deck, and consequently she did not have a large central cabin. The absence of these features meant that she had a lower profile, and no \\"Texas\\" deck, which resulted in her having less wind resistance and therefore being both faster and more manageable in the high winds that prevailed in Montana and North Dakota during the summer months. She possessed ample freight carrying capacity, and she had a shallow draft. Her powerful engines and three boilers combined with her other features to make her not only a speedy boat, but also a boat that was able to traverse shallow channels, cross sand bars, breast strong currents and go up through rapids. A unique feature of light river steamboats like the Far West was their ability to \\"grasshopper\\" to get across shallow sand bars to reach a deeper river channel beyond the sand bar. In this \\"grasshopper\\" maneuver, the boat used spars and steam capstans on the front of the boat to lift and swing the front of the boat onto the sand bar, moving forward a few feet at a time. Once the front of the boat was on the sandbar, when the boat was lifted the current would help dislodge loose sediment under the boat, and often the paddle wheel would be accelerated to generate a current in the water under the boat that would also pull the loose sandbar sediment from under the boat. This process was intended to create enough draft or flotation in the water, so the steamboat could then move forward into the deeper channel beyond the sand bar. ==Ownership== Far West was first owned by the Coulson Packet Line which was also known as the Missouri River Transportation Company. The Coulson Packet line sold the Far West to the Northwest Transportation Co. called the Peck Line out of Sioux City/Yankton, ND. The boat was later sold to Capt. Henry M. Dodds and Victor Bonnet. ==Early use== In 1870 the Far West made trips to and from Fort Benton, Montana, which was the upper terminus of river travel on the Missouri. In 1872 the Far West made the quickest trip on record from Sioux City, Iowa, to Fort Benton, Montana – seventeen days, twenty hours – with Mark Coulson as master. ==Activities during the Great Sioux War of 1876== In 1876, the Far West was contracted by the United States Army to be part of the Custer/Terry military expedition against the Sioux Indians. The Far West was used to ferry supplies from the rail head at Bismarck up the Missouri to the Montana Territory, and then up the Yellowstone River where the military column was seeking the villages of the Sioux. The military column led by General Terry and Custer's 7th Cavalry traveled westward over the prairies from Fort Lincoln, Dakota Territory to the Yellowstone River. The Far West, captained by Grant Marsh, brought supplies up the Missouri and Yellowstone river and met the military column at the mouth of Powder River in Montana Territory, near present-day Terry, Montana. General Terry then used the Far West as the expedition's headquarters. On June 21, 1876, at the mouth of the Rosebud a meeting was held on the Far West which mapped out the next steps in the campaign to attempt to find the Sioux/Cheyenne village in the valleys of the Rosebud or the Little Bighorn. The next day, Custer and the 7th Cavalry rode up Rosebud Creek seeking the Indian villages. Far West was ordered to proceed up the Yellowstone to the Big Horn and then up the Big Horn to the mouth of the Little Big Horn River so that supplies would be close to the area of expected troop activities. On June 25, Custer encountered the Sioux/Cheyenne village on the Little Bighorn river and suffered a disastrous defeat. Unaware of this defeat, Grant Marsh had the \\"Far West\\" on station at the mouth of the Little Big Horn on 26 June. While tied along the bank, Curley a Crow scout who had been with Custer, emerged from the willows on the riverbank and came on board and by drawings and signs indicated that Custer had been \\"wiped out\\". After General Terry learned of the battle he ordered the Far West to stand by to receive the wounded. On June 29 set about preparing the Far West to become a hospital ship. Captain Marsh ordered grass cut and placed on the decks, and covered with canvas tarpaulins for the wounded, which soon began to arrive from the battle site which was only about distant. On June 30, 1876, 52 wounded were on board. Casting off from the mouth of the Little Big Horn, Captain Marsh descended to the column's base camp on the north bank of the Yellowstone River. The Far West spent the next two days ferrying troops across the Yellowstone and taking on a heavy load of wood to power the two engines. Stacks of cordwood and grain sacks were positioned along the gunwales to protect the wounded from possible Indian attack. Sheets of boiler iron were placed around the pilot house. At 5 p.m. on July 3 Terry ordered the Far West to take the wounded to Bismarck river miles away. Piloted by Grant Marsh and under a full head of steam the \\"Far West\\" proceeded down the Yellowstone and then down the Missouri. With only brief stops the Far West arrived at Bismarck in at 11 p.m. on 5 July, after an amazing downriver run of 710 miles in 54 hours which set a record for riverboat travel. Along the way only one trooper died, Private William George and the \\"Far West\\" stopped briefly at 4 a.m. on July 4 at \\"Terry's Landing\\" at the mouth of the Powder River where Pvt. George's remains was hastily put ashore, (to be buried by the detachment located there) while the \\"Far West\\" proceeded on down-river.Pvt. George's burial site may be visited today on a large empty flat at the mouth of the Powder River. The flat was the bustling Terry's landing where supplies for the Montana column were stacked. The single grave is surrounded by an old- fashioned iron fence, and marked with a standard U.S. Army marble headstone, like those on Last Stand Hill. The \\"Far West\\" brought the first news of the Custer disaster, which was promptly put on the telegraph at Bismarck, and received in the east in the afternoon of 6 July, during weekend celebrations of the July 4th, 1876 centennial birthday of the United States. Only 9 days later, Captain Marsh and the Far West steamed back up river with horses and supplies for the Terry column. ==Far West after 1876== The Far West continued to carry freight and passengers on the upper Missouri and Yellowstone, and she continued to set records. In 1881, the Missouri River was so high that the arrival of river boats coming up river was delayed. The Far West was the first boat to reach Fort Benton that year. However, due to the high water it did not arrive until May 19. ==1883 sinking == In October 1883 the Far West hit a snag on the Missouri River, near St. Charles, Missouri, and was lost. ==See also== * Grant Marsh * Joseph LaBarge — famous steamboat captain on the Missouri River, during the same era ==References * Category:1870 ships Category:Ships built in Pittsburgh Category:Steamboats of the Missouri River Category:Paddle steamers of the United States Category:Shipwrecks of the Missouri River Category:History of North Dakota Category:History of Montana Category:Missouri River Category:Maritime incidents in 1883 ","title":"Far West (steamship)"},{"id":"42076234","text":"A declaration of independence is an assertion of the independence of an aspiring state or states.

He is currently based between Bangkok, Thailand and Geneva, Switzerland, where he is editor of Global Geneva magazine, a print and online publication stressing quality journalism and focusing on so-called 'International Geneva' themes, such as humanitarian response, conflict mediation, climate change and sustainable development goals.http://www.global-geneva.com ==Early life and education== Having lived much of his youth in the United States, Bahamas, Canada and Germany, Girardet completed his high school education at Clifton College, a British public school in Bristol, UK, and then Nottingham University, where he studied German literature. On graduating, he went to Paris to become a foreign correspondent. ==Professional== As a reporter for The Christian Science Monitor, U.S. News & World Report and the PBS MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour but now other media, he has covered wars and humanitarian crisis zones in Africa, Asia, the Balkans and Central America. He is widely regarded as one of the most informed international journalists on Afghanistan and humanitarian media issues. His latest book, Killing the Cranes, is considered a classic. ==Books== Girardet has written or edited various books, mainly about Afghanistan but also Africa and media. His 1985 book Afghanistan: The Soviet War was one of the first books based on personal experience about the Soviet war, the Afghan resistance and clandestine humanitarian cross-border support. He often trekked hundreds of miles across the Hindu Kush to report the Red Army war. Girardet was also the first American reporter to meet and write about Afghan resistance leader, Ahmed Shah Massoud in the summer of 1981. Girardet narrowly escaped being killed, or at least serious injury in September, 1981 when he travelled up to northern Afghanistan to see Massoud just before the latter was assassinated by two Al-Qaeda operatives. Posing as journalists, the two suicide bombers lived in the guesthouse room in Khoja Bauhouddin next to Girardet, who was on assignment for National Geographic. Girardet left several days before the assassination on 9 September 2001 because, as he wrote in Killing the Cranes, he had to get back to Europe for his wife's birthday on 13 September. Girardet edited Somalia, Rwanda and Beyond: The Role of the International Media in Wars and Humanitarian Crises published by Columbia University Press and Crosslines Global Report in 1995. Girardet has co-produced and reported various television documentaries filming, sometimes clandestinely, in places such as Western New Guinea, Haiti, Zambia, Angola, Mozambique and El Salvador. He was reporter on the BBC2 documentary \\"Frontline Doctors\\" about Medecins sans Frontières (MSF) during the 1990s produced by French film-makers Christophe de Ponfilly and Frederic Laffont, and narrated by actor Daniel Day-Lewis. Girardet was also editor of Populations in Danger with MSF published by Routledge in 1996 and contributed the chapter on Liberia. Together with British editor and former Gurkha officer Jonathan Walter, Girardet co-edited and wrote The Essential Field Guide to Afghanistan in 1998 published by Crosslines Global Report and Media Action International. This is aimed at helping aid workers, diplomats, soldiers, journalists and others to be better informed about Afghanistan.The most recent 4th edition of The Essential Field Guide to Afghanistan was published in February, 2014, which includes essays and briefs by writers such as Ahmed Rashid, William Dalrymple, Christina Lamb, William Dowell, Jason Burke and Girardet himself. Girardet's latest book is Killing the Cranes - A Reporter's Journey Through Three Decades of War in Afghanistan published by Chelsea Green in 2011 and in French by Editions Les Arènes in Paris in February, 2014 as Il Parait Que Vous Voulez Me Tuer. Killing the Cranes includes a personal account of Afghanistan's nearly 35-year-long war including encounters with Islamic extremists such as Osama bin Laden and Afghan Hezb-e-Islami fundamentalist Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. As with other Afghan Pushtun and Islamic radicals, Gulbuddin was supported by the Central Intelligence Agency and Pakistan's military InterServices Intelligence (ISI) during the 1980s and is now a leading insurgent figure against the post-2001 US-led intervention in Afghanistan. ==Related Activities== Girardet was founder of the International Centre for Humanitarian Reporting (ICHR) which became Media Action International. He is a specialist in 'Lifeline Media', an idea initially propagated by Media Action International, providing needs-based humanitarian information to disaster victims. Girardet is an avid proponent of quality reporting for the coverage of wars, humanitarian crises and development issues. He has organized numerous workshops for local, regional and international journalists focusing on global themes, such as climate change, humanitarian response, the environment, access to health, and water. Girardet serves as a media consultant and strategic advisor to various United Nations aid agencies and non-governmental organizations on the need for more effective public information outreach through media as a means of promoting transparency and accountability. As editor of Global Geneva,http://www.global-geneva.com Girardet seeks to highlight the need for credible and trusted journalism as crucial for any democracy. His magazine is also working closely with young people as part of its Youth Writes initiative to help develop writing skills but also to learn how to discern what is credible - and what is not - in social media in the age of false news and disinformation. Girardet is currently working on a what he describes as a \\"factual novel.\\" Girardet is married and has two children. == References == Category:1951 births Category:American male journalists Category:Living people ","title":"Edward Girardet"},{"id":"42076360","text":"Johan Julius Tallberg (born 13 May 1948, in Helsinki) is a sailor from Finland.

His right-hand man, Andrea Bottini, does not lose faith, but instead gets the idea of secretly substituting Oliveri's twin brother, Giovanni Ernani, an over-the-top writer and philosopher who has previously spent time in mental health care and is still medicated. Complications ensue, but the substitute proves more outgoing, more visionary, and much more popular with the press, the public and even with his competitors than his more serious brother, and he leads the party towards victory. The real senator rediscovers himself while watching his brother's success from afar through the French newspapers as he himself dallies in the arms of lovers. Enrico Oliveri eventually returns to Rome. But does he resume his life, or is his mad brother left in charge? The film ends in ambiguity. == Context == The backdrop of the film is the depiction of a despair bordering on self-loathing of much of the Italian electorate at Italian economic conditions and the austerity regimen imposed by the European Union. A \\"Chancellor\\" obviously intended to be Angela Merkel appears in the film without being named. While some have found the film somewhat lightweight, an extended quotation from Berthold Brecht placed in the mouth of the mad brother reveals the director's intent: when politicians and political institutions fail, only the spirit and individual efforts of the people can rescue a nation from crisis. == Cast == * Toni Servillo: Enrico Oliveri/Giovanni Ernani * Valerio Mastandrea: Andrea Bottini * Valeria Bruni Tedeschi: Danielle * Michela Cescon: Anna * Anna Bonaiuto: Evelina Pileggi * Eric Nguyen: Mung * Judith Davis: Mara * Andrea Renzi: De Bellis * Massimo De Francovich: President of Republic * Renato Scarpa: Arrighi * Gianrico Tedeschi: Furlan == Production and Distribution == The movie was produced by BiBi Film and RAI Cinema.

Dating from the lattice of the coat of arms of the Leszczynski's. ==History== It was built between 1734 and 1743 for Joachim Pastorius, a doctor and royal historian, as a four-storied facade. Since the mid-17th century it was owned by Warsaw juror K. Waltera, and from 1666 by Mikołaj Prażmowski, the Crown Chancellor and Polish Primate. In 1754, after being purchased by the Leszczynski family, it was rebuilt as a rococo palace with a five-story facade, designed by Jakub Fontana. From Senatorska Street, it is the second home frontage in classical style. A new segment at the southern part of the building was built before 1795. It then passed into the hands of the Rautenstrauchów family. In 1804 it was bought by merchant Stefana Dobrycza. Partially destroyed in 1944, and demolished for the construction of a major through route, it was rebuilt as it looked in the late 18th century, based on the design of Zygmunt Stępiński. In 2002-2003, it was restored. Internally it is connected to the adjacent Johna Residence - the \\"House of Literature\\" (Polish Writers' Union). ==Bibliography== * Bartłomiej Kaczorowski: Encyklopedia Warszawy.

It was published on the cover of the weekly magazine Suomen Kuvalehti on June 15, 1918. The caption to the image declared, \\"One of the finest protectresses of the Helsinki White Guard.

It is not known when the name became hereditary. The surname “Degiorgio” translated into English means “The Farmer”. ==Royal lineage== The Bagrationi Royal Dynasty reigned over Georgia. Their ascendancy lasted from the early Middle Ages until the early 19th century. The origin of the Bagrationi dynasty is disputed, as well as the time when they first appeared on Georgian soil. The history of the dynasty is inextricably bound with that of Georgia. They began their rule, in the early 9th century, as presiding princes in historic southwestern Georgia and the adjacent Georgian marshlands that had been reconquered from Arabs. Subsequently they restored, in 888, the Georgian kingdom, which prospered from the 11th to the 13th century, bringing several regional polities under its control. Several members of royal families from Europe, Russia and Asia married with Georgian royalty. This period of time, particularly the reigns of David IV (1089–1125) and his great granddaughter Tamar (1184–1213), is celebrated as a “golden age” in Georgian history. The era featured empire, military exploits and cultural achievements. After the fragmentation of their unified feudal state in the late 15th century, the branches of the Bagrationi house ruled the three breakaway Georgian kingdoms – Kartli, Kakheti, and Imereti – until Russian annexation in the early 19th century. The dynasty persisted in exile as an Imperial Russian noble family until the 1917 February Revolution. The establishment of Soviet rule in Georgia in 1921 forced some members of the family to accept demoted status and loss of property in Georgia; others relocated to Western Europe. Some returned after Georgian independence in 1991. Records in Malta have been found, dating as far back as the 1700s, where De Giorgio forefathers landed on the Island of Malta, and set up a successful trading business. ==People with the surname== * Kirk Degiorgio (born 1967 or 1968), British techno producer and DJ * Michael Degiorgio (born 1962), Maltese footballer * Vincent DeGiorgio, Canadian DJ and record producer * H.G.

The game was played through either the male character (Gimble) or the female character (Libby) as they help rebuild the town on Rinth Island after a powerful storm. The game was met with positive reviews upon release. ==Gameplay== The player controls either as the male character Gimble, or the female character Libby. The character is controlled by a virtual direction pad that can go either left or right, or by touching the screen towards where the character would move. The characters cannot jump, so players must make use of ladders and flying bugs to elevate. The player pushes coconuts and crates, pulls levers, and fires cannons and explosives in order to clear off obstacles such as opening/closing platforms, baskets, and rocks. There are four modes in the game: Basic (beat the level), steps (beat the level under a certain number of steps), timed (beat the level quickly), and crystal (collectible crystals appear in the level, often requiring the player to access parts of the level they did not consider before). ==Removal== The game was taken down on iOS stores by 2015, however for those who installed the game before removal, it remains either playable or downloadable through purchased retrieval. ==Reception== The game received critical acclaim for its innovative gameplay, cylindrical structure, and art style, as well as its included level editor. However, some criticized its core gameplay that depended heavily on restarting levels, and the excessive difficulty in later stages. The game was not a commercial success, with only 1,990 downloads on the App Store. ==References== Category:2012 video games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Video games with 2.5D graphics Category:IOS games Category:IOS- only games Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Rinth Island"},{"id":"42076459","text":"The women's kumite +68 kilograms competition at the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China was held on 25 November 2010 at the Guangdong Gymnasium. ==Schedule== All times are China Standard Time (UTC+08:00) {class = \\"\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! width=220Date ! width=50Time ! width=150Event -  rowspan=4Thursday, 25 November 2010  09:30  Quarterfinals -  09:30  Semifinals -  09:30  Bronze medal match -  09:30  bgcolor=ffffccFinal } ==ResultsMain bracket=Repechage=References *Official website Women's kumite 69 kg ","title":"Karate at the 2010 Asian Games – Women's kumite +68 kg"},{"id":"42076460","text":"The Electricity Security and Affordability Act () is a bill that would repeal a pending rule published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on January 8, 2014. The proposed rule would establish uniform national limits on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from new electricity-generating facilities that use coal or natural gas. The rule also sets new standards of performance for those power plants, including the requirement to install carbon capture and sequestration technology. The bill passed in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. ==Provisions of the bill== This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Electricity Security and Affordability Act would prohibit the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from issuing, implementing, or enforcing any proposed or final rule under the Clean Air Act that establishes a performance standard for greenhouse gas emissions from any new source that is a fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating unit unless the rule meets specified requirements of this Act. The bill would require the Administrator to separate sources fueled with coal and natural gas into separate categories. The bill would prohibit the Administrator, however, from setting a standard based on the best system of emission reduction for new sources within the coal category unless it has been achieved on average for at least one continuous 12-month period (excluding planned outages) by each of at least 6 units within the category. Requires each such unit to: (1) be located at a different electric generating station in the United States, (2) be representative of the operating characteristics of electric generation at its location, and (3) be operated for the entire 12-month period on a full commercial basis. Prohibits the use of any results obtained from a demonstration project in setting the standard. The bill would require the Administrator, in separating sources fueled with coal into a separate category, to establish a separate subcategory for new sources that are fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units using coal with an average heat content of 8300 or less British Thermal Units (BTUs) per pound. The bill would prohibit the Administrator, in issuing any rule establishing performance standards for greenhouse gas emissions from new sources in such subcategory, from setting a standard based on the best system of emission reduction unless the standard has been achieved on average for at least one continuous 12-month period (excluding planned outages) by each of at least 3 units within such subcategory that meets the unit requirements specified by this Act for the coal category. The bill would preclude from taking effect, unless a federal law is enacted specifying an effective date, any EPA rule or guideline that: (1) establishes any performance standard for greenhouse gas emissions from a modified or reconstructed source that is a fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating unit, or (2) applies to greenhouse gas emissions from such an existing source. The bill would nullify the force and effect of specified proposed rules (or similar successor proposed or final rules) for Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions for New Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units that are issued before enactment of this Act. ↔ ==Congressional Budget Office report== This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on January 28, 2014. This is a public domain source. On January 8, 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a proposed rule that would establish uniform national limits on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from new electricity-generating facilities that use coal or natural gas. The rule also sets new standards of performance for those power plants, including the requirement to install carbon capture and sequestration technology. H.R. 3826 would repeal this pending rule and place new requirements on any future regulations addressing GHG emissions from new or existing power plants. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing this legislation would cost $2 million over the 2015-2019 period, subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Enacting H.R. 3826 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 3826 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. ==Procedural history== The Electricity Security and Affordability Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on January 9, 2014, by Rep. Ed Whitfield (R, KY-1). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power. It was reported by the committee on February 28, 2014 alongside House Report 113-365. On February 29, 2014, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 3826 would be considered on March 5, 2014. The bill passed the House on March 6, 2014 in a vote of 229-183. ==Debate and discussion== Republicans thought the bill was needed to stop the EPA from implementing a rule that would force new coal-fired power plants to meet an impossible emissions standard. Bill sponsor Ed Whitfield (R-KY) said that, if finalized, the EPA's rule would \\"make it impossible to build a new coal-powered plant in American... That is hard to believe that that will can be the situation in our great country, particularly since 40 percent of our electricity comes from coal.\\" Whitfield argued that the legislation was needed because the EPA refused to respond to criticism or complaints about their proposed rule. Republicans also criticized the EPA's proposed rule, suggesting that it could raise electricity prices by up to $1,200 per household. The activist group FreedomWorks supported the bill and asked its members to contact their representatives about it. In a blog post FreedomWorks president Matt Kibbe said that the bill would go a \\"long way in curbing the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) radical war on affordable and reliable energy from fossil fuels.\\" Kibbe argued that the EPA's proposed rule was \\"an obvious backdoor attempt to effectively outlaw coal\\" because the standards were set \\"well below the emissions levels achieved by even the most advanced coal facilities.\\" The bill was also supported by Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform. Norquist said \\"Congress never intended for the EPA to unilaterally determine what source of energy Americans consume. The Electricity Security and Affordability Act also reaffirms Congress's legislative duties by enacting numerous safeguards against EPA partisan overreach.\\" Most Democrats opposed the bill, arguing that it was meant to derail efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA) said that \\"If we pass this terrible bill, we will vote to let China leap ahead of us in the race to build the clean energy economy for the future, and we will be ignoring our moral obligation to protect the planet for our children and grandchildren.\\" President Barack Obama said that he would veto the bill. Rep. John Dingell (D-MI) did not believe that the bill would pass the Senate, so \\"we are wasting the time of the American people.\\" ==See also== *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Energy in the United States *Electricity sector of the United States *Energy policy of the United States *United States energy independence *Coal power in the United States ==References *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 3826 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 3826 *GovTrack.us H.R. 3826 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 3826 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 3826 *Congressional Budget Office report on H.R. 3826 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:2014 in the environment Category:Coal in the United States Category:Energy in the United States Category:Energy policy of the United States ","title":"Electricity Security and Affordability Act"},{"id":"42076473","text":"Martin Bendík (born April 27, 1993FIS Biography in Poprad, SlovakiaSochi 2014 profile) is an alpine skier from Slovakia.

A veteran of the Mexican–American War and American Civil War, he attained the rank of brigadier general. ==Biography== Joseph A. Haskin was born in Troy, New York on June 21, 1818, a son of William Phelps Haskin (1787-1855) and Sarah \\"Sally\\" (Slade) Haskin (1791-1856). He was raised and educated in Troy, where his father served in appointed and elected offices including sheriff of Rensselaer County. In 1839 Haskin graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point as 10th out of a class of 31 and was commissioned as 2nd lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Artillery. At the outbreak of the Mexican-American War he was a 1st lieutenant and received brevet promotions to captain for Cerro Gordo and major for Chapultepec. He was severely wounded during the battle Chapultepec which resulted in the loss of his left arm. At the close of the war Haskin was promoted to captain as a staff officer in the quartermaster's department. In 1851 he was promoted to captain in the 1st U.S. Artillery.Eicher p.286 Haskin was in command of the Baton Rouge Barracks when the Civil War began. He was forced to surrender on January 10, 1861 to the Confederate forces in Louisiana. He was exchanged and assigned to the staff of John E. Wool with the rank of lieutenant colonel.

Its performance was predictably poor and only one was completed. ==Design and development== The ES-54 Gnome was designed by Harry Schneider, Edmund Schneider's eldest son, as a response to urging by Fred Hoinville for small, cheap sailplanes that could nonetheless soar. Hoinville had flown in Australia's 1952 World Gliding Championships team. The Gnome was built to test the performance and handling of a glider with a wing of short span, very low aspect ratio (6.18), and laminar flow aerofoil. The Gnome had a wood framed wing and a steel framed pod and boom fuselage, the whole covered in a mixture of plywood and fabric. Its cantilever, constant chord, high mounted wing was built around a single spar, placed at about 40% of the chord. Forward of the spar the wing was ply covered around the leading edge, forming a torsion resisting D-box. Behind the spar both wing and ailerons were fabric covered. The steel fuselage frame defined a nonohedral cross section, not including the keel, which with its fabric covering approximated a blunt oval. The cockpit was at the wing leading edge, with flat and single curvature panelled glazing which extended rearwards behind the leading edge, with side panels below the wing and an upper panel reaching into it for upwards vision. Near the trailing edge the outer fuselage framing simplified into four tubes forming a diamond cross section but also containing the boom, which emerged briefly (about ) from the fuselage as it tapered away aft. A straight edged, constant chord horizontal tail, the tailplane ply-skinned and the inset elevators fabric covered was mounted on the boom. Its vertical tail extended both above and below the boom, overall forming an irregular pentagon, with the fin ply skinned and the rudder fabric covered. Both vertical fin and rudder were low aspect ratio and broad chord. A short, steel sprung landing skid reached from near the nose almost to the trailing edge. The Gnome made its first flight, under aero-tow, on 1 May 1955. It handled safely and well but its performance was as poor as Schneider had predicted, its low aspect ratio wing producing high drag at the low speeds used in thermals. No soaring flights were made. During 1955, some alterations were made to the fuselage to clear the tail from the ground. When the Gnome was offered for manufacture in kit form no definite orders were received and development ended in 1956. The sole prototype then flew with the Port Pirie gliding club. ==SpecificationsReferences== Category:1950s Australian sailplanes ","title":"Schneider ES-54 Gnome"},{"id":"42076559","text":"Barbora Lukáčová (born April 28, 1990FIS Biography in Liptovský Mikuláš, Slovakia2014 profile) is an alpine skier from Slovakia.

Her mother, Joanna Catarina, was of Polish, German, and French extraction, while her father, Hans Theilade, was an engineer. In 1926, on the family's return to Denmark, she attended Asta Mollerup's ballet school in Copenhagen. After she was refused entry to the Royal Ballet's school when she was 12, her mother took her to Paris, hoping the best teachers of the time would ensure her development. Although Nini soon appeared in Carina Ari's performances in Montreux with the Opéra Comique ballet company, her mother was more ambitious. She decided to place her with the highly reputed Paris school run by Lubov Egorova who trained the stars of the Ballets Russes. ==CareerDancer=== In 1929, aged 14, Theilade appeared in The Hague in a solo programme of various pieces choreographed by Asta Mollerup. She was such a success that she went on tour in the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, France, Sweden and Finland. In 1931, she was a guest performer at the Royal Theatre, Copenhagen before touring the United States. From 1931, under Max Reinhardt, she appeared in Berlin, Vienna, Salzburg and Florence. She also starred both as a dancer and actress in Reinhardt's Hollywood film A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1935. From 1938-40, she played many leading roles in the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo which were choreographed for her by Léonide Massine. They included Poverty in Nobilissima Visione and Venus in Bacchanale with costumes by Salvador Dalí. She performed as a guest at New York's Metropolitan Opera dancing to Debussy's Clouds. ===Choreographer and instructor=== During the war years, she went to Brazil where she met her first husband, Piet Loopuyt, a Dutchman, with whom she had two children. They travelled widely together before arriving in Rio de Janeiro where Theilade became an instructor. In the 1950s, she was invited back to Copenhagen as a choreographer. Among her productions were Metaphor with music by Niels Viggo Bentzon with Mona Vangsaa in the highly erotic leading role, and Concerto with music by Robert Schumann. In 1965, she settled in Denmark, producing Græsstrået, one of the earliest ballets for television, by composer Else Marie Pade and author El Forman. It was followed by Psyche and Kalkbillede. From 1969 to 1978, she founded a ballet academy in Thurø with a ballet company that toured Europe. She also began her involvement as ballet instructor at Odense Theatre's school which was to last 30 years. After running into financial difficulties at Thurø, she and her second husband, Arne Buchter-Larsen, accepted an invitation to set up a three-year course of study in Lyon, the Académie de Ballet Nini Theilade. She left Lyon in 1990 at the age of 75 to return to Denmark where she continued to be active in drama and dance productions. In particular, she was to work for a further 20 years as dance instructor at Oure Folk School on the island of Funen. She died on 13 February 2018 at the age of 102. ==References== Category:1915 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Prima ballerinas Category:Danish ballerinas Category:Danish centenarians Category:People from Banyumas Regency Category:Women centenarians ","title":"Nini Theilade"},{"id":"42076573","text":"Dilara Kazimova presenting herself.

It is one of the most common minnows of Taiwan, found in the entire western part of the island from sea level to 1200 m elevation. It is a small species reaching a maximum length of TL. ==Colonization history== Opsariichthys pachycephalus populations show strong genetic structuring between drainages and weak genetic structuring within drainages. It is suggested that the current population structuring reflects colonization from two glacial refugia, formed when the cooler climate during the last glacial period restricted this species to lower elevations: one on the land bridge that connected Taiwan to the Asian mainland, and the other one in the south, east of the Gaoping River. Further divergence may be due to founder effects, bottlenecks, and selection. ==Reproduction== Opsariichthys pachycephalus show two peak spawning periods, one in spring (February–April) and the other one in summer (June–August), the former being the main one. During the courtship, males chase after one female, showing aggressive behaviours among the males. Only the winner of the male-male contests follow the female to spawn.

Mary R. Grizzle (née Pearson; August 19, 1921 – November 9, 2006), was a legislator and advocate of the Equal Rights Amendment, who served in both houses of the Florida state legislature. She was the first female Republican to serve in the Florida legislature. In 1963, she was elected to the Florida House of Representatives. From 1974 to 1978 she served as House Republican Leader Pro-Tempore, making her the first woman in Florida elected to a leadership position. In 1978, she was elected to the Florida Senate. She introduced and passed the Married Women Property Rights Act, which became law in 1970, giving married women in Florida, for the first time, the right to own property solely in their names and to transfer that property without their husbands' signatures. She also sponsored legislation admitting women to jury duty, providing equal pay for equal work, providing maternity leave for teachers, and requiring state licensing for child care centers. In 1972, she co-sponsored a bill that set strict standards on sewage dumped into Tampa Bay. ==Legacy== In 1990, the Florida Senate passed a resolution naming her \\"Dean of the Legislature\\" because she had the longest continuous term of service there. She stayed in the Senate until 1992. In 2003, she was inducted into the Florida Women's Hall of Fame.

Simeon the Elder appears to be shown at the left stepping down from his pillar in obedience to the monastic elders; the image may also reference a point in his life when, due to an ulcerous leg, he was forced to stand atop his pillar on one leg only. At right is represented Simeon Stylites the Younger (also known as 'St. Simeon of the Admirable Mountain'). A stylite (from Greek στυλίτης, stylitēs, \\"pillar dweller\\", derived from στῦλος, stylos, \\"pillar\\", ʼasṯonáyé) or pillar-saint is a type of Christian ascetic who lives on pillars, preaching, fasting and praying. Stylites believe that the mortification of their bodies would help ensure the salvation of their souls. Stylites were common in the early days of the Byzantine Empire. The first known stylite was Simeon Stylites the Elder who climbed a pillar in Syria in 423 and remained there until his death 37 years later. ==Ascetic precedents== Palladius of Galatia tells of Epidius, a hermit in Palestine who dwelt in a mountaintop cave for twenty-five years until his death. St. Gregory of Nazianzus (Patrologia Graeca 37, 1456) speaks of a solitary who stood upright for many years together, absorbed in contemplation, without ever lying down. Theodoret claimed that he had seen a hermit who had passed ten years in a tub suspended in midair from poles (Philotheus, chapter 28). ==Simeon Stylites and his contemporaries== In 423 Simeon Stylites the Elder took up his abode on the top of a pillar. Critics have recalled a passage in Lucian (De Syria Dea, chapters 28 and 29) which speaks of a high column at Hierapolis Bambyce to the top of which a man ascended twice a year and spent a week in converse with the gods, but the Catholic Encyclopedia argues that it is unlikely that Simeon had derived any suggestion from this pagan custom. In any case Simeon had a continuous series of imitators, particularly in Syria and Palestine. Daniel the Stylite may have been the first of these, for he had been a disciple of Simeon and began his rigorous way of life shortly after his master died. Daniel was a Syrian by birth but he established himself near Constantinople, where he was visited by both the Emperor Leo and the Emperor Zeno. Simeon the Younger, like his namesake, lived near Antioch; he died in 596, and had for a contemporary a hardly less famous Stylite, Saint Alypius, whose pillar had been erected near Hadrianopolis in Paphlagonia. Alypius, after standing upright for 53 years, found his feet no longer able to support him, but instead of descending from his pillar lay down on his side and spent the remaining fourteen years of his life in that position. Roger Collins, in his Early Medieval Europe, tells us that in some cases two or more pillar saints of differing theological viewpoints could find themselves within calling distance of each other, and would argue with one another from their columns. ==Other stylites== This tower in Um er-Rasas, Jordan, has been interpreted as a stylite column. Saint Luke the Younger, another famous pillar hermit, lived in the 10th century on Mount Olympus, though he also seems to have been of Asiatic parentage. Daniel the Stylite lived on his pillar for 33 years after being blessed by and receiving the cowl of St. Simeon the Stylite. There were many others besides these who were not so famous, and even female Stylites are known to have existed. One or two isolated attempts seem to have been made to introduce this form of asceticism into the West, but it met with little favour. In the East cases were found as late as the 12th century; in the Russian Orthodox Church the practice continued until 1461, and among the Ruthenians even later. For the majority of the pillar hermits the extreme austerity of the lives of the Simeons and of Alypius was somewhat mitigated. Upon the summit of some of the columns a tiny hut was erected as a shelter against sun and rain, and other hermits of the same class among the Miaphysites lived inside a hollow pillar rather than upon it. Nonetheless, the life was one of extraordinary endurance and privation. In recent centuries this form of monastic asceticism has become virtually extinct. However, in modern-day Georgia, Maxime Qavtaradze, a monk of the Orthodox Church, has lived on top of Katskhi Pillar for 20 years, coming down only twice a week. This pillar is a natural rock formation jutting upward from the ground to a height of approximately one hundred and forty feet. Evidence of use by stylites as late as the 13th century has been found on the top of the rock. With the aid of local villagers and the National Agency for Cultural Heritage Preservation of Georgia, Qavtaradze restored the 1200-year-old monastic chapel on the top of the rock. A film documentary on the project was completed in 2013. ==Popular culture== *The Vertigo stunt performed by David Blaine on 22 March 2002 was in part inspired by the Pillar-Saints, as he declared in the TV documentary about this stunt. *A song named \\"Stylitis\\" (\\"Stylite\\") was written by the Greek singer-songwriter Thanasis Papakonstantinou in 1998. ==Fiction== Alfred, Lord Tennyson wrote an 1841 poem \\"St Simeon Stylites\\", illustrated here by W.

The new regime praised him for his \\"early and faithful adherence to the King\\". He was knighted and made a justice of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland). He was appointed Recorder of Drogheda in 1655.D'Alton, John. History of Drogheda, Volume 1, p.259 ==Judge== As a judge he presided over one of the last Irish witch trials.Ball p.346 He also engaged in a dispute over precedence with his colleague Sir Jerome Alexander, who as a result is said to have challenged him to a duel, and then accused him of cowardice for refusing to accept the challenge. The two were neighbours in Ship Street, Dublin; Aston obtained permission from the Corporation to widen the street in front of his house. He also quarreled with the well-known Roman Catholic barrister Patrick D'Arcy, who had carried Alexander's challenge: according to one report, Aston tried unsuccessfully to have D'Arcy prosecuted. D'Arcy in turn threatened to horsewhip Aston, who is said to have gone in fear of him for some time after, although the story that he fled to England and stayed there until after D'Arcy's death is not borne out by the evidence.Burke, Oiver Anecdotes of the Connaught Circuit Hodges Figgis Dublin 1885 p.64 As well as his town house, he also had a country estate with a 15th Century castle at Richardstown in County Louth, which he obtained from the historic White family.Faulkner, Padraig.

He married secondly in 1642 Elizabeth Gill (née Fellgate), the daughter and widow of merchants of London, by whom he had two sons, William junior and John; she died in 1661. ===The case of Aston's son William, who was hanged for murder (1686)=== Aston's eldest son by Elizabeth Gill, William Aston junior (1643-1686), who was a barrister of Lincoln's Inn, killed a Mr Keating in a street brawl in Dublin in 1686 and was tried, convicted and hanged for his murder. The crime was considered so grave, and his defence of his actions so feeble, that the Crown, despite his high social standing, clearly decided to make an example of him. A good deal of trouble was taken to empanel a \\"good jury\\" i.e. one which could be trusted, with a certain amount of \\"persuasion\\" (a polite word for bullying) from the Bench, to bring in a guilty verdict.It was not then thought improper for judges to \\"persuade\\" i.e. coerce a jury into returning the desired verdict- Kenyon, J.P. The Stuart Constitution 2nd Edition Cambridge University Press 1986 p.406 The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon, referred to Aston with contempt, and wrote to his brother Lord Rochester that despite \\"great intercession\\" having been made on the young man's behalf, he could see no grounds for James II to exercise his prerogative of mercy.The Correspondence of Henry Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, with his brother Lawrence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester Vol.1 p.391 The only concession made to clemency was that, rather than Aston being hanged, drawn, and quartered and his body parts exposed in public, which was the usual penalty for an Irish murdererer at the time, his body, after a simple hanging would be released to his family for private burial.In England this was the normal penalty for treason, not murder, but in Ireland the more severe penalty applied to murder as well as treason - see Clarendon Correspondence p.391 ===Third marriage=== Sir William married thirdly, after 1661, Ursula Stockton, daughter of his judicial colleague, Thomas Stockton, and his wife Ursula Bellot of Great Moreton Hall, Cheshire, and had one surviving son, Thomas.

When the first verse ends, a guitar floats to the couple carrying a glass of beer for Bree and a glass of wine for Chelsea. When the second verse ends, the scene cuts to Chelsea smoking a cigarette and coughing as Bree is cleaning out the pool. When the third verse ends, the video cuts to an underwater scene in which Bree is swimming while attempting to play the electric guitar.

Selke began his professional career with Werder Bremen in 2013 where he went on to score 10 goals in 36 appearances before signing for RB Leipzig in 2015 for a 2. Bundesliga record fee of €8 million. He spent two seasons with Leipzig, helping the club earn promotion to the Bundesliga for the first time in 2016 and qualification to the UEFA Champions League the following year. Having scored 14 goals in 51 appearances, Selke then joined Hertha BSC in June 2017. He has also represented Germany at all youth levels and in 2014 was part of the squad which won the 2014 UEFA European Under-19 Championship, earning the Golden Boot and Golden Player awards for his performances at the tournament. Two years later, he featured at the 2016 Summer Olympics where Germany earned a silver medal, losing out to hosts Brazil in the final. The following year he helped his nation claim the UEFA European Under-21 Championship title. ==CareerWerder Bremen=== Having spent the majority of his youth years at Hoffenheim, Selke signed for Werder Bremen in 2013 for €50,000. While spending most of the 2013–2014 season playing for the reserves in the fourth-tier Regionalliga Nord, he made his first-team debut for the club on 3 November 2013, coming on as a second-half substitute for Clemens Fritz in a 3–2 Bundesliga victory over Hannover 96. The following month, Selke exchanged blows with Fritz during a training session, with the pair having to be separated by teammates. He ended the season having scored 9 goals in 26 appearances for the reserves and remaining goalless in three first-team appearances for Die Grün-Weißen. Selke started his career at Werder Bremen in 2013 and went on to score nine goals in 33 league appearances for the club. At the start of the 2014–15 campaign, Selke signed a new four-year deal with Bremen, tying him to the club until 2018. He scored his first goal on 20 September 2014, netting in a 4–2 Bundesliga loss against FC Augsburg. A late flurry of four goals and four assists in nine games from Selke helped Bremen to a tenth-placed finish in the league, thus securing their status in the Bundesliga for another season. He finished the season with 10 goals in 33 appearances in all competitions. Despite having signed a contract extension with Bremen a few months prior, Selke announced on 1 April 2015 that he would be joining then 2. Bundesliga side RB Leipzig at the end of the season. The €8m fee Leipzig paid for Selke made him the most expensive 2. Bundesliga signing in the history of the competition. With Selke having been courted throughout the season by a host of European clubs, including Real Madrid, his decision to drop down a division was seen as being financially motivated. This was especially the case given Leipzig's relationship with energy drink company, Red Bull. Following the announcement of his departure, Selke was jeered by parts of the Werder Bremen fan base during the remaining matches of the season. He ultimately scored 10 goals in 36 appearances for the club. ===RB Leipzig=== Selke became the most expensive player in 2. Bundesliga history when he signed for RB Leipzig in 2015. Selke made his debut for RB Leipzig on 25 July 2015 against FSV Frankfurt and scored his first goal for the club the following week, netting in a 2–2 draw with Greuther Fürth. On 21 November, Selke netted the only goal in a 1–0 win over Arminia Bielefeld which saw Leipzig climb to the summit of 2.Liga. On 8 May, Die roten Bullen secured promotion with a match to spare after beating Karlsruher SC 2–0. It was the first time in the club's short history that they had been promoted to the Bundesliga. During the post match celebrations, Leipzig manager Ralf Rangnick pulled his hamstring after being chased by Selke with a glass of beer. He finished the 2015–16 season with 10 goals in 32 appearances. Selke scored his first goal for the 2016–17 Bundesliga season on matchday three, scoring one and assisting another in a 3–1 win over Hamburg. On matchday 32, he netted a brace in a 4–1 win over Hertha BSC which saw the Leipzig qualify for the Champions League for the first time in the club's history. He struggled for first-team football throughout the season, however, and started in just four out of 20 appearances for the campaign, scoring four goals. ===Hertha BSC=== On 1 June 2017, Hertha BSC confirmed the signing of Selke on a long-term deal for a reported club record fee of €8.5m. The following month, Selke suffered a metatarsal injury in training which was later diagnosed to be a bone-marrow edema, and was ruled out for a number of weeks. He eventually made his first league appearance for Hertha on matchday eight, coming off the bench in a 2–0 loss to Schalke 04. He scored his first goal for the club four days later, netting in a 2–1 Europa League defeat to Zorya. On 5 November, he scored his first league goal, netting in a 3–3 draw with Wolfsburg. The following month, Selke came up against RB Leipzig for the first time since joining Hertha BSC and prior to the match he vowed to celebrate if he scored against his former club. He proceeded to score twice to lead Hertha to a 3–2 win despite his side being down to 10-men after Jordan Torunarigha was sent off in the eighth minute. On 14 March 2018, following a run of three months without a goal, Selke netted another brace in a 2–1 win over Köln, the second of which was the 1000th home goal scored in the Bundesliga by Hertha. His return to goal scoring form continued with Selke enjoying a run of five goals in four matches during the final stages of the season to end the campaign with a return of 10 goals in 27 appearances. In July 2018, Selke suffered a collapsed lung which ruled him out of the start of the 2018–19 season. Following a successful recovery, he featured regularly under manager Pal Dardai and by February 2019, despite having only scored four goals, had recorded eight assists in the league; more than he had in each of his previous campaigns combined. The following month, he made his 50th league appearance for the club during a 3–2 defeat to Borussia Dortmund. On 31 January 2020, the last day of the 2019–20 winter transfer period, Selke re-joined Werder Bremen on a loan deal lasting until the summer of 2021. The transfer reportedly includes an obligation for Werder Bremen to sign him permanently at the end of the loan for an estimated transfer fee between €10 and 15 million, which only takes effect if the club remains in the Bundesliga. ==International careerGerman national youth teams=== Though born in Schorndorf, Germany, Selke is eligible to represent both Ethiopia, the birthplace of his father, and the Czech Republic, the birthplace of his mother. He and fellow German youth international teammate Gedion Zelalem had in the past been approached by the Ethiopian Football Association to represent the African nation but both players elected to remain within the German camp. 2016 Rio Olympics In 2014, he helped Germany win the UEFA European Under-19 Championship. Selke netted six goals throughout the tournament which earned him the Golden Boot award. His goalscoring tally equaled the tournament record, jointly held by Borko Veselinović and Álvaro Morata. Selke was also named as the tournament's Golden Player. On 16 July 2016, Selke was named in Horst Hrubesch's 18-man squad for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. He scored his first goal at the tournament on 7 August, netting Germany's second in a 3–3 draw with South Korea. Germany ultimately went on to win the Silver Medal, losing to Brazil in the final. The following year, he was included in Germany's 23-man squad for the 2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Poland where they went on to be crowned champions after beating Spain 1–0 in the final. ==Style of play== Former Germany striker Klaus Fischer described Selke as being a \\"young Miroslav Klose\\", comparing his stature and strength in the air with that of Germany's all-time record goalscorer. Selke himself, however, cites former Bayern Munich striker Mario Gómez as being his idol. ==Career statistics== {   + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club!!rowspan=\\"2\\"Season!!colspan=\\"3\\"League!!colspan=\\"2\\"Cup1!!colspan=\\"2\\"Europe2!!colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !League!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"3\\"Werder Bremen2013–14Bundesliga3000colspan=\\"2\\"—30 - 2014–15Bundesliga30931colspan=\\"2\\"—3310 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total!!33!!9!!3!!1!!0!!0!!36!!10 - rowspan=\\"3\\"RB Leipzig2015–162.

He was the most important representative of Neo- Impressionism in Germany. ==Life== He began as a flower painter at the Royal Porcelain Factory.Ketterer Kunst: Biography In 1877, he decided to study with Friedrich Preller at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. A year later, he switched to the Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School, where he studied under Theodor Hagen until 1887. During his studies, he travelled to Mecklenburg and Hamburg as well as Holland and Flanders. In 1888, he stayed briefly at the art colony in Dachau District. During a trip to Paris in 1890, he had his first encounter with French Impressionism. Afterwards, he left Dachau and spent four years in Knokke, Belgium, where he became friends with Camille Pissarro and the Belgian pointillist painter Théo van Rysselberghe. In 1894, he returned to Dresden and became part of the Dresden Secession. However, he continued to be restless and, in 1895, moved to Sint Anna ter Muiden near Sluis, where he lived until 1908. Even so, his stay there was interrupted by numerous trips to Berlin, the south of France, Italy and Turkey. While visiting Berlin in 1902, he became a member of the Berlin Secession. In 1909, he joined the Neue Künstlervereinigung München (N.K.V.M.) and participated in their first exhibition. That same year, he received the Villa Romana Prize, which included a one-year stay in Rome. He then travelled to Tuscany, remaining there for four years in San Gimignano and, then, Florence. After the outbreak of war in 1914, he returned to Germany and became a professor at the Academy. But, after a year, he was again on the move. He stayed briefly at the Willingshäuser Art Colony and went from there to Neustadt near Marburg. When his friend, Carl Bantzer, was appointed professor at the Kunsthochschule Kassel in 1918, Baum took his place as a teacher of landscape painting. In 1921, he bought a house in Marburg, intending it to be his permanent residence but, from 1924 on, lived mostly in San Gimignano. He died of pneumonia there in 1932. ==Selected paintings== File:Paul Baum - Weimar, Nach dem Regen.jpgWeimar in the Rain (1883) File:Paul Baum Flusslandschaft in Mecklenburg c1895.jpgRiver Landscape in Mecklenburg (1895) File:Paul Baum 010.JPGSint Anna ter Muiden (c.1902) File:Paul Baum - Landschaft bei Hyères.jpgLandscape near Hyères (1909) ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Allgemeines Künstlerlexikon.

It was removed on 9 November 2003 due to mechanical failure in the ride's gearbox, and inability to source required parts. The park also needed space to build their new roller coaster for 2005, Rita: Queen of Speed. It first opened at the park in 1995 under the name \\"Energizer\\", but ran on less intense cycles in its later years to better suit Ug Land's intended family audience. ==HistoryEnergizer (1995-2000)=== Energizer first opened on 18 March 1995 on the former 1001 Nights site in Festival Park area (known as UG Land from 1999-2009). The ride brought in many crowds of teenagers and thrill- seekers. At the time, this ride was extremely popular because of how it swung from side to side so much with only a lap bar to keep visitors secure. Being alongside the Corkscrew, a world-famous attraction, the ride normally had quite long queue times. When X-Sector opened in 1998, Energizer was re-located into the new area. It still proved to be popular while next to Oblivion, the world's first vertical drop roller coaster, now pulling in guests of all ages. At the end of 2000, Energizer was removed to make way for Submission, a Chance Double Inverter. As of 2014, Submission has also been removed from the park. ===Boneshaker (2001-2003)=== After what was thought to be the end of Energizer, it returned to its original area under the name of Boneshaker at the back of the newly re-themed Festival Park, UG Land. Due to UG Land being a family area, the ride's settings were changed and it never operated the way it used to ever again. Following these setting changes, the ride experienced many faults and became extremely costly for the park to maintain. The park decided to close the attraction at the end of the 2003 season, and at the end of 2004 it was removed to make way for the new 2005 roller coaster.

CIMI's goal is to enable users to manage cloud infrastructure in a simple way by standardizing interactions between cloud environments to achieve interoperable cloud infrastructure management between service providers and their consumers and developers. CIMI 1.1 was registered as an International Standard in August 2014 by the Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). == Overview == The CIMI standard is defined and published by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF). It includes the Cloud Infrastructure Management Interface (CIMI) Model and RESTful HTTP-based Protocol specification, the CIMI XML Schema, the CIMI Primer and the CIMI Uses Cases whitepaper: *Cloud Infrastructure Management Interface (CIMI) Model and RESTful HTTP-based Protocol :The Cloud Infrastructure Management Interface (CIMI) Model and RESTful HTTP-based Protocol Specification defines the architecture and concepts of CIMI. *CIMI XML Schema :The CIMI XML Schema defines the XML representation of the CIMI model. *CIMI Primer :The CIMI Primer explains how clients can use the CIMI API for some common use cases, such as listing Machine Images and Configurations, creating a Machine from a Template and then retrieving details about it. *CIMI Use Cases :The CIMI Use Cases whitepaper collects a number of use cases that typify the next generation of issues facing IaaS providers and that are being considered to be addressed in the next version of the CIMI specification, such as Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery, Service Level Objective Management, Log / Metadata Management and Multicloud Management. == Goals == CIMI aims to provide a single set of interfaces that a cloud consumer can use to provision and manage their cloud infrastructure in multiple clouds, so client code does not need to be adapted to each of the proprietary interfaces from these multiple vendors. CIMI has been described as a de jure standard that is under change control of a standards body, contrasting it to a de facto standard where typically one vendor has change control over the interface, and everyone else has to reverse engineer the inner workings of it. It is expecting vendors to embrace a dual strategy of delivering two offerings – one a CIMI compliant offering and the second a more proprietary offering that allows for more proprietary functionality. == Scope == CIMI is scoped to the core IaaS functionality such as deploying and managing Machines, Volumes, Networks, Monitoring, and Systems that group them. It includes a feature discovery mechanism to find out what functions the cloud provider supports, including the metadata describing capabilities and resource constraints. == Model and Features  Model === The CIMI model describes in detail all the resources that are accessible by the Cloud Consumer and that are maintained by the Cloud Provider, and their relationships. The main entry point for the CIMI Consumer is the IaaS Provider's Cloud Entry Point. All other data is discovered, iteratively: * Pointers to Machines, Volumes, Networks, Systems (a grouping of resources managed as a single unit), Machine Images, Credentials, ... * Templates to provision new resources such as Machines, Volumes, Networks and Systems * Monitoring resources such as Meters, Events & Event Logs (for notifications from the Provider, with time, type (error, warning, ...), severity, etc.) * Jobs (one or more processes or actions directed to accomplish a specific goal, performed by the Provider) * Metadata describing capabilities and resources constraints * Optional provider extensions The model is self-describing and allows for querying its own metadata, e.g., to discover which extensions have been implemented. The model is also extensible by the Consumer and the Provider. The model also defines serializations both in XML and JSON for each resource. === Features === CIMI addresses the management of the lifecycle of infrastructure provided by an IaaS Provider, such as the creation, deletion, viewing and alteration of virtual machines, networks and storage, and start and stop operations. It also defines resource operations such as creating machine images or snapshots of machines for backup & restore, or for creation of additional identical virtual machines. CIMI allows the import of an OVF package to create a System with Machines and other CIMI resources, as well as the export of a CIMI System of resources to an OVF package. The actual import and export of OVF packages is handled by the underlying hypervisor under the management of the CIMI implementation. == Protocols == CIMI currently supports the REST architectural style using HTTP for all interactions between the Consumer and the Providers. Mappings to SOAP and WS-MAN are also considered. This protocol binding follows REST principles and describes the mapping of HTTP protocol verbs to operations on the model: Each request is sent by using an HTTP verb such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, and includes a message body in either JSON or XML format. Each response uses a standard HTTP status code, whose semantics are interpreted in the context of the particular request that was made. == Implementations == Several adapters have been developed that expose a CIMI API endpoint for client applications to consume and translate API calls to the proprietary API calls of supported target cloud provider(s). The following is a list of CIMI implementations: * Apache Deltacloud * OW2 Sirocco Project * StratusLab Project * CIMI interface for OpenStack The CIMI Working Group has announced plug-fests for improved interoperability between CIMI implementations. == See also == * Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) * Infrastructure as Code * Open Virtualisation Format (OVF) ==References== Category:Cloud computing Category:Application programming interfaces Category:DMTF standards Category:Cloud standards Category:Open standards Category:ISO/IEC standards ","title":"Cloud Infrastructure Management Interface"},{"id":"42077378","text":"Alemão is a 2014 Brazilian action-drama film directed by José Eduardo Belmonte starring Antônio Fagundes, Cauã Reymond, Caio Blat, Gabriel Braga Nunes, Marcello Melo Jr. and Milhem Cortaz. The story presented in the film takes place a few days before the invasion of the Complexo do Alemão by the military police, which occurred on November 26, 2010.Alemão : Curiosidades - AdoroCinema ==Plot== Doca (Otávio Müller), Danillo (Gabriel Braga Nunes), Carlinhos (Marcello Melo Jr.), Branco (Milhem Cortaz), and Samuel (Caio Blat) are five policemen working undercover at the Complexo do Alemão, an area which gathers several slums and is considered one of the most dangerous places in Rio de Janeiro.G1 - Cauã Reymond vive traficante em 'Alemão'; veja o trailer - notícias em Cinema Their operation goes wrong after the government threatens to raid the place using military vehicles, which leads local drug lord Playboy (Cauã Reymond) to cut off all the slum's communications, leaving them unable to contact their boss, Samuel's father sheriff Valadares (Antonio Fagundes) and forcing them to hide at the basement of Doca's pizzeria, which serves as their base of operations. Their situation is worsened when Valadares' assistant Pixixo (Izak Dahora) is almost killed by Playboy's men and drops a briefcase containing details on all the policemen infiltrated in the slums. All five police officers manage to meet at the pizzeria, some barely escaping from the drug dealers. Carlinhos is the last to arrive and is thus immediately blamed by Branco (the chief of the operation) as the one who gave up their real identities. He denies, but ends up handcuffed. Carlinhos is also the lover of Leticia (Aisha Jambo), sister of Senegal (Jefferson Brasil), Playboy's right-hand man. Meanwhile, Mariana (Mariana Nunes), a local resident who works as a cleaner, leaves her son at home and enters the pizzeria with her own key to claim her service's money. She goes down into the basement and is captured by Branco. Even after Doca explains that she's innocent and has a son, Branco forbids her of getting out, fearing she may reveal their location, specially after he discovers her son's father is Playboy. Meanwhile, tension grows as the government assembles military forces to raid the slums and Valadares is frustrated at not being able to contact his son and his officers. Playboy has his henchmen interrogate people on the streets and in their houses, seeking information leading to the police officers. Knowing that Carlinhos is in love with Leticia, Playboy convinces Senegal to use his own sister as a bait for the officer. He puts her in a car and travels around the slum, threatening to kill her and using a loudspeaker to make his intentions known to Carlinhos wherever he is. Carlinhos is finally allowed by Branco to go rescue the girl. After hearing Mariana say that police officers always leave their partners behind when hell breaks loose, Branco goes to his aid. He tells Senegal that they have Mariana, Playboy's long-time passion, and that he must let them go if they want Mariana alive. After the officers leave, Senegal decides to break into their pizzeria, but without asking Playboy first. He assembles a bunch of gunmen and raids the pizzeria. No one survives the resulting gunfight but for Leticia and Mariana. Mariana is later found by Pixixo, who puts her on the phone with Valadares. She confirms that no officer survived the battle, and Valadares collapses, crying over the loss of his son. The film ends with scenes and facts about the 2010 Complexo do Alemão raid, which are followed by images of the 2013 protests in Brazil. == Cast == * Caio Blat as Samuel * Milhem Cortaz as Branco * Otávio Müller as Doca * Cauã Reymond as Playboy * Gabriel Braga Nunes as Danillo * Marcello Melo Jr. as Carlinhos * Antonio Fagundes as sheriff Valadares * Mariana Nunes as Mariana * Jefferson Brasil as Senegal * Aisha Jambo as Leticia * Izak Dahora as Pixixo ==Awards and nominations== {  width=\\"75%\\"; style=\\"text- align:center; - !Year !Organization !Category !Nominee(s) !Result ! - 2017 45th International Emmy Awards Best TV Movie/miniseries    } ==References * Category:Brazilian films Category:Brazilian action drama films Category:2014 action drama films Category:Films set in Rio de Janeiro (city) Category:2014 films Category:Action films based on actual events Category:2014 drama films ","title":"Alemão (film)"},{"id":"42077419","text":"Mamurras Stadium is a multi-use stadium in Mamurras, Albania.

He attended college and then law school at Willamette University. After graduation, he practiced law and operated a ranch in Clatskanie in Columbia County, Oregon. He served four terms in the Oregon House of Representatives, from 1971 until his death in 1978. During the 1977 legislative session, he came within one vote of being elected speaker of the House of Representatives. == Early life == Magruder was born in Portland, Oregon, in 1946, the son of Kent and Caroline Magruder. He grew up on a farm in Columbia County owned by his family since 1905.\\"Dick Magruder\\", Oregon Voter Digest, \\"Who's Who in the 1971 Oregon Legislature\\" edition, Metropolitan Publications, Portland, Oregon, December 15, 1970, pp. 107–108.\\"House's 'resident leprechaun' recalled as brilliant maverick\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, June 20, 1978, p. B4.\\"Richard Brooke Magruder\\", Oregon, Death Index, 1903–1998, accessed via FamilySearch, January 9, 2014. As a youth, Magruder participated in 4-H farming activities. He raised champion sheep that were shown at the Oregon State Fair from 1957 through 1962. In 1964, one of his steers won champion honors at the State Fair. That same year, Magruder won the state's highest 4-H achievement award for his accomplishments. By the time he left for college in 1964, he was the top crop and livestock judge at the Columbia County Fair.\\"Cited for 4-H Achievement\\", The Times, Brownsville, Oregon, December 31, 1964, p. 5. Magruder attended Willamette University, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1968. He then attended law school at Willamette. While he was a law student, Magruder became chairman of the Columbia County Democratic Central Committee and was also a member of the Oregon Democratic Central Committee. During his final year in law school, Magruder ran for a seat in the Oregon House of Representatives and won. He finished his law school course work at the end of 1970 and received a Doctor of Jurisprudence degree the following spring.Federman, Stan, \\"Country bumpkin façade keeps smart political cookie fresh,\\" The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, May 1, 1977. After law school, Magruder moved home to Clatskanie where he managed his family's ranch. He also opened a part-time law practice in a local livestock feed store. Magruder was a member of the Columbia County Livestock Association, the Oregon Cattlemen's Association, and the Oregon Sheep Growers Association. == Political career == In 1970, at the age of 23, Magruder ran as a Democrat for the District 2 seat in the state House of Representatives.\\"Demo, Republican to Oppose Turner\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, March 20, 1970. At that time, District 2 represented Columbia County, a mostly rural county along the Columbia River in northwestern Oregon. In the Democratic primary, Magruder defeated the seven-term incumbent, Wayne Turner, by a margin of more than a two-to-one. In the November general election, he easily defeated his Republican opponent, once again winning with a two-to-one margin. He took his seat in the state legislature in January 1971 and served through mid-June when the legislature's regular session ended.\\"1971 Regular Session (56th): January 11-June 10\\", Oregon Legislators and Staff Guide, Oregon Secretary of State, Salem, Oregon, December 28, 2013. After the 1971 legislative session, the House of Representatives was re-districted and Magruder's home in Clatskanie became part of District 1. The new district included Columbia County and parts of Washington County. In 1972, he ran for the House seat in District 1. In a re-match of the 1970 Democratic primary, Magruder beat former state representative Wayne Turner, receiving 61 percent of the vote. No Republicans filed for the District 1 seat so Magruder was unopposed in the general election.\\"Will Democrats Gain Control of the Legislature?\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, May 21, 1972, p.

During that time, he was instrumental in establishing the College of Veterinary Medicine at Oregon State University and funding a new building to house the college.Thompson, Wayne, \\"House Votes to Resurrect Fair Share\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, September 7, 1973, p.

In 1976, Magruder easily beat two opponents in the Democratic primary, receiving 68 percent of the vote.\\"Washington Vote Tallied\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, May 27, 1976, p. C6. However, he faced a tough opponent in the general election. Because of his conservative voting record in the House of Representative, his Republican opponent was endorsed by the AFL-CIO and the Oregon Education Association.\\"Columbia Campaign Trail Hot\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, October 31, 1976, p. B1. At the same time, Magruder was endorsed by Oregon's largest newspaper, The Oregonian.\\"Oregonian's Choices on Candidates, Issues\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, November 1, 1976, p. C8. In November, Magruder was re-elected with 52 percent of the vote.\\"Washington County\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, November 4, 1976, p.

During the turbulent 1977 legislative session, Magruder helped build a coalition of Republicans and moderate and conservative Democrats that ultimately stripped the Democratic speaker, Philip D. Lang, of his power. At the beginning of the session, Magruder joined with House Republican leader Roger E. Martin and a small group of conservative Democrat to oppose the Democratic caucus' choice for speaker. As a result, Magruder came within one vote of being elected speaker.Cogswell, Phil, \\"Legislative arithmetic vital skill in House\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, March 22, 1977, p. B14. After Lang was elected speaker, he appointed Magruder as chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee. However, Magruder's conservative fiscal views put him at odds with House liberals including the Speaker. This on-going conflict encouraged further cooperation between conservative Democrats led by Magruder and the Republican minority in the House. The influence of this coalition continued to grow throughout the legislative session. In May 1977, a small group of moderate Democrats joined the coalition. In a quick legislative move, the expanded coalition voted to transfer the speaker's power to the House Rules Committee which was controlled by the coalition leaders. While the speaker was not removed from office, the Rules Committee took control of virtually every aspect of House operations. As a member of the Rules Committee, Magruder played a key role in setting the legislative agenda for the remainder of the 1977 session.Cogswell, Phil, \\"Members of House Challenge Speaker\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, May 3, 1977.\\"Lang wants Caucuses to Pick Interim Panels\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, June 7, 1977, p. B15.Federman, Stan, \\"House power struggle likely to leave more losers than Lang\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, May 8, 1977. In 1978, Magruder ran for another term in the Oregon House of Representatives. In the May primary election, he lost the Democratic nomination to Garland Brown. The race was very close with Maguder winning in Washington County by 288 votes and losing in Columbia County by just a few votes more. At the same time, Magruder won the Republican primary with write-in votes. This could have allowed him to run again in the November general election. However, before he made any announcements about his political future, Magruder was killed in a farm accident.Federman, Stan, \\"House Hornets' 'chief stinger' defeated\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, May 25, 1978, p. 13. == Death == On June 19, 1978, Magruder was killed while working on his ranch near Clatskanie. He was using a farm tractor to free another tractor stuck in a muddy meadow when his tractor flipped over backwards, crushing him.\\"State Rep. Magruder, 31, killed when tractor flips\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, June 20, 1978, p. 1.Willis, Henny, \\"Dick Magruder death shocks legislative colleagues, officials\\", Eugene Register-Guard, Eugene, Oregon, June 20, 1978, p. 2B.\\"Rep. Dick Magruder, 31, dies in tractor mishap\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, June 20, 1978. Despite his many political battles, Magruder was well liked by everyone at the Oregon State Capitol. Even urban liberals, who he routinely hindered and vexed, were personal friends. The House Speaker, Phil Lang, said: Oregon's governor, Robert W. Straub, praised Magruder, saying: On June 22, 1978, a memorial service for Magruder was held in the House chamber at the Oregon State Capitol. Over 500 people attended the service.\\"Magruder memorial service draws 500\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, June 23, 1978, p. 24. == Legacy == After Magruder's death, Oregon law required the Columbia and Washington county commissioners to select another Democrat to fill the remaining six months of his two-year term in the Oregon House of Representatives. Instead of selecting Garland Brown, who had beaten Magruder in the Democratic primary a month before his death, the commissioners selected Magruder's mother, Caroline, to finish his term. Since Magruder had won the Republican primary with write-in votes, his death created the opportunity for the local Republican committee to nominate a new candidate to represent their party in the general election. Instead of selecting a Republican, the committee chose Caroline Magruder, a Democrat. As a result, Brown faced a newly appointed incumbent Democrat, Caroline Magruder, in the 1978 general election.McDonough, S., \\"Challenges Press Incumbents\\", The Oregonian, Portland, November 5, 1978, p. E5. In the November election, Mrs. Magruder beat Brown, taking her son's seat in the state legislature.\\"Legislative Table\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, May 25, 1978, p. C5. \\"1979 Regular Session (60th): January 8-July 4\\", Oregon Legislators and Staff Guide, Oregon Secretary of State, Salem, Oregon, December 28, 2013. During a special session in September 1978, the Oregon legislature directed the state's Board of Higher Education to name the new veterinary school at Oregon State University after Magruder. In 1979, Oregon State University began construction of a $8.5 million facility to house the university's college of veterinary medicine. The building was completed in 1980 and named Magruder Hall. Every year, Oregon State University awards the Dick Magruder Memorial Scholarship to a number of students majoring in veterinary medicine. The scholarship recognizes Magruder for his leadership in establishing the university's veterinary college. As of 2014, the scholarship provides $1,000 to selected students.\\"Scholarships\\", College of Veterinary Medicine, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, January 28, 2014.\\"Dick Magruder Memorial Scholarship\\", Scholarship Library, www.scholarshiplibrary.com, One on One Marketing, Lehi, Utah, January 28, 2014. ==References External links == *Oregon Legislators and Staff Guide from Oregon Secretary of State Category:1946 births Category:1978 deaths Category:People from Clatskanie, Oregon Category:Members of the Oregon House of Representatives Category:Oregon Democrats Category:Oregon lawyers Category:Agriculture in Oregon Category:Willamette University alumni Category:Willamette University College of Law alumni Category:20th-century American lawyers Category:Ranchers from Oregon Category:20th-century American politicians ","title":"Dick Magruder"},{"id":"42077465","text":"The Texas Educational Assessment of Minimum Skills or TEAMS was the second standardized test used in Texas, from 1984 until 1990.

William Shaw \\"of the strand\\" (1797–1853) was a British agricultural writer, editor and translator, first editor of the agricultural journal Mark Lane Express, and of The Farmer's almanac and calendar, and co-founder of the Farmers Club in 1842.Nicholas Goddard, \\"William Shaw \\"of the Strand\\" and the foundation of the Royal Agricultural Society of England\\", JRASE, 143, 1982, pp 98–104 He is known for advocating agricultural reforms and improvements. == Life and work == William Shaw was born in Bath, Somerset in 1797, as eldest son of John Shaw of Bath. He spent two years from June 1813 to June 1815 at Wadham College, Oxford,Gardiner, Reg. ii. 261 and was admitted to the Inner Temple on 20 June 1828, being called to the bar on 22 November 1833. In 1832 Shaw co-founded the weekly agricultural journal Mark Lane Express, of which he became its first editor. The other co-founders were Cuthbert William Johnson (1799–1878), John Rogerson and Joseph Rogerson, farmers from Lincolnshire, Doctor J. Blackstone,Carrie de Silva A short history of agricultural education and research. Harper Adams University, Newport, Shropshire. 2013. and George Parker Tuxford. In his position as editor Shaw played a leading role in advocating innovative farming techniquesAdam Hope, Adam Crerar, Champlain Society (2007) Letters of Adam Hope, 1834–1845. p. 73 and the formation of agricultural societies and farmer's clubs in Britain.Joan Thirsk, Edward John T.

He was chosen the first secretary, a position which he resigned in the following year, when he was elected 7 August 1839 a member of the council. Shaw was also elected honorary member of the French Académie d'Agriculture. In 1838 he had started with his lifelong friend, Cuthbert William Johnson. In 1841 they started as the first editors of The Farmer's almanac and calendar. This publication had an annual sale of about 15,000 between 1841 and 1865, and was according to Goddard (1983), \\"probably among the most widely read of all agricultural publications of the nineteenth century.\\"Goddard, Nicholas. \\"The Development and Influence of Agricultural Periodicals and Newspapers, 1780–1880.\\" The Agricultural History Review (1983): 116–131. The Farmers' Almanack and Calendar continued to be issued annually in their joint names, notwithstanding Shaw's death in 1853, until 1872. Shaw was a great supporter of farmers' clubs, and a frequent speaker and reader of papers at them. The establishment of the London Farmers Club in 1842 was greatly owing to his efforts, and he was honorary secretary from 1840 to 1843. Other founders of the Farmers Club were James Allen Ransome, Robert Baker, and one or two others.\\"James Allen Ransome\\" in: The Farmer's Magazine, Rogerson and Tuxford, Vol. 11th, 3rd Series, January to July 1857. p. 1-2. In 1844 Shaw and Johnson translated and brought out an English edition of Von Thaer's Principles of Agriculture. Between 1846 and 1849, Shaw edited the Steeplechase Calendar and collaborated with Henry Corbet, editor of the Mark Lane Express since its foundation in 1832, and Philip Pusey in an investigation into tenant rights. He read before this body six papers on tenant right and two on agricultural statistics. He took up enthusiastically the then novel but soon burning question of tenant right. In 1848 with Corbet he published an extensive Digest of Evidence on the Agricultural Customs of England and Wales. This was a digest of the evidence on tenant right given in the previous year before the famous committee of the House of Commons presided over by Philip Pusey. This digest was very popular, and is still useful for reference; a second edition appeared in 1854. In 1849 he participated in the North Hampshire by-election as tenant farmer. On 1 April 1850 Shaw was presented with a service of silver plate by the tenant farmers for his advocacy of their cause, when he was described by the chairman who made the presentation as \\"the Cobden of Agriculture.\\"Farmer's Mag. 1850, xxi. 407 He was one of the chief founders of the Farmers' Insurance Company established in 1840, and amalgamated in 1888 with the Alliance Insurance Company, of which he was managing director. He was managing director also of a less successful venture, the Farmers' and Graziers' Mutual Cattle Insurance Association, established 1844, which fell into difficulties in 1849. Other ventures of Shaw's proved unsuccessful, and during the time of the railway mania he had money troubles. In November 1852 he fled to Australia to escape bankruptcy, where, some time in 1853, he died very miserably in the gold diggings far up the country, with only a few pence in his pocket. He was married, but lived apart from his wife. Shaw was of commanding presence and had fine features. There is a small portrait of him by Richard Ansdell (1842) in the rooms of the Royal Agricultural Society at 13 Hanover Square. This was reproduced in the engraving of the society subsequently published in 1843. Back in London Henry Corbet succeeded Shaw, both as editor of The Farmer's almanac and calendar, and as secretary of the Farmers Club. == Selected publications == * Cuthbert W.

It was one of the most severe winter storms of the 2013–14 North American winter storm season, storm affecting most of the Western Seaboard (especially California), and various parts of the Eastern United States, bringing damaging winds, flash floods, blizzard conditions, icy conditions. ==Meteorological history== On February 23, 2014, an extratropical disturbance developed over the northeast Pacific. The system slowly began to intensify as it moved eastwards, before encountering an omega block that was situated over Alaska and the Northwest Pacific, on February 24, 2014. Over the next few days, the omega block broke down, and the system began to intensify more rapidly as it moved towards the southeast. On February 27, 2014, meteorologists identified the system as having of high risk of having major impacts in the United States. Winter Weather Watches and Winter Storm Warnings were initiated in many different parts of the Western United States. After a previous, weaker winter storm had moved through the West Coast on February 26, the winter storm turned towards California, resulting in Flash Flood warnings and high wind advisories being issued. During the next 2 days, the storm system underwent explosive intensification and also developed an eye-like feature, reaching an intensity of 976 millibars on February 27, before deepening further to its peak intensity of on February 28. Around that time, the winter storm was predicted to bring ice, snow, and blizzard conditions to the Central and Eastern States of the US. Afterwards, the system slowly began to weaken as it continued bearing down on the West Coast, although it continued to maintain its organization. The storm brought powerful winds and heavy torrents throughout much of the Western Seaboard, especially in California. Flash floods ensued throughout many parts of the state, resulting in some road closures. Early on March 1, the eye of the storm disappeared as the organization of the system began to deteriorate. Later on March 1, the winter storm continued to shrink in size as it weakened further, and the storm began moving ashore in Southern California. A secondary circulation developed near the southern end of the storm's circulation, which quickly dominated the system; the original surface low became completely detached from the system and was absorbed into another approaching storm on March 3. On March 1, the winter storm also spawned an EF0 tornado over Arizona, which was the confirmed first tornado in the Greater Phoenix since January 2005. Late on March 1, 2014, the winter storm's low-level circulation center made landfall over San Diego County. Several hours later, the winter storm passed through California, even as the storm weakened to on March 2. The winter storm triggered severe thunderstorms, and dropped hail while it passed through the Southwestern United States. The storm began to accelerate towards the east while building up convection. During the next couple of days, the winter storm's structure began to break down; however, the storm still brought blizzard conditions and ice to the Eastern United States. Early on March 4, the winter storm weakened and exited the east coast of the Carolinas, before being absorbed into the circulation of a much larger extratropical cyclone centered over the Labrador Sea later that day. ==Impacts== On March 1, The storm caused at least 2 fatalities, at least 44 injuries, as well as several car accidents. On the same day, a plane was moved 3 feet and damaged by a microburst, near the John Wayne Airport at Santa Ana, California. While moving eastward across the United States, the storm caused more road accidents, and downed numerous trees and power lines. The storm also produced an EF0 tornado 9 miles south of Karnak, California, which lasted for 5 minutes. Another person was killed in Kansas, along with a student in Oklahoma. The winter storm later killed another 12 people and injured dozens more, before the storm weakened and left the East Coast on March 4, 2014. ===Precipitation totals=== North Carolina *Highest snowfall total reported was 2.5 inches at Norlina and Concord.

A Lieutenant Colonel of the Polish Army, he took part in the September Campaign. Arrested by the Soviets, he escaped and returned to his native Vilna, where he soon joined the Polish underground: the Service for Poland's Victory, the Union of Armed Struggle and finally the Home Army. He took part in the Operation Ostra Brama as commanding officer of the East group attacking the city of Vilna from the direction of Nowa Wilejka and Belmont. After the success of the operation and the arrest of most of the commanders of the Polish forces by the Soviet NKVD, Olechnowicz was one of the few officers to evade capture and assumed the role of the new commanding officer of the Vilna Home Army Area. In the summer of 1945 he evacuated his headquarters to Central Poland. Arrested by the communist authorities, he was sentenced to death in a show trial and buried in an unmarked grave. During his service in the underground, he used a variety of noms de guerre, including \\"Meteor\\", \\"Kurkowski\\", \\"Pohorecki\\", \\"Lawicz\\", \\"Krzysztof\\", \\"Roman Wrzeski\\" and \\"Kurcewicz\\". == Biography == Antoni Olechnowicz was born 13 June 1905 in Marguciszki, a small hamlet near Święciany (modern Švenčionys) in what is now Lithuania. He graduated from a local gymnasium in Nowa Wilejka in 1926 and immediately afterwards joined the Polish Army. A graduate from the Infantry Officers' School, on 15 August 1929 he was promoted to the rank of Second lieutenant and attached to the Vilna- based 5th Legions Infantry Regiment. A promising NCO, in 1935 he was allowed to join the Higher War School and in 1937 he was promoted to the rank of Captain and attached to the headquarters of the 20th Infantry Division. During the 1939 Invasion of Poland he served as a quartermaster of the 33rd Infantry Division. Taken prisoner by the Soviets in early October, he managed to escape and returned to his native Vilna,PAP, p. 1 where he soon joined the Polish underground: the Service for Poland's Victory, the Union of Armed Struggle and finally the Home Army. He took part in the Operation Ostra Brama as commanding officer of the East group attacking the city of Vilna from the direction of Nowa Wilejka and Belmont. After the success of the operation and the arrest of most of the commanders of the Polish forces by the Soviet NKVD, Olechnowicz was one of the few officers to evade capture and assumed the role of the new commanding officer of the Vilna Home Army Area. Following the arrest by the NKVD of Home Army's commander for the Vilna area, Col. Wileńczyk, Olechnowicz became his successor on 27 March 1945.Krzywicki, pp. 88-89 In contact with the Armed Forces Delegation for Poland, he decided to limit the losses among his men, disband the remaining partisan groups and transfer most of them across the Curzon Line to the areas controlled directly by the new communist authorities of Poland. By May however the line separating Vilna from the rest of Poland became more heavily guarded by the NKVD and further evacuation became impossible. Also, in early June the local Government Delegate was arrested and it became clear that even remaining in Vilna was dangerous. In mid-June Olechnowicz fled to Pomerania. By that time it is estimated that there were still around 400 armed partisans in Soviet-held Wilno Voivodeship, mostly in small self-defence units, with additional 1000 men demobilised and awaiting orders. The resistance in what soon became the Lithuanian SSR continued until the end of the decade, but on an ever smaller scale. While in \\"Lublin Poland\\", Olechnowicz continued his resistance activities. Together with some of the former partisans evacuated from Vilna area he formed the \\"Mobilisation Centre of the Wilno Home Army Area\\", a communications network intended to keep former soldiers of the Vilnian resistance in contact, should the situation in Europe change. However, due to the Yalta Agreement it never did. In December 1945 the partisan units of Maj. Zygmunt Szendzielarz joined Olechnowicz's organisation. In February 1947 Olechnowicz went to Paris, where he met with the Polish commander-in-chief, by then no longer recognised by Poland's former Allies. Ordered to return to Poland, he continued his resistance activities. However, in 1948 the Ministry of Public Security forces managed to arrest all members of the Mobilisation Centre. Olechnowicz himself was arrested on 26 June 1948 in Wrocław. After a show trial, Olechnowicz was sentenced to death on 2 November 1949. He was executed on 8 February 1951 at Mokotów Prison. His body was interred in an unmarked grave at the outskirts of the Powązki Military Cemetery. On 28 February 2014 the Institute of National Remembrance announced, that Olechnowicz's body had been identified following archaeological excavations and a successful identification. == References  Citations = Bibliography === * * Category:Polish military personnel Category:1905 births Category:1951 deaths Category:Armia Krajowa officers Category:Executed military personnel Category:Executed Polish people Category:People executed by the Polish People's Republic Category:Polish Army officers Category:Cursed soldiers Category:Burials at Powązki Cemetery ","title":"Antoni Olechnowicz"},{"id":"42077771","text":"Peter Gregory may refer to: * Peter Gregory (doctor), team doctor for the England cricket team * Peter H.

It operated from 2012 to 2018 producing electric guitars. Each guitar was custom built based on designs submitted by customers using an online design tool. Moniker's manufacturing process enabled their guitars to sell at prices comparable to store-bought guitars. ==History== The company was inspired when amateur guitar player Kevin Tully observed a bicycle manufactured by Republic Bike of Dania Beach, Florida, which allows customers to design each bike using an online tool. In 2012, Moniker Guitars was founded by Tully and his associate Dave Barry, both natives of Boston. Original funding of $25,000 was provided by IDEA, the business incubator at Northeastern University, and in 2013, a Kickstarter campaign was used to raise an additional $60,000 from 155 backers. By 2014, the company employed six people operating out of a shared workspace in Austin, and was producing approximately 12 electric guitars per week. Moniker Guitars closed in 2018. == Manufacturing == Customers used a \\"configurator\\" tool on Moniker's website to choose from three body styles, five stains, and 17 paint colors, as well as different component parts, including a pickup by Seymour Duncan. Text and user-designed graphics could also be added. The configurator software cost about $10,000, and the company's goal was to create an interface that was clean, simple, and easy to use. Moniker then used CNC milling to precisely produce the guitar body, which was made from domestically-sourced wood. A fast-drying clearcoat manufactured by Simtec Coatings was then applied, followed by environmentally-safe water-based paints by PPG Industries. Adobe Illustrator and a vinyl plotter were used to create stencils from which text and graphics were applied. Though the company could assemble the guitar in 24 hours, the final product was shipped to customers in four weeks. ==Reception== In 2013, Moniker Guitars was featured on MSNBC's Your Business. The company's website stated that their guitars had been purchased by Kyle Shutt of The Sword, and Justin Bradley and Josh Withenshaw of Anarbor. It also showed photos of various musicians playing Moniker Guitars, including Matt Noveskey of Blue October, Paul Marc Rousseau and Shane Told of Silverstein, and Andy Lane of Driver Friendly. ==References * Official website (archived 4 March 2016) Category:Companies based in Austin, Texas Category:Defunct companies based in Texas Category:Guitar manufacturing companies of the United States Category:2012 establishments in Texas Category:2018 disestablishments in Texas Category:Manufacturing companies established in 2012 Category:Manufacturing companies disestablished in 2018 ","title":"Moniker Guitars"},{"id":"42077902","text":"Alush Noga Stadium is a multi-use stadium in Patos, Albania.

In 2016, the stadium received 2,100 plastic seats from the Qemal Stafa Stadium following its demolition, and the seats were installed onto the concrete stands which lowered the capacity to around 2,150 including the existing VIP seating in the main stand. ==References== Category:Football venues in Albania Category:Multi-purpose stadiums Category:Buildings and structures in Patos (municipality) ","title":"Alush Noga Stadium"},{"id":"42077911","text":"Robert Kelvin \\"Bob\\" Holliday (February 11, 1933 – February 28, 2014) was an American politician.

Hill and Mary Eileen Mossman. Hill graduated from Vassar College in 1906 and taught high school French in Washington, D.C. She became involved with the D.C. Branch of the College Equal Suffrage League in 1913 along with Alice Paul and Lucy Burns and joined the organization's leadership committee in 1914. Hill worked on women's rights issues for the rest of her life. She was a strong supporter of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which gave women the right to vote across the U.S. in 1920. After it passed, she supported the Equal Rights Amendment, which was submitted to Congress in 1921 but has still not been ratified into law. Katherine Morey, Brookline, Mass. & State Chairman of the Woman's Party; Elsie Hill, Norwalk, Conn.; Mary Dean Powell, D.C.; Emma Wold, Portland, Oregon; Mabel Vernon, Wilmington, Del., 1922 Elsie Hill was involved in the planning of the Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913, and notably reached out to African American students during the planning of that event. In 1914-1915 she joined the Congressional Union of Woman Suffrage’s executive committee, and headed efforts to establish branches of the Union in South Carolina and Virginia. In July 1916 she spoke at a street meeting in St. Paul, Minnesota, during a Prohibition Party convention (while representing the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage) and the convention did endorse a plank advocating a suffrage amendment. Alice Paul sent Hill on public tours to campaign in favor of women's suffrage in 1916. She was arrested for speaking at a Lafayette Square meeting in Washington D.C. in August 1918, and was arrested in Boston in February 1919 for picketing President Woodrow Wilson upon his return from Europe. In 1921 she married Albert Levitt but kept her own name, as was noted in the New York Times. Also that year she chaired the National Women's Party's convention, and she was the Party's National Council chairwoman from 1921 until 1925. (The National Women's Party was simply the Congressional Union of Woman Suffrage with a new name.) In 1924, Hill and other members of the Party visited President Calvin Coolidge to lobby on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment. In 1956 she and Levitt divorced. In 1968 Hill was a passenger on Pan American Airlines' first flight from New York to Moscow. The Elsie M.

Located at 1032 12th Street in downtown Cody, Wyoming the small boutique hotel is 21 units made up of a series of suites, rooms, cottage and garden studios, as well as the Court House Residence, all within a brick and wrought iron courtyard. ==Description and history== In 1900 Agnes (Aggie) Chamberlin made the journey from Kansas to Cody based on a job awarded to her to work for the famous Buffalo Bill Cody at the Cody Enterprise newspaper office. Across the street from the Cody Enterprise office was a sagebrush-covered vacant lot where in 1903, Agnes opened her first boarding house. Over the next 14 years, several buildings were combined to create the Chamberlin Hotel. Agnes held the first Cody Club meetings in the dining room of the Inn. The Cody Club is still in existence in Cody, Wyoming as the Cody Country Chamber of Commerce's weekly meeting event.The Story of The Cody Club, 1900-1940 (1940). Cody, WY: J J Little Ives Co. Agnes sold the hotel in 1939 and the name was later changed to the Pawnee Hotel by Hattie and George Evans. Then in 1974 the hotel was purchased by JoJean DeHony, and over the next 31 years JoJean successfully operated the hotel, landscaped the adjoining vacant lot, and added baths to most rooms. In October 2005, the hotel again changed ownership and, as a tribute to Agnes Chamberlin, the name was changed back to the Chamberlin Inn. The owners Ev and Susan Diehl, long time Cody residents, began a complete restoration of the hotel and the surrounding properties. ==Notable guests== During the 1920s and 30's, the Chamberlin Inn was a very popular place to stay in Cody and included famous people such as Marshall Fields, Larry Larom, Stanley, and Haliburton. Ernest Hemingway's signature is on one of the Chamberlin Inn's original guest registers and is displayed in Room 18, where the author stayed for several days in 1932. During this time, Ernest Hemingway had completed the manuscript for \\"Death in the Afternoon\\" and mailed the manuscript and several short stories to his publishers from his Cody, Wyoming location.

He is Connacht's record points scorer in the Pro14, having overtaken Ian Keatley in March 2019. Carty is an international, having made his debut for the side against in 2019. ==Youth== Carty received his secondary education at Marist College, Athlone. He attended university at NUI Galway.

It is one of Ligeti's juvenile compositions withdrawn by the composer. == Composition and context == Joseph Stalin's death in 1953 and further conflicts among Hungarian and Russian people led to Russia installing Imre Nagy, whose leadership led to a debilitating economy and government instability. Ligeti wrote his Chromatische Phantasie in 1956 in Budapest, shortly before going into exile in Vienna due to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Even though he started other projects, such as his Chromatische Variationen, Requiem (not the one completed in 1964) and many other unfinished works, this was one of the last works he composed in Hungarian soil. It was eventually premiered in Nissafors, Sweden, on April 17, 1974, by Eva Pataki. Since then, many other pianists have played it both in public performances and on the radio, but it is still one of Ligeti's least-known works. It was never published, though it has been performed by several artists and transcriptions have been written by other musicians. The original manuscript is now located in Basel, as part of the Sacher Shiftung. == Analysis == The composition is scored for one solo piano and takes approximately 6 minutes to perform. It is based on the dodecaphonic compositional technique. This is Ligeti's only finished piece in his entire catalogue in which he uses such system. The tempo is slow, marked ♩ = 60. The row is merely a descending chromatic scale from C to D♭, presented right in the first five bars of the piece. The row is put in retrograde, inversion and retrograde inversion version throughout the whole piece. Ligeti combines this twelve-tone technique with tone clusters, which he further developed in his following compositions. Scholar Elliot Sneider, who also transcribed the piece, has analysed this composition and has divided it into five contrasting sections. Section A consists exclusively of tone clusters, with sparse notes followed by rapid arpeggios, which climax in an (forte fortissimo) A0, which is the lowest possible note of the piano. This starts section B, which consists mainly of pulsating low notes with slow sixteenth notes with the right hand. A0 is played seven times. After that, C♯1 pulsating notes are played, only this time just a bit faster, which then jumps to the cluster E1-F1 performed by the left hand. A final cluster made up of B1-C♯1-C2, with short clusters on the right hand ends section B. Section C starts with the left hand playing short pulsating staccato B1-C2 tone clusters. The right hand combines both sixteenth-note arpeggios and tone clusters. A triplet from the right hand leads to a cluster chaos, repeating notes loudly. A seven-second pause leads to section D, which sings a chromatic melodic voice with the right hand, which is interrupted by sparse left-hand patterns from the previous section. Section E ends the pieces with long cluster tones as in section A. == Reception and criticism == Ligeti was a fervent critic of his own work. He once described the piece as being \\"very naïve and primitive\\" in the use of the twelve-tone technique. == Notable recordings == Following are some of the most well-known recorded performances of this piece: { !align=\\"center\\"Piano !align=\\"center\\"Record company !align=\\"center\\"Year of recording !align=\\"center\\"Format - align=\\"center\\"Fredrik Ullén align=\\"center\\"BIS Records align=\\"center\\"1972 align=\\"center\\"CD } == References  See also == * List of compositions by György Ligeti Category:Compositions by György Ligeti Category:1956 compositions Category:Compositions for solo piano Category:Contemporary classical compositions ","title":"Chromatische Phantasie"},{"id":"42078164","text":"Kasey Smith (born 29 March 1990) is an Irish singer.

It depicts the emotional and spiritual conflicts faced by its eponymous heroine as she leaves her home village, Mackinac Island, to seek a future as a young woman in the Northeastern United States. Her good qualities win her many suitors, but she finds hypocrisy and dysfunctional social relationships among the wealthier strata of U.S. Victorian society. Eventually she selects a suitor who, although of wealthy origins, has lost his means and is ready to accept the stolid virtues of the American working class. Anne Douglas returns with her new partner to her place of origin. Anne was first published through serialization in Harper's New Monthly Magazine. Upon republication as a book in 1882, the work became a bestseller and was reviewed in The Nation, The Century, and other leading periodicals of the day. Many readers and reviewers appreciated the book, as it depicted a wide variety of settings and social circumstances, with a particular eye for the picturesque elements to be seen on the shores of northern Lake Huron inhabited by persons who had come to live in harmony with the ecology of the Great Lakes. Woolson's sentimental depiction of a rural setting was attractive to a readership increasingly tied to smoky, industrial cities. 1916 illustration of character Anne Anne was republished as a volume in 1882 by Harper and Brothers. Sales of the novel faded with changing literary tastes; Woolson admirer Anne Boyd Rioux confessed in 2014 that \\"self- sacrificing heroines like Margaret in East Angels and Anne in Anne seem almost impossibly good to our eyes today.\\" The work's copyright has expired and it is in the public domain in its country of publication, the United States.

Upon retiring from athletics, he became a physical education teacher. Alt URL ==Post-athletic life== On 24 August 1999, an explosion on board a landed Uni Air plane, Flight 873, injured 28 people and killed Ku Jing-chi (C: 古金池, P: Gǔ Jīnchí), the older brother of Ku Chin-shui. A report from the Aviation Safety Council (ASC) said a motorbike battery jostled, igniting gasoline in bottles in an overhead compartment. Prosecutors accused Ku Chin-shui of asking his nephew to bring gasoline on the flight. Ku was convicted and sentenced to ten years in prison. Upon appeal, it was shortened to seven and a half years. After a fifth retrial, he was declared not guilty. The ASC had commissioned an analysis from the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology, which said the ASC's simulation environment differed from that of the aircraft which had exploded.\\" The court case caused Ku to lose his teaching position, and he worked part-time at a steel factory until 2008, when he returned to teaching full-time. Ku was diagnosed with cancer in 2014, and died of plasma cell leukemia on 25 May 2016 at National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei. Aged 56 at the time of his death, Ku was survived by his wife and two children.

The brown, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1670 by master builder Magne Essen using designs by an unknown architect. The church seats about 160 people. ==History== The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1340, but the church was not new that year. The original church was likely a stave church and by 1661 it was described as being in miserable condition. The church was replaced by a new church about to the north in Fretheim, but the old church wasn't torn down. Unfortunately, the new church was significantly damaged in a wind storm the following year. In 1670, both churches (the medieval stave church and the new church) were torn down and the materials from the two churches were reused in the building of a new church on the site of the old stave church. == Media gallery == Flåm kyrkje i Flåmsdalen.jpgView of the church near the river in the Flåmsdalen valley Flåm kyrkje.jpgAnother exterior view Flåm Church.jpgExterior view, including an outside storage building Flaam kirke inne1.JPGInterior view of the altar area Flaam kirke inne2.JPGClose up of wall art ==See also== *List of churches in Bjørgvin ==References== Category:Aurland Category:Churches in Vestland Category:Wooden churches in Norway Category:17th-century Church of Norway church buildings Category:Churches completed in 1670 Category:13th- century establishments in Norway ","title":"Flåm Church"},{"id":"42078235","text":"Marsilea ancyclopoda, common name tropical water clover, is a plant species native to the warmer parts of the Western Hemisphere.

The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1859 using designs by the architect Christian Henrik Grosch. The church seats about 200 people. The church is a small, simple building with a nave and a choir. A chancel contains the altarpiece. ==History== The people living along the Nærøyfjord and in the surrounding valley had desired a local church for a long time, to avoid the long journey to the Undredal Stave Church. In the 1820s and 1830s, there was talk of relocating the old stave church to be closer to the population of the parish, but nothing was done. In 1851, the new church law required larger churches for many parishes. At that time new plans were made to divide the parish and build a new church along the Nærøyfjorden in the village of Bakka. The new church was consecrated on 11 May 1859. Due to its rural, isolated location, the Nærøy parish is one of the smallest parishes in the Diocese of Bjørgvin with only 104 members in 1999.

The white, stone church was built in a long church design and in early Gothic style around the year 1202. The church seats about 270 people. Vangen Church is the largest of the seven medieval stone churches in the Sogn og Fjordane region, leading it to be called the Sognedomen or Sogn Cathedral. ==History== The church probably built in two stages in the 13th century. There is a foundation stone in the church on which the date 2 May 1202 is inscribed. A local historian, Anders Ohnstad, has stated that King Sverre had local ties to Aurland and he died in March 1202, so the church may have been constructed on his orders. The church has a rectangular nave and a smaller, narrower choir. It does not have a sacristy, porch, or tower. The stone walls of the church are all high and are also about thick. The ceiling of the church reaches high at the highest point. The church has a hexagonal pulpit from the early 17th century. It is decorated with painted tulips, brass ornaments, and pilasters in green, yellow and red against a pale yellow background.

It became generally known after a party of Forty-Niners led by Colonel John Coffee Hays followed a route suggested to him by a Mexican Army officer as a shorter route than Cooke's Wagon Road which passed farther south to cross the mountains to the San Pedro River at Guadalupe Pass.Leland J. Hanchett, Crossing Arizona, Pine Rim Publishing, Cave Creek, AZ, 2002, p.193 ==Route== The Tucson Cutoff ran from Ojo de Ynez on Cooke's Wagon Road on the southeast side of the Big Burro Mountains to the southwest to a spring and through a pass in the Pyramid Mountains south of today's Lordsburg. Descending to the southwest onto the playa in the north end of Animas Valley the cutoff route passed to the west through Stein's Pass, then southwest of its mouth to the Cienega of San Simon on the San Simon River. The cutoff then ran west through Puerto del Dado, from there it crossed the middle Sulphur Springs Valley and Willcox Playa to Croton Springs. From there it ran to Nugent’s Pass, down Tres Alamos Wash to the lower crossing of the San Pedro River near Tres Alamos. From Tres Alamos the route led southwest to a waterhole on Cooke's Wagon Road on Mescal Arroyo (just west of modern Mescal) where it linked up again with Cooke's route to Tucson.John P.

It was first traveled by American fur trappers in the 1830s and was known but not used by Cooke for his wagon road. It became known to westward bound American travelers after it was first traveled by a party of 49ers led by John Coffee Hays in 1849. Notes about the Hays expedition aided the mapping of the route, lent to the commander of the Railroad Survey Expedition, by one of its members, John Nugent. In consequence the route was sometimes called Nugent's Wagon Road and also Nugent’s Pass and Nugent’s Springs on the route were given his name.REPORT OF CAPTAIN A. A.

It then ran down Dragoon Wash to the San Pedro River, then down river to the middle crossing of the San Pedro River (below the rail and highway bridges of modern Benson and south of Pomerene).

The plant comprises the powerhouse, switchyard, penstocks, and a pipeline. A dam next to the site is associated with the Granite Power Plant farther downstream, and is part of neither historic district. The powerhouse is the only remaining building associated with the plant. It is an example of an intact high-head generating plant from the late 19th century. ==Description== The power plant was originally built with four Pelton wheels, since replaced by a single Francis turbine capable of generating 1.2 megawatts. The station was designed in the Second Renaissance Revival style with two levels, the lower housing the generating equipment, the upper formerly housing switchgear. Until the late 1950s water was impounded behind the Storm Mountain Dam, built in 1921 to replace an earlier dam about above the station horizontally and vertically. The dam is a low earthfill structure, about to high and long, concrete faced on the upstream side. A steel pipeline, now abandoned, connected the dam to a penstock that made the fall to the power plant. The penstock is about long, made of steel, with a non-contributing standpipe at its head ==History== The station was designed by Robert M. Jones for his Big Cottonwood Power Company at a cost of $325,000. In 1895 the company contracted to provide power to the Salt Lake and Ogden Gas and Electric Company, In 1897 the Big Cottonwood company was absorbed into the Union Light and Power Company in 1899. An operator's house was demolished on the site at an unknown date.

The first section of the museum, hangar 37, opened with the museum on December 7, 2006, and features much of the museum's static exhibits. The museum's hangars show damage from the attacks on Pearl Harbor from December 7, 1941. The museum has been involved in community events ranging from preservation of historical landmarks to educational tours throughout Hawai'i. The focus devoted efforts to restoring the Ford Island control tower and signed a lease with the Navy to begin repairs. Visitors to the museum gain access via tour bus from the Pearl Harbor Historic Sites on Halawa landing. The museum has received awards for their efforts to restore historical buildings. ==History== Control tower on Ford Island seen in the movies Tora! Tora! Tora! and Pearl Harbor.

Due to airport expansion plans, the Pacific Aerospace Museum operation was suspended in the fall of 2001 and finally removed two years later. A few of the exhibits were salvaged by the Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor foundation as well as responsibility for the education and scholarship programs. Prior to the completion of the Admiral Clarey Bridge in 1998, access to Ford Island was provided via ferry boat only to those residing on Ford Island and their guests. Senator Inouye proposed a $500,000,000 \\"rebirth\\" of Ford Island through special legislation () to authorize the Navy to sell land to fund the rebirth. The plan included 500 new homes for Navy personnel, a new child development center, a new Navy lodge, and the Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor. The original museum was called the Military Aviation Museum of the Pacific. The foundation sought funds to raise the original $46 million goal from various sources including the US State of Hawaii, the United States Congress, the United States Navy, and fundraising dinners. It received support from former US astronaut Captain Walter Schirra. While executive director of the San Diego Air & Space Museum, Allan Palmer was hired by the United States Air Force to conduct a feasibility study on an aviation museum in Hawaii and then hired as its executive direction and chief executive operating officer. A groundbreaking ceremony was held March 21, 2006 for the $75,000,000 construction of the museum. It opened on December 7, 2007 on the 65th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Its board consists of former United States president George H.W. Bush, Brigadier General Chuck Yeager, and retired Brigadier General Paul Tibbets. The museum occupies hangars 37 and 79 on Ford Island and covers 16 acres. In 2012, the Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor was named an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution as part of the Smithsonian Affiliations program. On April 4, 2013, the museum received its millionth visitor. ===Facilities=== The arrival of a retired Royal Australian Air Force F-111C in front of hangar 37. Due to its historical significance, as the location of the first radio alert of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the museum plans to spend over $7,500,000 repairing the Ford Island control tower. It was registered as a category 1 structure in the 1978 Pearl Harbor Naval Base Historic Preservation Plan and is being restored by Kiewit Building Group; the same contractor who built the museum. The 70-year-old tower suffers from deteriorating steel stairs, landing, and beams that require repair or replacement. A grant through the United States Department of Defense appropriations for the stabilization and restoration of a historical landmark was given to the museum for $3,800,000 which provided the initial funds to start the project. The control tower, as well as the runway, has been designated a national historic landmark since 1964. In 2010, records filed with Congress shows that defense firms had donated nearly $449,000 to the museum during efforts to raise money to restore the tower. The tower was considered a personal issue for Senator Inouye and many of these donations were made in his memory. The tower was featured in the films Tora! Tora! Tora! and Pearl Harbor. Hangar 37, a former seaplane hangar and a survivor of the attack on Pearl Harbor, was the first hangar developed for the museum. The facility consists of nine exhibits, a movie theater, flight simulators, a store and a restaurant. The renovation cost was $11,000,000 and was raised by federal and state grants and through donations by local corporations. Built in 1939 and at over , Hangar 79 is the restoration hangar but also contains many of the museums exhibits including the flying tigers exhibit, MiG Alley exhibit, and various helicopters, jets, and civil aircraft. The hangar's glass windows are still riddled with bullet holes from Japanese aircraft from the day of the attack. Tawani Foundation donated $82,500 for the renovation of Hangar 79. ==Exhibits== Boeing Stearman Model 75 flown by former President George H.W. Bush In 2009, former McDonald's CEO Fred L. Turner sponsored the restoration of a Douglas SBD Dauntless. The Boeing N2S-3 Stearman used by former President George H.W. Bush for flight training and used for his first solo flight is an exhibit at the museum. The remains of the Japanese A6M2 Zero \\"B11-120\\" from the carrier Hiryu piloted by Airman First Class Shigenori Nishikaichi, who crash landed on Ni'ihau after the second wave of the attack on Pearl Harbor, are stored at the museum. It is displayed exactly as it was after the crash. The remains of the tractor used to create trenches to prevent such a landing are stored at the museum. The trenches were created after the island was warned that the Japanese had planned to use the island as a forward operating base. A Japanese A6M2-21 Zero similar to the aircraft used in the attack on Pearl Harbor was salvaged in 1968 and restored to flying condition in 1985. Originally, it flew with the Japanese air group 201 in the Solomon Islands. It was sold to the Confederate Air Force for use in air shows and later sold to the museum in 2006. Swamp Ghost restoration at the Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor On April 11, 2013, the remains of a B-17 bomber arrived at the Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor almost 70 years after avoiding destruction during the attack on Pearl Harbor. The restoration project is expected to cost $5,000,000. The plane, called \\"Swamp Ghost\\", was supposed to fly to Hickam Field on December 7, 1941 but was delayed due to engine trouble and avoided the attack. Later, it was used in the February 22, 1942 bombing of Rabaul. After the bombing, the plane was attacked by nine Japanese fighters on its return to base, was struck on the wing, and crashed in marsh water. The plane remained there for 64 years, earning its nickname, and the wreckage was used as a navigational aid. It appeared in National Geographic in 1992 and several attempts were made to recover the aircraft, but it was not successfully recovered until 2006 and arrived back in the United States in 2010. It was purchased by the museum in 2011. It was delivered in seven separate shipment containers and is being restored outside of hangar 79. In June 2012, the museum debuted a tall, wide diorama of the Battle of Midway. The diorama was commissioned in 2008 for $400,000 on the advice of Turner and took three years to complete by former US Navy pilot Karl Lau. ===Collection=== F4F-3 Wildcat on display representing Cactus Air during the Battle of Guadalcanal ===East, Wind, Rain=== In 2008, the Hawaii Pacific University documentary and corporate video class completed development of a 12-minute film titled East, Wind, Rain to replace the older film shown to visitors at the museum. The film explains the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor to museum guests and won the 2010 Pixie Gold Award from American Pixel Academy. ==Public reception== Conceptual design for photovoltaic panels covering the historic runway on Ford Island. Barnstorming program Sign out in front of the Pearl Harbor Historic Sites at Halawa Landing on O'ahu, Hawaii ===Controversies=== In 2013 the museum planned to host 1,500 Chinese nationals from Amway China on Ford Island who were particularly interested in the Flying Tigers exhibit. The Navy expressed concerns about this plan as Ford Island remains an active military installation. Despite these concerns, the Navy approved the event and erected a tall fence. In March 2013 the museum's online ticketing service was hacked. The museum's service provider, Vendini, believed that none of the data of its customers was accessed. In June 2013 the museum fought the US Navy's plan to install 60,000 photovoltaic panels over 28 acres on the Ford Island runway. The Navy had intended to comply with Congressional and Defense Department mandates to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and offset the cost of Hawaiian energy costs, which are the highest in the United States. The plan deviated from a 2009 proposal which would use the panels to define the historic runway in favor of panels which would produce twice the power. The Navy offered the museum $250,000 toward renovation of the control tower's elevator in exchange for their support of the plan which the museum declined. It organized an internet campaign to oppose the plan based on historical significance. Instead, the Navy decided to install the panels on existing structures around Pearl Harbor. ===Community involvement=== In 2008, the museum received a grant from BAE Systems to fund its Barnstorming program to build wind tunnels and plane props that will tour local schools to teach aerospace education to sixth graders. In 2012, the program was credited with teaching 3,500 students from 40 schools. In 2013, the U.S. State Department awarded the museum the \\"Museums Connect\\" grant for the \\"Past to Present: U.S. -Sino Bridge of Connections\\" program. The program allowed students from Kaiser High School to participate in a cultural heritage exchange with students in Chengdu, China and conduct research into 1940s American-Chinese relations. ===Tourism=== During the 2013 federal budget sequestration in the United States, the Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor received an increase in tourists, due to limited ferry trips to the USS Arizona Memorial which are operated by active duty United States Navy personnel. While former and active military tourists gain access through the Admiral Clarey bridge and because Ford Island is still part of the active military base Joint Base Pearl Harbor- Hickam, non-military tourists gain access via the National Park Service's Halawa Landing, now known as the Pearl Harbor Historic Sites, for tickets to the museum and then are transported via tour bus onto the installation for the museum and the USS Missouri. ==Recognition and awards== Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor was listed as the eighth top aviation attraction in the United States by TripAdvisor. In 2007, the museum was awarded a preservation award from the Historic Hawaii foundation for \\"a specific project that preserved, rehabilitated or restored a historic building, object, site or district\\" in the redevelopment of hangar 37. ==See also== * Onizuka Space Center * List of aerospace museums * List of museums in Hawaii ==ReferencesPearl Harbor Historic Sites * Pearl Harbor Historic Sites on Recreation.gov * Category:Aerospace museums in Hawaii Category:World War II museums in Hawaii Category:Museums in Honolulu Category:World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument Category:Attack on Pearl Harbor Category:Smithsonian Institution affiliates Category:Museums established in 2006 Category:2006 establishments in Hawaii ","title":"Pearl Harbor Aviation Museum"},{"id":"42078449","text":"Anésia Pinheiro Machado (June 1902 or 5 June 1904, in Itapetininga – 10 May 1999) was the second licensed female pilot in Brazil (Teresa De Marzo being the first.)

Originally established as Bombing Squadron VB-146 on 15 July 1943, it was redesignated Patrol Bombing Squadron VPB-146 on 1 October 1944, redesignated VP-146 on 15 May 1946, redesignated Medium Patrol Squadron (Landplane) VP-ML-6 on 15 November 1946, redesignated VP-6 on 1 September 1948 and disestablished on 31 May 1993. It was the third squadron to be designated VP-6, the first VP-6 was disestablished on 3 May 1926 and the second VP-6 was disestablished on 20 June 1945. ==Operational history== P2V-5s at NAS Kodiak in 1954 P-3B off Oahu in 1978 *15 July 1943: VB-146 was established at NAS Whidbey Island, Washington to fly the PV-1 Ventura. On 5 December 1943, the squadron moved to NAS Alameda, California, for final training prior to combat deployment. On 22 December all squadron aircraft, equipment and personnel were embarked aboard for conveyance to NAS Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. *29 August 1943: Lieutenant Commander Ralph R. Beacham and his crew of five were lost between Bellingham and Everett, Washington, in inclement weather during a routine instrument training flight in a PV-1 (BuNo. 34637). A search for the aircraft was begun when it became overdue, but the dense tree cover in the mountains and poor visibility due to bad weather conditions prevented the search teams from finding the aircraft or crew. *28 December 1943: VB-146 commenced combat training while conducting actual wartime patrols off the coasts of the Hawaiian islands, convoy patrol duties in the Central Pacific and advanced base patrols from Midway Island and Johnston Atoll. *9 April 1944: VB-146 aircrews received training in air-to-ground rocket firing and advanced Anti- submarine warfare (ASW) techniques. *8 June 1944: The squadron was deployed to the South Pacific area of the Admiralty Islands, conducting combat operations from Palmyra, Kanton, Funafuti, Espiritu Santo and Pityilu. On 24 June, while based at Pityilu Island, the squadron was placed under Task Force 70.2 for operational control. *19 October 1944: VPB-146 deployed to Morotoi to conduct sector searches and strikes on Japanese shipping. *1 December 1944: VPB-146 deployed to Mokerang Airfield, Los Negros Island. Duties included search sectors, ASW patrol and antishipping missions in support of the Morotoi landings and the Leyte, Philippines occupation. Upon arrival at Mokerang one half of the squadron personnel were given R&R; to Australia. *18 February 1945: VPB-146 departed the combat zone for return to NAS Kaneohe Bay, and on to NAS San Diego, California. *15 April 1945: VPB-146 was reformed and commenced familiarization training on the new PV-2 Harpoon at NAS Moffett Field, California. *September 1946: Orders were received for deployment to Naval Base Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The squadron arrived on 2 October 1946, and was stationed at NAS Barbers Point. Over the next several months duties consisted of search and ASW exercises with the fleet. *7 November 1946: A detachment of squadron aircraft was sent to NAS Alameda, for deployment to Mexico City to participate in an air demonstration for the presidential inauguration ceremonies. Upon completion of the detail, the detachment ferried PV-2s to NAS Quonset Point, Rhode Island, before returning to NAS Barbers Point on 13 December 1946. *12 December 1947: VP-ML-6 was notified of a change in permanent home base to NAS Whidbey Island, Washington. The first elements of squadron personnel boarded for return to the continental United States on 12 January 1948. The squadron officially detached from FAW-2 on 30 January 1948. *30 January 1948: VP-ML-6 began transition training to the P2V-2 Neptune at NAAS Miramar, California. *April 1950: New P2V-3 and P2V-3N aircraft were received as replacements for the older P2V-2 aircraft flown by the squadron. *28 June 1950 – 12 February 1951: VP-6 deployed to Korea as the first patrol squadron in the theater of operations, and the first to fly the P2V Neptune in combat. During this tour the squadron operated from Johnson AFB, Japan from 7 July–6 August 1950; from Tachikawa Air Base, Japan, from 6 August 1950 – 12 February 1951; and a detachment at NAS Atsugi, Japan, from 5 January–12 February 1951. Patrols were flown over the Yellow Sea and Sea of Japan, and in support of the Inchon landings. *29 July 1950: Two squadron P2V-3s, piloted by Lieutenant Commander R. L. Ettinger and Lieutenant William J. Pressler, sighted a train along the Korean coast near Chongjin. The two crews destroyed the train with 5-inch rockets and 20-mm bow guns. *13 August 1950: Two squadron Neptunes, led by Lieutenant Command E. B. Rogers, attacked several boats and barges engaged in minelaying near Chinnampo. Three boats and two barges were sunk. Roger's P2V was holed six times by enemy fire. On the same day, other VP-6 aircraft damaged two surface craft near Wonsan. *16 August 1950: A squadron P2V piloted by Ensign William F. Goodman, attacked an enemy patrol vessel near Chinnampo. The starboard engine of his aircraft was damaged by enemy fire and was ditched near the enemy shoreline. The entire crew was rescued by the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Kenya. As a result of this loss, patrol aircraft were no longer assigned attack missions in Korea. 1 Aug 1951: During the squadron's second combat deployment to Korea it moved to NAF Naha, Okinawa, to conduct aerial reconnaissance off the China Coast under the operational control of FAW-1. *6 November 1951: A squadron P2V-3W was shot down with the loss of all hands (10 aircrewmen) by Russian fighter aircraft while on patrol in the Sea of Japan off Vladisvostok, Siberia. BuNo 124284 was conducting a weather reconnaissance mission under United Nations command. The attack occurred over international waters, but the Russians claimed the aircraft had violated Soviet airspace over Cape Ostrovnaya. *7 July 1952: VP-6 departed Hawaii for NAS Kodiak, Alaska. Detachments were maintained at Ladd AFB from 14 August–17 September and at NAS Adak from 10–20 December 1952, in support of the Cold Weather Advance Base exercise. *November 1957: In November VP-6 participated in the search for Pan Am Flight 7, lost in the western Pacific. The futile search for survivors was the largest air-sea rescue operation ever conducted in the Pacific. *July 1962: VP-6 flew 1,000 hours during operations at Johnston Atoll in conjunction with testing of nuclear devices. Air samples were collected in the zone near the test site and downwind to check on radioactivity and particle dispersion. *April 1962: A squadron Neptune, flown by Lieutenant Commander G. L. Page, ditched in the Sea of Japan after both reciprocating engines experienced mechanical problems and were feathered. The ditching was smoothly executed and the crew was picked up within minutes with no injuries. *9 August 1964: VP-6 participated in the response to the Gulf of Tonkin Incident with the Seventh Fleet, in waters off Vietnam. The squadron flew surveillance and ASW patrols over the Gulf of Tonkin and the South China Sea during this period. VP-6 was based at NAF Naha, Okinawa, on 18 August 1964, relieving VP-17. A detachment was maintained at NAS Cubi Point, Philippines. A few months later VP-6 was transferred to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan, where it was relieved in January by VP-2. *15 August 1967: VP-6 were the first patrol squadron at NAS Barbers Point to receive AGM-12 Bullpup missiles for the P-3A Orion. The small missile was carried under the wing of the P-3A, and was intended for airto-surface attacks against small targets ashore and afloat. *1 January 1968: The squadron deployed to WestPac based at NAF Naha, Okinawa, with a detachment at NS Sangley Point, Philippines, and NAF Cam Ranh Bay, South Vietnam. During the deployment VP-6 conducted its first patrols over a combat zone since the Korean War. *5 April 1968: A squadron aircraft, BuNo. 151350, crashed on patrol over the China Sea with all hands lost. *1 June 1969: VP-6 deployed to NS Sangley Point, with a detachment at U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield, Thailand. *14 July 1970: The squadron deployed to NAF Naha, Okinawa, in support of Seventh Fleet operations off the sea lane approaches to North Vietnam. *12 May 1971: A squadron P-3A (BuNo. 152151) crashed shortly after takeoff from NAS Cubi Point. All four engines had failed because cleaning fluid had been mistakenly substituted for water-injection fluid. *21 September 1971: VP-6 deployed to NAS Cubi Point in support of the Seventh Fleet operations in WestPac. A detachment was maintained at NAF Cam Ranh Bay. Missions were generally flown throughout South China Sea and off the coast of Vietnam. Operations during this period concentrated on Vietnamese infiltrator trawler interceptions. *30 November 1972: The squadron was again deployed to WestPac based at NAF Naha, with a detachment at U-Tapao, Thailand. The deployment marked the last for the squadron in the Vietnamese theatre of operations. *August 1975: VP-6 was the first squadron to deploy a detachment to NAS Agana, Guam, with the P-3B. The three-aircraft/four-crew detachment remained until March 1976. *August 1977: Upon return from its 1976–1977 deployment, the squadron began the update program from the P-3B to the P-3B TAC/NAV MOD Super Bee. The retrofits to the P-3B airframes included more powerful engines, improved navigation equipment and upgraded avionics. *May 1978: VP-6 returned to NAS Cubi Point and became the first of the patrol squadrons to deploy the P-3B MOD aircraft. During this assignment the squadron visited Australia, Kenya, Djibouti and Japan. A detachment was also maintained throughout the deployment on the island of Diego Garcia. *June 1979: VP-6 deployed a detachment to NAS Agana, Guam, for ASW coverage, Mariana Islands surveillance flights and routine training missions. During this period the detachment assisted in support of refugee rescue operations flown from NAS Cubi Point, aiding in the recovery of over 500 Vietnamese boat people. *5 September 1980: A VP-6 Orion, BuNo. 154591, made a wheels up landing at Lihue Airport Kauai. One crewman was injured, with extensive damage to the aircraft. *November 1980: The squadron deployed to NAS Cubi Point as the first Pacific fleet squadron to deploy with full Harpoon missile capabilities. Throughout the deployment a detachment was maintained on the island of Diego Garcia. *February 1982: VP-6 deployed to NAS Agana, during this period the squadron aircraft visited numerous Southeast Asia countries. In the last two months of the tour, the squadron was deployed to NAS Adak for a period of intense ASW operations against Soviet submarines in the northern Pacific. *May 1983: VP-6 deployed to NAS Cubi Point. *November 1984: VP-6 deployed to NAS Cubi Point. *10 May 1986: VP-6 deployed to NAS Cubi Point and Misawa, Japan. *1 December 1987: VP-6 deployed to Adak while monitoring Soviet submarine movement and air defense reactions. *June – September 1988: VP-6 was placed in \\"Cold Iron\\" status due to fiscal constraints. The standdown permitted only the bare minimum of maintenance required to preserve the aircraft, but did not allow for sufficient flying time to retain top crew proficiency. As a result of the standdown aircrew proficiency was graded unsatisfactory on the COMNAVAIRPAC Naval Aviation Training and Procedures Standardization (NATOPS) inspection conducted 26–30 September 1988. *1 May 1989: VP-6 deployed to NAS Cubi Point and Diego Garcia where crews performed detachments to Darwin, Brunei, Masirah, Djibouti and Mauritius. *February 1990: VP-6 became the first patrol squadron at NAS Barbers Point to receive the first P-3C Update II.5 aircraft. This update had improved electronics systems, new IACS (Integrated Acoustic Communication System), improved MAD, standardized wing pylons and improved wing fuel tank venting. *4 December 1990: VP-6 deployed to Adak. *5 December 1991: VP-6 deployed to Panama. *10 June 1992: VP-6 went on their last deployment to NAF Misawa, Japan, to participate in Operation Final Frenzy, a SEATO exercise with U.S. and allied nations providing surveillance and ASW coverage. Exercises took the squadron from the Persian Gulf to Australia and involved allies from Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong. *31 May 1993: VP-6 was disestablished at NAS Barbers Point. *15 October 1995: A hiker spotted the burned and shattered remains of an aircraft in a remote area usually covered by snow near Mount Baker in northwestern Washington. It was the remains of the PV-1 Ventura belonging to VB-146 flown by Lieutenant Commander Ralph R. Beacham, missing since 29 August 1943. A Navy Recovery Team removed the remains of the two officers and four enlisted crewmen for positive identification and notification of next of kin. ==Home port assignments== The squadron was assigned to these home ports, effective on the dates shown: *NAS Whidbey Island, Washington 15 July 1943 *NAS Kaneohe, Hawaii 28 December 1943 *NAS Moffett Field, California 15 April 1945 *NAS Alameda, California 30 July 1945 *NAS Barbers Point, Hawaii 2 October 1946 *NAS Whidbey Island 30 January 1948 *NAS Barbers Point, Hawaii 1 May 1949 ==Aircraft Assignment== The squadron first received the following aircraft on the dates shown: *PV-1 July 1943 *PV-2 April 1945 *P2V-2 February 1948 *P2V-3/P2V-3W April 1950 *P2V-5 February 1954 *P2V-5F March 1955 *SP-2E Mod II May 1962 *P-3A 1965 *P-3B November 1974 *P-3B MOD December 1977 *P-3C UII.5 January 1990 ==Unit Awards== { style=\\"margin: 1em auto; text-align: center;\\" - colspan=\\"6\\" align=\\"center\\" -  20px  -    } { style=\\"margin: 1em auto; text-align: center;\\"  - colspan=\\"6\\" align=\\"center\\" Navy Unit Commendation w/ 2 service stars: - colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation w/ 8 service stars colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation w/ Operational Distinguishing Device colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" National Defense Service Medal w/ 2 service stars - colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal w/ 1 service star colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" Coast Guard Special Operations Service Ribbon colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation with Palm (2 awards) } ==See also== * Maritime patrol aircraft * List of Lockheed P-3 Orion variants * Squadron (aviation) * Naval aviation * List of inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons * List of United States Navy aircraft squadrons * List of squadrons in the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons * History of the United States Navy ==References== Category:Patrol squadrons of the United States Navy Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons ","title":"VP-6"},{"id":"42078482","text":"Shake is the first posthumous studio album by American singer-songwriter Sam Cooke. ==Track listing== All tracks composed by Sam Cooke; except where indicated ===Side one=== # \\"Shake\\" – 2:42 # \\"Yeah Man\\" – 2:32 # \\"Win Your Love for Me\\" (L.C.

The regiment was the first regiment of any kind assigned to the Puerto Rico National Guard back when it was known locally as the 1st Infantry Regiment. ==History== The 295th traces its history back to the Spanish colonization of the Americas as an infantry militia constituted on May 17, 1762, as part of the reorganization of the Milicias Disciplinadas () decreed by Spain. However, on February 12, 1870, the militia were reduced to en cadre until their disbandment in April 1898 after Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States. Almost two decades after, on 1917 and at the brink of World War I, Puerto Ricans were granted American citizenship. Right after, the President of the Senate of Puerto Rico requested the United States Army to include Puerto Ricans on the draft. At the time, the United States Army was segregated, and, in order to assign more than 18,000 Puerto Ricans that enlisted or were drafted into the Army for the war effort, the Army created an infantry regiment and the Puerto Rico Voluntary Infantry. The regiment was merely a reconstitution of the disbanded Spanish-era militia as an infantry regiment assigned to the Puerto Rico National Guard on April 12, 1917. Two years later, this freshly created regiment was designated as the 1st Infantry Regiment on July 19, 1919. Several years later, somewhen between July 9 and September 13 of 1922, the Puerto Rico National Guard established a new battalion and called it the 1st Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment. A few months later, the battalion was renamed as the 1st Battalion, 296th Infantry Regiment (1-296) on December 26, 1922. A few weeks later, on January 23, 1923, the aforementioned 1st Infantry Regiment was renamed as the 295th Infantry Regiment. This series of events would establish a long parallel history between the 295th and the 296th infantry regiments. Diagram showing the split of the 295th into the 296th while the 296th becomes the 295th. On June 1, 1936, a set of confusing changes takes place. First, the 1st Battalion of the 295th Infantry Regiment (1-295) is split into two battalions in order to form the 1st Battalion and 2nd Battalion of the 295th Infantry Regiment (1-295 & 2-295). However, these two battalions (1-295 & 2-295) become the 1st Battalion and 2nd Battalion of the 296th Infantry Regiment (1-296 & 2-296) while simultaneously the pre-existing 1st Battalion of the 296th (1-296) becomes the 1st Battalion of the 295th Infantry Regiment (1-295). A few months after the break out of World War II, between 18–25 June 1940 the regiment organizes its 3rd Battalion (3-295). Several weeks after, on August 25, 1940, the regiment becomes part of a new unit: the 92nd Infantry Brigade. A few years later, on January 1, 1944, the regiment was activated and served in the American Theater of war in the Panama Canal Zone until February 20, 1946. The regiment then suffered a series of mobilizations, inactivations, and reorganizations that ultimately dissolved it as a regiment on May 1, 1964. The regiment was simply reorganized as two battalions of the 92nd Infantry Brigade on that date although they maintained their names without an administrative hierarchy as a regiment. Finally, on December 31, 1967, the battalions were reorganized as a single battalion of the 92nd Infantry Brigade. The battalion, however, was eventually allocated to the 101st Troop Command. Most recently, Company C, 1st Battalion, 295th Infantry Regiment (C/1-295) spent a year running security escort missions throughout southern Iraq and security patrols around Baghdad International Airport as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2006. ==Structure== * Executive branch of the government of Puerto Rico & National Guard Bureau & United States Department of the Army ** Puerto Rico National Guard & Army National Guard *** Puerto Rico Army National Guard **** 101st Troop Command ***** 1st Battalion, 295th Infantry Regiment ==Honors and awards== Streamer for American Campaign Medal {  border=\\"1\\" - ! 1st row  American Campaign Streamer } ==See also== * Military history of Puerto Rico ==NotesReferences== Category:Military units and formations in Puerto Rico Category:Puerto Rico Army National Guard ","title":"295th Infantry Regiment"},{"id":"42078819","text":"was an vice admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy, noted for his role in the Siemens scandal. ==Biography== Matsumoto was born in Edo (now Tokyo) as the younger son of a direct retainer of the Tokugawa shogunate.

A work area in the station was powered by a Pelton wheel driving a belt, an unusual feature. The ceiling is a peaked assembly of steel beams with an arched brick infill. Water is supplied through a steel conduit and penstock system with a head from the Stairs Station upstream. The dam, built in 1945, is part of neither historic district. The transformer house is a plainer version of the power house. The operator's residence is nearby, built using the same sand-colored brick with extensive corbeling and a hipped roof. Two other residences of wood frame construction stand nearby, added in the 1920s. The present operator's residence is outside the historic district. ==History== The Granite Power Station was built beginning in 1896 by the Utah Power Company, owned by the Salt Lake City Railroad Company to provide power to the company's streetcar system. The station did not live up to expectations and was frequently out of service. After several changes of ownership, the plant passed into the hands of Utah Power and Light in 1912. PacifiCorp later took ownership in 1989 operating the site under its own name as well as the name Rocky Mountain Power. Deseret News Article.

The Massachusetts–Lowell River Hawks, the defending champions from the 2012–13 season, defeated New Hampshire 4-0 to repeat as champions and became the 7th team in league history to successfully defend their title. Sophomore goalie Connor Hellebuyck was named tournament MVP for his 30-save shutout in the championship match that gave the River Hawks Hockey East's automatic bid into the 2014 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. The tournament is the 30th in league history, as the conference entered its 30th year of existence. It was also the first tournament since 2004 that neither Boston College nor Boston University advanced to at least the semifinals, played at the TD Garden. ==Format== With the addition of Notre Dame to Hockey East, the tournament was reformatted to include all eleven teams in the conference. With eleven being an uneven number, an unorthodox format was needed to achieve a tournament that allowed all eleven teams to participate. A fourth, Opening Round was added before the traditional Quarterfinals, which consists of single-elimination games between the 6-11 seeds hosted by the higher seed, with the 1-5 seeds earning a bye to the next round. The 4 and 5 seeds are guaranteed to play each other whereas the 1-3 seeds will play the winners of the 6-11 seed games, with the highest seeds hosting the lowest seeds remaining. The Quarterfinals through Finals are unchanged from the previous season, with the Quarterfinals consisting of a best-of-three series hosted by the higher seeds, while the Semifinals and Final are single games played at the TD Garden. The tournament champion will receive an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. This tournament format will only be used for the 2013-14 season, as the addition of the UConn Huskies to the conference in the 2014–15 season will bring the total number of teams in the league up to twelve, which allows for a more even, 12-team tournament format. The tournament format following this year will change to a best-of-three Opening Round between 5-11 seeds, with 1-4 seeds earning a bye. The Quarterfinals through Finals will be unchanged. ===Regular season standings=== Note: GP = Games Played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; PTS = Points; GF = Goals For; GA = Goals Against ==Bracket== * denotes overtime periods ==ResultsOpening Round=== On March 7–8 the 6-11 seeds will play in single-elimination games to advance to the best-of-three quarterfinals.

(Some traditional sources written during the subsequent Song Dynasty referred to him as \\"Ma Yisun\\" () to observe naming taboo for Song's founding emperor Zhao Kuangyin (Emperor Taizu).) == Background == It is not known when Ma Yinsun was born, and all that is known about his family background was that he was from Shanghe (商河, in modern Jinan, Shandong). It was said that he had a weak personality. He was studious in his youth, and he particularly took after Han Yu in his writing style. At some point (although it is not known when), he passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 55. == Service under Li Congke  Before Li Congke's reign === During the reign of the Later Tang emperor Li Siyuan, Li Siyuan's adoptive son Li Congke served as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Huguo Circuit (護國, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. Ma Yinsun became Li Congke's assistant in Li Congke's role as governor (觀察使, Guanchashi). When Li Congke lost his governorship of Huguo due to the machinations of Li Siyuan's chief of staff An Chonghui in 930 and was forced to take up residence at the capital Luoyang with no real authorities, instead of leaving Li Congke, Ma followed Li Congke to Luoyang and continued to serve him. Later (after An's fall from grace and Li Congke's restoration to grace), Ma continued to follow Li Congke to his posts as the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (京兆, in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi) and then as the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). As of 934, Li Congke's adoptive brother (Li Siyuan's biological son) Li Conghou was emperor. Dominating his court were his chiefs of staff, Zhu Hongzhao and Feng Yun, who suspected both Li Congke and his brother-in-law (Li Siyuan's son-in- law) Shi Jingtang the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). They decided to dislodge both Li Congke and Shi by issuing a number of orders, transferring Li Congke from Fengxiang to Hedong, Shi from Hedong to Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), and Chengde's military governor Fan Yanguang to Tianxiong Circuit (天雄, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei). Li Congke feared that this was a deathtrap, and he consulted his staff members, most of whom suggested that he rebel. When he consulted Ma, Ma advised heading to Luoyang to pay homage to Li Conghou and then report to Hedong — a suggestion that the other staff members were openly contemptuous to. Li Congke ultimately decided to rebel,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. but respected Ma for his faithfulness. Li Congke's army soon defeated the army Li Conghou sent against him, and marched on Luoyang, but was killed in flight. Li Congke became emperor. === During Li Congke's reign === Li Congke, once he took the throne, commissioned Ma Yinsun as imperial scholar (翰林學士, Hanlin Xueshi) as well as Hubu Langzhong (), a supervisory official at the ministry of census (戶部, Hubu), and put him in charge of drafting edicts. Within the span of a year, he continued to promote Ma — first to Zhongshu Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng); then to deputy minister of rites (禮部侍郎, Libu Shilang); Ma also continued to serve as imperial scholar.Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 127. In spring 936, Li Congke commissioned Ma as the Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎, deputy head of the legislative bureau) and chancellor, with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). However, it was said that because Ma was overly careful, he did not handle many of the responsibilities of chancellorship, and also was not seeing guests. Therefore, people referred to him as, \\"the one who does not open three things\\" () — i.e., he did not open his mouth (to talk), did not open his seal (to handle official business), and did not open his gate (to welcome people in).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. Shortly after Ma became chancellor, Shi Jingtang, then still at Hedong, rebelled. The forces that Li Congke sent against him, commanded by Zhang Jingda, was defeated by the joint army of Shi and Emperor Taizong of Later Tang's northern rival Khitan Empire, and soon became surrounded by Khitan/Hedong troops at Jin'an Base (晉安寨, near Hedong's capital Taiyuan). A second major general that Li Congke sent, Zhao Dejun, was not fully devoted to Li Congke's cause, and stopped well short of Taiyuan, while secretly negotiating with Emperor Taizong, hoping that Emperor Taizong would support him rather than Shi as Li Congke's replacement instead. Li Congke's own army stopped at Huai Prefecture (懷州, in modern Jiaozuo, Henan), as Li Congke became paralyzed by fear. At that time, Ma, whom Li Congke had left at Luoyang, arrived at Huai as well. The other chancellors, anticipating that Ma would have good suggestions, stated, \\"Chancellor Ma has arrived. He must have suggestions on how to secure the state.\\" Instead, all Ma did was offer silk to Li Congke, and had nothing else in terms of suggestions. Soon thereafter, Zhang's deputy Yang Guangyuan assassinated him and surrendered the army at Jin'an to the joint Khitan/Hedong army. Emperor Taizong declared Shi the emperor of a new Later Jin, and Shi advanced south toward Luoyang. Zhao's army collapsed, and he was forced to surrender. Li Congke, finding the situation hopeless, returned to Luoyang and committed suicide with his family, ending Later Tang. Shi entered Luoyang shortly after and took over Later Tang's territory. == After Later Tang == In an edict that Shi Jingtang issued after entering Luoyang that declared a general pardon, he, excepting them from the general pardon, ordered the deaths of Li Congke's close associates Zhang Yanlang, Liu Yanhao, and Liu Yanlang (). He singled out several officials whom he stated as not complicit with Li Congke (his justification for rebelling against Li Congke was that Li Congke, as an adoptive son, was an usurper of the Later Tang throne) — Ma Yinsun, Fang Gao, Li Zhuanmei (), and Han Zhaoyin — such that they were removed from their posts but spared their lives. In 939, Shi, apparently viewed his punishment of Ma, Fang, Han, and Li Zhuanmei to be too harsh (as he pitied them for being in poverty), commissioned them various offices — in Ma's case, Taizi Binke () — but then immediately ordered them into retirement (i.e., to allow them to draw pensions without allowing them to return to the government).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. In retirement, Ma made a complete turn in his spiritual beliefs. Previously, he had been a critic of Buddhism, taking after Han Yu, whose writing style he followed. Now, in retirement, he lamented Li Congke's fate bitterly, as he was still thankful for Li Congke's grace toward him. He began to study Buddhist sutras, hoping to gain divine favor and have the favor transferred to Li Congke's soul. He was particularly fascinated with the Avatamsaka Sutra and the Śūraṅgama Sūtra. He took to copy those sutras personally, and he wrote poems summarizing their theology, which he collected in a work titled the Faxi Collection (), and further wrote a prose excerpt of key points from those sutras as well, titled the Fuguo Collection (). When someone mockingly asked him, \\"You, Lord, throughout your life, had viewed Fu Yi [(a Sui Dynasty anti-Buddhist writer)] and Han Yu to have the better view. How is it that your arrogance has turned to abjectness? Is it that Buddha is flattering you? Or is it that you are flattering Buddha?\\" Ma smiled and responded, \\"It would be too much for me to say that Buddha is flattering me.\\" Throughout Later Jin and the succeeding Later Han, it was said that because the officials knew that Ma liked to write, they often requested him to write for them. Ma also favored calligraphy, and whenever he was he wrote greetings to others, he would write it himself to show up his calligraphic abilities. After Guo Wei founded Later Zhou, he gave Ma, in addition to the title of Taizi Binke, also the title of acting minister of rites (禮部尚書, Libu Shangshu), but with his office at Luoyang rather than then-capital Kaifeng — in other words, keeping him in de facto retirement. He died in 953, during Guo's reign. == Notes and references == * Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 127. * New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 55. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 279, 280, 282.

It is named after Queen Saleha, the queen consort of the current Sultan of Brunei, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. The cable-stayed bridge is the first of its kind in Brunei. It was officially inaugurated on 14 October 2017. It is the second-longest single-pylon cable-stayed bridge in the world. == Design == The bridge has a total length of 622 metres and the main span is 300 metres long. It is a cable-stayed bridge with one tower which rises to the height of 157 metres. At the top is an Islamic dome with a diametre of 8.7 metres and weighs 9.5 tonnes. The tower has since been the tallest structure in the country. The bridge is also reported to be the second longest single-pylon cable-stayed bridge in the world. On the bridge is a dual-carriageway road with interchanges at both ends, as well as pedestrian sidewalks. At the base of the tower is a crescent island which resembles that of the Panji-Panji or Emblem of Brunei. On the island there is a small building that has been built, which is slated to be a gallery. The Sungai Kebun Bridge in April 2016 ==History== The Ministry of Development reached a success to begin the construction of the bridge on June 2013 as part of the 10th National Development Plan. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on 16 January 2014, officiated by the Crown Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah. The joint-venture between the South Korean company Daelim Industrial and local Swee constructed the bridge, which took about three years and cost 139 million Brunei dollar ($100M as of October 2017). The bridge began to open to the public on 2 October 2017 on a trial basis. On the 14th in the same month, it was finally inaugurated in a grand opening ceremony as part of the Golden Jubilee celebration of His Majesty the Sultan, which included fireworks display by Howard & Sons, Hunan Dream Fireworks and Liuyang Intently Fireworks, as well as procession of decorated floats. == References == Category:Bridges in Brunei Category:Bridges completed in 2017 ","title":"Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Hajah Saleha Bridge"},{"id":"42079075","text":"Gvozdarus is a genus of notothen native to the Southern Ocean. ==Species== The recognized species in this genus are: * Gvozdarus balushkini Voskoboinikova & Kellermann, 1993 * Gvozdarus svetovidovi Balushkin, 1989 (Naked-head toothfish) ==References== Category:Nototheniidae ","title":"Gvozdarus"},{"id":"42079089","text":"Phaio acquiguttata is a moth of the subfamily Arctiinae.

It generally develops in the second metatarsal, but can occur in any metatarsal. Physical stress causes multiple tiny fractures where the middle of the metatarsal meets the growth plate. These fractures impair blood flow to the end of the metatarsal resulting in the death of bone cells (osteonecrosis). It is an uncommon condition, occurring most often in young women, athletes, and those with abnormally long metatarsals. Approximately 80% of those diagnosed are women. Initial treatment is generally 4–6 weeks of limited activity, often with crutches or orthotics. In rare cases, surgery is necessary to reduce the bone mass of the metatarsal. The condition was first described by Dr. Alfred H. Freiberg in 1914.

As of 2014, the largest Hmong populations in the state are located in Green Bay, La Crosse, Milwaukee, Sheboygan, and Wausau. ==History== Hmong people first arrived in the upper Midwest in 1975 or 1976 following the United States withdrawal from the Vietnam War. They were seeking asylum in the United States, as many had worked or served in fighting for U.S. forces in Laos during the \\"secret war\\".Burt, p. 111. By 1980 there were 408 Hmong people in the state. Originally only Hmong veterans were allowed to immigrate.Zaniewski and Rosen, p. 14. Churches and social service agencies initially settled Southeast Asian refugees, most of them Hmong, along with some Vietnamese and Laotian people, in Wausau. According to the 1980 U.S. Census, Wausau had fewer than 1% non-White people. There were several dozen Asian immigrants in 1978. By 1980 200 Southeast Asian refugees had settled in Wausau. This increased to 400 in 1982 and 800 in 1984.Beck, Roy. \\"The Ordeal of Immigration in Wausau\\", (Archive). The Atlantic. April 1994. Retrieved March 1, 2014. Over time, the Hmong became the largest ethnic minority in the city.\\"In Wausau, Hmong at another crossroads\\", Chicago Tribune, 16 June 2003. Retrieved on March 2, 2014. Doualy Xaykaothao of The Atlantic stated that ethnic tension between Hmong and native-born Americans in the state started in the 1980s and spilled over into the following decade. In 1990 there were 16,980 Hmong in Wisconsin. This was an increase of more than 4,000% from the 1980 figure. By this time the US government had relaxed some restrictions and allowed families to immigrate, leading to reunification of Hmong families in Wisconsin and other destinations. The first effort aided nuclear families, but Hmong extended families and clans are extremely important to their society, and they pressed also for extended family members to be allowed to immigrate.Mary Jo Beghto, \\"Hmong Refugees and the US Health System\\", Cultural Survival Quarterly, Issue: 12.1 (Spring 1988) Health and Healing, accessed 30 August 2014 They have a patrilineal kinship system. By 1980, the Hmong quickly began to organize Mutual Assistance Associations in cities where they had the largest populations, and these have continued. In 1991 there were 1,010 Hmong students in the Wausau School District. In a period ending in 1994, the tax rate of the Wausau School District rose by 10.48% because of the added expenses of services to children from immigrant families. The increase was three times as high as the increase in an adjacent school district that lacked a large immigrant population. By 1994 Wausau had 4,200 refugees. The number of Hmong students in the school district was over 2,000 in 1996. In 1998 this number reached its peak, 2,214. Wausau had some social upheaval from the Hmong arrival. Some schools in Wausau developed a minority of English speakers or were dominated by Hmong students. Some native-born American families in Wausau criticized crime associated with the Hmong community and the costs of social services to them. In 2000 there were 46,600 Hmong in Wisconsin.Fungchatou Lo In 2006 there were 38,949 Hmong. By 2002, 12% of the Wausau population was Hmong, and 25% of the students at Wausau public schools were Hmong. ===State task force to aid 2004 immigration=== In 2004 the U.S. agreed to allow immigration by an additional 15,000 Hmong in order to close the last refugee camp in Thailand. By 2006 a total of 3,254 of these individuals, representing 682 families, had been settled in Wisconsin. The governor of Wisconsin Jim Doyle appointed a Hmong Resettlement Task Force in 2004 to review social policies and make recommendations to aid the acculturation of Hmong in the state, particularly as some welfare and social service programs were changing as a result of federal law.Arlene K. Welcher, A Review of the Recommendations of the Hmong Resettlement Task Force and the Implementation of These Recommendations, Master's Thesis, March 2009, Graduate School, University of Wisconsin-Stout Menominee, pp 3-7. The state had gained experience with dealing with Hmong immigrants since the 1980s immigration, and many studies supported changes to programs to increase effectiveness. The task force reported in 2005 to the governor with recommendations to support the 2004 immigration.Arlene K. Welcher. A Review of the Recommendations of the Hmong Resettlement Task Force and the Implementation of These Recommendations. Master's Thesis, March 2009, University of Wisconsin-Stout Menominee, pp. 3-7. As a result of these recommendations, additional monies were budgeted for expansion of English as a Second Language (ESL) classes, and vocational skills training at community colleges, as well as for special classes to aid immigrants in adapting to Wisconsin. Local resettlement organizations worked to coordinate with the many Hmong Mutual Assistance Associations. Provisions were made for bilingual, bicultural aids and interpretation services to assist immigrants, and particularly the elderly, in using health and social services and managing interviews and encounters. Materials to gain a driver's license were translated into Hmong and posted on the department's website, and special programs were devised to help immigrants gain driver's licenses, to increase their readiness for work. In addition, employers were recruited for short-term programs to enhance immigrant entry into the job market.Welcher (2009), A Review of Task Force Recommendations, pp. 15-19. Among measures to recognize Hmong contributions, in 2006, the Sheboygan Hmong Memorial was built in Sheboygan. It memorializes the Hmong veterans and civilians who fought with the United States in the Laotian Civil War. As of the 2010 U.S. Census, there were 49,240 Hmong in the state. This was a 46% increase over the 2000 figures.Pabst, Georgia. \\"Report shows growth in Hmong community\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. January 6, 2013. Retrieved March 2, 2014. ==Geography== The majority of Wisconsin Hmong live in central city boundaries of Wisconsin communities, but some rural areas and small towns also have Hmong residents. Due to the post-Vietnam War resettlement policies of the federal government of the United States, the Hmong population was primarily concentrated in medium- sized and large-sized towns.Hachten, Harva and Terese Allen. The Flavor of Wisconsin: An Informal History of Food and Eating in the Badger State. Wisconsin Historical Society, September 3, 2013. , 9780870205538. p. 133. In 2013 Mark Pfeifer, the editor of the Hmong Studies Journal, stated that Hmong in Milwaukee had recently been moving to the northwest side of Milwaukee; they historically lived in the north and south areas of Milwaukee. As of 2010 the largest groups of Hmong in Wisconsin live in Greater Milwaukee, Appleton, Eau Claire, Green Bay, La Crosse, Madison, Sheboygan, and Wausau. As of 2008, the numerically largest Hmong population is in Milwaukee County. In order, the following numerically largest groups are in the counties of La Crosse, Marathon (Wausau), Brown (Green Bay), and Eau Claire. The Hmong make up higher percentages of the population in Eau Claire, La Crosse, and Marathon counties than in the larger Milwaukee county. Jenna Christian, Pa Sia Low Moua, and Ingolf Vogeler, authors of The Cultural Landscape of the Hmong in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, wrote that \\"the Hmong stand out more singularly as an ethnic minority\\" in the other counties, which are less densely populated, \\"than they do in metropolitan areas like Milwaukee, which is already more racially and culturally diverse.\\"Christian, Moua, and Vogeler, p. 3 (internal document page number) In 1998 Zaniewski and Rosen stated that the cities with the largest Hmong groups \\"are dispersed widely throughout the state\\". The communities that they identified as having significant Hmong populations included Appleton, Chippewa Falls, Eau Claire, Fond du Lac, Green Bay, La Crosse, Ladysmith, Madison, Manitowoc, Mauston, Menasha, Menomonie, Milwaukee, Neenah, Oshkosh, Sheboygan, Stevens Point, Superior, Tomah, Two Rivers, Wausau, and Wisconsin Rapids. ==Demographics== As of the 1990 U.S. Census, 74% of Hmong households have an income below the federal poverty level. The average annual household income of the Hmong community was $13,518.Zaniewski and Rosen, p. 14-15. As of 1998, the Hmong had the lowest socioeconomic status of all of the ethnic groups in Wisconsin. As of the 1990 Census, 3% of Wisconsin Hmong are 65 years of age or older, and 55% of Hmong are younger than 15 years of age.Zaniewski and Rosen, p. 15. In December 1999 the Institute for Wisconsin's Future stated in a report, \\"Given the major cultural differences, language barriers and skill gaps facing the Hmong, a number of Wisconsin's Hmong population have relied on welfare to meet their families' basic needs during this transition.\\"Kaiser, Robert L. \\"After 25 Years In U.S., Hmong Still Feel Isolated.\\" Chicago Tribune. December 27, 1999. 1. Retrieved on April 14, 2012. Vicky Selkowe, who served as the organization's project coordinator and the co-writer of the report, said that the language barrier was the main difficulty affecting the state's Hmong population. The immigrant generation's inexperience with the written language worsened their disadvantage in learning a new language. ==Commerce== As of the 1990 U.S. Census, 28% of Hmong are employed in professions or services related to professions. The Wisconsin statewide average in that sector was 23%. As of 2013 many Hmong families have market gardens and attend farmers markets in Eau Claire, Green Bay, La Crosse, Madison, Milwaukee, and Wausau. In the state relatively few Hmong work full- time in the agricultural sector. As of 2003, 90-95% of adult Hmong in Wausau worked in low paying jobs which did not require fluency in English. All eligible members of the family held jobs in a typical Hmong household. In the city of Wausau, as of 2003, some Hmong owned small businesses, restaurants, and grocery stores. As of 2019, The Hmong median household income in Wisconsin of $49,200 is closer to the state's median household income of $50,800. ==Media== , in Wausau, there was relatively little Hmong-language media. Historically, the Hmong language was not written for a significant part of its history. In the Twin Cities of Minnesota, the radio station KFXN (690 AM) carries a Hmong language format, along with television station KJNK-LD3. In Sheboygan, the city's school district station, WSHS, has carried a locally- based Hmong program since 1983 from Vue Yang and the Hmong Mutual Assistance Association. In 1994 Roy Beck wrote an article about Wausau's Hmong community for The Atlantic, stating that it would grow to the point where native-born Americans would be displaced. Beck credited the article for a book publishing deal and other benefits, and these benefits resulted in him establishing Numbers USA. In 2014 Robert Mentzer of the Wausau Daily Herald wrote a follow- up article on Beck's, criticizing it for having \\"racial anxiety\\" and stating that Beck's predictions did not come to fruition. ==Education== A Hmong- centered charter school is located in Milwaukee. Chris Her-Xiong established the Hmong American Peace Academy/International Peace Academy in 2004 as a K-12 school system there. In 1981 there were 160 Hmong students in the Wausau School District (WSD). In the 1990s the Wausau School District received an increase of Hmong students, some of whom came from refugee camps and lacked formal education. In 1993 the Wausau School District began moving students, previously assigned to schools based on attendance zone, to a different scheme intended to equalize the ethnic proportions of Hmong and non-Hmong students. However it reverted to its previous scheme in 1994 after a negative reception from area parents. Patti Kraus, who worked as a secretary for the WSD, stated in 2016 that the ethnic Hmong successfully adapted to American school life. As of the 1990 Census, of the Hmong older than 25, 47% had an education below the fifth-grade level. ==References== * Burt, Susan Meredith. \\"Hmong in Wisconsin\\" (Chapter 8).

He was assigned to the personal guard of Semyon Budyonny and soon married his secretary, Lida; they had a daughter Lena (born 1959) and son Aleksandr, who also became a high-profile bodyguard. In 1956 Soldatov became a personal bodyguard of Nikita Khrushchev. In 1961, when Khrushchev arrived at the Vienna train station, someone threw a metallic cylinder resembling a grenade at Khrushchev's feet. Soldatov jumped and covered the object with his body, ready for explosion, but it was just a capsule with a personal letter to Khrushchev. After Khrushchev was removed from power in 1964, Soldatov was assigned to guard Leonid Brezhnev, as well as other Soviet and foreign leaders, including Erich Honecker, Dmitry Polyansky, Saddam Hussein and one of the princes of Laos.

The nonlinear narrative follows her mother and older sister who set out to solve the mystery of her death, insinuating themselves into the life of the girl who bullied her. ==Plot== Hyun-sook (Kim Hee-ae) is a widowed single mother who is raising two teenage daughters while working at a big grocery store. One day, her youngest child, 14-year-old Cheon-ji (Kim Hyang- gi) suddenly commits suicide by hanging without even leaving a note. To Hyun- sook and her older daughter Man-ji (Go Ah-sung), Cheon-ji was the sweet child of the family who rarely complained and studied hard, while always trying to comfort her hardworking, often-weary mother. Struggling with guilt and anger, and not knowing why Cheon-ji chose to kill herself, the two women wonder whether there was something they missed or something they could have said or done. Flashbacks of Cheon-ji's past show that she had been the victim of cruel acts of bullying at her middle school, led by Hwa-yeon (Kim Yoo-jung), the prettiest and most popular girl in class whose true callous and manipulative nature hides a tortured soul. ==Cast== *Kim Hee-ae as Hyun-sook *Go Ah-sung as Lee Man-ji *Kim Hyang-gi as Lee Cheon-ji *Kim Yoo-jung as Kim Hwa-yeon *Yoo Ah-in as Choo Sang-bak *Sung Dong-il as Kwak Man-ho *Chun Woo-hee as Kwak Mi- ran *Yoo Yeon-mi as Kwak Mi-ra *Park Soo-young as Mr. Im *Kim Jung-young as Hwa-yeon's mother *Lee Jae-gu as Hwa-yeon's father *Kim Ji-hoon as Hyun-sook's co-worker, the dumplings guy *Jang Ah-young as Teacher Lee *Lee Young-eun as Mi-so *Park Ji-young as Soo-kyung *Han Sung-yong as Park, Chinese restaurant delivery man ==Critical reception== Luke Ryan Baldock of The Hollywood News called it \\"the best film of the year so far,\\" with \\"the best exploration of bullying ever seen on-screen, as well as being an uplifting tale of life after death and the importance of understanding.\\" He also praised the script as \\"brave\\" for \\"[tackling] such complex issues in a fair, balanced, and non- judgmental way,\\" and the acting as \\"miraculous across the board, with the young cast taking centre stage and representing the full gamut of emotions.\\" Describing it as a \\"superbly constructed drama,\\" Richard Kuipers of Variety wrote, \\"Rarely, if ever, has the topic of teenage bullying been examined in such forensic detail and delivered with such devastating emotional impact,\\" and that \\"helmer Lee Han maintains perfect tonal control and elicits fine performances from a predominantly female cast.\\" ==Box office== Thread of Lies was released in theaters on March 13, 2014.

He is best known for the coming-of-age film Punch, which became one of the biggest hits on the South Korean box office in 2011. ==Career== Lee Han graduated from Hanyang University's theater and film program. He first worked as an assistant director on two films for veteran filmmaker Bae Chang-ho: Love Story (1996) and My Heart (1999). In 2002, he wrote and directed his first feature, Lovers' Concerto, a melodrama about three friends caught in a love triangle which starred Cha Tae-hyun, Lee Eun-ju and Son Ye-jin. He then wrote the screenplay for Garden of Heaven (2003), a tearjerker about a hospice doctor who falls for a terminally ill patient, played by Ahn Jae-wook and Lee Eun-joo. Lee was also part of the writing staff of Bodyguard, a 2003 action-comedy television series starring Cha Seung-won. With his succeeding films, Lee further solidified his reputation as a filmmaker with a keen insight into modern romance. Almost Love (also known as Youth Comic) is a 2006 romantic comedy starring Kwon Sang-woo and Kim Ha-neul about a stuntman and an actress with stage fright. My Love (also known as Love, First) is a 2007 Christmas movie which featured an ensemble cast playing multiple couples, namely Kam Woo-sung, Choi Kang-hee, Ryu Seung-ryong, Im Jung-eun, Jung Il-woo, Lee Yeon-hee and Uhm Tae-woong. But Lee's breakthrough film would be his fourth feature, Punch (2011). Based on Kim Ryeo-ryeong's 2008 bestseller Wandeuk, the film seriously highlighted the issue of multicultural families in a coming-of-age comedy-drama about a poor and rebellious teenage boy (the titular Wandeuk, played by Yoo Ah-in), whose idiosyncratic homeroom teacher and next-door neighbor (Kim Yoon-seok) encourages him to learn more about his Filipino immigrant mother, and their teacher-student relationship helps him mature into a young man. After gaining strong word of mouth for its interesting story and charismatic performances, Punch became a surprise box office hit, drawing 5.3 million viewers. It was also invited to the 2012 Berlin International Film Festival; it screened in Generation 14Plus, a competition section of Berlinale devoted to films for teens. Commenting on the film's positive reception, Lee told Yonhap News that the seemingly eclectic ensemble of characters who appear in Punch, though they rarely receive the limelight, are present and active as members of Korean society. He also believed that the warmth and honesty with which he tried to portray these characters and introduce their daily lives was what resonated with viewers. In 2014, Lee adapted another bestselling novel by Kim Ryeo- ryeong, Elegant Lies (published in 2009). When quizzed about adapting another work by the same author, Lee said that he chose to do so because \\"the story was interesting as well as meaningful. In fact I turned down the original story at first because it seemed too difficult. However, it captivated and wouldn't let go.

Positively viewed teams will retain and employ better staff. Lack of respect and what is sometimes called \\"incivility\\"—low level negative behaviours (such as rudeness, discourteousness, not acknowledging others)—can create a dysfunctional team environment, relationship breakdown, decline in productivity, and the risk of psychological injury. == Process == Managers that want to encourage a respectful workplace must model the appropriate example. They should talk about what behaviours are encouraged. The managers must be willing to talk about problem behaviours. There should be safe ways to report problems, which could be anonymous, or independent people such as an ombudsman. Measures of the culture could include competitiveness, formality, respect, hospitality and supportiveness. Respect can be included in performance appraisals, with feedback given in a formal process. Disrespectful behaviour must not be ignored but be named and its impact brought to the attention of the responsible person. By ignoring problematic behaviour, others will perceive it as condoned. The \\"compassionate organisation\\" will have strategies that deal with problems affecting the well being of employees such as redundancies, disasters, workplace conflict. There would be strategies that enable recovery from distress. ==References * Sample guideline Category:Occupational safety and health ","title":"Respectful workplace"},{"id":"42079540","text":"Southeast side of Allen Flat Allen Flat is a flat in Cochise County, Arizona. ==References== Category:Landforms of Cochise County, Arizona ","title":"Allen Flat"},{"id":"42079562","text":"Vladimir Sobachenkov () is a retired Soviet KGB officer who served as a bodyguard of Leonid Brezhnev.

Her disappearance remains unsolved. Carpenter was last seen by a taxi driver around 9:30 p.m. on Tuesday, June 1, 1948. Numerous individuals have reported seeing her over the years, but none of these sightings have been confirmed. Her mother, Mrs. Hazel E. Carpenter (later Mrs. Hazel Smith), spent many years helping police chase down rumors and leads. She eventually gave up hope, believing that her daughter was dead, although she still wanted her body to be found. In 1998, Denton police received an anonymous tip that Carpenter was buried at the campus she was supposed to attend, but it turned out fruitless. Countless man-hours and almost a quarter of a million dollars were spent on the investigation. The case is cold but remains open. Speculation of Carpenter's disappearance was that the serial killer responsible for the Texarkana Moonlight Murders had murdered her, since she knew three of the victims. The girl's mother convinced herself that Carpenter was a victim of amnesia, not knowing who she was or where she was from, which prompted her to give the girl's life story for the second anniversary of her disappearance in the Denton Record-Chronicle; although the year before, she was convinced that her daughter was dead. Bones were found around Denton County in 1949, 1958 and 1960, but they were declared to not be Miss Carpenter. In 1985, Lewis C. Rigler, a Texas Ranger who was a lead investigator in the case, said that he was not surprised that what may have been the most famous missing person case in Texas was still drawing attention. == Description == An only child, Virginia Carpenter was tall, weighed , and had dark brown hair and brown eyes. She was last seen wearing a light white chambray dress with brown and green stripes (some descriptions include red stripes) and silver buttons down the front, a small white straw hat with the brim flipped up and a white feather stuck in the back, red leather platform high-heeled shoes, and a gold Wittnauer watch. Carpenter took with her a red purse, a black pasteboard hat box, and a brown steamer trunk with a matching cosmetics case. According to Mrs. Carpenter, her daughter left with no more than 15 or 20 dollars. == Disappearance == A scene recreation from the Denton Record-Chronicle On Tuesday, June 1, 1948, Carpenter went to Texarkana Union Station and boarded the Texas & Pacific Texas Special #31, which departed for Dallas at about 3 p.m. The train stopped in Denton around six hours later. She was on her way to the Texas State College for Women (TSCW) campus now Texas Woman's University to enroll in the summer course. While on the train, Carpenter met Marjorie Webster, a middle-aged school teacher who was also enrolling at TSCW from Texarkana. After arriving in Denton, both women hired a taxi (driven by Edgar Ray \\"Jack\\" Zachary) to take them to the college dormitories. As Webster was being dropped off at the Fitzgerald dormitories, Carpenter realized that she forgot to check on her trunk at the Denton train station. She asked Zachary how much it would be to take her back to the station, to which he replied 75 cents. Webster asked if she needed to ride back with her, but Carpenter refused, stating, \\"No, I'll go alone. I'll be alright.\\" After arriving again at the station, Carpenter went inside to get her trunk but came back a few minutes later claiming that she could not get it. She spoke to a railroad employee named Mr. Butrill, who told her the trunk would not arrive until later. Zachary told Carpenter to sign the back of her claim check and that he would pick it up and deliver it to her in the morning. Carpenter agreed and gave him her luggage receipt after writing \\"Virginia Carpenter, Room 200-- Brackenridge\\", and a dollar for the extra trip. Upon arriving back at Brackenridge Hall about 9:30 p.m., Zachary said he saw a yellow or cream- colored convertible parked in the front. There was no moon, and the street lights were out due to repair work on a cable. He reported that Carpenter walked up to the vehicle, which had two young men standing by it; one of whom was tall, the other short and stocky. She asked, \\"Well, what are y'all doing here?\\" He said it seemed as though she was surprised to see them. The shorter boy talked to her and lifted her on the curb. Carpenter told Zachary to place her luggage on the ground because the boys will get them for her and to leave her trunk there in the morning as well. After doing so, Zachary drove off but did not hear the rest of the conversation. That was the last anyone had seen Carpenter. Reports claimed that a nightwatchman saw Carpenter get out of the cab and into the convertible. The next morning, Zachary dropped the trunk off and set it on the front lawn of Brackenridge Hall. After being there for two days, it was taken to the office. Mrs. Mattie Lloyd Wooten, the dean of women of TSCW, later explained to Mrs. Carpenter that it was the first time someone did not deliver luggage to the room. == Investigation == Three days later on Friday, June 4, Carpenter's boyfriend, Kenny Branham of Dallas, called her mother in Texarkana because he could not get a hold of her. Mrs. Carpenter, now worried, called TSCW and found out that her daughter never enrolled. She then called friends and relatives that her daughter may have tried visiting, but they had not heard from her. On Saturday, June 5, around 12:30 a.m., she called the local authorities and the Denton police to report Carpenter missing. The Texarkana police told her to \\"just go to bed and we'll get on the case in the morning\\", but she could not sleep, so she and Mrs. Lucille Bailey, a friend who was living with her, left for Denton at 2:10 a.m. Late Saturday night, the girl's uncle and friends went to Denton to help assist the police in their search with any helpful information, but they failed to shed any light. Airplanes began scanning the Denton area and motorboats were used to search ponds and lakes. Search parties searched the woods as well as tanks, storm drains, creeks, country roads and abandoned wells. The search went statewide as police checked out drivers of light-colored convertibles in Texarkana and Denton, but came up with nothing. Lewis C. Rigler, a Texas Ranger, entered the investigation on Monday, June 7, by the request of Carpenter's uncle, Dr. E.C. Dodd, along with Chief of Police Jack Shepherd and Sheriff Roy Moore. Officers talked with groups and individuals as possible witnesses. Hunters and farmers were asked to be on the lookout for freshly dug dirt or any unusual odors. Pictures and a description of Carpenter were sent to the Department of Public Safety, major city police departments, protection officers of major railroad companies, state investigative agenciess, among others. Carpenter's trunk was eventually opened, but it gave officers no clues. Her handbag was never found. A reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible started Wednesday, June 9, and by the end of Friday night, it had reached $1,368. Carpenter's picture and description was given to Reward magazine, the official publication of Tracers Company of America which investigates missing people with rewards. Despite having 150,000 police officials as subscribers, little replies came in about Carpenter and investigations came out inconclusive. On Friday, July 9, Zachary took a polygraph test which concluded that he had no connection to her disappearance. By Monday, July 12, it was rumored that Carpenter had returned home, but her mother confirmed that it was untrue. Shepherd said that Carpenter knew some boys with a cream-colored convertible, but was not able to implicate any of them with her disappearance. Many leads and tips were thoroughly checked but police were no further to finding Carpenter. More rumors had spread that she returned home or that her body or her luggage was found, but they were branded false by Shepherd. The reward money reached around $3,000, most of which was given back to the donors after two years of no helpful information. On June 9, 1955, seven years after her disappearance, Carpenter was considered officially dead under Article 55:41 in the Texas Civil Statute. On October 18, 1959, a three-by-one wooden box was discovered, containing female bones including a skull, in a smokehouse near an abandoned farmhouse 7.5 miles northeast of Jefferson, Texas. The bones, which matched the height and weight description of Carpenter, were sent to Austin for examination. During that time, the previous owners of the farmhouse admitted to digging up the bones from a \\"Negro\\" cemetery. Mrs. Carpenter had hopes that it was her daughter's remains because the bones had a deformity in the right leg which made it shorter than the left, similar to Carpenter. Although the remains turned out to be from a white female with a shortened leg, the dental work did not match. In May 1998, the police were tipped by a man in his 70s claiming that he knew who killed Carpenter and where she was buried. He stated she was buried on the grounds of the TSCW (now TWU) campus. The area was excavated, but only a leather glove, a rubber boot, and animal bone fragments were found. == Reported sightings == Not long after Carpenter went missing, reports of sightings came in from Denton County, South Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas. None of the sightings, however, were confirmed. Two mornings after Carpenter's disappearance, a gas station attendant in Aubrey, Texas, located ten miles from Denton, saw a girl who resembled her. He reported his sighting on June 6 after seeing Carpenter's picture in that morning's newspaper. He said that a yellow convertible with Arkansas license plates occupied by two boys and two girls stopped at his station. On Friday, June 11 around 9:00 p.m., a ticket agent named Mrs. James, working at a bus station in DeQueen, Arkansas, saw a girl who resembled Carpenter. The girl got off a bus from Texarkana wearing a red dress and carrying a red purse. She waited in the lobby before departing ten minutes later with a young man about 25- or 26- years old, weighing about 135 pounds, with light brown hair, and wearing a white shirt with khaki trousers. Mrs. James reported that before the girl met the boy, she seemed nervous by biting her lips a lot and going to the door frequently. She also inquired about local hotels. A few moments after their departure, Mrs. James received a phone call from a woman asking if \\"Miss Virginia Carpenter\\" was there. Mrs. James learned the next morning about Carpenter's disappearance and reported her sighting to the police. Bowie County Sheriff Bill Presley and FBI agent H. S. Hallett showed Mrs. James two groups of pictures in which she pointed out Carpenter as the girl she had seen. Police checked hotels and tourist camps but came up with nothing. Later, Mrs. James was uncertain of her identification of the girl. On Saturday, June 12, a girl matching Carpenter's description was reported riding in a car with two boys in Mena, Arkansas (47 miles from DeQueen). A Michigan tourist in Tucson, Arizona reported seeing a girl matching Carpenter's description on July 8 after seeing her reward poster in a local cafe. By July 12, Mrs. Carpenter said she had checked all leads in the case but was no closer to learning of her daughter's whereabouts. On Friday, January 14, 1949, the Houston Press received a letter written in pencil, signed by Mrs. Gladys Bass from Chireno, Texas, who claimed that she and her friends met a girl who was well-dressed and well-educated who had been hitchhiking. The girl told them she was hungry and had no money. \\"She called herself Virginia. She talked properly, had long brown curly hair that touched her shoulders, and wore a white hat with a feather in it, a striped dress and blue sweater,\\" she wrote. She said while they were eating at a cafe, the girl claimed to have run away. They all departed thinking that she was telling a story. It was not until later they believed that the girl was Carpenter, but the police were unable to substantiate Bass's report. == Theories == Since Carpenter went missing, different theories have been proposed as the reason for her disappearance, including running away, leaving with a lover, being kidnapped, being murdered, amnesia, or even being sold into a white slavery ring. Psychiatrists and doctors who were consulted stated she had nothing to run away from but had rather enthusiastically looked forward to the future. It was also suggested that her body could have been weighed down and sunken in Lake Dallas, which was too large and too deep to be dragged. Carpenter knew three of the victims who were murdered by the \\"Phantom Killer\\" credited with the Texarkana Moonlight Murders, leading to speculation as to whether that case was linked to her disappearance. Texas Ranger Lewis Rigler concluded Carpenter was dead because he believed there was no reason for her to disappear. He said she did not owe anyone any money, she had no criminal past, no jealous ex-boyfriends, no lovers convincing her to run away, and according to a medical exam before her disappearance, she was not pregnant. == Personal life == Virginia Carpenter with her family at Caddo Gap Lake in the Arkansas Ozarks when she was nine Mary Carpenter was born January 25, 1927 in Texarkana. She was a healthy baby, mostly feeding from Holstein milk which was suggested by her maternal grandfather who eventually gave the family a Holstein cow. She began walking at a young age and as her mother put it, she \\"inherited a bad streak from me of wanting to walk a little too far from home.\\" To keep her from doing so, Mrs. Carpenter would scare her daughter by telling her that big dogs roamed the streets. When she was three, Miss Carpenter rolled down the back steps at her home and hit a tree. X-rays showed that she had no injuries. Three months afterward, she caught a bad case of influenza and could not walk. Her parents diligently searched for a cause for her illness but medical science at the time could not diagnose her. She got better for a while but then a severe attack left her badly crippled. The family went through many orthopedic surgeons until one in Memphis, Tennessee found an infection in her right hip bone. It left perforations in it similar to tiny pinholes. Virginia was placed in a contraption for a few months that pulled her leg back into proper position. Too young to understand, Carpenter was given internal medicine, a diet, and the task to sunbathe on the hospital's tar roof for two hours a day for two years. She was able to walk better with the use of a steel brace that fitted into the heel of her shoe which then came up to a leather- rolled \\"saddle\\" around her hip. Mrs. Carpenter admitted to making the mistake of placing Virginia in kindergarten while she was still in the brace. Virginia soon became self-conscious and lost weight due to a loss of appetite. She was taken out of school but returned a year later when the brace was removed. She was announced \\"completely cured\\" by a specialist when she was 12. She was one of only four complete case histories compiled for the American Medical Association. Last known picture of Virginia taken by a friend from Texarkana Junior College at the yearly picnic in Daingerfield Photo of Virginia Not long after going to Arkansas High School with her cousin, her father became seriously ill. He died two years later when she was 15. She was not bright in school, but her teachers described her as a child with an unusual amount of common sense and loyalty. She was a quiet girl and rarely participated in activities because she tired easily and had a limp in her right leg from her childhood disease. She joined the band and became a majorette. Because of her participation in activities, she joined a sorority after receiving a bid from each one. After graduating from Arkansas High in 1944, she went to the University of Arkansas to study journalism. After a year, she came home and told her mother that she wanted to go into laboratory technician training but it required something she did not take in high school (science). She went to TSCW from September 1945 until February 1946 when she had to quit and take care of her mother who became ill. She planned on finishing her schooling within a year. After her mother became ill, she underwent major surgery. A week later, Virginia was struck with appendicitis and was also operated on. A month later, they were both taken home by an \\"Aggie\\" (a student from Texas A&M; University) named Mac. Virginia fell in love with Mac, became engaged, and set a date for their wedding. Her grandparents did not approve of the engagement. Three weeks before their wedding date, Virginia broke it off. Virginia's mother said, \\"I loved Mac because of his fine qualities and because he was so good to me, but I couldn't see their two personalities living together in harmony.\\" Virginia soon started working for a clinic. She wanted to be a nurse but knew that her right leg would not support the strenuous hours of being on her feet. She decided instead to be a technician. Mrs. Carpenter revealed that Virginia wanted to be a technician because medical science did not find a cure for her father. Virginia wanted to return to school but worried about finances. She then took a job at an insurance firm because it paid a better salary. She stayed with the firm until August 1947 when she had enough money to go back to school. She started the next month at Texarkana Junior College. She now had her future planned: she could go to TSCW in the summer which would enable her to attend the technician training in the autumn of 1948. Ten days before school was out, Virginia went to the annual picnic from Texarkana Junior College at a lake near Daingerfield, Texas. She left with her date and another couple. About 5 p.m. that evening, Virginia came home and said she did not feel well. Mrs. Carpenter said her daughter \\"was one of the most sunburned persons I had ever seen.\\" Virginia fell across her bed and went to sleep. Hazel woke her for supper but Virginia said she did not feel like eating. She came to the dinner table but fainted. She regained consciousness while her mother was taking her to the bathroom and then she fainted again and fell to the floor. Mrs. Carpenter did not think she would revive. She picked her up and put her in the bed before calling a doctor. While waiting for the doctor, Virginia regained consciousness and then fainted again, due to sunstroke. She was diagnosed with second-degree sunburn. He prescribed her with rest and quiet for a few days. After the third day, Virginia made an effort to take her final exams at school. While there, she told her teachers about her love affair that did not work out and that she fell in love again but the boy did not love her. In the last few months before her disappearance, she took up sketching and became quite good through the coaching of a friend. Mrs. Carpenter said that a portrait Virginia did from memory of her father was one of the best likeness she had ever seen. Virginia was recovering from her sunburn when she packed for her trip to Denton. Mrs. Carpenter wanted to take Virginia to Denton in the car, but she insisted that she would be fine on the train. On June 1, the day of her disappearance, they ran to the station and caught the train moments before it left. \\"I was so in hopes we would find the train gone so that I could drive her down the next morning. There was a tinge of disappointment when I saw the train had not left, but she refused to get on until she kissed me goodbye; and as she stood on the rear platform of the train waving goodbye, I wondered if there was anyone more radiant and beautiful. In my heart I offered a silent prayer because she was mine.\\" ==See also== *List of people who disappeared == References  External links == * Virginia Carpenter at CharleyProject.org Disappearance of Virginia Carpenter Category:Possibly living people Category:1927 births Category:1940s missing person cases Category:Missing person cases in Texas ","title":"Disappearance of Virginia Carpenter"},{"id":"42079624","text":"Johnny Lyon Hills, are a range of hills, north of the Tres Alamos Wash and the Little Dragoon Mountains in Cochise County, Arizona.

A study in 2009 ranked him as the 14th most influential physicist in the world for the period 1967–1973.. ==Biography== Claud William Venton Lovelace was born in London, England on January 16, 1934. His family emigrated to South Africa, and Lovelace began to study physics on his own at the age of 15.. He received a B.Sc. from the University of Cape Town in 1954, at the age of 20, but then turned to architecture. Lovelace returned to physics in 1958 for graduate studies at Imperial College, London, under the supervision of Abdus Salam, who shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to the electroweak theory, which unifies weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles. Lovelace did not complete his Ph.D., and in 1965 left Imperial College for a position with Daniele Amati at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), in Geneva, Switzerland. There, Lovelace began to investigate the role of hadrons in string theory. At the time, researchers were investigating two types of string interaction models: Reggeons (open-ended strings) and Pomerons (closed-loop strings). One of the prerequisites for these models to be credible required unitarity in the ordinary four dimensions of spacetime, which the Pomeron model could not show. Instead, the theory yielded strange (hypothetical) entities - named tachyons - that, among other characteristics, had to be able to travel backwards in time and be faster than light, both of which are violations of the ordinary four dimensions of spacetime. In attempting to resolve the dilemma, Lovelace relaxed the assumption that strings had to be restricted to four dimensions. This premise was not unheard of. Abstract five-dimensional space was already a legitimate mathematical construct, and the boson-exchange theories of Theodor Kaluza and Oskar Klein required a fifth dimension for the unification of gravitation with electromagnetism (Kaluza–Klein theory, 1921). Similarly, in the 1930s and 1940s, Albert Einstein had considered fifth-dimensional unification before turning to other approaches. But Lovelace did not stop with the fifth or sixth dimension. Instead, he continued to increase the number of dimensions until, strangely, at D = 26 the problem with tachyons vanished and unitarity was restored.. Despite the earlier models that worked in more than four dimensions, at the time nobody took anything more than four dimensions too seriously. Lovelace did not think his discovery would be taken seriously either, but chose to publish it anyway. In 'Pomeron form factors and dual Regge cuts' (Physics Letters, B34, Issue 6, March 1971, pp. 500–506), he announced his 26th dimension observation towards the end of the seven page paper. Lovelace's observation changed the way that strings are thought about,. and the existence of more than four dimensions is today generally accepted in modeling theory... In September 1971, Lovelace moved to Piscataway, New Jersey, where he obtained a professorship at Rutgers University despite his lack of a Ph.D. He remained there for the rest of his life, grappling with the nuances of various versions of string theory. Claud Lovelace died of prostatic cancer in 2012. He left his estate to Rutgers University, which provides the endowed Lovelace Chair in Physics in his name. ==NotesReferences== *.

In the 2014-15 season, he batted .326 with a .482 on-base percentage (OBP), .456 slugging percentage (SLG), 65 walks and 10 strikeouts in 314 plate appearances, ranking second in the league in OBP. Baseball America ranked him as the #3 Cuban player in April 2015. With a notoriety as contact hitter, Fernández struck out 113 times in 2,580 career CNS plate appearances, a 4.3 percent rate, compared with a 10.1 percent walk rate (263 total walks). For his career in Cuba, Fernández batted .319 with a .403 OBP and .423 SLG.

He did not play in any professional games in 2015 – including the CNS – as he was suspended for previously attempting to defect from Cuba and remained under heavy police guard. On December 2, 2015, reports emerged that he had defected from Cuba. However, at that time, he had yet to establish residency in another country, and still required clearance from Major League Baseball (MLB) to sign a free agent contract with a major league club. ===Los Angeles Dodgers=== On January 11, 2017, it was officially announced that he had signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers.

It was established out of the territories of the Tsardom of Vidin, after the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396. == Administration == The earliest defter of the Sanjak of Nicopolis is composed in the mid-15th century. One group of scholars dated this defter to 1430 while another group of scholars dated it to 1479/1480. This was the first Ottoman defter which mentioned the Romani people, who lived in 431 households, or 3.5 percent of households in this sanjak. === Administrative division === In the collected notes of Evliya Çelebi (mid-17th century) the Sanjak of Nicopolis with 20 ziamets and 244 timars and income of 40,000 aspres was mentioned as one of 24 Ottoman sanjaks in Rumelia. In the mid-19th century it had 15 kadiluks. === Sanjak-beys === Bulgarian historian Rusi Stojkov believed that Skanderbeg was mentioned in 1430 Ottoman defter as a sanjak-bey of the Sanjak of Nicopolis. According to this view he was appointed to this position shortly after being chosen for the position of sanjak-bey of the Sanjak of Dibra. Halil İnalcık explained that for Skanderbeg, \\"this was a big promotion as Nikopol was one of the largest sanjaks of European Turkey\\". Strashimir Dimitrov dated this defter to 1479–80 and believed that the Iskander Bey mentioned in it was not Skanderbeg but some other person who was mirliva of Nicopolis. During the reign of Sultan Murad II the sanjak-bey was Mehmed Bey, a son of Firuz Bey. In March 1834 Husseyn Pasha was appointed as sanjak-bey of the Sanjak of Nicopolis and Sanjak of Vidin. == Economy == The Sanjak of Nicopolis was one of six Ottoman sanjaks with most developed shipbuilding (besides sanjaks of Smederevo, Vidin, Požega, Zvornik and Mohač). == References == Category:Sanjaks of the Ottoman Empire in Europe Category:Ottoman period in the history of Bulgaria Category:1396 establishments in the Ottoman Empire Category:1878 disestablishments in the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Sanjak of Nicopolis"},{"id":"42080019","text":"Peter James Ballard (born 10 March 1955) was Archdeacon of Lancaster from 2006 to 2010.‘BALLARD, Ven.

In 2015, during the winter transfer window, Canka left Apolonia after only half season to rejoin Lushnja until the end of 2014–15 season.

This military budget finances employee salaries and training costs, the maintenance of equipment and facilities, support of new or ongoing operations, and development and procurement of new weapons, equipment, and vehicles. In 2014, Russia's military budget of 2.49 trillion rubles (worth approximately US$69.3 billion at 2014 exchange rates) was higher than any other European nation, and approximately 1/7th (14%) of the US military budget. However, a collapse in the value of the Rouble greatly reduced the dollar-value of the planned 2015 Russian military budget to US$52 billion, despite a 33% increase in its Rouble-value to 3.3 trillion. Due to the ongoing crisis the planned 33% increase had to be reduced to 25.6%, meaning the 2015 Russian military budget totalled 3.1 trillion rubles. The originally planned 3.36 trillion budget for 2016 has also been reduced to a planned budget of 3.145 trillion rubles, an increase of only 0.8% over 2015. ==Unofficial estimates== Unofficial estimates typically place the total amount of military spending for the Russian Federation higher than the Russian government figures, but these calculations tend to differ between organizations. According to the IISS \\"By simple observation..[the military budget] would appear to be lower than is suggested by the size of the armed forces or the structure of the military–industrial complex, and thus neither of the figures is particularly useful for comparative analysis\\".International Institute for Strategic Studies, The Military Balance 2006, Routledge, p.153 IHS Inc. estimated the 2013 Russian military budget as being US$68.9 billion, US$78 billion in 2014, and predict a rise to US$98 billion in 2016. IHS described this as a rapid increase in spending which will result in the defence budget increasing from 15.7 percent of federal expenditure in 2013 to 20.6 percent by 2016. The International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) estimated the 2013 Russian military budget at US$68.2 billion, a 31% rise since 2008. IISS noted in their 2013 report that this meant that Russia had passed the UK and Saudi Arabia to become the world's third largest military spender, though exchange rates had also been a factor in this. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) 2017 Military Expenditure Database estimated Russia's military expenditure in 2016 at US$69.2 billion. This estimate is roughly twice that of SIPRI's estimate of the Russian military budget for 2006 (US$34.5 billion). ==History== In 1988 military spending was a single line item in the Soviet state budget, totaling 21 billion rubles (68.8 billion 1988 U.S. dollars). Given the size of the military establishment, however, the actual figure was considered to be far higher. However, in the wake of the breakup of the Soviet Union and the emergence of Russian Federation as an independent state, between 1991 and 1997 Russia's defence spending fell by a factor of eight in real prices. Between 1988 and 1993 weapons production in Russia fell by at least 50% for virtually every major weapons system. In 1998, when Russian Federation experienced a severe financial crisis, its military expenditure in real terms reached its lowest point— barely one-quarter of the USSR's in 1991, and two-fifths of the level of 1992, the first year of Russia's independent existence. However, since the rise to power of Vladimir Putin and the exposure of the poor state of preparedness amongst Russia's armed forces in the Chechen Wars, Russian military spending has rapidly increased, particularly after the 2008 Russian military reform. According to SIPRI, Russian military spending in real terms in 2012 was the highest it has been since Russian Federation's re-emergence as an independent nation, but is still far lower than the estimated military expenditure of the USSR in 1990 - its final full year of existence (US$291 billion at 2012 prices). The budget expanded from 1998 until 2015, but economic problems including a sharp decline in the oil price mean it will be cut by 5.3% in 2016 despite analysts saying that large increases are required to fund the current equipment plans and accommodate high rates of inflation; the navy may be the most likely victim of cuts. ==Comparison with other countries== A pie chart showing global military expenditures by country for 2018, in US$ billions, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

From 2000 to 2003, he served as head coach for the AHL's Hamilton Bulldogs, the top minor league affiliate of the NHL's Montreal Canadiens. In 2000, Julien won a bronze medal as the head coach of Canadian junior team. He also served as an assistant coach to Marc Habscheid at the 2006 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships. ===NHL coaching career=== Montreal Canadiens and New Jersey Devils On January 17, 2003, Julien became head coach of the Montreal Canadiens. In 2003–04, his first full season as an NHL head coach, he led Montreal to a 93-point performance (41–30–7–4 record) and the second round of the 2004 Stanley Cup playoffs. He was eventually fired and replaced by General Manager Bob Gainey on January 14, 2006. Julien accumulated a record of 72–62–10–15 during his three seasons with the Canadiens.Claude Julien's Coaching Record at hockey-reference Julien was then announced as the head coach of the New Jersey Devils on June 13, 2006, becoming the 15th head coach in Devils history. On October 6, 2006, he won his first game as Devils head coach with a 4–0 win against the defending Stanley Cup champions, the Carolina Hurricanes. On November 4, Julien won in his first return to Montreal as the Devils defeated the Canadiens, 2–1. On April 2, 2007, Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello abruptly fired Julien with three games to go in the season. This was despite the Devils having a 47–24–8 record, which at the time was leading the Atlantic Division and tied for the second-best record in the Eastern Conference. They were also on their way to setting a franchise record for wins in a season. Lamoriello said that despite the team's stellar record, he did not feel Julien had it ready for the 2007 playoffs.http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2822234 Lamoriello named himself interim head coach for the rest of the season, the second straight season in which Lamoriello left the front office to coach the Devils at the end of the season. Despite the change, the Devils went on to lose in the Eastern Conference Semifinal to the Ottawa Senators. Boston Bruins On June 22, 2007, it was confirmed by various sports websites that Julien had been named as the 28th head coach of the Boston Bruins. In his first season as Boston coach, he led the team back to the playoffs. His team struggled with consistency over the course of the season, but this was in large part due to the many injuries that plagued the Bruins throughout the 2007–08 season. Most notably, forward Patrice Bergeron and goaltender Manny Fernandez missed almost the entire season. The Bruins were defeated in the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals by his former team, Montreal, who were coached by Guy Carbonneau, Julien's permanent replacement as head coach, in seven games. On February 17, 2009, Julien coached his 200th win as an NHL head coach, a 5–1 Bruins road game victory over the Carolina Hurricanes. On June 18, 2009, at the end of the 2008–09 season, he was awarded the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year. In the 2010 playoffs, the Bruins became only the fourth NHL team to lose a best-of-seven series after being up three games to none when they were eliminated by the Philadelphia Flyers (the other two teams were the 1942 Detroit Red Wings and the 1975 Pittsburgh Penguins). Boston held a 3–0 lead in game seven, but the Flyers tied and eventually won the game, 4–3. Injuries to star Bruins forwards David Krejčí (broken wrist), Marco Sturm (torn ACL) and Marc Savard (concussion), as well as defenceman Dennis Seidenberg (wrist) and an undisclosed injury to former Vezina-winning goaltender Tim Thomas (hip), were factors in the defeat. The 2010–11 season saw Julien coach the Bruins to the third-seed in the playoffs and a first round matchup against the rival Montreal Canadiens. After dropping the first two games at home, Julien made some lineup adjustments, and helped his team come back to win the series in seven games. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bruins got a chance to redeem themselves from the previous year in a much anticipated series against the Philadelphia Flyers. After winning Game 1, 7–3, they went on to sweep the Flyers out of the playoffs in four games. In the Conference Finals, the Bruins faced off against the Tampa Bay Lightning for their first chance at a Stanley Cup since 1990. The Bruins came out victorious in their second seven-game series of the playoffs, including wins of 6–5, 2–1 and a penalty-less 1–0 win in Game 7. The team's victory set up a Stanley Cup Final against the number one seed Vancouver Canucks, who possessed the best statistics in offence, defence, goaltending, power play and special teams in the NHL. After a hard- fought Game 1, the Canucks scored the first goal of the game with just 18.5 seconds remaining in the third period, taking the series opener, 1–0. The Bruins, looking to rebound in Game 2, skated to a tie with Vancouver after regulation before a costly mistake by Boston captain Zdeno Chára after just 11 seconds of overtime allowed the Canucks to score the game-winning goal to take a 2–0 series lead. Back in Boston, after a rough first period in which the Bruins lost Nathan Horton to an illegal, concussive hit by Vancouver defenceman Aaron Rome, Boston exploded for four goals in the second period and four more in the third to complete an 8–1 blowout victory. The Bruins followed up that big win with another decisive victory, this time romping 4–0 over the Canucks while chasing goaltender Roberto Luongo, who had surrendered 12 goals in five periods during the two games in Boston. On June 15, 2011, the Bruins won their sixth Stanley Cup championship with a 4–0 victory in Game 7 in Vancouver. Entering the 2011 playoffs, Julien's career playoff record in Game 7s was 1–3, with the three losses all coming during his tenure as Boston coach, against Montreal in 2008, Carolina in 2009 and Philadelphia in 2010. His one Game 7 victory came in 2004 as Montreal's coach, ironically against Boston. With the 2011 playoff game seven wins against Montreal, Tampa Bay and Vancouver, he thus improved his record to 4–3. Additionally in the 2011 playoffs, Julien (now with 33 wins) passed Don Cherry (31 wins) for the most playoff wins by a Boston Bruins coach. During the 2011–12 regular season, Julien reached multiple personal coaching milestones. On December 17, 2011, he collected his 200th regular season win as Boston's coach in a 6–0 whitewash defeat of the Eastern Conference-leading Philadelphia Flyers. The win completed a Bruin 41-day journey from the absolute bottom of the Eastern Conference to tied for first place. On January 29, 2012, Julien (and his Bruin bench staff) coached Team Chara to a 12–9 win over Team Alfredsson in the 2012 NHL All-Star Game in Ottawa, Ontario. It was his second appearance and second win as an All-Star Game coach, having also appeared in the 2009 Game. On March 19, 2012, he coached his 400th game behind the Bruin bench, an 8–0 win over the Toronto Maple Leafs. The win completed a perfect 6–0 sweep of the season series with the Maple Leafs. The 2012 postseason, however, would not be as memorable for Julien's defending Cup champion Bruins, as they fell in the first round to the Washington Capitals and their upstart rookie goaltender Braden Holtby in seven games. The series was the closest, most evenly fought series in NHL history, with all seven games (including four overtime games) being one-goal decisions. After the defeat, Julien's playoff Game 7 record fell to 4–4. Despite the early exit for Boston in the playoffs, the Bruins signed Julien to a new, multi-year contract extension. In the lockout- shortened 2012–13 season, Julien led his team to their second Stanley Cup Finals in three years. In the first round, they defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in seven games, where in the deciding Game 7, they came back from a 1–4 deficit to win 5–4 in overtime, the first time in NHL playoff history in which a team trailing by three goals in the third period went on to win Game 7 to take the series. The Bruins then eliminated the New York Rangers in five games. Matched up against the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Eastern Conference Finals, who were the regular season Conference champions, the Bruins swept them in four games, which included two shutouts of the normally high-scoring Penguins. In the Cup Finals, however, the Bruins lost to the first place Chicago Blackhawks in six games after failing to hold on to third period leads in their Game 1 and Game 6 losses. In the 2013–14 regular season, the first under the League's new conference and division realignment, Julien's team won the Presidents' Trophy for the best regular season record in the NHL. In the 2014–15 regular season, the Bruins failed to make the playoffs for the first time since Julien took over the role as Bruins head coach. On June 5, 2015, Don Sweeney, the Bruins' new general manager, confirmed that Julien and his staff would be staying on for the upcoming 2015–16 NHL regular season. During a six-game roadtrip for the Bruins as part of the team's 2015–16 season, on February 13, 2016, Julien was surprised to learn, after his Bruins team defeated the Minnesota Wild in a 4–2 road victory, that he had coached his 500th NHL winning game. Another achievement for Julien's career in coaching the Bruins would be earned less than a month later; as the result of Julien's coaching the Bruins to a 4–2 home ice win against the 2015 Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks on March 3, 2016, Julien's winning game total as the Bruins' head coach rose to 387 wins for the Boston team, equalling the most won Bruins games coached total of Hall of Fame member Art Ross' career as coach of the Bruins from their beginnings in 1924, through four separated periods of coaching ending in 1939. Only four days later, on March 7, with a Bruins' 5–4 overtime road victory over the Florida Panthers, Julien's win record with the Bruins reached 388, surpassing Art Ross' career total with the team. On February 7, 2017, Julien was relieved of his coaching duties after leading the team with a 26–23–6 record. Return to Montreal On February 14, 2017, Julien was named the head coach of the Montreal Canadiens after Michel Therrien was relieved of his head coaching duties. This marks the second time in Canadiens franchise history Julien replaced Therrien, the first time being during the 2002–03 regular season. On November 30, 2017, Julien won his 100th game as the Canadiens' coach with a 6–3 win against the Detroit Red Wings. On August 12, 2020, following a loss to the Philadelphia Flyers in the Eastern Conference First Round, Julien experienced chest pains and was transferred to the hospital. Canadiens general manager Marc Bergevin stated that his chest pains had nothing to do with COVID-19. Kirk Muller, the associate head coach of the Canadiens, assumed the role of head coach for the rest of the first round of playoffs. On August 14, the Canadiens announced that Julien had a stent placed in one of his coronary arteries on August 13. It was also announced that he would be returning home to Montreal to rest, and the chances of him being able to rejoin the team before the end of the first round were described by Bergevin as \\"very minimal\\". ==Personal life== Julien and his wife Karen have one daughter. The family resides in Dorval, Quebec. They previously resided in Red Bank, New Jersey and Lexington, Massachusetts. Julien was raised in the suburb of Orléans, in Ottawa. He is bilingual, speaking both French and English fluently. ==Head coaching record== {  style=\\"font-size:95%; text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Team !! rowspan=\\"2\\"Year !! colspan=\\"7\\"Regular season !! colspan=\\"4\\"Postseason - !

The fauna of Louisiana is characterized by the region's low swamplands, bayous, creeks, woodlands, coastal marshlands and beaches, and barrier islands covering an estimated , corresponding to 40 percent of Louisiana's total land area. Southern Louisiana contains up to fifty percent of the wetlands found in the Continental United States, and are made up of countless bayous and creeks. The Creole State has a humid subtropical climate, perhaps the best example of a humid subtropical climate of all the Southern United States with long, humid and hot summers and short, mild winters. The subtropical characteristics of the state are due in large part to the influence of the Gulf of Mexico, which at its farthest point is no more than away. Louisiana's varied habitats — tidal marshes, bayous, swamps, woodlands, islands, forests, and prairies — offer a diversity of wildlife. Some of the most common animals found throughout all of the parishes include otter, deer, mink, muskrat, raccoons, opossums, rabbits, squirrels, nutria, turtles, alligators, woodcocks, skunks, foxes, beavers, civet cats, armadillos, coyotes and bobcats. Deer, squirrel, rabbit, and bear are hunted as game, while muskrat, snakes, nutria, mink, opossum, bobcat, and skunk are commercially significant for fur. Prized game birds include quail, turkey, woodcock, and various waterfowl, of which the mottled duck and wood duck are native. There are several endemic plants and animals in Louisiana that are found nowhere else on Earth; an example could be the Louisiana bluestar or the white leucistic alligator.http://www.auduboninstitute.org/animals/louisiana-swamp- gallery/spots-white-alligator-3033 The Pearl River map turtle and the ringed map turtle are only found in Louisiana and neighboring State of Mississippi. Louisiana contains a number of areas which are, in varying degrees, protected from human intervention. In addition to National Park Service sites and areas and the Kisatchie National Forest, Louisiana operates a system of state parks, state historic sites, one state preservation area, one state forest, and many Wildlife Management Areas. The Nature Conservancy also owns and manages a set of natural areas. == State ecology == An aerial view of the Atchafalaya Swamp, the largest swamp in the U.S.http://lacoast.gov/new/About/Basins.aspx Much of the state's lands were formed from sediment washed down the Mississippi River, leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of coastal marsh and swamp. The northern parts of Louisiana mostly consist of woodlands which are home to deer, squirrels, rabbits, bears, muskrats, mink, opossums, bobcats, and skunks. Louisiana's forests offer a mix of oak, pine, beech, black walnut, and cypress trees. In the Piney Woods in the Ark-La-Tex-region, mammals such as the North American cougar, gray fox, feral hogs (razorback), and snakes such as the western cottonmouth, the western worm snake, the Louisiana pine snake, as well as other animals are common.http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/publication/32954-feral- hogs/feral_hogs.pdf Louisiana's largest forest, the Kisatchie National Forest in the forested hills of Central Louisiana, has 155 species of breeding birds, 48 mammal species, 56 reptile species and 30 amphibian species. It is some in area, more than half of which is vital flatwoods vegetation, which supports many rare plant and animal species. These include for instance the Louisiana pine snake, the red-cockaded woodpecker, the Louisiana black bear and the Louisiana pearlshell.United States Department of Agriculture. 1999. Final Environmental Impact Statement. Revised Land and Resource Management Plan. Kisatchie National Forest. Forest Service, Southern Region, Pineville, LA. Alligators are common in Louisiana's extensive swamps, bogs, creeks, lakes, rivers, wetlands, and bayous. Other water-loving reptiles such as the alligator snapping turtle live in the Louisiana swamps. The alligator snapping turtle is characterized by a very large head and three rows of spiked scutes. These wetlands of Louisiana make ideal homes for several species of turtles, crawfish and catfish - all of which are popular Acadian foods. Jambalaya, a Louisiana Creole dish that originated among the Cajuns in Acadiana, is made entirely by all sorts of meat found in the swampland of southern Louisiana: crawfish, herons, shellfish, catfish, toads, frogs, shrimp, oysters, alligator, duck, turtle, boar, venison, and myriad other species. Among invasive species that thrive in the wetlands of Louisiana is the nutria, a South American rodent that was likely introduced when individual animals escaped from fur farms. == Mammals == The Louisiana black bear was designated the Official State Animal in 1992.http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/Louisiana/mammal_black_bear.html Forty species of mammals reside in Louisiana, excluding marine mammals. Seventy mammal species have been recorded in Louisiana or its immediate adjacent waters.http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/document/33610-taxonomic- groups/taxonomic_groups.pdf Louisiana has, for instance, two species of squirrels: gray squirrels and fox squirrels, according to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/hunting/small-game/program Louisiana has two species of rabbits: eastern cottontails and swamp rabbits. Although the cottontail is considered more of an upland species and the swamp rabbit a wetland species, both species occur throughout the state. Rabbits have high productive rates in Louisiana when habitat and weather conditions are good. === Louisiana black bear === The Louisiana black bear (Ursus americanus luteolus) is one of sixteen currently recognized subspecies of American black bear.http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/publications/pwdpubs/media/pwd_bk_w7000_0013_louisiana_black_bear.pdf The Louisiana black bear once ranged throughout the State of Louisiana and parts of adjacent neighboring Mississippi, Arkansas, and Texas. The black bear was common at the time of early colonization, serving as food for Native Americans for generations. An 1890 record shows 17 parishes containing bears, all of them by the Mississippi-border and the Atchafalaya region. It was reported that the most extensive areas of bottomland hardwoods in the state have \\"at least a few bears\\", with the greatest number found in the denser woodlands along the Tensas, Red, Black, and Atchafalaya Rivers. In the late 1950s, bears occupied habitat in the Tensas-Madison area in northeast Louisiana and in the lower fringes of the Atchafalaya Basin. Today, black bears can be found in all of Louisiana, but according to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, most black bears are observed in a confined region made up of the following parishes: West- and East Carroll, Richland, Franklin, Madison, Tensas, Catahoula, Concordia, Avoyelles, Pointe Coupee, St. Landry, Vermilion, Iberia, as well as both St. Martin and St. Mary.http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/document/37270-bear- snare/bear_snare2.pdf Black bear could be legally hunted in parts of Louisiana through the late 1980s. One of the last organized bear hunts in Louisiana occurred December 15, 1955. During this hunt, five bears were harvested in the Lake Providence area. It was recommended to the Wildlife Commission that the bear season be closed. Bear hunting was closed the following season and remained closed until 1961. The season was opened again from 1962-1965 with hunting permitted only in northeast Louisiana and in the coastal parishes. The hunting season was again closed from 1966 to 1974. It was reopened in 1975-1987 with hunting restricted to the Atchafalaya Basin.http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/page/36211-black- bear-history/bear-conservationistart19540001.pdf The Louisiana bear hunting season has remained closed since 1988. From 1964 through 1967, 161 black bears were live-trapped in Cook County, Minnesota and released in the Mississippi and Atchafalaya River bottoms of Louisiana in an effort to restock black bear to the state. By 1968 there was evidence that the translocated bears were reproducing. However, most of the relocated bears were killed on roads, as nuisance animals, or during recapture.http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/page/36211-black- bear-history/bear-conservationistart19540001.pdf As of 2016, Louisiana black bears are no longer endangered.http://theadvocate.com/news/15080421-37/report- iconic-louisiana-black-bear-teddy-bear-removed-from-endangered-species-list == Reptiles == Wild leucistic alligators are only found in Louisiana.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/wildlife/4639072/White-alligator- is-one-of-rarest-in-world.html The American alligator is the official state reptile of Louisiana. Perhaps the most iconic of Louisiana wetlands' animals, the American alligator has bounced back from near extinction to being relatively commonplace. An abundance of snake species make their home in Louisiana, including the eastern diamondback rattlesnake, Texas coral snake, eastern yellowbelly racer, mud snake, western pigmy rattlesnake, northern scarlet snake, rainbow snake, buttermilk racer, tan racer, western cottonmouth, red cornsnake, pit vipers and kingsnake. America's largest freshwater turtle, the alligator snapping turtle, shares the habitat with its cousin, the common snapping turtle. The green American chameleon also lives in the wetlands, along with the lizard-like tiger salamander, which is an amphibian. Other examples of reptiles in Louisiana are the gopher tortoise, razor-backed musk turtle, broad-headed skink, coal skink and the slender glass lizard. According to the Louisiana Alligator Council, there are over one million alligators in the state in 2014 and the number is continuously increasing. Alligators like swamps, rivers, lakes or wherever they can have an adequate habitat. Louisiana has several varieties of venomous snakes. The eastern coral snake, Texas coral snake, copperhead, western cottonmouth, western pygmy rattlesnake, and the eastern diamondback rattlesnake and canebrake rattlesnake can all be found in Louisiana. The largest reported American alligator was a male killed in 1890 on Marsh Island in Louisiana, and reportedly measured at .Wood, Gerald (1983). The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats. ==Birds== The brown pelican is the official state bird of Louisiana. Approximately 160 species of birds are year-round residents or probable confirmed breeders in Louisiana and another 244 are known to regularly migrate through or winter in the state or its immediate adjacent waters.http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/document/33610-taxonomic- groups/taxonomic_groups.pdf There are 69 species on the CWCS species of conservation concern list of which 42 species are considered critically threatened, imperiled or rare, according to the Louisiana Natural Heritage Program. Shorebirds and songbirds constitute the majority of species. In 1902, the eastern brown pelican was made a part of the Seal of Louisiana and, ten years later, in 1912, the pelican and her young adorned the flag of Louisiana as well. The official nickname of Louisiana is the Pelican State. In 1958, the pelican was made the official state bird of Louisiana. This act was amended on July 26, 1966 to specifically designate the brown pelican, the National Basketball Association's New Orleans Pelicans are named in honor of Louisiana's state bird. The eastern brown pelican is also the national bird of Barbados and the Turks and Caicos Islands, it is also one of the mascots of Tulane University and is on the seals of Tulane University, Louisiana State University and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Shore birds are abundant in Louisiana and the most common is the great white egret. This large, all-white heron has an impressive wingspan and stature. The egret occurs often in the wetlands of Louisiana and coastal areas that provides it with plenty of fish, amphibians and small mammals to feast on. This bird is also the official symbol of the National Audubon Society. The American bald eagle nests in southeastern coastal parishes and, occasionally on large lakes in northern and central parishes, but these nests are less successful. Some of America's tallest birds, such as the great blue heron and great egret, cannot resist the fishing opportunities that exist in the Louisiana swampland. Raptors such as the osprey, American black vulture and barred owl live in the marshes of southern Louisiana. Migratory waterfowl and songbirds often make stopovers or actually spend the winter in these wetlands. == Amphibians == The American green tree frog is the official state amphibian and lives in every parish in the state. The American green tree frog was designated the official state amphibian of Louisiana in 1993.http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/Louisiana/greentreefrog.html Examples of other amphibians in Louisiana are salamanders such as the eastern tiger salamander, southern red-backed salamander, Gulf Coast waterdog, dwarf salamander and the three-toed amphiuma. There are also toads such as Hurter's spadefoot toad and southern toad, as well as frogs such as pig frog, striped chorus frog and the bronze frog. American bullfrogs are the largest frogs native to Louisiana. == Fish == The white perch, sometimes called sac au lait from Cajun French, was designated the official state fish of Louisiana in 1993.http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/Louisiana/fish_white_perch.html Coastal beaches are inhabited by sea turtles. Freshwater fish include bass, crappie, and bream. Red and white crawfishes are the leading commercial crustaceans. Many sharks have been observed in Louisiana waters; including, but not limited to lemon sharks, tiger sharks, bull sharks and blacktip sharks. The sharks, for instance the bull shark, have often been observed throughout the Atchafalaya Basin, 900 miles up the Mississippi River, and in inland bayous and wetlands.http://www.wafb.com/story/10635603/bull-sharks-take-to-louisiana- swamp The alligator gar and the frecklebelly madtom, which is native to Pearl River in Southeastern Louisiana, are two additional species of fish in Louisiana. The bowfin, known by many other names such as the mudfish, dogfish, grinnel, grindel, jack, jackfish, cypress trout, cotton fish, and in South Louisiana; choupique (pronounced shoe-pick or shoe-peg), choupique= shoe pick or shoe-peg: How We Talk: American Regional English Today (by Allan A.

Threatened animal species include five species of sea turtles: green, hawksbill, Kemp's ridley, leatherback, and loggerhead). Twenty-three Louisiana animal species were on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's threatened and endangered species list for 2003. Among those listed are the Louisiana black bear, American bald eagle, inflated heelsplitter, and red-cockaded woodpecker. The Louisiana WAP identifies 240 species of concern. The mountain lion population in Louisiana is small but growing in recent times. There is a relatively small and threatened population of Louisiana black bears. The historic range of the Florida panther extended from Florida to Louisiana throughout the Gulf Coast states and Arkansas. Today, the only place with wild Florida panthers is the southwestern tip of Florida. The Florida panther is considered of historical occurrence in Louisiana. The historic range included as far west as Western Louisiana and the East Lower Mississippi River Valley through the southeastern states. Even though numerous sighting reports continue to surface annually throughout its historic range, it is unlikely that viable populations of the Florida panther presently occur outside of the State of Florida. The Louisiana black bear has been taken off the endangered species list. Mississippi diamondback terrapin is recognized as a \\"species of concern\\" in Louisiana, but is found on the Mississippi border. == Invasive species == The coypu, also known as nutria http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/14085/0 or river rat, is an invasive species. Its destructive feeding and burrowing behaviors make this invasive rodent a pest throughout Louisiana. Native to South America, Quaker parrots are considered an invasive species and are known to damage fruit crops. These parrots have nested in the New Orleans metropolitan area since the 1960s. === Coypu === Tabasco tycoon and naturalist Edward McIlhenny brought thirteen adult coypu from Argentina to his home in New Iberia, during the 1930s, for the fur farming industry.nutria.com- Retrieved 2017-03-29 Two years later, one hundred and fifty got out of the pen, supposedly escaping during a storm. The nutria reproduced at a high rate, increasing by the thousands every year. By the 1960s the number ranged to as high as twenty million, and increasing. By the time the government instituted a control program, the coypu was destroying Louisiana marshes and wetlands, causing widespread erosion. In the 21st century, the coypu is one of the most common and despised pests in the Bayou State.Tulane: The Louisiana Environment: Nutria, Exotic Species in Louisiana- Retrieved 2017-03-29 The story of the nutria is not unique. Many species of birds, mammals, fish, and plants have been introduced into the Louisiana environment in the past two centuries. Exotic species, or species that have been introduced to areas outside their native range, take heavy tolls on the ecosystems they colonize. Some invaders, such as the leafy vine kudzu (Pueria lobelia), destroy the habitat for resident wildlife. Other species fiercely compete with native plants and animals for resources. By some estimates, exotic species pose the second most serious threat to endangered species after habitat loss. Nutria were introduced into coastal marshes from Latin America in the mid-1900s, and their population has since exploded into the millions. They cause serious damage to coastal marshes and may dig burrows in levees. Hence, Louisiana has had a bounty to try to reduce nutria numbers. Large alligators feed heavily on nutria, so alligators may not only control nutria populations in Louisiana, but also prevent them spreading east into Florida and possibly the Everglades. Since hunting and trapping preferentially take the large alligators that are the most important in eating nutria, some changes in harvesting may be needed to capitalize on their ability to control nutria. ===Monk parakeet=== An agricultural pest in its native South American range, the monk parakeet was first brought to the U.S. as a cage bird. They were so popular that over 60,000 were imported between 1969 and 1972. By the 1980s it had already been released in many parts of the country and had established small breeding colonies. Twenty years later, monk parakeet numbers have increased exponentially but their distribution remains spotty. Monk parakeets tend to be restricted to urban areas where they feed and nest in ornamental palm trees, occupying a niche that no indigenous bird holds. So far, their distribution in Louisiana has been limited almost exclusively to the City of New Orleans, where they have had no adverse effects on local wildlife. If their numbers increase, however, monk parakeets could pose a serious threat to agricultural areas, possibly becoming as much of a pest here as they already are in their native range. === Red fire ant === Native to South America, the red fire ant has flourished in many southern U.S. states since its introduction in the 1930s. Superficially similar to most other ants, the fire ant is a vicious predator, attacking birds, rodents, and larger mammals in swarms. One study of white-tailed deer found that death rates for young deer were twice as high in areas with fire ants as in uninfested areas. In Louisiana, the spread of fire ants has been linked to the decline of the loggerhead shrike and some species of warblers. The red fire ant has replaced nearly half the native insect species in some areas it has colonized. == See also == * Fauna of the United States == References == F01 .L ","title":"Fauna of Louisiana"},{"id":"42080194","text":"Ilaria Debertolis (born 17 September 1989 in Feltre) is an Italian cross- country skier.

Bell and others have argued that the use of \\"sexy baby voice\\" demeans the speaker, who appears as a \\"submissive 12-year-old trying to be a sex object\\", or that its use in film and television exploits contemporary culture's \\"fetish for adult sexuality wrapped in adolescent packages\\". Others questioned the purpose of critiquing the speech pattern, asserting that \\"picking at the vocal quirks of your own gender is just as much of a nuisance as harping on the bodies that belong to them\\".

UN Resolution on Territorial integrity of Ukraine  On March 27, 2014, at the UN General Assembly, Deshchytsia presented the resolution on \\"Territorial integrity of Ukraine\\", which was supported by 100 United Nations member states, affirming the United Nations commitment to recognize Crimea within Ukraine's international borders and to condemn Crimea's annexation by Russia as illegal.  Geneva Statement on Ukraine  U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry with Deshchytsia in Geneva, Switzerland, on April 17, 2014 On 17 April 2014, Deshchytsia negotiated with John Kerry, Catherine Ashton and Sergei Lavrov at a quadrilateral meeting in Geneva in an attempt to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Ukraine. The resulting Geneva Statement on Ukraine laid ground for de-escalating the crisis. However, Russia has repeatedly breached its commitments under the Geneva agreement, according to official statements of the leaders of the EU and the United States. One week after the joint Geneva Statement, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry accused Russia of failing to adhere to Geneva commitments by orchestrating armed resistance in eastern Ukraine.http://www.voanews.com/content/kerry-accuses-russia-of-ignoring- geneva-agreement-on-ukraine/1900859.html U.S. President Barack Obama stated that Vladimir Putin has 'not lifted a finger' to ease tensions.https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/obama-vladimir-putin-lifted-finger- ease-tensions-23487958 President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy acknowledged that Russia has not lived up to its Geneva commitments.http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/142565.pdf  Advocating sanctions against Russia  In May 2014, Deshchytsia said: \\"The West should impose more severe sanctions that hit specific economic sectors such as banking and target Russian decision makers.

Incident near the Russian Embassy  On June 14, 2014, protesters had swarmed on the Russian embassy - overturning the embassy car and throwing paint and egg missiles — after pro-Russian combatants shot down a Ukrainian plane, killing 49 on board. Deshchytsia had descended on the protest in the hope that he could quell the escalating trouble, pleading with the demonstrators not to attack the building despite also understanding their concerns. \\"Did I say that I am against you protesting? I am for you protesting. I am ready to be here with you and say 'Russia, get out of Ukraine',\\" he told the baying crowd. \\"Yes, Putin is a huylo, yes,\\" he said. However, Geoffrey Pyatt, the US ambassador to Ukraine, wrote on Twitter that the minister had been \\"seeking to defuse a dangerous situation\\", adding that Deshchytsia is \\"a skilled diplomat and credit to Ukraine\\".

The following day, the people involved, which included friends, family, relatives, and women in the house would continue the preparations of various dishes such as cleaning the wheat for the \\"qyshkek\\" (boiled grain in sugar), which marked the beginning of the wedding. Women and girls from the village would aid in laying the dining tables in the courtyard and would begin cleaning the wheat on them early in the mornings for three continuous days. During these days, celebrations would begin; the females would take up tambourines or baking pans, along with singing and dancing, while the wheat was being cleaned up grain by grain. On the wedding day, people would come to congratulate the family early in the morning, whereas in the evening, only those who were invited to the wedding would show up. The guests would bring presents with them for the couple; usually the women would bring pies, and the men, two kilograms of sugar. Among the men, various songs were sung with the cifteli and lute (traditional Albanian instruments) while comedic acts were played on one another. Among the women, two tambourine players would sing rhythmical songs to which women would dance. Once the dinner that would have been prepared by a cook would have been served and eaten, the guests would be sent to sleep. On the wedding day, the guests would be served an early lunch so they would be ready in time to take the bride from her house. The first to make their way to the wedding would be the women and the dowry cart and the men would set off half an hour later. Upon their journey to and from the bride's house and back to the groom's house, the guests would throw cigarettes to the people they would meet in a sign of respect. The guests would arrive in pairs, coming from opposite directions; however, the earlier custom was for one side to stop and unbridle the horses first to leave space for the other side to pass who would be all led by the banner-holder. The individual who would hold the banner was usually from the groom's side of close relatives. While the bride would leave her village, she would keep her face down in a sign of pain that she was leaving her birth village. As the bride and her guests would approach the wedding house (groom's house), the groom's side would await them with tambourines. The first to enter the courtyard would be the bride's car, which would stop there for her to come out, followed by the dowry car and other guests at the end. While this would happen, an elderly man would throw corn and grains mixed with beans, coins, and sugar squares upon the bride's car and guests. This ritual would be performed so that the bride would enter the courtyard with \\"abundance\\". The man of the house would grab the bride by her shoulder, take her off the carriage and take her to the standing place. The bride would have to step with the right foot first and walk on wheat grain, metal things and coins which belonged to the man of the house and which had all been laid down prior to her coming. The groom would stand facing the bride while they attempted to look at each other. However, prior to the bride's entrance, her fingers would be dipped in honey and sorbet and, upon entering, she would wet the upper threshold of the door with her fingers so that she would have a pleasant life in her new house. After dinner, the women would select the best items from the dowry the bride had brought with her so that they would be worn for the groom. Finally, the groom would make his way into the bedroom, while the bride would stand and wait for him. Before entering the room, the groom would salute his parents and would be followed by youth who would award him with pats on his back. The next day, the bride had her head tied with a head wrap and was brought out to the courtyard while a boy led her to the well. The bride would get a bucket of water from the well with the boy and they would help each other wash their hands. After the wedding, the bride would become a part of the family and within the week, her father-in-law would take her and go to spend a night at her parents' house. After a month, the bride's family would take her to spend a week with them where she would bring them food consisting of two loaves of bread and pies; the same food would be brought back to the groom's house and the pie is shared with everyone on the street. Rexhep Maksutaj, Isniq Through Centuries, Shtepia Botuese Libri Shkollor, Prishtine, 2002, pg.92 ===Engagement=== A traditional wedding day at the brides home The engagement is an important act leading to the marriage life. Marriage among Albanians was always considered holy and consequently, the wish for a happy married life was enormous. From a very young age, lullabies encouraged children to get married and have a big wedding with a beautiful bride or a good husband. Engagements today happen when two young people know and love each other. When they decide to get engaged, the ceremony takes place according to tradition. In the past, the engagements were done at a very young age or they were arranged prior to birth; this was caused by poor education and patriarchal life. The age of partners had no importance and earlier association between the engaged was not even considered. The engagement took place through a mediator who often, having set the engagement, left with an award by the groom's family. From that day, the girl's family begins to take an interest on the groom and his family; both parts are interested on the relatives of the girl and the boy. If the father does not want to engage his daughter to that house, he argues that his daughter is still young or that she is not suitable for him, as the boy's family is richer or braver; but, in a way that does not lower the authority of the asker. If the girl's father decides to give his daughter to the asking family, he lets the family know that they must wait until the next day since daughters are only given in the morning. The mediator should have coffee and tobacco on him so during that night they will consume those goods as if sent from the boy. When the girl's hand is given, the mediator takes the \\"word\\" to the groom's house. In previous times, the custom was to fire a gun so that the relatives and the village will be notified that the person is locked in marital affairs with a significant other. The mediator also appointed the day of the feast. On that day a party is held for the guests and it lasts from dinner time until the next day's lunch. To the party are invited the man of the girl's house and their close relatives and as soon as they enter the room, the guest is served coffee and tobacco. The first to take the coffee will wait until the others have been given their coffees and then he congratulates them for the girl and friendship between the two parts. Dinner and lunch pass in a joyful mood and depending on the economic position of the groom's house, singers are also invited. From that day, the man of the house has to take care of the bride's dowry because from the time on, she had to be ensured a basis to be able to take care of clothing for her husband, children and husband's parents in the future. Since the man of the groom's house sends the entire dowry to the bride, he goes to the in-laws to set the date for the wedding. The girl's father understands the intention of his guests coming, but the boy's father asks him anyway, as a ritual, \\"Friend, where is our account?\\" If the girl's father is prepared then they will set the date of the wedding and in the meantime, the girl's father gives him a thread that is as longs as the girl's height as a symbol of confirmation.Rexhep Maksutaj, Isniq Through Centuries, Shtepia Botuese Libri Shkollor, Prishtine, 2002, p. 85 ===Death=== The death ceremony also had its own traditional features in the area. When someone dies, everyone gathers to the deceased house. First the closest relatives are notified and they decide who should be sent the news and they determine the time of funeral. The corpse is prepared by the closest of kin, and if it is a man that is done by men, and if a woman by the women. If the deceased died late in the day and his burial cannot take place on the same day, then he will be guarded by his relatives and family members of the same genre as he. The corpse is taken among the women and on the burial day the lamenting ladies, and in their absence sister, mother or some female close relative lament the dead by pointing out his virtue, good deeds, and the great pain felt by his loss. It is important to point out that until recently women did not take part on the burial ceremony, but they visited the deceased grave next day. After death in the men's guestroom are received those who came to express condolences and perform the burial. Condolences were accepted by those close to the family of the deceased(son, father, brother), uncle and some of his cousins. After the burial day 'seeing'(the wake) continued for some period, which has lately been reduced, lasting up to three months. Friends and well-wishers that came for condolences left an amount of money on the tray as help for the family. After the wake ceremony has been concluded and after the guests have been served coffee and cigarettes the host give them the word to speak their speeches. Those coming to express condolences usually have good words to say about the deceased, then they praise his family asking it to face up the pain.Rexhep Maksutaj, Isniq Through Centuries, Shtepia Botuese Libri Shkollor, Prishtine, 2002, p. 99 ==Besa== In the beginning Besa had a simple legal character but in time it evolved to a spiritual and moral institution of Albania. Application of besa began surely very early, sometimes at the beginnings of tribal organization of Albanians, and continues to exist even today in the form of a moral institution. Gjeçovi, speaking of besa, says that besa is securing an 'armistice' between two families in blood feud'.Kanun Besa is applied in particular in murder cases after which the family of the murderer was compelled to isolation. In order to be able to carry out the works, particularly in the field, the murderer's family asks for besa through a third family intermediator. According to the Code of Lekë Dukagjini the granted besa lasted for 30 days. However, by additional agreement, it could be extended. Besides a legal character among Albanians, besa has also attained a psychological and spiritual character. To Albanians, granting besa means that the aim for which it has been granted has been reached, and if dealing with a secret it means it will never be revealed. It occurred that once granted, besa, should never be violated even in cases when people risked their lives.Rexhep Maksutaj, Isniq Through Centuries, Shtepia Botuese Libri Shkollor, Prishtine, 2002, p.102 ==Folk clothes== Women and men's traditional Kosovian clothes Albanian traditional women's clothes Folk clothes represent an essential element and ethnic insignia of Albanian people. People of this country appreciate and value this traditional domain. Almost every ethnographic zone has various special characteristics of folk clothes. Folk clothes differ even within a zone' the nuances differ village by village. Folk costumes were worn in the late 1950s. Nowadays only the elders prefer these traditional clothes especially those of men. It is important to mention that in villages young women and older ones still wear these dresses. Young ladies' costumes are not very much different from those of the older women, but they are considerably more modest. The shirt and stockings are made of canvass. The shirt is a bit open and this opening is made by a knitting needle. The stockings reach to the knee and are circled at the end by \\"beads'. Apart from the shirt, the vest is worn, too, but it was only decorated based on one's economic standing. The young women wore a scarf without fringes on their heads. Earlier the young women wore a round-the waist skirt, but much simpler and smaller than that of older women.Rexhep Maksutaj, Isniq Through Centuries, Shtepia Botuese Libri Shkollor, Prishtine, 2002, p.111 Later the apron was worn which was done in a loom and was decorated with broidery made by knitting needle and was usually black. This apron was usually worn above the knee. The lasses wore stockings reaching to the knee and leather shoes. The latter were made of leather and laces, but later they were made of rubber, linen, string, and cotton threads. The young women did not use the same decoration as the older women.Rexhep Maksutaj, Isniq Through Centuries, Shtepia Botuese Libri Shkollor, Prishtine, 2002, p.110 Until late the men of the Deçan region wore white or dark (black) leggings (tirq) with braids and vests also we made by braids. The leggings frock was made of wool and knitted by the women in a loom. Later it was pressed on a fuller's mill. Women also made the braids in black threads. Tailors made the sewing of the leggings and vests. The leggings were sown with 2 to 12 stripes of braids and their upper and lower parts were covered in leather. Apart from leggings also a woolen overcoat was sown. The leggings were tied on the belly with a belt and a long and colorful stripe made by women in the loom.Rexhep Maksutaj, Isniq Through Centuries, Shtepia Botuese Libri Shkollor, Prishtine, 2002, p.112 ==Food== A traditional dish of Kosovian people A delicious food which is prepared for feasts A delicious recipe of an Albanian cuisine an Albanian recipe Kosovo Food and Drink Grilled meat dishes are popular and a good bet. Many dishes use freshwater fish. Vegetarian choices are limited. Specialities: • Flija (layered pie with yogurt filling). • Raznjici (skewered meat). • Hajvar (paprika paste). • Qebab (charcoal-grilled minced meat). • Sarma or japrak (vine or cabbage leaves stuffed with meat and rice). • Pliskavica (meat patties of beef and lamb). National drinks: • Kosovan wine, especially Velika Hocha. • Kafe Turke (Turkish coffee) • Rakija (spirit usually made from grapes). • Reçel (potent plum brandy). *Baklava is one of the traditional pastries of the Kosovar cuisine. Although of Turkish origin, baklava's preparation and recipe is a small heritage that is passed on generation to generation in Kosovo as well. There are a few different ways of making baklava, (varying from the way it is rolled) or what kind of nuts and fruits it contains. *A delicious way to spice up your lunch or dinner is to make an appetizer, and this traditional dip might be just the answer. With a very easy to follow recipe, \\"lëng me speca\\" (lit. dip with peppers) is a typical Kosovar appetizer. This spicy dip is served with bread (traditionally) *Byrek (also burekas, börek, burak, boereg, piroq, and other variants on the name). This a type of baked or fried filled pastry, popular in the Arab world, some countries around the Mediterranean Sea, the Slavic cuisines, throughout the Balkans and the former Ottoman Empire. They are made of a thin flaky dough known as phyllo dough (or yufka dough) and are filled with salty cheese (often feta), minced meat, potatoes or other vegetables. Burek may be prepared in a large pan and cut into portions after baking, or as individual pastries. The top of the Burek is often sprinkled with sesame seeds. *Llokuma are relatively easy to prepare, with ingredients you're likely to have to hand in your kitchen, but served to make a day feel special; for example a perfect Sunday breakfast served with the yoghurt and garlic dip they are also the perfect hangover cure. In traditional Kosovan weddings when the bridegroom's party of male friends (minus the groom) has set off to collect the bride from her home, superstition says that they must return a different way from the route they took to her house. On their journey, they stop off at a friend's who will serve them llokuma. Llokuma are also made when a baby is born. ==Games== Traditional games are very popular and an important part of our culture heritage maintained from generation to generation. With the intention of filling the leisure time of the age groups, both sexes have their preferred games. These games had no written rules, but still respected rules. We may divide these games now according to the age groups and the time when they were usually played. They may be divided in two children's games of the grown-ups. Children's games include games with lasse and lads.Rexhep Maksutaj, Isniq Through Centuries, Shtepia Botuese Libri Shkollor, Prishtine, 2002, pg.132 ===Stick game=== Shepherds in the mountains usually play this game. In the game, the participants are an undetermined number of players. They all sit at a straight line and throw at a cane by beating against the ground a thin bending branch. The one who throws closer to the cane follows the service. The player making the service extends his branch and player's line. The players will throw in the same way as when measuring where the branch touches the ground and the one that flies the furthest the server puts his branch. The game continues in this way until the branch of the server has been touched. The person serving is the one to bring back all the branches for a new throw. When the player cannot touch his branch, he gathers then and sits among the players. He puts all the branches over his head and by that he will choose the branch, which he aims to throw. If he touches one with any of the branches, its owner then will serve. But if he does not, he continues to serve as loser.Rexhep Maksutaj, Isniq Through Centuries, Shtepia Botuese Libri Shkollor, Prishtine, 2002, pg.134 ===Touch and run game=== It is a game usually played by girls but often boys were also involved. By counting the one that will pursue the game was appointed. Then he runs to touch someone else and leave him \\"ngile\\" (the touch). Players run away to avoid the touch.Rexhep Maksutaj, Isniq Through Centuries, Shtepia Botuese Libri Shkollor, Prishtine, 2002, pg.135 ===Hat game=== While the young and children played the above-mentioned games in both open nature and indoors, all age groups particularly by the elderly in men's room played the hat game. In the men's room a number of men gathered from the village or neighboring villages. First a team of three players each were formed and the host would bring in five pairs of socks and small metallic sphere. The teams were seated facing each other and lined up the sticks two rows with five each. Then one of the teams' leaders hides his hands behind and then stretches them forward offering the rival to select. If they find the sphere they will start the game first if not then the one who threw the bet will hide the sphere first. He holds the sphere into his fist and quickly puts his hand under each sock, leaving it unheeded less than one of them. If the opposition team notices it, they will catch it on its way and they will win ten points. But if the sphere is hidden without being noticed on its way, the rival has to search for it. The leader consults with his team members if they have a target or if they suspect any of the targets. Then he begins unraveling the socks. When he unravels the first, he says: \\"For you\\", meaning for his rival. If the sphere is under the particular sock, the rival will hide it again.Rexhep Maksutaj, Isniq Through Centuries, Shtepia Botuese Libri Shkollor, Prishtine, 2002, pg.138 ===Blind- eyed game=== It was the most widespread game among children regardless of sex. The one who would start the game was appointed by counting or by singing as follow: Elem, belem Belbasiqi Sara, piq, gramatiqi Hiq, piq, krasniq Qeto mere, qeta hiq (a game of words without a particular meaning). The one that was the last to be counted began the game by closing his/her eyes. Once his/her eyes were closed he/she counts to twenty. During that time everyone hides. Finally, the one that closed his/her eyes calls: \\"Ready or not, I open my eyes!\\" Then he/she begins searching for the hidden ones. The one found first, as agreed, will be the next to have his/her eyes closed. If all of them succeed in \\"spiting\\" him out, he/she will continue to close his/her eyes. ==Anniversary rites== Anniversary rites have a continuation in this region, since the ancient times. Within these rites, fall the summer days rites, Saint George rites, those of climbing Mountains, shearing, chumming, descends, harvest dinner, pastrami dinner, etc. Rexhep Maksutaj, Isniq Through Centuries, Shtepia Botuese Libri Shkollor, Prishtine, 2002, pg.105 ===Summer days=== Summer days are on 11th, 12th and 13 March and are featured by juniper burning. The children, several days before the spring day, bring juniper trees from Mountains, they gather them in the courtyard and on the night of 11th members gather around the fire and jump over the fire wishing that all the evil, bad things and summer fever get burned. Each family burns their junipers on their own courtyard. All family women and girls on this day do not do any work after dinner and for dinner smoked pastrami legs are prepared. ===Saint George=== Saint George's Day is celebrated on 6 May, but the celebration begins much earlier by cleaning and whitewashing the house. On Saint George's night children gather flowers and willow tree branches with leaves decorating the house and the courtyard. On that night flowers, leaves and nettles are laid on beds. On the Saint George day all wakes up early in the morning and women wash their children with water in which nettles, flowers, and grasses have been poured. Earlier also grass of furuncle was mixed to be given to cattle in order to not to get sick on summer. On the Saint George day women do not work either. Shepherds separate the lambs from the sheep on Saint George's day and the entire family eats milk pap.Rexhep Maksutaj, Isniq Through Centuries, Shtepia Botuese Libri Shkollor, Prishtine, 2002, pg.106 ===Climbing the mountains=== The Dukagjini region, including Deçan, are good cattle- raisers and pass their summer time in mountains with cattle. Climbing on the mountains is prepared weeks earlier in advance by purchasing necessary things. The transport is done on horse-back and donkeys. After preparation, two or three shepherds come together and with their loads take up road to the mountain. Days before, cattle are colored in red and bells are put on their necks. When the flock gets going, the courtyard gates open wide and axes are thrown. Loom items, a hand of nettles, a big needle, are among the items which are loaded along. In order to have a journey without a spell of an evil eye, the woman of the house sends the flock off by looking at it from a bread soave so that damage would not befall on the livestock and they can be kept safe.Rexhep Maksutaj, Isniq Through Centuries, Shtepia Botuese Libri Shkollor, Prishtine, 2002, pg.107 ===Shearing=== This is a tradition of the people who live in Deçan. The kind of shearing which Kosovians apply to their sheep Traditional rite of shearings so far was held in the mountains of Roshkodol, in Zllonopoje in the mountains of Prilep, In the mountains of Lumbardh etc. Shear tradition was maintained with major challenges. Some shearer that have started from childhood to know the shorn 12 types ranging from the round shape, with the sequence, the moon, the star, in the form of a serpent, with a trap ....and many other forms. Sheep which holds terrkaqen - or knell sheep to be shorn in order to be of particular because the herds of sheep must be distinguished. But note that this is related to the particular arrangement of shearers, shearer ranging from the oldest, the best shearer, the shearer who shears the rams and the shearer that shear the sheep The - bell. \\"Ogiqet\\" aren't sheared, because not counted by years or fawn, but counted with years it has not been shaved. This ritual is among the oldest rites. Even this is a job of art. For a long time, wool was the raw material used by the family to ensure clothing for the entire year. Shearing of sheep was done in a ritual way. The period of shearing began in the middle of summer, when they had nearly finished all the house duties of the summer. The shepherd would invite shearers and other people to honor them. For this day, besides a sheep being slain for the meat for the guests, other traditional dishes were also prepared. Breakfast was served usually with corn bread and thickened milk, and for lunch, apart from other foods, boiled cream was served; a special mountaineers food. In Deçans mountains the sheep are usually sheared in rows, randomly in four or five rows. The best shearer shared the dark sheep. There is also a traditional element that should not be omitted: the one who sheared the rams at dinner is served the sheep backbone and the dearest guest is served its head.Rexhep Maksutaj, Isniq Through Centuries, Shtepia Botuese Libri Shkollor, Prishtine, 2002, pg.108 ===Descends=== At the Cursed Mountains the \\"descends\\" are of the most characteristic rites. Speaking of Deçan the time of descending from mountains was set by the village council dealing with mountains and forests. The descends consist of two stages. Two weeks before the \\"Karvaj\\" (that is how the caravan of people descending the mountains were called) began the churning. The dairy gathered during summer was prepared to be descended before children. The cream was churned (a process through with butter was separated from the brim) and in the brim cottage cheese remained. Children and adults too await for this moment with joy, as delicious mash was prepared by it. A day before they go and fetch snow so on that night they add to the cream in order to make it cooler. The women of the cottage(baqica)is very busy at that time. Children, on those days, upon their return from blueberries gathering, sang in joy: Tuna, Tuna, vaja-vaja Sot dy javë vinë karvaja vinë karvajat varg e vi na vinë teshat me shami... (Tuna, tuna, vaja- vaja In two weeks will come \\"karvaja\\" Caravans come one by one Our clothes come in a bundle...) This song is sung joyfully by children because the descend meant as a custom they would be given new clothing, e.g. leather shoes, shirts, wool pants, vests, scarves, beads, etc. Later on, when trade developed, these things could be bought at market. The descending took place on the same day for all the cottage owners. The one that had the best horses lead the caravan. At a set place the caravan stopped for lunch. Because of this at the Deçan Gorge there exists a micro-toponym Pie's Spring. In the evening, after they all reached home, guests were invited for the \\"descend dinner\\". Guests said their welcome and expressed their happiness for their safe coming from the mountains. Dinner was served with traditional foods, boiled cream amongst others.Rexhep Maksutaj, Isniq Through Centuries, Shtepia Botuese Libri Shkollor, Prishtine, 2002, pg.109 ===Harvest and Pastrami dinners=== These are two dinners that enrich the anniversary rites. The first is served when family has completed all field works and is called the threshing dinner. In it are invited all the close relatives of the man of the house who wish him a healthy harvest yield. The pastrami dinner is at the beginning of winter when a cattle \\\\has been slain and on the occasion the men of the house invites guest to dinner. Albanians have inherited habits and traditions of sacrifice, remembrance, joy and peace . One of them is the tradition of \\"Supper Lama\\" and its linguistic variations known as \\"Night of the field\\", \\"Night of the crops\\", etc. \\"Harvest Supper\\" is a traditional Albanian party which is usually held in late October reap the benefits when the summer job. Lama called for \\"llama\\" has been flat land in villages Highlands, where are threshed crops, mainly maize. While the field is named \\"dinner of the field\\" after being harvested its benefits, mainly wheat. Lama was also gravitating instead of solidarity and reciprocity among Albanian villagers, helping each other with manpower. Given that the Albanians area was part bukësore significant dilution of ethics, \\"giving bread\\" has been an essential aspect of traditional social relations. Ethnographic evidence shows that the collection of products and completion of works in various areas Kosovo, is always organized a big dinner joint to thank people who have helped the conclusion of livestock and agricultural affairs. This is evidenced in the recent years in different villages. ==References== Category:Albanian culture Category:Albanian mythology Category:Deçan ","title":"Culture of Deçan"},{"id":"42080436","text":"Jerwu Bala is a village in Khwahan District in Badakhshan provinceMaplandia world gazetteer in north-eastern Afghanistan. ==References *Bala/ Satellite map at Maplandia.com * Category:Populated places in Khwahan District ","title":"Jerwu Bala"},{"id":"42080437","text":"Soup of Life (simplified Chinese: 砂煲肉骨茶) is the tenth Malaysian production by MediaCorp Studios Malaysia.

Only thus can life be truly exciting! This was a principle Ah Yuan's mother had told him to live by. When Ah Yuan was young, he was a gangster, and often committed petty thefts. Once when there was a gang fight, Ah Yuan's buddy, Ah Hai, took the blame and pleaded guilty in court in order to protect him. Ah Yuan was grateful to Ah Hai for his sacrifice, and decided to turn over a new leaf, taking over his father's business of selling Bak Kut Teh at a coffee shop together with his wife, Ah Mei. Ah Yuan was hardworking and honest, and refused to cut corners when cooking his Bak Kut The. He soon had a steady stream of regular customers. However, Ah Mei's ex-boyfriend, Hei Ge, continued to pester the couple, wanting her to leave Ah Yuan and return to him. Once when they were having an argument, Ah Yuan was pushed beyond his limits and scalded Hei Ge. He Ge swore to put Ah Yuan behind bars... After Ah Hai was released from prison, he wanted to start life anew. When he knew that Hei Ge was causing trouble for Ah Yuan, he looked Hei Ge up quietly to negotiate with him. However, Hei Ge wanted Ah Hai to help him in smuggling, but was stopped in time by Ah Yuan. The two buddies proceeded to work together to put Hei Ge behind bars. Ah Hai had a lot of difficulty finding a job because of his background, and when he finally found a job as a chef, he met his previous chief, Long Ge. Knowing Ah Hai's capabilities, he wanted Ah Hai to work for him again. However, Ah Hai was very unwilling to return to crime, and kept rejecting him, offending him in the process. Ah Hai had no choice but to open a Nasi Lemak stall at the coffee shop with Ah Yuan's help. At the coffee shop was a lady selling duck rice named Lin Fang, who was very hardworking, and sacrificed a lot for her family. Her husband, Mark, was bad tempered and abusive as a result of being jobless for a long time, and was having an affair with a bar owner named Amy. Lin Fang was torn between tolerating the affair to keep the family together and confronting him. As Mark was trying to seek Lin Fang's forgiveness, Amy appeared and sowed discord among the family members, causing Lin Fang and her son's relationship to be strained. To get Mark to return to her side, Amy kept causing trouble for the family, and caused the marriage to fall apart. Having lost her husband, Lin Fang had the help of those at the coffee shop to pull herself together. As Ah Hai helped her repeatedly, the two of them started developing feelings for each other. However, they could not move beyond being mere friends because of their own circumstances. At that time, Ah Yuan was framed for a murder, and was arrested by the police. Knowing that Long Ge was behind it, Ah Hai agreed to work for him in order for Ah Yuan to be released. Thus when Ah Yuan was released, Ah Hai “disappeared” without a word. One day, Lin Fang spotted Ah Hai and discovered that he was working for a gang. This tested their relationship further. The coffee shop had many different people working together. The lady boss was Yin Jie, who was stingy and calculative, and cared only for material benefits. She was in charge of the stall operators and workers. She had a son and a daughter. Her son was called Jin Mao, and he was idle all day, looking for a way to earn a quick buck. However, his attempts always ended in failure. Her daughter was called Jin Ling, and she was mildly retarded. Thus, she was often bullied. Luckily Ah Hai often protected her. As a result, she regarded him as a hero and often followed him everywhere. Yin Jie's lover was Master Ling, and he was a Tai Chi Master. Master Ling was knowledgeable and often gave advice to the others at the coffee shop. Paul, who sold western food, met a girl from China called Jiang Hong, and fell in love with her. However, Jiang Hong is only focused on fulfilling her dream to go to the US to dance. In order to earn more money, she went to work at the coffee shop. The son of the coffee shop owner, Jin Mao, fell in love with her and pursued her relentlessly. When he knew that she needed a lot of money, he recommended her a job selling weight loss pills. However, Lin Fang's sister, Lin Zhu, ate the pills and was hospitalized for kidney failure. Jiang Hong was filled with remorse, and Paul stayed by her side to comfort her. Thus, Jiang Hong was touched and decided to accept Paul's love. At this point in time, Master Ling's daughter, Ding Ding, suddenly returned from the US, and was very liberal and avant garde. This caught everyone off guard. Even though Yin Jie and Master Ling had planned to get married, but because Ding Ding and Jin Mao could not get along, they had to call the wedding off. This made Yin Jie very angry with Master Ling. A downcast Master Ling dragged Paul off for a drinking session, but this resulted in Paul getting drunk and scolding Ding Ding badly when he saw her. When Ding Ding knew of her father's love for Yin Jie, she decided to bring the couple together again, with Paul's help. This incident enabled Paul and Ding Ding to get to know each other. Jin Mao had always carried a torch for Jiang Hong, and even tried to kiss her forcibly when she was tipsy. When Ding Ding got to know of this incident, she decided to help Jiang Hong take revenge, and framed Jin Mao. As a result, others got to know of the incident and Jin Mao was ostracized and disgraced. Jin Mao hated Ding Ding to the core, and abducted her. What he intended to just be a scare for her spiraled into something much more serious, and the police was called in. Forced into a corner, he had no choice but to turn to Long Ge for help. Long Ge decided to use him against Ah Hai. After Jiang Hong graduated, she was actively looking for a job in order to gain a work permit to stay in Singapore. With Paul's help, she finally found a job teaching little children to dance. Among her students was a girl named He En Qi, who got a long very well with her. En Qi's father, Mr He, also fell in love with Jiang Hong. This affected her relationship with Paul, who was also being pursued by Ding Ding. In order to let Jiang Hong fulfill her dreams, Paul decided to let Jiang Hong go with Mr He, and during that time, Ding Ding was faithfully by his side, encouraging him to move on from his breakup. Would Paul really be able to let go? Ah Mei became pregnant, and Ah Yuan's family was filled with joy. However, Ah Mei discovered that she had severe gestational diabetes and was having a dangerous pregnancy. For Ah Mei's sake, Ah Yuan wanted Ah Mei to abort the baby, but Ah Mei was unwilling. Thus the couple labored together to bring the baby to full term. Unfortunately, Ah Mei witnessed Jin Mao committing a murder and became a target herself. Would Ah Yuan be able to protect his wife? In the aroma of food, and the unique flavor of the coffee shop, many touching stories of the resilience of life are brought forth. In life there are always ups and downs, sweet and sour, but one's strength of character, the ingredients for resilience and perseverance, dictates one's failure or success. ==List of overseas broadcasts== According to series premiere date: { class=\\"sortable \\" - !
