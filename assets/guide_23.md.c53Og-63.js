The mall was built as an integrated development together with a condominium, Compass Heights which is located adjacent to the mall. Originally opened on 1 August 2002, the mall closed for extensive renovation works on 26 October 2015 and re-opened on 1 September 2016. ==History== Compass Point was built as an integrated development together with the adjacent Sengkang MRT/LRT station and Compass Heights condominium. Constructed at a cost of S$230 million, the shopping mall started operations on 1 August 2002. The shopping centre was the first major mall to open on the North East line. Before the renovation works, the mall was Singapore's first thematic suburban shopping mall based on the theme of learning. Educational panels and informative posters are mounted on railings and walls, which feature interesting trivia based on particular themes updated periodically. After getting feedback from the public and commissioning a survey of residents in the area, conducted by international property adviser DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited, the mall's developer, Centrepoint Properties, proposed the learning theme for the shopping mall to cater to the predominantly young families of Sengkang New Town. The shopping mall had an approximate retail area of . Retail space was spread out over four storeys and a basement. Each storey of the shopping centre was named after the five major continents, with motifs showing different aspects of that continent, such as flora and sea transport vessels: Oceania (basement storey); Asia (ground floor); Europe (2nd storey); The Americas (3rd); and Africa (4th). Tile floor mural in Compass Point ===Change of ownership and renovation works=== In December 2015, it was announced that real estate fund manager M&G; Real Estate will become the sole owner of Compass Point mall in Sengkang, after entering into a deed to acquire the remaining 18.99 percent of shares owned by Frasers Centrepoint. The buyout was finalised in February 2016 and M&G; Real Estate announced that the mall will reopen on 1 September 2016 after upon completion of the upgrading works under a new name and new management. The mall was called 1 Sengkang Mall after a competition on Facebook with the winner getting $1000 in cash with the most 'likes', but was officially renamed Compass One by the management after the public wanted to stick to the original name. Compass One reopened on 1 September 2016 with a new interior design, 180 speciality tenants and a redesigned interior layout. The Sengkang Public Library, which opened on 18 March 2017, occupies a portion of Levels 3 and 4. There will also be a play deck comprising a wet and dry playground at Level 4. The returning tenants are Cold Storage, Kopitiam and Japan Home. Additionally, Rubi Shoes opened one store in Compass One at the same opening, together with Cotton On Body and Cotton On. ==Accessibility== Compass One Shopping Mall is located next to the Sengkang MRT/LRT station, Sengkang Bus Interchange and Compassvale Bus Interchange. ==Gallery (as Compass Point)== File:Compass Point, Nov 05.JPGMain entrance of the mall in November 2005 File:Compass Point.JPG Compass Point before the upgrading works File:Compass Point Shopping Centre 2, Apr 06.JPGWall mounts on the railings depicting the theme of the mall File:Wall Mural at Compass Point.JPGWall tile mural in Compass Point ==See also== * Sengkang Community Hub * Sengkang Bus Interchange * Compassvale Bus Interchange ==References== ==External links== *Compass One website Category:Buildings and structures in Sengkang Category:Sengkang Category:Sengkang Town Centre Category:Shopping malls in Singapore Category:Buildings and structures completed in 2002 Category:2002 establishments in Singapore Category:Tourist attractions in North-East Region, Singapore ","title":"Compass One"},{"id":"3260278","text":"Christian La Rue (born 1970 or 1971) is a Canadian ice hockey coach.

Ferré at a location in the Ponce Historic Zone. The museum moved to its current building location on Avenida Las Américas in 1965. In 2010, the museum increased its size significantly after a $30M expansion. ==History== Main hall of the museum The project of the museum began in 1956 when Luis A. Ferré traveled to Europe and acquired various European art pieces, including many Pre-Raphaelite works, which encouraged him to start a project for a museum in the city of Ponce, his birthplace. With the advice of two experts – Julius S. Held, specialist on Rubens and professor of Art History at Barnard College and Columbia University, and René Taylor, art and architecture enthusiast and professor at the University of Granada, Yale, and Columbia – Ferré compiled a collection of works of art based on their value instead of their popularity.Celia Quartermain.

Ferré would state in a Forbes interview that \\"the scholars and critics all called it kitsch, everyone thought I was crazy to buy them.\\" On 3 January 1959, Ferré opened the museum at a house at 70 Cristina Street in Ponce at what is today the Centro Cultural de Ponce, with an exhibit of 72 works of art. Some of these original paintings continue to be on display today. As time passed and the museum gained popularity, additional works of art were added to the collections. In 1962, the Samuel H. Kress Foundation donated 15 paintings to the museum. By 1989, the museum's collection had grown to 500 pieces, with a then estimated value of $50 million, equivalent to $ in present-day terms. Fearing a fire in the Cristina Street building would destroy its collections, Ferré acquired a tract of land on Las Americas Avenue in Ponce to build the current museum, and recruited architect Edward Durell Stone for its design. On 23 April 1964 the first stone was placed and the construction of the museum began. It was finished in 1965 and officially opened on 28 December 1965. One of the main features of the museum is its hexagonal galleries, which allow natural light to enter through its corners bringing an illumination to exhibitions. The museum contained a total of 14 galleries, two gardens, and an amphitheater, and its main entrance with bifurcated ladders. Pinceladas en Vuelo (\\"Brushstokes in Flight\\"), a 28-foot-high aluminum structure created in 1984 by New York sculptor Roy Lichtenstein sits on the front yard of the museum, which was then considered \\"the largest public [display art] work in Latin America and the Caribbean.\\" The museum was closed from 2008 to 2010 while undergoing renovations, re-opening in time for the celebration of its 50th anniversary on 13 November 2010, after a $30 million in improvements.In Transit; Art Museum Reopens After Major Expansion.

Locally, it was known as Southwest 232nd Street, Silver Palm Drive, and Bailes Road. Its western terminus was an intersection with Country Club Road (Southwest 202nd Avenue) in the Redlands; its eastern terminus was an intersection with Galloway Road (Southwest 87th Avenue) midway between Cutler Bay and Black Point. All but of SR 908 was on Silver Palm Drive—the section just east of South Dixie Highway (U.S. Route 1/SR 5) was bypassed by using US 1 and Bailes Drive in Goulds. ==Route description== With the exception of the segment in Goulds, a suburb of Miami, SR 908 passed through agricultural areas (primarily landscape nurseries, cornfields, tomato farms, and elephant ear fields). One mile south of the eastern terminus of the former SR 908, Black Point has evolved from a popular fishing spot to the site of a major Miami- Dade County marina and a primary access to Biscayne National Park. ==History== Silver Palm Drive was built in the early 1900s. It was established as State Road 908 in the late 1950s. Although the road lost its Florida Department of Transportation State Road status in the 1970s, the area along the road itself has not significantly changed since then, in contrast to the rapid urbanization to the south of it in Homestead and Florida City, and to the north of it, in Saga Bay and Lakes by the Bay, both now part of Cutler Bay. 908 908 ","title":"Florida State Road 908"},{"id":"3260315","text":"Diane Mott Davidson (born ) is an American author of mystery novels that use the theme of food, an idea she got from Robert B.

In a few of her novels (particularly, The Cereal Murders), she references a prestigious eastern women's college that her sleuth, Goldy Schulz, attended before transferring to the University of Colorado in Boulder. In real life, Mott Davidson transferred from Wellesley and eventually graduated from Stanford University. ==Career== The main character in Mott Davidson's novels is Goldy Schulz, a small town caterer who also solves murder mysteries in her spare time. At the start of the series, Goldy is a recently divorced mother with a young son trying to make a living as a caterer in the fictional town of Aspen Meadow, CO. As the series progresses, new characters are introduced that change Goldy's professional and personal life.

From 1940 to 1949, he played for the New York Yankees (1940–46) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1947–49). Bonham, who batted and threw right-handed, won 21 games for the Yankees in 1942. He was born in Ione, California, and nicknamed \\"Tiny\\" because he was an imposing tall and weighed . ==Career== In a 10-season career, Bonham posted a 103–72 (.589) record with 478 strikeouts and a 3.06 ERA in 1,551 innings pitched. Bonham kept opposing batters off balance with an assortment of deliveries. He started his professional baseball career with the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League in 1935. He worked his way up through the New York Yankees minor league system until 1940, when he was summoned from Triple-A Kansas City to anchor a weak Yankees pitching staff. Remaining with the Yankees until , Bonham was a pitching mainstay of manager Joe McCarthy's pennant-winning combinations between 1941 and 1943. Bonham supplied his team with the decisive complete game 4-hit 3–1 victory over the Brooklyn Dodgers in Game Five of the 1941 World Series played at Ebbets Field. But Bonham was ill- fated in his other Series starts, losing to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1942 and 1943, both times by 4–3 scores. His most productive season came in 1942, when he led the American League with 21 wins, six shutouts, 22 complete games and a .808 winning percentage. He made the All-Star team that season and again in 1943. Hampered by a chronic back ailment during his last few years with the Yankees, which were interrupted by a brief time in the Army in 1944, Bonham was sent to the Pittsburgh Pirates before the 1947 season. Although his physical condition was such that he could not be counted on regularly, Bonham provided three solid seasons for the Pirates. After a 1–4 start in 1949, Bonham won six straight games for a floundering Pittsburgh club, including an 8–2 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on August 27, his final game. Nineteen days later Bonham died in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at the age of 36, following an appendectomy and stomach surgery. ==See also== * List of baseball players who died during their careers ==References== ==External links== *Baseball Library * Category:1913 births Category:1949 deaths Category:Akron Yankees players Category:American League All-Stars Category:Baseball players from California Category:Binghamton Triplets players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Kansas City Blues (baseball) players Category:People from Amador County, California Category:New York Yankees players Category:Newark Bears (IL) players Category:Oakland Oaks (baseball) players Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players ","title":"Tiny Bonham"},{"id":"3260322","text":"The Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act of 2005 (), nicknamed \\"Bioshield Two\\" and sponsored by Senator Richard Burr (R-North Carolina), aims shorten the pharmaceutical development process for new vaccines and drugs in case of a pandemic, and to protect vaccine makers and the pharmaceutical industry from legal liability for vaccine injuries. The proposed bill would create a new federal agency, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency (BARDA), that would act \\"as the single point of authority\\" to promote advanced research and development of drugs and vaccines in response to bioterrorism and natural disease outbreaks, while shielding the agency from public Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. BARDA would be exempt from long-standing open records and meetings laws that apply to most government departments. The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee approved the bill, co-sponsored by Bill Frist (R-TN), Mike Enzi (R-WY), and Judd Gregg (R-NH), by voice vote, despite Democratic objections. Several other proposals have contained, in part, similar provisions (or protections) as those found in the Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act of 2005.Office of Legislative Policy and Analysis (OLPA) , 109th Congress, Legislative Updates ==Key provisions== The Bioshield Two bill would shift the main responsibility for developing bioterrorism countermeasures out of the Department of Homeland Security and into the new BARDA agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. The proposed new agency would improve on Project BioShield, a barely two-year- old program also meant to encourage production of vaccines and drugs. BARDA would receive a first-year budget of $1 billion. Other key aspects of the proposed legislation include: * Provision of rebates or grants as incentives for domestic manufacturing of vaccines and medical countermeasures against bioterrorism and natural disease outbreaks. * Liability protections for drug makers that develop vaccines for biological weapons. The measure would make manufacturers, distributors, health care providers, or administrators of security countermeasures immune from liability caused by a security countermeasure or any pandemic/epidemic product, by means of a limited antitrust exemption. * Establishment of a single agency, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency, as the lead federal agency for the development of countermeasures against bioterrorism. The new agency would report directly to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, which would have sole authority to decide whether a manufacturer violated laws mandating drug safety. Citizens would be banned from challenging such decisions in the civil court system. The agency would 'partner' with drug makers while placing information about such partnerships outside of public view. * Extension of some prescription drug patents. * Allow the Department of Health and Human Services to sign exclusive sales contracts with particular manufacturers for a particular product. * Forbid government purchases of generic versions of such new drugs or vaccines as well as public sales of the products for use as countermeasures. * Exempt countermeasures from certain federal cost oversight requirements. ==Support== Much of the support for the bill comes from Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and its members. In the 2002 election cycle, PhRMA contributed $3,505,052 to politicians, with 95% going to Republicans. The top recipient in the Senate was the bill's sponsor, Senator Richard Burr, who received $288,684, according to the non- partisan Center for Responsive Politics. Senator Burr said the legislation \\"creates a true partnership\\" between the federal government, the pharmaceutical industry and academia to \\"walk the drug companies through the Valley of Death\\" in bringing a new vaccine or drug to market. Exemptions from open records and meetings laws would streamline the development process, safeguard national security and protect the proprietary interests of drug companies, say Republican backers of the bill.December 2005 Las Vegas Sun Portal ??? ==Opposition== Senator Chris Dodd (D-Connecticut) said \\"Their plan will protect companies that make ineffective or harmful medicines, and because it does not include compensation for those injured by a vaccine or drug, it will discourage first responders and patients from taking medicines to counter a biological attack or disease outbreak.\\"Editorials & Op-Eds of Sen.

Thomas Chirnside was born in Berwickshire, Scotland, the elder son of Robert Chirnside and Mary Fairs. His father was also a farmer. In 1839 Chirnside came from Liverpool on the ship . He arrived in Adelaide in January, and Sydney in March of that year. The drought of 1839 adversely affected the sheep he had bought near the Murrumbidgee River, so he joined his younger brother Andrew in Melbourne. In April 1842 the brothers established a station in the Grampians, and that same year Thomas acquired a station on the Wannon River, where he was one of the first to employ Aborigines. In the mid-1840s the brothers acquired series of properties in the Western District of Victoria. The elder Chirnside settled in Werribee, Victoria, just before the gold rushes, eventually buying 80,000 acres (320 km²) of land. He built a substantial bluestone house surrounded by a ha ha wall, and later, in the 1870s, the sandstone Italianate Werribee Park Mansion. On 2 September 1853 he purchased through a government grant Section 14, Parish of Cut Paw Paw, County of Burke. This allotment was , which is now the Melbourne suburb of Kingsville. Thomas Chirnside was a member of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria from 1857 to 1859 and the Royal Society of Victoria from 1860 to 1866. He was a strict Sabbatarian, allowing no work on his properties on Sundays. He donated an acre (0.4 ha) of land and £100 for the first Presbyterian Church in Werribee, and in February 1884, he laid the foundation stone of the second one. He and Andrew gave £1000 to Ormond College, at the University of Melbourne. Suffering from depression, Thomas Chirnside committed suicide in 1887. He was found dead in the laundry of Werribee Mansion with a shotgun lying beside him. His ghost now haunts the mansion. Andrew Chirnside inherited the property, but died three years later. A primary school in Werribee has been named in his honour. == References == An aerial perspective of his legacy in Werribee. Thomas Chirnside School.

In rheology, shear thinning is the non-Newtonian behavior of fluids whose viscosity decreases under shear strain. It is sometimes considered synonymous for pseudoplastic behaviour, and is usually defined as excluding time-dependent effects, such as thixotropy. Shear thinning is the most common type of non-Newtonian behavior of fluids and is seen in many industrial and everyday applications. Although shear thinning is generally not observed in pure liquids with low molecular mass or ideal solutions of small molecules like sucrose or sodium chloride, it is often observed in polymer solutions and molten polymers, as well as complex fluids and suspensions like ketchup, whipped cream, blood, paint, and nail polish. ==Theories behind shear thinning behavior== Though the exact cause of shear thinning is not fully understood, it is widely regarded to be the effect of small structural changes within the fluid, such that microscale geometries within the fluid rearrange to facilitate shearing. In colloid systems, phase separation during flow leads to shear thinning. In polymer systems such as polymer melts and solutions, shear thinning is caused by the disentanglement of polymer chains during flow. At rest, high molecular weight polymers are entangled and randomly oriented. However, when sheared at a high enough rate, these highly anisotropic polymer chains start to disentangle and align along the direction of shear. This leads to less molecular/particle interaction and a larger amount of free space, decreasing the viscosity. === Power Law Model === Shear thinning in a polymeric system: dependence of apparent viscosity on shear rate. η0 is the zero shear rate viscosity and η∞ is the infinite shear viscosity plateau. At both sufficiently high and very low shear rates, viscosity of a polymer system is independent of the shear rate. At high shear rates, polymers are entirely disentangled and the viscosity value of the system plateaus at η∞, or the infinite shear viscosity plateau. At low shear rates, the shear is too low to be impeded by entanglements and the viscosity value of the system is η0, or the zero shear rate viscosity. The value of η∞ represents the lowest viscosity attainable and may be orders of magnitude lower than η0, depending on the degree of shear thinning. Viscosity is graphed against shear rate in a log(η) vs. log(\\\\dot\\\\gamma) plot, where the linear region is the shear thinning regime and can be expressed using the Oswald and de Waele power law equation: \\\\tau=K(T)({d\\\\gamma \\\\over dt})^n = K(T)\\\\overset{\\\\centerdot}{\\\\gamma}^n The Oswald and de Waele equation can be written in a logarithmic form: log(\\\\tau)=log(K)+nlog(\\\\dot{\\\\gamma}) The apparent viscosity is defined as \\\\eta={\\\\tau \\\\over \\\\dot\\\\gamma} , and this may be plugged into the Oswald equation to yield a second power-law equation for apparent viscosity: \\\\eta=K(T)\\\\dot\\\\gamma^{(n-1)} This expression can also be used to describe dilatant (shear thickening) behavior, where the value of n is greater than 1. === Herschel-Bulkley model === Bingham plastics require a critical shear stress to be exceeded in order to start flowing. This behavior is usually seen in polymer/silica micro- and nanocomposites, where the formation of a silica network in the material provides a solid-like response at low shear stress.The shear-thinning behavior of plastic fluids can be described with the Herschel-Bulkley model, which adds a threshold shear stress component to the Ostwald equation: \\\\tau=\\\\tau_{y} + K(T)\\\\dot\\\\gamma ^n ==Relationship with thixotropy== Some authors consider shear-thinning to be a special case of thixotropic behaviour, because the recovery of the microstructure of the liquid to its initial state will always require a non- zero time. When the recovery of viscosity after disturbance is very rapid however, the observed behaviour is classic shear-thinning or pseudoplasticity, because as soon as the shear is removed, the viscosity returns to normal. When it takes a measurable time for the viscosity to recover, thixotropic behaviour is observed. When describing the viscosity of liquids, however, it is therefore useful to distinguish shear-thinning (pseudoplastic) behaviour from thixotropic behaviour, where the viscosity at all shear rates is decreased for some duration after agitation: both of these effects can often be seen separately in the same liquid. == Everyday examples == Modern paints are examples of pseudoplastic materials. When modern paints are applied, the shear created by the brush or roller will allow them to thin and wet out the surface evenly. Once applied, the paints regain their higher viscosity, which avoids drips and runs. Whipped cream is also an example of a shear thinning material. When whipped cream is sprayed out of its canister, it flows out smoothly from the nozzle due to the low viscosity at high flow rate. However, after whipped cream is sprayed into a spoon, it does not flow and its increased viscosity allows it to be rigid. == See also == * Shear thickening * Non-Newtonian fluid * Power-law fluid * Thixotropy * Dilatant *Bingham plastic * Rheology * Kaye effect == External links == * The Great Ketchup Mystery * NASA - The Physics of Whipped Cream NASA April 25, 2008 References: Category:Continuum mechanics Category:Rheology Category:Non-Newtonian fluids Category:Smart materials Category:Tribology ","title":"Shear thinning"},{"id":"3260364","text":"King is the second studio album by American alternative rock band Belly, released on February 13, 1995.

Her contributions have had worldwide adoption in head-mounted display, HDTV, laptop computers, and projector products; she was the technical force behind a generation of low- cost computing, and innovative consumer and medical imaging technologies. She was named one of the hundred most influential people in the world by Time Magazine (Time 100), was named in 2013 to CNN's top 10 thinkers in science and technology for her work in display innovation, and she has over 200 patents published or issued. She was the co-founder and first chief technology officer of One Laptop per Child (OLPC), and later founded Pixel Qi in Taipei, Taiwan, focused on the design and manufacture of displays. She founded and led two moonshots at Google X, reporting to Sergey Brin, and was an executive at Facebook / Oculus VR, leading an effort to advance Virtual Reality. In 2016 she founded OpenWater, a startup working on fMRI-type imaging of the body using holographic, infrared techniques. == Early life and education == Jepsen studied Studio Art and Electrical Engineering at Brown University. She received a Master of Science in Holography from the MIT Media Lab, and then returned to Brown to receive a Ph.D. in Optical Sciences. == Career == Her PhD work combined theoretical coupled-wave analysis with lab work, in which she created large-scale, embossed surface-relief diffraction gratings with liquid crystal-filled grooves with high diffraction efficiency in un-polarized illumination. She has created some of the largest ambient displays ever. In Cologne, Germany she built a holographic replica of pre-existing buildings in the city's historic district and created a holographic display encompassing a city block. She also demonstrated that it was technically feasible – but agreed it was culturally unacceptable – to project TV images on the moon's surface. From 2003 until the end of 2004, she was the chief technology officer of Intel’s Display Division. In 2016 she joined the board of directors of Lear Corporation, a leading maker of automotive electronics and seating. === MIT Media Lab and OLPC === In 2005 Jepsen joined the faculty of the MIT Media Lab as a professor with a tenure-track position. Here she started the Nomadic Displays Group, and co-created the first holographic video system in the world in 1989, where the interference structure of the hologram was computed at video rates, and shown on her hand-made display. This system inspired a new subfield of holographic video and received numerous awards. Working with Nicholas Negroponte, she simultaneously co-founded One Laptop per Child, a $100 computer, the lowest-power laptop ever made. As of 2013, millions of units have shipped to children in the developing world and revenues are beyond the billion dollar mark. There are deployments in over 50 countries and in more than 25 different languages. For the entire first year of the effort (2005) she was the only employee of One Laptop per Child [OLPC]. By the end of 2005, she had completed the initial architecture, led the development of the first prototype, and signed up some of the world's largest manufacturers to produce the XO-1. By the end of 2007 she had led the laptop through development and into high volume mass production. At OLPC, Jepsen invented the laptop's sunlight-readable display technology and co-invented its ultra-low power management system, and transformed these inventions into high volume mass production. === Pixel Qi === Hooked on the impact that OLPC was having using the massive factory infrastructure of the world, she left Boston to split her time between Silicon Valley and Asia. In 2008 she started a for- profit company, Pixel Qi, to commercialize some of the technologies she invented at OLPC. The firm's business was based on the concept that the screen is the most critical component of any mobile device. Pixel Qi \\"About Us\\" page, accessed October 5, 2008 It aimed to deliver high performance, low-power, sunlight-readable screens for mobile devices. The long-term vision of Pixel Qi was to create devices that never needed to be recharged by lowering the power consumption and using alternative power generation and battery technologies. Its screens became available in a few dozen commercial and specialized products with sunlight readability, and reduced screen power consumption (which typically accounts for about 90% of the power draw in a tablet, and 70% of the power draw on a standard cell phone. === Google X and virtual reality === Jepsen joined Google X in 2013. She advised and directed display and consumer electronic programs throughout Google. The Wall Street Journal reported that among her projects there she created Google Lego TV: displays composed of smaller screens that plug together like Legos to create vast, seamless images and \\"live walls\\" for wall size interaction, television, video conferencing and gaming, to virtual reality without having to wear anything on your face or body. She was also one of the first contributors in Google's \\"Solve for X\\" projects with her idea of \\"Imaging the Mind's Eye\\". In February 2015, she joined Facebook as an executive for virtual reality. === Openwater === In 2016, she left Facebook and founded Openwater, a firm aiming to use infrared holography to make fMRI-type imaging inside the body practical, at the price level of consumer electronics and in wearable form factors. She gave a talk at 2018 TED on the technology behind the Openwater approach. At the IGNITION 2018 Conference, Jepsen further discussed the resolution progression of Openwater's MRI machines and the potential for the technology to make advancements in telepathy by allowing users to transmit thoughts and feelings electronically. In a 2020 online call, Mary Lou mentioned that openwater devices are actively in the rapid prototyping phase with alpha kits expected August 2020.

In 1348 Bayan Qulï was raised to the position of khan by the ruler of the Qara'unas, Amir Qazaghan, who had effectively taken control of the Chagatai ulus in 1346. For the next decade he remained Qazaghan’s puppet, exercising little real authority. In 1358 Qazaghan was assassinated and succeeded by his son ‘Abdullah. Not long after his ascension, ‘Abdullah had Bayan Qulï killed and selected a new puppet, Shah Temur, to succeed him. Bayan Qulï’s death was used as a pretext by ‘Abdullah’s enemies to bring about his downfall that same year. The Mongols, prior to the conquest of Ma wara'u'n-nahr and Semirechye were primarily shamanistic. However, in the 14th century many of those in Central Asia converted to Islam.

They are often only a small portion of the screen and thus must be selective in what details they display. Elements usually included on Mini-maps vary by video game genre. However, commonly included features are the position of the player character, allied units or structures, enemies, objectives and surrounding terrain. Mini-maps have become very common in real-time strategy and MMORPG video games because they serve as an indication of where the current screen lies within the scope of the game world. Most first person shooter games also have some version or variant of the mini map, with the odd exception of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019 video game), often showing enemy and teammates locations in real time. ==Features== Many mini-maps make use of similar features. Common features are: ===Fog of war=== In many games using a mini-map, the mini-map begins completely blank, while the map is automatically drawn as the player discovers new areas of the game world. After players discover new areas, the terrain of the discovered area often remains visible on the mini-map. If the player's characters or units cease being able to see the area, the area might be covered by a fog of war, so that unit or structure movements in that area will not be shown. Things in a fog of war portion of a mini-map may not be updated until they are rediscovered. ===Layers=== Similar to custom layers in Google Earth, some team-oriented multi-player games, such as Age of Empires II or Empire Earth, allow players to draw temporary lines, signals or markings on the mini-map for others to see. This allows for quick communication over large distances in games. ===Rotation and zoom=== In some 3D video games the mini-map rotates when the player character or game camera faces different directions, to keep the top of the map always corresponding to forward from the cameras point of view. This is common for games in the Grand Theft Auto series, and many racing games which show the track in a mini-map. Other games such as many in The Legend of Zelda series, the map does not rotate but features an arrow that moves about and rotates to show the position of the player character and the direction they're facing. In some games mini-maps that only show the close surrounding area often have icons on the edge to show the direction of locations or characters that are outside of the area shown on the map. Some games also have a feature where the mini-map zooms out when the player character is travelling at high speed, and zooms back in when they slow down. ==Automap== The automap feature in Meritous An Automap is similar to a mini-map but traces its origin back to early role-playing games. In early dungeon crawl video games players were expected to draw maps by hand as they played the game so they could solve complex mazes and explore large dungeons. Game boxes such as those for early 1980s Wizardry games included graph paper for this purpose. Games featuring automapping simulate the creation of a map, typically showing an abstract top- down view of nearby areas of the game world that is automatically updated as the player character gains knowledge of the environment. Automaps typically display doors, terrain types, and important locations or items. When discussing The Bard's Tale IIIs role as one of the first CRPGs with automapping, Computer Gaming World in 1994 wondered \\"How did we ever play without it?\\". Early automaps typically found in role-playing video games were pause screens that stopped gameplay when opened. Early examples of video games to feature a real-time automap include Namco's Rally-X in 1980, Gebelli Software's Horizon V in 1982,John Romero, and Arsys Software's WiBArm in 1986. (Translation) When the feature became popular with action-oriented games such as Doom and Diablo, the automap feature in these games did not pause the game and allowed the player to continue gameplay while the map was on screen. MUDs which were popular multiplayer virtual worlds in the mid 1990s rarely provided an automap. This resulted in MUD clients adding automapping as a feature, notably zMUD in September 1996. ==Code Minimap in Text editors and IDEs == The IDE KDevelop showing a code minimap in the right corner of the screen A code minimap in a Text editor or Integrated development environment (IDE) is a reduced overview of the entire file in its own view pane, typically next to the main editor pane. The portion of the file visible in the main editor pane is highlighted and clicking or dragging in this view scrolls the editor through the file. ==See also== *Overworld ==References== Category:Video game gameplay ","title":"Mini-map"},{"id":"3260392","text":"The greater naked-tailed armadillo (Cabassous tatouay) is an armadillo species from South America. ==Description== Larger than the closely related southern naked-tailed armadillos, adults of the greater species measure in head-body length, with a tail in length. There are eight or nine uniformly shaped teeth on each side of each jaw, with no identifiable incisors or canines. The carapace includes an average of 13 movable bands between the solid shields over the shoulders and hips, with each band having about 30 individual scutes. There is also a scaled shield over the upper surface of the head, with much smaller scales on the ears and on the cheeks below the eyes. The tail bears only small, isolated scales. ==Distribution and habitat== Greater naked-tailed armadillos are found in southern Brazil, eastern Paraguay and Uruguay and extreme north-eastern Argentina. It inhabits lowland and submontane forests, and also relatively open areas such as the Cerrado and Pantanal. There are no recognised subspecies. ==Behaviour== Greater naked-tailed armadillos feed on ants and termites and sleeps in burrows, often dug within termite mounds.

With no discernible sexual dimorphism, both males and females weigh about . The upper body, tail, and upper surface of the head are covered by a dark grey carapace of bony scales and have very little hair. The central part of the carapace is divided into a number of movable bands; there are usually seven such bands, but many individuals have just six, while a few have eight. The scales on the main shields, over the shoulders and hips, are hexagonal and about across, while those on the bands are rectangular and marked with a V-shaped groove that divides them into three triangular sections. The scales on the head are variable in shape. The tail has a number of distinct rings for about two-thirds of its length, and a slender tip. They have a narrow snout and long ears, measuring about a quarter to a third of the length of the head. There are four toes on the front feet and five on the hind feet; all have powerful curved claws. The underside of the animal has sparse dark-brown hair, and skin that is wrinkled on the abdomen, but smoother on the inside of the legs. == Distribution and habitat== The southern long-nosed armadillo inhabits southern Brazil, in the states of Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina, southern Paraguay, north-eastern Argentina, and almost the whole of Uruguay. There are no recognised subspecies. Within this region, they live in grasslands up to in elevation, preferring relatively undisturbed habitats and avoiding agricultural cropland, although they may be found on cattle ranches. ==Behaviour and biology== About 60% of the species' diet consists of ants and termites, although they also eat other small invertebrates, the occasional small mouse, and some vegetables and scraps. They are diurnal and active throughout the year, being solitary outside of the breeding season. They spend the night in burrows, which consist of a single passage with an average length of and depth of , although individual burrows vary greatly. They are typically built on flat or gently sloping terrain and angled so that the entrance faces away from the prevailing winds. The entrance is usually concealed beneath bushes or rocks, and may be lined with dried plant matter, which is also often found deeper within the burrow, where it forms a nest. Breeding begins in March, with the young being born from October to early December. From six to ten young are born in each litter, and are relatively precocial at birth, with their eyes already open and the bony scutes of their carapace already partially developed. Newborn young weigh about , and are weaned at about two months. ==References== Category:Armadillos Armadillo, Southern long-nosed) Armadillo, Southern long-nosed Armadillo, Southern long-nosed Armadillo, Southern long-nosed Armadillo, Southern long- nosed Armadillo, Southern long-nosed Armadillo, Southern long-nosed Category:Mammals described in 1804 ","title":"Southern long-nosed armadillo"},{"id":"3260400","text":"Khabul Shah (died 1370) was khan of the Chagatai Khanate from 1364 to 1370.

Lava released it on October 21, 2003 as a single from her cancelled second studio album SexySexObsessive. Toby Gad produced the song and wrote it with Ford and Rhonda Robinson. Ford had spent approximately two years working on material for a follow-up to her debut album Willa Was Here (2001). She said that she wanted to revolutionize pop music through using the word \\"fuck\\". After SexySexObsessive was shelved, \\"A Toast to Men\\" was promoted as a solo single. Ford was hesitant on whether or not Lava Records would release the song given its provocative content. A pop song with dance influences, its lyrics are based on Ford's experiences at a sorority party; it has a hook reminiscent of sorority chants. An extended play (EP) and a music video were released to promote the song. It was featured in the 2004 film Barbershop 2: Back in Business. \\"A Toast to Men\\" received positive reviews from critics, who noted its composition and Ford's sex appeal. It peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot Dance Singles Sales chart and number 45 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Sales chart. == Background and composition == Following the release of debut studio album Willa Was Here (2001), Willa Ford spent two years working on new music. She had developed the concept for \\"A Toast to Men\\" at a sorority party, after hearing girls chant: “Here’s to the men we love / Here’s to the men who love us / Fuck the men, let’s drink to us.” The lines were used for the song's hook. Ford was uncertain if her record label, Lava, would approve of the single's use of profanity. Describing her intentions behind its lyrics, she said: \\"I was part of the revolution, as far as changing the way people think of pop music. I wanted it to be sexy and fierce and be OK to say the word 'fuck.' I just needed some time to get out of it and figure out what the fuck was going on.\\" \\"A Toast to Men\\" was produced by Toby Gad, who contributed to the songwriting with Willa Ford and Rhonda Robinson. Tom Coyne served as the track's mastering engineer. It includes vocals by American rapper Lady May. A pop song, \\"A Toast to Men\\" lasts three minutes and twelve seconds. Rolling Stone's Gil Kaufman wrote that the song had elements of dance music, while Elysa Gardner of the Chicago Sun-Times as inspired by hip hop music and dancehall. The lyrics were compared to \\"an age-old sorority chant\\", and \\"salty sorority chant into a female-empowerment anthem\\". == Release and promotion == \\"A Toast to Men\\" was released as a digital download by Lava on October 21, 2003. An extended play (EP), which included the original and four remixes, was made available on November 18 of the same year. Lava promoted the song as part of Ford's second studio album SexySexObsessive. After the album's cancellation, \\"A Toast to Me\\" was referenced as a \\"solo single\\" instead. Due to the song's obscenity, critics question if radio personalities could say the single's full title on air. An edit was created to better accommodate radioplay, and the song was subsequently placed on heavy rotation on both radio stations and television. The song was featured in the 2004 film Barbershop 2: Back in Business. Jay Hainsworth of IGN wrote that \\"A Toast to Me\\" was \\"surrounded by controversy due to its risqué lyrics\\". A music video was released to promote the single, which Billboard's Chuck Taylor praised as \\"saucy (but graciously playful)\\" and \\"add[ing] fuel to the flamboyant raunch\\". == Reception == Critics had a positive response to \\"A Toast to Me\\".

It is one of only two species of armadillo that can roll into a ball (the other is the southern three-banded armadillo). It has suffered a 30% decline in population in the last 10 years. ==Names== It was known as kwaráu in the extinct Huamoé language of the Serra Negra in Pernambuco State, Brazil,Pompeu Sobrinho, Thomaz. 1958. Línguas Tapuias desconhecidas do Nordeste: Alguns vocabulários inéditos. Boletim de Antropologia (Fortaleza- Ceará) 2. 3-19. and as ˈkʌ̨́ñíkį̀ in the extinct Kambiwá language of Barreira, Petrolândia, Pernambuco. ==Habitat== The Brazilian three-banded armadillo lives primarily in open savannahs (Cerrado) and dry woodlands (Caatinga), where low rainfall and poor soil limit the vegetation to tall, woody grasses, scattered bushes, and gnarled trees. There is an abundance of cactus-like plants in the northern reaches of its range.Wildlife Explorer: Three-Banded Armadillo. USA: International Masters Publishers, 1998. ==Range== As its name suggests, the Brazilian three-banded armadillo is indigenous to Brazil, living primarily in the northeastern part of the country, just south of the equator. They are rarely seen west of 50°W longitude. ==Diet== The main staples of its diet are ants and termites, which it can smell through up to 20 centimeters of soil. It finds food by shuffling slowly along with its nose to the ground. When it detects prey, it frantically digs a hole and thrust its nose into it, using its long, sticky tongue to lap up any insects it may find. Other foods include mollusks, worms, fruit, and carrion. ==Anatomy== Tolypeutes tricinctus. Museum specimen Brazilian three-banded armadillos have a head-and- body length of about and the tail is between long. They weigh .Armadillo Online: Tolypeutes tricinctus. Retrieved 14 June 2014. The armor is composed of ossified dermal scutes covered by nonoverlapping, keratinized epidermal scales, which are connected by flexible bands of skin. This armor covers the back, sides, head, tail, ears, and outside surfaces of the legs. The underside of the body and the inner surfaces of the legs have no armored protection, and are covered instead by long, coarse hair. The genus Tolypeutes, which includes both the Brazilian and southern species of three-banded armadillos, is unique in the ability to roll up in a tight, almost impenetrable ball. This is because their armor is slightly looser than that of other armadillo genera, which allows for greater freedom of movement. The loose armor also creates a layer of air between the shell and the body, which insulates the animal. This higher capacity for thermoregulation allows them to survive in climates too arid for some of the other armadillo species. When the armadillo rolls into a defensive ball, the ears are tucked into the shell and the head and tail interlock to seal the shell completely. The teeth are soft and peg-like, adapted solely for smashing the exoskeletons of insects. ==Behavior== Tolypeutes tricinctus rolled into a defensive ball Armadillos are chiefly solitary, but this species will occasionally travel in small family groups of up to three members. They are largely nocturnal, but have been known to forage during the day. All the armadillos are spectacular diggers, but unlike most of the other species, three-banded armadillos do not dig in defense or to find shelter. They prefer to rest under bushes, rather than dig burrows, and their ability to roll into a ball makes defensive digging unnecessary. When they are not foraging, they move with a sort of trot, bouncing on the tips of their front toes, while their hind feet slap flatly on the ground. They mark their territories with secretions from glands on their face, feet, and rump. When threatened, they occasionally do not seal their armor completely, but wait until they are touched. They then quickly snap shut in an effort to startle the predator. ==Reproduction== The mating season lasts from October to January, during which there is a brief courtship before mating. The female carries the young for a gestation period of 120 days at the end of which single, blind offspring is born. The newborn’s armor is soft, but its claws are fully developed, and it can walk and roll into a ball within hours of birth. The armor hardens by the third or fourth week, around the same time the eyes and earflaps open. The young armadillo is weaned at 10 weeks and reaches sexual maturity at 9–12 months. ==Threats== The defense system of the Brazilian three-banded armadillo makes it safe from the majority of predators. Adult pumas and jaguars are the only South American mammals powerful enough to be a natural threat. The real danger to armadillos is the destruction of their habitats to make room for livestock. ==2014 FIFA World Cup mascot== The Caatinga Association, a Brazilian environmental NGO, launched in January 2012 a national campaign proposing the three-banded armadillo to become mascot of the 2014 FIFA World Cup hosted by Brazil. In March 2012, the Brazilian weekly, Veja, reported the three-banded armadillo would be the official mascot for the FIFA World Cup. Official announcement came in September 2012. ==ReferencesInfonatura * * World Cup Mascot.

Appearing in numerous television and billboard commercials, he has been played or modeled by various actors and is generally depicted as a clean living, older sailor with a white beard, dressed in merchant naval uniform and a white polo neck sweater and with a seafaring accent. ==History== The mascot is a reference to the brand's extensive and well-known range of frozen seafood products, of which fish fingers is probably the most-widely known. Because the Birds Eye brand is marketed to families, many of the advertising campaigns feature Captain Birdseye as having a 'crew' composed mostly of children in the preteen to teenage age groups, encouraging brand loyalty from children and emphasizing to parents the convenience of serving the company's products. An advertising campaign in the UK in 2005 features Captain Birdseye categorically proclaiming that Birds Eye frozen ready-made meals contain no artificial flavors or preservatives, with obvious references to the products being healthy and nutritious to children. The actor most associated with Captain Birdseye was John Hewer, who played the character from 1967 to 1998. His tenure was interrupted by a hiatus in 1971, when the fictitious Captain was killed off by Birdseye, with an \\"obituary\\" in The Times announcements section: Birdseye decided to resurrect the character three years later, on 22 July 1974, to bolster its brand against rising competition and rising prices resulting from the Cod Wars. Hewer was brought back to portray the Captain, who soon recaptured his popularity with children. In 1993, he was named in a poll as the most recognizable captain on the planet after Captain Cook. In 1998 Captain Birdseye became a much younger, rugged, dark-haired man with designer stubble and a miniature submarine, who indulged in far more action-packed adventures accompanied by his pet pelican named Jess. This version played by Thomas Pescod did not last long however, and the old version soon returned, played by Martyn Reid from 2002 until 2007. From 2008 until his death in 2012 German taxi driver Gerd Deutschmann played the captain. From early 2016 to late 2016 the captain was played by Mitch Commins, followed by Denis Parlato from mid 2016 to early 2017. Mark Fletcher took over the role in 2017 until early 2018, when Italian-born actor and seafarer Riccardo Acerbi was cast as Captain Birdseye in a £8m revamp of the brand and character in January 2018. The new Captain's \\"rugged good looks\\" were a huge hit with the British press. In South Africa, Captain Birdseye had been played by another British actor, Larry Taylor. ==Actors== Captain Birds Eye portrayed through the years. *1967 - 1998: John Hewer *1998 - 2001: Thomas Pescod *2002 - 2007: Martyn Reid *2008 - 2012: Gerd Deutschmann *Early 2016 - late 2016: Mitch Commins *Mid 2016 - early 2017: Denis Parlato *2017 - 2018: Mark Fletcher *2018- : Riccardo Acerbi ==Acquisitions == The brand was acquired by Anglo-Dutch food conglomerate Unilever, and was held until 2006, when it was sold to a private equity firm, Permira. ==Allusions== * In the UK television sitcom Only Fools and Horses, Derek Trotter once mockingly called Uncle Albert \\"Captain Birdseye\\", in reference to their similar appearances and Uncle Albert's naval past. * The Goodies parodied the adverts as 'Captain Fishface', ending with a note saying \\"Captain Fishface has your children.

The western unit is located in northwestern Harding, eastern Mora, and southeastern Colfax counties. The smaller eastern unit is located in eastern Union County, on the border with Oklahoma and Texas. The grassland has a total area of . The grassland is administered by the U.S. Forest Service together with the Cibola National Forest and the Black Kettle, McClellan Creek, and Rita Blanca National Grasslands, from common headquarters located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. There are local ranger district offices located in Clayton. ===Communities=== The community of Mills lies within the western unit of the Kiowa National Grassland.

Annual precipitation is about throughout the Grassland with July and August the wettest months and January and February the driest. Semi-arid steppe grassland (shortgrass prairie) is the most common vegetation, covering 79 percent of the Grassland (including the adjacent Rita Blanca National Grassland). Ten percent of the land is covered with Pinyon – Juniper woodland, almost entirely in the western sector. A few stands of Ponderosa Pine are found in the Canadian River Canyon in the western sector. Nine percent of vegetative cover is Sand Sagebrush and one percent is Cottonwood and Willow riparian forest. The Canadian River is the only permanent stream. Playa lakes (shallow lakes which hold rainwater part of the year) are commonly found. The Canadian River Canyon near Mills, New Mexico has been proposed as a Wilderness Area. Nearly all of the land in the Kiowa National Grassland is leased to ranchers for grazing cattle which is the main economic activity in the region. ==Recreation== Pronghorn Antelope, Kiowa National Grasslands ===Eastern Unit=== Twenty-two miles northeast of Clayton is McNees Crossing, a reliable source of water on the Santa Fe Trail. In 1828, two young traders, Robert McNees and Daniel Munro, were killed here by Native Americans. In 1831, the first celebration in New Mexico of Independence Day took place at McNees Crossing. Although on private property, a short trail leads to the crossing of Corrumpa Creek and a historical marker. Seventeen miles north of Clayton is a three-mile section of the Santa Fe Trail which is open for walking and horseback riding. The trail is marked by rock posts. The ruts of wagons that passed this way in the nineteenth century are still present. ===Western Unit=== The rim of the Canadian River Canyon, also called Mills Canyon, is six miles west of the nearly-deserted community of Mills. About of the red-rock, well-vegetated canyon are in the National Grassland. The canyon is deep and more than wide from rim to rim. A primitive campground is on the rim. A road down into the canyon is traversable by foot, horseback, or high-clearance vehicles. On the canyon floor are the ruins of the homestead of Melvin Mills who had an apple orchard and a home here in the early 1900s. The area is rich in wildlife including introduced Barbary Sheep which flourish among the cliffs. The Canadian River has a variety of sport fishes including Largemouth Bass and Channel Catfish. A wilderness area encompassing was proposed in 2008 for the Cimarron River Canyon. The proposal would preserve the pristine state of about eight miles of the canyon.

At , it is the largest grassland in the country. Enclaved within its borders is Theodore Roosevelt National Park, which is managed by the National Park Service (and therefore not included in the preceding statistics). The Little Missouri National Grassland was once a part of the Custer National Forest, but is now a part of the Dakota Prairie Grasslands, a National Forest unit consisting entirely of National Grasslands. A predominant feature of the grassland is colorful and beautiful badlands, a rugged terrain extensively eroded by wind and water. It is a mixed grass prairie, meaning it has both long and short grass. The boundaries of the grasslands on certain maps can be misleading. Within the boundaries of the national grassland are significant portions of state-owned and privately owned land, much of it leased by cattle ranchers for grazing. Overall, in descending order of land area, it is located in parts of McKenzie, Billings, Slope, and Golden Valley counties. Private land intersperses the public grassland acres and there is heavy cattle grazing throughout with 253 allotments in the Medora district and more than 190 allotments in the Mckenzie district. White Butte, North Dakota's highest point, is located in the extreme southeast corner of the grassland, south of the town of Amidon. The grassland is administered by the Forest Service as part of the Dakota Prairie Grasslands from offices in Bismarck, North Dakota. There are local ranger district offices in Dickinson and Watford City. The ongoing oil and gas exploration, extraction, and distribution in the region has the potential for long term negative impacts on the soil, water, vegetation, and wildlife of the grassland, including threatened and endangered species. ==ReferencesDakota Prairie Grasslands - U.S. Forest Service Category:National Grasslands of the United States Category:Protected areas established in 1960 Category:Protected areas of McKenzie County, North Dakota Category:Protected areas of Billings County, North Dakota Category:Protected areas of Slope County, North Dakota Category:Protected areas of Golden Valley County, North Dakota Category:Grasslands of North Dakota ","title":"Little Missouri National Grassland"},{"id":"3260563","text":"The Viti Levu Group is an archipelago in Fiji consisting Viti Levu island and its outliers. ==Geography== The group had an aggregate area of , and a population of 574,801 at the 1996 census.

The Sun News-Pictorial was part of The Herald and Weekly Times stable of Melbourne newspapers. For more than fifty years it was the newspaper with the largest circulation in Australia. ==Character== Along with its extensive coverage of Australian rules football (for example, it was responsible for the competition that produced the original VFL/AFL team songs) The Sun News-Pictorial distinguished itself with its photography, columns and cartoons. Its longest-running column was A Place in the Sun, originally written by Keith Dunstan—founder of the Anti-Football League—and later Graeme \\"Jacko\\" Johnstone. The award-winning cartoonist Jeff Hook became the full-time cartoonist for The Sun News-Pictorial in 1964. ==History== ===Origin=== Keith Murdoch became editor-in-chief of The Herald in January 1921. When the proprietor of the Sydney Sun tried to break into the Melbourne market in 1922 with the launch of The Evening Sun and The Sun News- Pictorial, Murdoch fought a long campaign which eventually resulted in The Herald and Weekly Times (HWT), with the circulation of The Herald up by 50%, taking over the two tabloids in 1925. Murdoch closed the afternoon rival The Evening Sun. In 1928, Murdoch became managing director of the HWT, by which time The Sun News-Pictorial was on its way to becoming Australia's highest- selling newspaper. An early editor, who has been given much of the credit for the paper's success, was Lloyd Dumas. ===Competition=== The Sun News- Pictorial's main competitors were the broadsheets The Argus and The Age. The Argus was a morning daily newspaper in Melbourne, published since 1846 and considered to be the general Australian newspaper of record for this period. Widely known as a conservative newspaper for most of its history, it adopted a left-leaning approach from 1949, and after twenty years of financial losses, closed on 19 January 1957.So now it's Goodbye The Argus 19 January 1957 page 1 The other competitor over the life of the newspaper was the more liberal- minded The Age, a daily newspaper that had been published in Melbourne since 1854. David Syme became sole proprietor of the paper in 1891, and he built it up into Victoria's leading newspaper, soon overtaking its rivals The Herald and The Argus. By 1890 it was selling 100,000 copies a day, making it one of the world's most successful newspapers, but Syme's will prevented the sale of any equity in the paper during his sons' lifetimes, which had the unintended consequence of starving the paper of investment capital for 40 years; The Age was unable to modernise, and gradually lost market share to The Argus and The Sun News-Pictorial, with only its classified advertisement sections keeping the paper profitable. By the 1940s, the paper's circulation was lower than it had been in 1900, and its political influence had also declined to the extent that while it remained more liberal than the extremely conservative Argus, it lost much of its distinct political identity. After David Syme's last surviving son, Oswald Syme, took over the paper, he modernised the paper's appearance and standards of news coverage by removing classified advertisements from the front page and introducing photographs long after other papers had done so. In 1948, realising the paper needed outside capital, Oswald persuaded the courts to overturn his father's will and floated David Syme and Co. as a public company, selling £400,000 worth of shares to enable a badly needed technical upgrade of the newspaper's production. The Sun News- Pictorial became the highest-circulating daily in Australia, and at times the world, outselling its rivals three to one. One very substantial reason for its high level of daily sales was that The Sun News-Pictorial offered a free life- insurance policy to each of those who subscribed for regular daily home delivery of the newspaper (i.e., rather than those who bought it spasmodically from street vendors or newsagents), and the insurance policy (valued at somewhere near 12 months' average wages) was current for the duration of that household's subscription.Message to Argus readers from The Sun News-Pictorial The Argus, final edition, 19 January 1957 at Trove ===1990 merger=== The Sun News-Pictorial ceased publication on 6 October 1990 and merged with sister evening newspaper The Herald to form the Herald Sun, which contained columns and features from both of its predecessors.Survivors, only to be swallowed up by their own Canberra Times 4 October 1990 page 2Sydney's Top Papers Unite Daily Telegraph 4 October 1990 page 1About Us Herald Sun Sunday ==Notable journalists, columnists, cartoonists and editors== * Jeff Hook * Keith Dunstan == See also == * List of newspapers in Australia ==References== ==External links== * Category:Publications established in 1922 Category:Publications disestablished in 1990 Category:Defunct newspapers published in Melbourne Category:1922 establishments in Australia Category:Daily newspapers published in Australia Category:1990 disestablishments in Australia ","title":"The Sun News-Pictorial"},{"id":"3260581","text":"Fusor is a proposed term for an astronomical object which is capable of core fusion.

Carlo Ridolfi (1594–1658) was an Italian art biographer and painter of the Baroque period. ==Biography== Ridolfi was born in Lonigo near Vicenza. He was a pupil of the painter Antonio Vassilacchi (Aliense). He painted a Visitation for the Ognissanti and an Adoration of the Magi for San Giovanni Elemosinario in Venice. He copied Tintoretto's Christ Washing the Disciples' Feet in San Marcuola, before it came to the collection of King Charles I of England. Ridolfi's copy still remains in San Marcuola. He was certainly best known, in his own day and ever since, as an author on art. Carlo Ridolfi was also an important collector of drawings, such as Giorgio Vasari. Many of these drawings are conserved in the Christ Church Library (Oxford). Carlo Ridolfi, Sacra Famiglia. Ridolfi wrote a biography of the Venetian painters in 1648 titled Le maraviglie dell'Arte ovvero, Le vite degli Illustri Pittori Veneti e dello Stato. He also wrote La vita di Giacopo Robusti (a biography of Tintoretto) in 1642. He was awarded the knighthood of the Golden Cross by Pope Innocent X and a chain of gold and a medal of St. Mark by the Republic of Venice, essentially for his books rather than his painting. Subsequent Venetian chroniclers who have quoted Ridolfi include Marco Boschini, Antonio Maria Zanetti, and Luigi Lanzi. As Vasari's Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects was weaker on Venetian painters than Florentine ones, Ridolfi remains an important source for Venetian painting between the beginning of the Renaissance and his own day, although his accuracy is often doubted, and many of his numerous attributions, especially to Giorgione, are no longer accepted: according to Michael Hirst, \\"... the enormous number of paintings attributed to Giorgione by Ridolfi gravely weakens his authority\\".Michael Hirst in Jane Martineau (ed), The Genius of Venice, 1500-1600, p. 210, 1983, Royal Academy of Arts, London. One purpose of his work was to supply a corrective to Vasari, and just as Vasari ascribes all progress in art to Florentines, Ridolfi attempts something similar for the Venetian tradition, with its closer connection to Byzantine art. He was well educated in the classics, and his style is much given to rhetorical flourishes, classical comparisons and references to poetry, whilst rather lacking Vasari's talent for telling anecdote. He approached the larger lives in a scholarly fashion, and quoted many documents, often now vanished, that remain invaluable to art historians. His work gives great insight into the way art was seen in his own day, as well as during the lives of his subjects.Jody Ribin Shifman, Introduction to The Life of Titian by Carlo Ridolfi, trans Peter and Julia Conaway Bondanella, 1996, Penn State Press, - also Translators Note He died at Venice in 1658. ==Works== * Le maraviglie dell'arte: ovvero Le vite degli illustri pittori Veneti e dello Stato ..., Volume 1, By Carlo Ridolfi, Giuseppe Vedova, Second edition with corrections, Tipografia Cartellier, Padua, 1835. 1648 Edition. * Vita di Giacopo Robusti (Tintoretto), 1642 (no preview). ==References== ==Sources== * * ==External links== *portrait and notes from the Metropolitan Category:1594 births Category:1658 deaths Category:People from Vicenza Category:17th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:Venetian painters Category:Italian art historians Category:Italian Baroque painters Category:Artist authors ","title":"Carlo Ridolfi"},{"id":"3260590","text":"The large-headed capuchin (Sapajus macrocephalus) is a species of robust capuchin monkey from South America.

Tennyson consists of a strip of land on the east coast of Gulf St Vincent extending from a beach with a frontage of sand dunes in the west for a distance of about to the west side of the artificial lake known as West Lakes in the east. It borders West Lakes for the full length of the part of the lake where a rowing course is located. Its northern boundary is located just north of Estcourt Road while it is bounded in the south by Fort Street. Tennyson’s boundaries were created on 30 September 1976 for land which includes the Town of Tennyson at its southern end. On 20 April 2006, the suburb’s northern boundary was altered to include land from the adjoining suburb of West Lakes Shore so that suburb boundaries aligned with those of land parcels. The suburb’s name is derived from the Town of Tennyson and ultimately from Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson who was the Governor of South Australia from 1899 to 1902 and who was the Governor-General of Australia from 1903 to 1904. Tennyson Post Office opened on 18 September 1962 and closed in 1972. Estcourt House, the former home of Frederick Estcourt Bucknall which is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register is located at the northern end of the suburb. The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that Tennyson had 1,166 people living within its boundaries. Tennyson is located in the federal division of Hindmarsh, the state electoral district of Lee and the local government area of the City of Charles Sturt. ==Town of Tennyson== The Town of Tennyson was gazetted on 5 January 1905. It originally consisted of crown land on the west side of Military Road which was resumed on 30 November 1893 from an existing lease over section 108 of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Yatala in order to eliminate damage to the sandhills caused by the grazing of cattle and the subsequent cost of keep the road clear of sand shifting from the sandhills. The town was originally surveyed in 1902 and then surveyed again in 1904 to create a revised sub-division design before allotments of land were offered for sale on 16 February 1905. The town was extended by proclamation on 25 January 1940 and again on 17 August 1950. On 7 October 1982, its extent was \\"diminished\\" by the removal of land. The town still exists as an administrative area and since 1982, it has consisted of land bounded by Hallam Terrace in the North, the east side of Military Road in the east, Fort Street in the south and the eastern side of the Tennyson Foreshore Reserve in the west which is considered to the \\"High Water Mark\\" by the 1982 proclamation. ==See also== *Tennyson Dunes Conservation Reserve ==References== Category:Suburbs of Adelaide ","title":"Tennyson, South Australia"},{"id":"3260624","text":"Lyndon B.

The pioneers in this field were Sri Lanka and Chile. == Background == A rational drug policy is one based on drug use in which patients receive medications appropriate to their clinical needs, in doses that meet their own individual requirements, for an adequate period of time, and at the lowest cost to them and their community. Pharmaceutical companies make considerable money by selling drugs under their trade names, promoting the branded drugs as against those named generically. Doctors often prescribe branded drugs which are more expensive than generic drugs which have the same efficacy. In the 1960s and 1970s Chile attempted to introduce a rational policy, based on a limited number of essential drugs. The Chilean pharmaceutical policy failed due to pressure from the pharmaceutical industry. In the 1970s Sri Lanka demonstrated that a state buying agency linked to a national formulary was a viable and powerful instrument for reducing drug costs without compromising quality, for saving foreign exchange, for rationalising drug usage and for supplying essential drugs at reasonable prices to the whole community. This was made possible by the formulation and implementation of an integrated national pharmaceutical policy. The Sri Lanka experience became a model for the rest of the world by Prof. Seneka Bibile === Causes of irrational drug use === *Irrational prescribing practices of doctors *Dispensing by pharmacists and drug sellers *Drug pricing policies and promotional activities of the pharmaceutical industry *Lack of information, education and communication on rational drug use to providers and consumers *Lack of effective control and regulatory mechanisms on drug use and *Lack of political will and leadership to promote rational use. == Centralised buying agency == Under an integrated national pharmaceutical policy, the central buying agency channels all imports and production of pharmaceuticals, calling for worldwide bulk tenders which are limited to the approved drugs listed in the national formulary. The public and private health sectors must obtain all their requirements from the central buying agency. In Chile in 1971, the government of Dr Salvador Allende organised centralised bulk procurement and the first international tender for raw materials was called. However, the pharmaceutical industry struck back and, in the three months following the call for tender, widely used drugs disappeared from the market, including analgesics and antibiotics. The manufacturers had cut their production. They agreed to replenish the market within one week only if the international tenders were called off. In 1972, the government was forced to succumb and called off the tenders. In Sri Lanka the Sri Lanka State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) was established in 1972 with Bibile as Chairman. Hence the stranglehold of the multinational corporations on the drug trade was successfully broken and they were made to compete with each other and with generic drug producers, enabling the country to obtain drugs much cheaper. Branded drugs were replaced by generic drugs in the prescription and sale of medicines. In 1972 it imported 52 drugs at a third of their previous prices. In 1973, the SPC itself bought the raw material necessary for 14 private processing laboratories established in the island. Some drug prices dropped by half or two-thirds. The SPC bought from an Indian company the raw material necessary for a widely used tranquilliser at a much lower price than that charged by a Swiss multinational.jh == Drug information == It is essential that correct information drugs and therapeutics be given to all medical personnel. The promotional material provided by the drugs manufacturers tends to be distorted in favour of their own products and adds to the costs of supplying drugs. In Sri Lanka, drug information was provided from official sources. The Prescriber, a quarterly publication edited by the NFC, was published by the SPC and distributed to all medical personnel. The extravagant promotional practices of drugs manufacturers were stopped to remove the dangers and costs inherent in process. == International experience == The Sri Lankan policy was supported by World Health Organization (WHO) and other United Nations agencies with enormous benefit to Third World countries. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development Secretariat examined the Sri Lankan experience, concluding that an analysis of the Sri Lankan model could give other developing countries an insight into ways of formulating, developing and implementing integrated national pharmaceutical policies. With Bibile's assistance, it published \\"Case Studies in the Transfer of Technology: Pharmaceutical Policies in Sri Lanka\\". This document has proved to be a very valuable guideline for developing countries intending to initiate pharmaceutical reforms. Translated into other languages, it may be found with health planners of almost every Third World country. The \\"Guide to Good Prescribing\\" has been translated into 18 languages and adopted by teaching institutions throughout the world. The WHO took Sri Lanka's experience to the rest of the World, with the result that by 2000: *over 100 countries had national pharmaceuticals policies, *156 countries had national or provincial essential medicines lists *135 countries had national treatment guidelines/formulary manuals *88 countries had introduced the essential drug concept into medical and pharmacy curricula. Bangladesh is a least developed country which has confirmed and reiterated that it is within the capabilities countries with limited resources to successfully introduce an integrated national pharmaceutical policy. The Chilean experience showed the power of the pharmaceuticals giants. The successful implementation of pharmaceutical reforms in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh was due to the presence of the vital ingredient of political will with which real progress is possible. == See also == * International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use *pharmaceutical policy *Chilean pharmaceutical policy *Medicare Part D *Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act *National Medicinal Drugs Policy *Pharmaceutical company *Prescription drug prices in the United States *Seneka Bibile *Sri Lanka National Pharmaceuticals Policy *State Pharmaceuticals Corporation of Sri Lanka *National Drug Code System == References == *Dr. K Balasubramaniam, 'The neglected solution', Daily News, 30 September 2002. *Dr. K.

The underlying theory describes the optimal characteristics for the merger of currencies or the creation of a new currency. The theory is used often to argue whether or not a certain region is ready to become a currency union, one of the final stages in economic integration. An optimal currency area is often larger than a country. For instance, part of the rationale behind the creation of the euro is that the individual countries of Europe do not each form an optimal currency area, but that Europe as a whole does. The creation of the euro is often cited because it provides the most modern and largest-scale case study of an attempt to identify an optimum currency area, and provides a comparative before-and- after model by which to test the principles of the theory. In theory, an optimal currency area could also be smaller than a country. Some economists have argued that the United States, for example, has some regions that do not fit into an optimal currency area with the rest of the country. The theory of the optimal currency area was pioneered in the 1960s by economist Robert Mundell. Credit often goes to Mundell as the originator of the idea, but others point to earlier work done in the area by Abba Lerner. Kenen (1969) and McKinnon (1963) were further developers of this idea. ==Models== ===Optimum currency area with stationary expectations=== Published by Mundell in 1961, this is the most cited by economists. Here asymmetric shocks are considered to undermine the real economy, so if they are too important and cannot be controlled, a regime with floating exchange rates is considered better, because the global monetary policy (interest rates) will not be fine tuned for the particular situation of each constituent region. The four often cited criteria for a successful currency union are: * Labor mobility across the region. What if we suppose instead that Home and Foreign have an integrated labor market, so that labor is free to move between them: What effect will this have on the decision to form an optimum currency area? This includes physical ability to travel (visas, workers' rights, etc.), lack of cultural barriers to free movement (such as different languages) and institutional arrangements (such as the ability to have pensions transferred throughout the region). For example, suppose Home and Foreign initially have equal output and unemployment. Suppose further that a negative shock hits Home, but not Foreign. If output falls and unemployment rises in Home, then labor will start to migrate to Foreign, where unemployment is lower. If this migration can occur with ease, the impact of the negative shock on Home will be less painful. Furthermore, there will be less need for Home to implement an independent monetary policy response for stabilization purposes. With an excess supply of labor in one region, adjustment can occur through migration. * Openness with capital mobility and price and wage flexibility across the region. This is so that the market forces of supply and demand automatically distribute money and goods to where they are needed. In practice this does not work perfectly as there is no true wage flexibility. The Eurozone members trade heavily with each other (intra-European trade is greater than international trade), and early (2006) empirical analyses of the 'euro effect' suggested that the single currency had already increased trade by 5 to 15 percent in the euro-zone when compared to trade between non-euro countries. * A risk sharing system such as an automatic fiscal transfer mechanism to redistribute money to areas/sectors which have been adversely affected by the first two characteristics. This usually takes the form of taxation redistribution to less developed areas of a country/region. This policy, though theoretically accepted, is politically difficult to implement as the better-off regions rarely give up their revenue easily. Theoretically, Europe has a no-bailout clause in the Stability and Growth Pact, meaning that fiscal transfers are not allowed. During the 2010 Eurozone crisis (relating to government debt), the no-bailout clause was de facto abandoned in April 2010. Subsequent theoretical analysis suggests that this was always an unrealistic expectation.The Trilemma of a Monetary Union: Another Impossible Trinity Hanno Beck, Aloys Prinz, Intereconomics Review of European Economic Policy, Volume 47, January/February 2012, Number 1 · pp. 39-43. \\"A monetary union among autonomous countries cannot simultaneously maintain an independent monetary policy, national fiscal sovereignty and a no-bailout clause. These three features make up an impossible trinity, and attempts to preserve all three concurrently will ultimately end in failure. In order to save EMU, one of these three must be abandoned.\\" * Participant countries have similar business cycles. When one country experiences a boom or recession, other countries in the union are likely to follow. This allows the shared central bank to promote growth in downturns and to contain inflation in booms. Should countries in a currency union have idiosyncratic business cycles, then optimal monetary policy may diverge and union participants may be made worse off under a joint central bank. Additional criteria suggested are: * Production diversification (Peter Kenen) * Homogeneous preferences * Commonality of destiny (\\"Solidarity\\") ===Optimum currency area with international risk sharing=== Here Mundell tries to model how exchange rate uncertainty will interfere with the economy; this model is less often cited. Supposing that the currency is managed properly, the larger the area, the better. In contrast with the previous model, asymmetric shocks are not considered to undermine the common currency because of the existence of the common currency. This spreads the shocks in the area because all regions share claims on each other in the same currency and can use them for dampening the shock, while in a flexible exchange rate regime, the cost will be concentrated on the individual regions, since the devaluation will reduce its buying power. So despite a less fine tuned monetary policy the real economy should do better. Mundell's work can be cited on both sides of the debate about the euro. However, in 1973 Mundell himself constructed an argument on the basis of the second model that was more favorable to the concept of a (then-hypothetical) shared European currency. ==Applications== ===European Union=== OCA theory has been most frequently applied to discussions of the euro and the European Union.Irena Vrnáková & Hana Bartušková, 2013. \\"Is Euro Area an Optimal Currency Area and What Barriers Could Obstruct Its Future Development?,\\" ACTA VSFS, University of Finance and Administration, vol. 7(2), pages 123-144. Many have argued that the EU did not actually meet the criteria for an OCA at the time the euro was adopted, and attribute the Eurozone's economic difficulties in part to continued failure to do so. Europe does indeed score well on some of the measures characterising an OCA (such as symmetry of shocks). By looking at the correlation of a region's GDP growth rate with that of the entire zone, the Eurozone countries show slightly greater correlations compared to the U.S. states. However, it has lower labour mobility than the United States, possibly due to language and cultural differences. In O'Rourke's paper, more than 40% of U.S. residents were born outside the state in which they live. In the Eurozone, only 14% people were born in a different country than the one in which they live. In fact, the U.S. economy was approaching a single labor market in the nineteenth century. However, for most parts of the Eurozone, such levels of labour mobility and labor market integration remain a distant prospect. Furthermore, the U.S. economy, with a central federal fiscal authority, has stabilization transfers. When a state in the U.S. is in recession, every $1 drop in that state’s GDP would have an offsetting transfer of 28 cents. Such stabilizing transfers are not present in both the Eurozone and EU; thus, they cannot rely on fiscal federalism to smooth out regional economic disturbances. The European crisis, however, may be pushing the EU towards more federal powers in fiscal policy. ===United States=== Michael Kouparitsas (Chicago Fed) considered the United States as divided into the eight regions of the Bureau of Economic Analysis, (Far West, Rocky Mountain, Plains, Great Lakes, Mideast, New England, Southwest, and Southeast). By developing a statistical model, he found that five of the eight regions of the country satisfied Mundell's criteria to form a single Optimal Currency Area. However, he found the fit of the Southeast and Southwest to be questionable. He also found that the Plains would not fit into an optimal currency area. ==Criticism== ===Keynesian=== The notion of a currency that does not accord with a state, specifically one larger than a state – formally, of an international monetary authority without a corresponding fiscal authority – has been criticized by Keynesian and Post-Keynesian economists, who emphasize the role of deficit spending by a government (formally, fiscal authority) in the running of an economy, and consider using an international currency without fiscal authority to be a loss of \\"monetary sovereignty\\". Specifically, Keynesian economists argue that fiscal stimulus in the form of deficit spending is the most powerful method of fighting unemployment during a liquidity trap. Such stimulus may not be possible if states in a monetary union are not allowed to run sufficient deficits. The Post-Keynesian theory of Neo-Chartalism holds that government deficit spending creates money, that ability to print money is fundamental to a state's ability to command resources, and that \\"money and monetary policy are intricately linked to political sovereignty and fiscal authority\\". Pdf. :See also: Both of these critiques consider the transactional benefits of a shared currency to be minor compared to these drawbacks, and more generally place less emphasis on the transactional function of money (a medium of exchange) and greater emphasis on its use as a unit of account. ===Self-fulfilling argument=== In Mundell’s first model, countries regard all of the conditions as given, and assuming they have adequate information, they can then judge whether the costs of forming a currency union outweigh the benefits. However, another school of thought argues that some of the OCA criteria are not given and fixed, but rather they are economic outcomes (i.e., endogenous) determined by the creation of the currency union itself. Consider goods market interaction as an example: if the OCA criteria were applied before the currency union forms, then many countries might exhibit low trade volumes and low market integration; which means that OCA criteria are not met. Thus, the currency union might not be formed based on those current characteristics. However, if the currency union was established anyway, its member-states would trade so much more that, in the end, the OCA criteria would be met. This logic suggests that the OCA criteria can be self-fulfilling. Furthermore, greater integration under the OCA project might also improve other OCA criteria. For example, if goods markets are better connected, shocks will be more rapidly transmitted within the OCA and will be felt more symmetrically. However, caution should be employed when analysing the self-fulfilling argument. Firstly, the self- fulfilling effect's impact may not be significant. According to a recent study by Richard Baldwin, a trade economist at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva, the boost to trade within the Eurozone from the single currency is much smaller: between 5% and 15%, with a best estimate of 9%. The second counter-argument is that further goods market integration might also lead to more specialization in production. Once individual firms can easily serve the whole OCA market, and not just their national market, they will exploit economies of scale and concentrate production. Some sectors in the OCA might end up becoming concentrated in a few locations. The United States is a good example: financial services are centered in New York City, entertainment in Los Angeles, and technology in Silicon Valley. If specialization increases, each country will be less diversified and will face more asymmetric shocks; weakening the case for the self-fulfilling OCA argument.Feenstra, Robert C., and Alan M.

At the , Sandy Point had a population of 270, growing to several thousand during the holiday period. It is surrounded by areas of significant natural heritage. Sandy Point is one of the few coastal towns in this region to remain relatively unaffected by the housing boom along the coast. This is partly due to its distance from Melbourne (around 2 hours) and the fact that a lack of town sewerage has meant a ban on further sub-division. ==History== The Bratowooloong people of the Gunai nation lived in the area before European settlement. The first Europeans to visit the area were three shipwrecked sailors in 1797. Irish convicts escaped south from Sydney and landed on Seal Island where several men were stranded and found by George Bass who put them ashore near Shallow Inlet to walk back to Sydney. No more was ever heard of them. Sealers and whalers visited the area in the first half of the nineteenth century. However, it wasn't until the 1860s that the area was settled by cattle farmers. The arrival of the Gippsland Railway improved the viability of local farms and made dairy farming in the area. The Post Office opened on 2 September 1926, and was closed in 1994. The development of the town as a tourist location started in earnest in the 1960s but has been restricted by its natural heritage values. ==Surrounding areas== The Sandy Point area has a large spit system and its shoreline, on Waratah Bay, is considered of high heritage value. Sandy Point's surf beach is patrolled during the summer months and is considered good for surfing. The beach on Waratah Bay is long, running between Walkerville at its northwestern end and Wilsons Promontory at its southeastern end. 3 kilometres east of Sandy Point lies a river inlet known as Shallow Inlet. This sandy, tidal inlet is a popular fishing spot and a popular area for windsurfing and kitesurfing. Speed sailing records have been set here on several occasions, including Macquarie’s Innovation, which in 2009 broke the 50 knot speed barrier here.Speed sailing record A summer storm rolls in over Waratah Bay, Sandy Point ==Natural habitats== The area near Sandy Point contains a diverse range of habitats including mangroves, extensive stands of coastal heathland as well as remnant coastal grassy forest.

He previously was elected for one term in the state legislature. He was an iron worker. Shakspeare ==Early life and political career== Shakspeare was born in New Orleans in 1837, the son of Samuel Shakspeare, a Quaker from Delaware, and his wife Mariane Mathias, a Swiss immigrant. He studied iron design in New York City and later returned to New Orleans to run an ironworks started by his father. Shakspeare later entered politics, serving one term in the state legislature. In 1863 he married Antoinette Kroos, a German immigrant. The couple had five children. In the municipal election of 1880, Shakspeare accepted the mayoral nomination of a coalition of reformers determined to take power from the Ring, a scandal- plagued local Democratic political machine. Shakspeare defeated Jules Denis, the Ring candidate, by 9803 votes to 9362. For several days, outgoing Ring Mayor Isaac W. Patton refused to recognize the results. He would not give up City Hall until he was ordered to by a judge. ==First Shakspeare administration, 1880-1882== Shakspeare's first two-year term as mayor was a difficult one. He was the only reformer elected, so he faced unending hostility from the seven-member City Council and administrative board, both still controlled by the Ring. Still, Shakspeare was able to overhaul the city's disorganized budget and managed to reschedule the crippling municipal debts left over from the Civil War and Reconstruction. He increased the city's revenue by selling the Carrollton Street Railroad franchise and by devising the Shakspeare Plan: illegal gambling operations could operate, as long as they made regular payments to the city treasury. He attempted to reform the fire and police departments, by removing them as destinations for job seekers for political patronage but was thwarted by City Council. The city enacted a new municipal charter to replace the Reconstruction-era charter. His new charter created a new thirty-member City Council with legislative power and increased the mayor’s term of office from two years to four. His administration also commissioned construction of a monument to Confederate General Robert E. Lee. (This was installed in Lee Circle but has been moved). It also authorized the creation of a monument commemorating the Battle of Liberty Place of 1874, in which the white supremacist White League attempted to overthrow the Reconstruction-era Republican state government because of a disputed gubernatorial election. Shakspeare did not run for re-election in 1882. He was followed in office by William J. Behan, the Ring candidate. ==Second Shakspeare administration, 1888-1892== In the municipal election of 1888, Shakspeare ran again as a reform candidate opposing the Ring. As before, he was supported by members of the conservative Bourbon business elite. He defeated the Ring candidate, Judge Robert C. Davey, by 23,313 votes to 15,635. The election was characterized by the presence at polling places of armed bands of men from both the reform and Ring camps, who attempted intimidation. Under the rules of the new charter, the mayoral term had been made to last four years. Shakspeare's second term was characterized by renewed street improvements, the introduction of electric street lights and street cars, and a further improvement of the city’s debt situation. His administration began construction of a new courthouse and jail complex on Tulane Avenue. He also created a professional fire department to replace the existing volunteer fire departments, which had been active in municipal machine politics. However, his efforts to use the police department as a source of political patronage alienated some of his reform-oriented supporters. Shakspeare appointed David Hennessy as chief of police. Hennessy's assassination in October 1890, allegedly by members of the Sicilian Mafia, sparked anti-Italian feeling. When numerous Italian suspects were acquitted at trial and others given a mistrial, a mob stormed the parish prison and murdered 11 of the 19 Italian suspects in what is known as the March 14, 1891 lynchings. The event was well organized by a small group, although a mob of thousands gathered outside the prison. The mass lynchings created an international diplomatic incident: the Italian consul to New Orleans and the Italian ambassador to the US at Washington, DC were both recalled by the Italian government, and for a time war seemed possible. Shakspeare's public hostility to Italian Americans after the murder, and the lynching which took place on his watch, and which he did nothing to prevent, tarnished his reputation. Shakspeare ran for a third term in 1892, but was defeated by Ring candidate John Fitzpatrick, a popular politician with strong pro-labor credentials, who also benefitted from the Italian-American vote.

It is the main part of Dubai South, a planned residential, commercial and logistics complex. When fully completed (expected 2027), the airport will contain transport modes, logistics and value-added services, including manufacturing and assembly, in a single free economic zone. It will cover an area of . The airport has a projected annual capacity of of freight and between 160 million and 260 million passengers. As of May 2019, only a handful of airlines operate passenger services out of Al Maktoum International Airport. ==History== === Construction === The runway was completed in 600 days and subsequently underwent tests over the following six to eight months in order to fulfil its CAT III-C requirements. Construction of the airport's cargo terminal, the Al Maktoum Airport Cargo Gateway, which cost around US$75 million, was 50% complete by the end of 2008. During the first phase of the project, the airport is planned to handle around of cargo per year, with the possibility of increasing to . The passenger terminal at this phase is designed to have a capacity of 5 million passengers per year. It was planned to be the largest airport in the world in terms of freight handled, moving up to per year in 2013.Staff Writer (2008, January 7) Arabianbusiness.com Dubai Cargo Village announces major restructure The project was originally expected to be fully operational by 2017, although the 2007–2012 global financial crisis subsequently postponed the completion of the complex to 2027. Previous working names for the airport complex have included \\"Jebel Ali International Airport\\", \\"Jebel Ali Airport City\\", and \\"Dubai World Central International Airport\\". It has been named after the late Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the former Ruler of Dubai. The total cost of the airport has been estimated by the Dubai government to be $82 billion. ===Operations=== Al Maktoum International Airport opened on 27 June 2010 with one runway and only cargo flights. The first flight into the airport occurred on 20 June 2010, when an Emirates SkyCargo Boeing 777F landed after a flight from Hong Kong. The flight served as a test for various functions such as air traffic control, movement of aircraft on the ground, and security. According to Emirates, the flight was an \\"unmitigated success\\". On 24 February 2011, the airport was certified to handle passenger aircraft with up to 60 passengers. The first passenger aircraft touched down on 28 February 2011, an Airbus A319CJ. The airport officially opened for passenger flights on 26 October 2013 with Nas Air and Wizz Air as the two carriers to operate from the airport. In the first quarter of 2014, 102,000 passengers went through the airport. At the time of its opening, three cargo service airlines served Al Maktoum International Airport, including RUS Aviation, Skyline Air and Aerospace Consortium. Fifteen additional airlines have signed a contract to operate flights to the airport. Passenger numbers in the first half of 2016 totalled 410,278, up from 209,989 in the first half of 2015. ==Facilities== The airport will be the largest component of Dubai World Central, with a surface area of more than . If completed as planned, the airport will have an annual cargo capacity of , and a passenger capacity of 160 to 260 million people per year. In the future it will handle around 700 million passengers This would make it the largest airport in the world in both physical size and passenger volume.Zeidan, Ghaleb (2009, November 9) pr2live.com Dubai Aviation City Corporation Executive Chairman outlines Dubai's strategic focus on transport and logistics at SITL Dubai 2009 Al Maktoum International Airport intends to handle all types of aircraft. Up to four aircraft will be able to land simultaneously. The airport will include: * Three passenger terminals, including two luxury facilities; one dedicated to Emirates, the second to other carriers, and the third dedicated to low-cost carriers * Multiple concourses * Executive and royal jet centres * Hotels and shopping malls * Support and maintenance facilities: the region's only hub for A-, B-, and C-checks on all aircraft up to A380 specifications Al Maktoum International Airport will be linked to the existing Dubai International Airport by a proposed high-speed express rail system, and served by the Dubai Metro and a dedicated Dubai World Central light railway. The airport was initially planned to have six runways, but this number was reduced to five parallel runways in April 2009, with a large passenger complex in the middle. Furthermore, each runway would have extended asphalted pathways on either side which would allow aircraft to by-pass other runways and taxiways without disturbing aircraft movements of these runways and taxiways. Dubai expects an exponential rise in passenger traffic over its skies, with the presumption that it will become the primary air hub for transiting travelers from the Asia–Pacific Region, South Asia, Greater Middle East, Africa, Europe, and Australia (for the Kangaroo route: Australia to Britain and back). Several large warehouses and hangars line the westernmost part of the airport. These interlinked hangars will stretch from end-to-end of the westernmost runway. Each of these is capable of housing A380 aircraft. The airport will complement Dubai International Airport, some away. It is surrounded by a logistics hub, a luxurious golf resort, a trade and exhibition facility with 3 million square metres of exhibition space, a commercial district, and a residential and hotel area.Press Release (2007, Nov 11) Dubai World Central Dubai World Central Aviation City Master Plan Launched Al Maktoum International Airport will have a total of 100,000 parking slots for automobile vehicles for its employees, Dubai residents, tourists, and other users. ==Airlines and destinations== ===Passenger=== ===Cargo=== == References == == External links == * Official website Category:Proposed buildings and structures in Dubai Category:Airports in the United Arab Emirates Category:Government-owned companies of the United Arab Emirates Category:Transport in Dubai ","title":"Al Maktoum International Airport"},{"id":"3260711","text":"Midnight Rescue! is an educational and entertainment hybrid computer game created by The Learning Company in 1989 for Windows and Macintosh PCs. The program is designed to help strengthen the reading and critical thinking skills of children grades three to five. Midnight Rescue is a side-scrolling adventure game whose objective is to prevent a school from disappearing by midnight by deducing Morty Maxwell's hiding place. To do this, the player must roam the halls of Shady Glen School and piece together clues received by reading articles and correctly answering questions about them. The game contains a plethora of articles ranging from fictional character diary entries to excerpts from famous works of literature. The game is part of several of the Learning Company's later releases including their \\"Super Solvers Super Learning Collection\\" and \\"Super Solvers Reading Ages 9–12\\". In 1995, the game was re-released on CD-ROM. ==Gameplay== spray paint. Midnight Rescue! is a side-scrolling educational game whose objective is to stop Morty Maxwell (also known as the Master of Mischief), a common antagonist of The Learning Company's Super Solvers series and Treasure series, from using his robots to paint the school invisible by midnight. To do this, the player must deduce which of the robots he is hiding in by comparing photographs taken of robots to clues obtained by reading passages left around the school and answering questions about them within nine minutes. During the course of the game, the player will be attacked by Morty's robot henchmen (Buffo, Lectro, Pogo, Rollo, and Turbo), who take the forms of types of paintbrushes. When they appear they will either attempt to crash into the player or launch projectiles like marbles or pies at him. This will cause the player to lose either time (45 seconds) or film (one per crash). If the player uses his camera to take a picture of the robot before this happens, however, the robot will run away and the player will learn characteristics about that robot. These photos hold information that can be used to identify the robot that Morty is hiding in. When the player has all four clues and photographs of each robot, he must decide which robot he thinks the Master of Mischief is hiding in. The player must compare the clues gathered from answered questions to photographs that reveal characteristics about the robots. If the player correctly guesses the robot the Master of Mischief is in, he gets a bonus score based on film and time remaining. This will be added to the total lifetime score. If the player guesses incorrectly or fails to gather enough information by midnight, one of the robots will cover the player with invisible paint and the player loses the game. Losing a game does not affect the lifetime score. Each time the player completes the game, his lifetime score increases (although in the 1995 version, the player receives the points they earned if they guess wrong). At certain score amounts, the player will advance a rank and the game becomes more difficult. At higher ranks, more photographs are required of each robot, the robots move faster, some of the articles posted around the school do not contain clues, and the readings become more difficult. ==Development== ===Super Solvers series=== The Super Solvers series are computer games released by The Learning Company that have educational and entertainment qualities. Midnight Rescue! is the first program of the series to be released. Other programs in this series include OutNumbered!, Spellbound!, and Gizmos and Gadgets! among others. Midnight Rescue! contains over 200 reading sections that consist of character written letters and diary entries as well as excerpts from famous novels. There are over 400 possible questions for these reading sections, meaning that a passage will not always have the same question at the end. To help build vocabulary, Midnight Rescue! provides definitions and, in many cases, pronunciations of over 500 words. By making the player choose the correct robot, the game also helps build deductive reasoning skills. ===Music=== In lieu of original scores, Midnight Rescue! plays famous classical compositions in the background during gameplay. The music heard at the beginning of the game and in the hallways of the school is The Sorcerer's Apprentice by Paul Dukas. The music heard inside rooms is \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\" by Edvard Grieg from Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt. ===Later versions=== In 1995, a more Windows-friendly version with slightly enhanced graphics and sound was released on CD-ROM. Midnight Rescue! was later released under the name \\"Super Solvers Super Learning Collection!\\" with both OutNumbered! and Spellbound! in one of the first bundle packages ever released. Later, it was merged with Spellbound! and released under the name \\"Super Solvers Reading Ages 9–12\\". ==Reception== Midnight Rescue! was one of the first successful combinations of educational and entertaining games. It has received lukewarm to positive reviews. Users at Abandonia gave it a rating of four out of five, saying that \\"while the 'action' stopped for the educational parts, many of the stories relate to the game (being played), so it never felt like (the game was left).\\" A review at Home of the Underdogs gave Midnight Rescue! two thumbs up and their Top Dog Award due to the strength of its ability to teach and entertain at the same time. ==References== ==External links== * *Midnight Rescue! at Abandonia * *The Learning Company Official Site Category:1989 video games Category:Children's educational video games Category:DOS games Category:Mac OS games Category:North America-exclusive video games Category:Windows games Category:The Learning Company games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Midnight Rescue!"},{"id":"3260714","text":"Dungog railway station is located on the North Coast line in New South Wales, Australia.

Rodriguez previously served as the head football coach at Salem University (1988), Glenville State College (1990–1996), West Virginia University (2001–2007), the University of Michigan (2008–2010), and the University of Arizona (2012–2017). His career college football coaching record stands at 163–118–2. In 2011, Rodriguez worked as an analyst for CBS Sports. ==Playing career== A native of Grant Town, West Virginia, Rodriguez graduated from North Marion High School in 1981 where he played four sports and was an all-state football and basketball player. After high school, Rodriguez attended West Virginia University. Playing as a defensive back, he recorded 54 career tackles over three seasons. ==Coaching career== ===Starting out in coaching (West Virginia and Salem)=== During the 1985 season, Rodriguez served as a student assistant under head coach Don Nehlen and graduated with a Physical Education degree. In 1986, he was hired by Salem College (now Salem International University) where he served as special teams coordinator and secondary coach. In 1987, he became Salem’s defensive coordinator and in 1988 took over as head coach. At 25 years old, he was the youngest college head coach in the country. He was 2–8 in his first season as head coach, after which the college announced it was dropping its football program. In 1989, he returned to West Virginia University as a volunteer assistant. ===Glenville State, Tulane, and Clemson=== After Rodriguez's return to WVU as a volunteer coach with the outside linebackers for the 1989 football season, he left again to take over as head coach at Glenville State College. During his stay from 1990 to 1996, the team earned three consecutive West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference championships and competed in the 1993 NAIA national championship. His first season, 1990, he led the team to a 1–7-–record. In 1991, Glenville improved to 4–5–1. 1992 showed a 6–4 season; however in 1993, Rodriguez led Glenville to a 10–3 record and the WVIAC Championship and NAIA runner-up. The next two years, 1994 and 1995, Glenville finished as WVIAC Co-Champions. In Rodriguez's final season at Glenville, 1996, he led them to a Co-Championship once again. While at Glenville, Rodriguez compiled a record of 43–28–2 and was named WVIAC Coach of the Year in 1993 and 1994, NAIA National Coach of the Year in 1993, and West Virginia State College Coach of the Year in 1993 by the West Virginia Sports Writers Association. Glenville State's four championships under Rodriguez were their first since 1959 while his players' set five national career records for Division II. He also coached three players who earned WVIAC Player of the Year honors. Rodriguez left Glenville State at the end of the 1996 season to serve as assistant coach, offensive coordinator, and quarterback coach for Tulane University from 1997 to 1998, under head coach Tommy Bowden. Rodriguez knew Bowden's father, Bobby Bowden, because he had worked at his camps during summers. In Rodriguez's first year as offensive coordinator his innovative offense succeeded as Tulane went 7–4 and had their best season since 1980. Rodriguez was part of Tulane's success, including their 12–0 season in Rodriguez's last season at Tulane, mainly for his spread offense with quarterback Shaun King. When Bowden was hired as the head coach at Clemson University, he retained Rodriguez on his staff. Rodriguez served as the offensive coordinator and associate head coach until the end of the 2000 season, traveling to a Peach Bowl and Gator Bowl. Rodriguez was considered to be the frontrunner for the Tulane coaching job following Bowden's departure and was led to believe that he was going to be the next coach for Tulane. However, Chris Scelfo was hired instead. In 1999, Rodriguez interviewed for the head coaching job at Texas Tech but lost to Mike Leach.Texas Tech picks Leach for offense – Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Google ArchivesTexas Tech contacts N.M. State's Samuel – Herald Journal Google Archives ===West Virginia=== On November 26, 2000, WVU's athletic department announced that Rodriguez would again return to West Virginia, this time as head coach to replace the retiring Don Nehlen. Rodriguez's first season at West Virginia, 2001, was a disappointing 3–8 season. However, Rodriguez's turn-around of the 2002 team is the greatest turn-around in Big East history with a 9–4 record, Big East runner-up finish, back-to-back road wins against ranked Virginia Tech and Pitt, and a Continental Tire Bowl berth, where they lost to ACC runner-up, Virginia. The Mountaineers finished second in the nation rushing with 283 yards per game and fourth in turnover margin. In 2003, the Mountaineers started the season 1–4, and after losing to #2 Miami 22–20, the Mountaineers posted a 6–1 Big East record and tied for the Big East championship with Miami, earning a Gator Bowl berth. That season, the Mountaineers replaced 22 seniors, eleven of which were starters. In 2004, the Mountaineers posted an 8–4 record with a talented team of seniors and juniors, but were ranked as high as sixth during the regular season. Following the 2002 season, Rodriguez was awarded the Big East Coach of the Year by Sporting News and state college coach of the year for all sports by the West Virginia Sports Writers Association. He also received the 2003 Frank Loria Award from the West Virginia chapter of the National Football Foundation, and also earned Big East Coach of the Year that season. In 2005, he was offered to join the AFCA Board of Directors, and that same season was again given Big East Coach of the Year honors. In 2005, Rodriguez and the Mountaineers won the Big East title with freshman tandem Steve Slaton and Patrick White, thus claiming the conference's automatic berth in the Bowl Championship Series (BCS), where they defeated the Georgia Bulldogs in the Nokia Sugar Bowl and a final Associated Press ranking of fifth, tying the highest in school history (other in 1988). Repeating their 2005 success, West Virginia posted another 11-win season, which was the first consecutive 10-win seasons in school history. The Mountaineers defeated Georgia Tech, 38–35, in the Gator Bowl and finished 10th in the final polls. Rodriguez also had two consensus All-Americans, running back Steve Slaton and center Dan Mozes (who also won the Rimington Trophy as the nation's best center). On December 7, 2006, Rodriguez received an offer from the University of Alabama to be the next Alabama Crimson Tide head coach. Despite reports that he had agreed in principle to coach at Alabama, The article stated, \\"University of Alabama officials and West Virginia’s Rich Rodriguez have reached an agreement in principle for Rodriguez to become the Crimson Tide’s next head football coach, two sources close to the search told The Birmingham News tonight.\\" which Rodriguez described as totally incorrect, on December 8, 2006, Rodriguez announced he would remain as head coach at West Virginia. The Mountaineers started the 2007 season ranked #3 in the AP Poll and #6 in the Coaches' Poll. They were #5 in the nation, before losing to #18 South Florida for the second consecutive time. South Florida eventually moved to #2, before dropping out of the Top 25 after losses (though USF would end the regular season ranked at #21). West Virginia dropped to #12 and #13 in the AP and Coaches' poll, respectively, before rebounding with wins against Syracuse, Mississippi State, #25 Rutgers, Louisville, and #21 Cincinnati. The Mountaineers eventually defeated #20 Connecticut to clinch the Big East Championship and move to #2 in the BCS standings and #1 in the Coaches' poll, both the highest position ever for a Mountaineer football team. WVU's regular season ended at home with a loss in the Backyard Brawl against Pittsburgh, 13-9. After the departure of Rodriguez, the Mountaineers went on to defeat University of Oklahoma in the Fiesta Bowl under interim head coach Bill Stewart. ====Departure from West Virginia==== On December 16, 2007, Rodriguez informed players at West Virginia that he was leaving to succeed Lloyd Carr as the University of Michigan head football coach. Rodriguez's earlier loss to the unranked Pittsburgh Panthers eliminated WVU from national championship contention. Rodriguez's original resignation letter listed January 3, 2008 as his resignation date, but he subsequently made it clear that he would not be coaching WVU in its January 2 appearance in the 2008 Fiesta Bowl versus Oklahoma. On December 18, 2007, Rodriguez informed the university that his resignation would instead be effective at midnight that night and was replaced by his former assistant coach Bill Stewart, who was selected as head coach after the Mountaineers won the Fiesta Bowl. The announcement of his departure came just four months after Rodriguez last renegotiated his contract with West Virginia and was made despite his stated long-term commitment to the Mountaineers. The contract included a $4 million buyout if he left WVU within one year of the August 2007 signing date. It has since been speculated that Rodriguez's departure was triggered by conflicts with the new president of WVU, Michael Garrison. Some insight into the discontent between Rodriguez and WVU is evidenced in a compendium of emails that were released to the Associated Press on January 23, 2008. An Associated Press story indicated that Rodriguez's agent Mike Brown was threatening to take his client elsewhere early in the 2007 season. On December 27, 2007, West Virginia University filed a motion for declaratory judgment in Monongalia County Circuit Court, asking the court to find that Rodriguez's contract with the University was valid, that WVU had not breached that contract, and that Rodriguez had breached it. Subsequently, on January 18, 2008, WVU added a count of breach of contract after Rodriguez allegedly failed to pay the first installment of the $4 million liquidated damages clause (often referred to as a \\"buyout clause\\" by the media) when due. On July 9, 2008 Rodriguez and WVU agreed to settle the lawsuit. The terms of the settlement stated that the University of Michigan would pay $2.5 million of the settlement. Rodriguez was required to pay WVU the remaining $1.5 million in three installments of $500,000 each, spread over three years starting in January 2010. An opinion poll in September 2013 by Public Policy Polling found that 47% of West Virginia voters still had an unfavorable opinion of him, with only 11% seeing him favorably. ===Michigan=== Rodriguez & Tate Forcier during spring practice on April 11, 2009. Rodriguez was introduced by Michigan as its new coach at a news conference held on December 17, 2007 at the Junge Family Champions Center on the University of Michigan campus. After arriving at Michigan, Rodriguez installed a new staff. He brought several members of his West Virginia staff with him, including Tony Gibson and offensive coordinator Calvin Magee. Fred Jackson, the running backs coach, was the only coaching holdover from Lloyd Carr's staff. Rodriguez also changed the strength and conditioning facilities, completed a top ten incoming recruiting class in 2008 (which was recruited mainly by Carr and his staff), and installed his own recruiting to serve his spread offense. Equipment manager Jon Falk also stayed with the Michigan football program; he had been with Michigan since the days of Bo Schembechler. Rodriguez began his Michigan coaching career on August 30, 2008 with a 25–23 loss to Utah. His 2008 team finished with a record of 3–9, the worst season in school history. Michigan's losing record meant that the team did not play in a post-season bowl game for the first time in 33 years, the longest such streak in college football up to that point. One of the few high points of the season came on September 27 when Michigan made the second-largest comeback in program history to defeat #9 Wisconsin 27–25 after trailing 19–0 late in the third quarter. That contest was also the 500th game played in Michigan Stadium. ====Players leaving and criticism==== Several Michigan players transferred and subsequently criticized Rodriguez. Justin Boren transferred from the program to rival Ohio State citing offensive behavior and a \\"lack of family values\\" from the coaching staff. Boren became first team all Big Ten at Ohio State University in the 2009 season. Others have supported the assertion about a lack of family values, including Detroit Free Press writer Michael Rosenberg, who stated \\"Rodriguez's staff uses some of the foulest, most degrading language imaginable. I know coaches curse, and I'm no prude, but this goes way beyond a few dirty words. This is a big part of why offensive lineman Justin Boren left the team. He felt his dignity was at stake.\\" Former Michigan player Kurt Wermers claimed to not get along with coaches after transferring following the 2008 season to Ball State University, but he was, in fact, academically ineligible at the time of his transfer, calling into question the credibility of his claim. ====NCAA rule violations==== Rich Rodriguez gives an interview in Beaver Stadium before the day of the 2010 Michigan vs. Penn State gamePrior to the 2009 season several anonymous players told journalists (including Rosenberg) at the Detroit Free Press that Rodriguez and his coaching staff had habitually violated NCAA rules. The alleged offenses included attending unofficial scrimmages and requiring players to work out more hours than NCAA rules permit for the off-season. Rodriguez denied the allegations. On October 27, 2009, the NCAA sent a Notice of Inquiry to the University of Michigan stating the NCAA found reasonably reliable information indicating NCAA rule violations. Following the Notice, the investigation into potential major violations continued. On November 16, 2009, the University of Michigan Auditors looking into the NCAA violations discovered that University of Michigan Athletic Department staff failed to file monthly logs that track how much players work out and practice. Then on February 22, 2010, the NCAA formally accused Michigan of five \\"major rules violations\\" after finding that the team and its coaching staff failed to comply with practice time rules under coach Rich Rodriguez, and used several graduate assistants in coaching position in contravention of NCAA regulations on the limits of the number of coaches. This marked the first time that major violations have been alleged against the Michigan football program. All of the violations dated from January 2008 forward, which coincided with Rodriguez's arrival at Michigan. The University of Michigan has acknowledged that it committed four major violations in its football program. This resulted in U-M self-imposing sanctions which including cutting practice time and either disciplining or terminating staff, as well as two years probation. The final NCAA report downgraded the list of violations originally investigated, agreed with Michigan's self-imposed sanctions, but added an extra year of probation. ====Eventual departure==== Despite the setbacks of his inaugural season, Rodriguez compiled a recruiting class for the 2009 season which was ranked eighth nationally by Rivals.com. Tom Dienhart, writing for Sports Illustrated, named Rodriguez the second best football coach in the Big Ten Conference behind only Iowa's Kirk Ferentz and ahead of more tenured coaches such as Penn State's Joe Paterno and Ohio State's Jim Tressel. Under Rodriguez, the Wolverines opened the 2009 season with a 31–7 win against Western Michigan followed by wins over rival Notre Dame and Eastern Michigan. Following these three victories, two over weak mid-major opponents, Michigan opened its Big Ten schedule with a 36–33 win against Indiana. However, Michigan finished the season with a 5–7 (1–7 in the Big Ten) record after road losses to Michigan State, and the Iowa Hawkeyes and a 25-point home loss to Penn State followed by a 25-point loss to the University of Illinois and a 38–36 loss at home to Purdue. Rodriguez ended the 2009 season with a 21–10 loss to rival Ohio State. This loss eliminated the Wolverines from bowl competition for the second year in a row. The 2010 season got off to a similar start to the 2009 campaign, with the Wolverines winning their first five games of the season. Michigan started the season off by notching a win over Connecticut, who eventually won a share of the Big East title and went on to represent the conference in a BCS bowl. By week three, the team earned a spot in the AP Top 25 at #20 and USA Today Poll at #22. Their highest AP ranking, #18, came before recording their first loss of the season against 17-ranked in-state foe and eventual Big Ten co-champion Michigan State (part of a three-way tie). The team finished Big Ten play with a 3–5 record, including a 37–7 loss against arch-rival Ohio State. This caused further criticism of Rodriguez, for failing to restore competitiveness to one of college football's greatest rivalries. Still, Michigan had earned a 7–5 record and, for the first time under Rodriguez, were bowl eligible. The season included such highlights as a spectacular 67–65 comeback win over Illinois in triple overtime on Nov 6 and a special talent in sophomore quarterback Denard Robinson who in 12 games passed for 2,316 yards and rushed for 1,643 yards while accounting for 30 rushing and passing touchdowns. Rodriguez led Michigan to its first New Year's Day bowl since the 2007 season when Michigan accepted a bid to play in the Gator Bowl. However, Michigan's 38-point loss to Mississippi State in the Gator Bowl was the worst bowl loss in school history. Due to the team's disappointing season after such a promising start, and another loss to Ohio State, Rodriguez finished the regular season campaign amidst speculation that he would not return for the 2011 season. Rumors about Rodriguez's ousting heated up after the season, when Stanford Cardinal head coach and former Michigan quarterback, Jim Harbaugh, did not attend an anniversary dinner recognizing the 1985 Michigan team. Harbaugh had been rumored to replace Rodriguez in seasons past. At Michigan, Rodriguez suffered a 20-point home loss to a Big Ten opponent in all three seasons he coached (most recently against Wisconsin, a 48–28 loss). In his first two years, Rodriguez had no wins in October against Football Bowl Subdivision teams and did not record a win against such an opponent until the 2010 season, recording a road victory over Indiana. At Michigan, Rodriguez had a 2–7 record against the Wolverines' three regular season rivals: Ohio State, Notre Dame, and Michigan State, recording victories against Notre Dame in the 2009 and 2010 campaigns. Media circus outside of Schembechler Hall after news broke that Rich Rodriguez had been fired as University of Michigan head coach on Jan 5, 2011 Rodriguez was rumored to be let go as Michigan coach on January 4, 2011. School officials initially denied this, but the following day, athletic director Dave Brandon announced that Rodriguez had been dismissed. Rodriguez has the lowest winning percentage (.405) of any coach in Michigan football's history. He also went 0–3 against Ohio State and 0–3 against Michigan State. Rodriguez worked as an analyst for CBS Sports for most of the 2011 season before being hired to coach at Arizona. He had previously participated in CBS's 2011 Signing Day Coverage. When asked if he regretted moving to Michigan, he said: \\"I think it's easy to go back now and say, 'Gee, [I] made a mistake.' And you can say that now because of hindsight. But at the time, some of the things I was looking to do and the opportunity that was there, you kind of make the move....but you know hindsight is always easier to look back and say, 'it was a mistake.' Because we did have a good thing going at West Virginia, and we really enjoyed it. As you look back at it, [it] wasn't the best move. Easy to say now.\\" When asked if he would ever return to coaching, Rodriguez said, \\"I'm open to another opportunity, but we'll see. Here, that window looks like it's closed, but if something comes open after this season, and it seems like it may be a good opportunity for me and someone is interested, I'm sure I'll look into it.\\" In June 2011, Rodriguez put the family home in York Township, Michigan up for sale for an asking price of $1.9 million.http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/dpp/news/local/rich-rodriguez's-home-for- sale,-listed-at-nearly-$1.9-million-20110705-mr The tumultuous three years with Michigan was chronicled in great detail in Three and Out, written by John U. Bacon. Bacon was given full insider access from the start of the 2008 season all the way through the search for Rodriguez's successor. The book also covers Rich Rodriguez's career before coming to Michigan, including the buyout from West Virginia. ===Arizona=== Following Rodriguez's tenure at CBS, he was hired as the 30th head coach of the Arizona Wildcats football program on November 21, 2011. His hiring was first announced by University of Arizona athletic director Greg Byrne on Twitter while a press conference officially announcing him as the head coach was held a day later at McKale Center in Tucson. Rodriguez's hiring ended a 41-day search for a head coach which started after Mike Stoops was dismissed after eight seasons as Wildcat head coach. In Rodriguez's first season at Arizona, the Wildcats finished the season 8–5 with a win over Nevada in the New Mexico Bowl. The season, which included Arizona running back Ka'Deem Carey breaking the school single-season records for rushing yards and rushing touchdowns, was Rodriguez' first winning debut season and first bowl appearance in a debut season. It also tied Jim Young for the most wins in an Arizona coach's debut season. The Wildcats posted an 8–5 record in Rodriguez' second season as head coach. The season saw the emergence of star running back Carey and was capped with a victory over Boston College in the AdvoCare V100 Bowl. In his third year, Rodriguez led the Wildcats to their first 5–0 start and top 10 ranking since 1998 after beating No. 2 Oregon 31–24. He then lost his first game to Southern California and subsequently lost to UCLA. After compiling an 0–2 mark against in-state arch- rival Arizona State his first two years, Rodriguez's Wildcats defeated the Sun Devils, 42–35 in 2014 to win the Pac-12 South Division, the first divisional championship in program history. The Wildcats advanced to the Pac-12 Football Championship Game at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, where they were defeated by their conference rivals, the Oregon Ducks, 51–13 (despite winning the regular season match-up). The Wildcats then played in the 2014 Fiesta Bowl, the school's third major-bowl appearance, where they faced the Boise State Broncos. Arizona lost the game to Boise State, 38–30. Under Coach Rodriguez, the Wildcats finished the 2014 season with a record of 10–4 (7–2 Pac-12), achieving only the second 10-win regular season in program history; the Wildcats also finished the season ranked #17 in the USA Today Coaches Poll and #19 in the AP Poll. Rich Rodriguez lost the last game he coached at Arizona to a Jeff Brohm coached Purdue University team 38-35, on December 27, 2017 in the Foster Farms Bowl. ==== Firing ==== Rodriguez's former administrative assistant filed a multimillion-dollar claim accusing him of sexually harassing her and creating a hostile work environment for years. Rodriguez was fired on January 2, 2018 after a three-month internal investigation by the Arizona Wildcats. He admitted to having an extramarital affair, but denied all allegations of other sexual misconduct. === Ole Miss === On December 31, 2018, it was announced that Rodriguez accepted the offensive coordinator position at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss), joining newly hired defensive coordinator Mike MacIntyre (recently fired head coach at Colorado) on the staff of head coach Matt Luke. He received a three- year contract. After Matt Luke was fired in December 2019, new head coach Lane Kiffin did not offer a contract to Rodriguez. ==Spread option== Rodriguez is considered a pioneer of a no huddle, run- oriented version of the spread offense, although a pass-first version was already being implemented by others. He first developed this offensive approach at Glenville State and refined it during his stops at Tulane with Shaun King, at Clemson with Woodrow Dantzler, and at West Virginia most notably with dual-threat quarterback Pat White. This strategy features frequent use of the shotgun formation. Rodriguez is also credited for inventing the zone read play run out of the shotgun formation. ==Family== Rodriguez and his wife, Rita, have two children, Raquel and Rhett. His grandfather is originally from Spain. ==Head coaching record== ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Arizona profile * Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:American people of Spanish descent Category:Sportspeople from Chicago Category:People from Marion County, West Virginia Category:Players of American football from West Virginia Category:American football safeties Category:West Virginia Mountaineers football players Category:Coaches of American football from West Virginia Category:West Virginia Mountaineers football coaches Category:Salem International Tigers football coaches Category:Glenville State Pioneers football coaches Category:Tulane Green Wave football coaches Category:Clemson Tigers football coaches Category:Michigan Wolverines football coaches Category:Arizona Wildcats football coaches Category:Ole Miss Rebels football coaches Category:College football announcers ","title":"Rich Rodriguez"},{"id":"3260744","text":"The Canon ELPH was a full-featured compact Advanced Photo System point and shoot camera released in May 1996 as part of a series. ==Features== The first camera in the ELPH series was sold in Japan as the IXY and in Europe as the IXUS.

Competence is an attribute that is decision-specific. Depending on various factors which typically revolve around mental function integrity, an individual may or may not be competent to make a particular medical decision, a particular contractual agreement, to execute an effective deed to real property, or to execute a will having certain terms. Depending on the state, a guardian or conservator may be appointed by a court for a person who satisfies the state's tests for general incompetence, and the guardian or conservator exercises the incompetent's rights for the incompetent. Defendants who do not possess sufficient \\"competence\\" are usually excluded from criminal prosecution, while witnesses found not to possess requisite competence cannot testify. The English equivalent is fitness to plead. ==United States== The word incompetent is used to describe persons who should not undergo or partake in certain judicial processes, and also for those who lack mental capacity to make contracts, handle their financial and other personal matters such as consenting to medical treatment, etc. and need a legal guardian to handle their affairs. ===Competence to stand trial=== In United States law, the right to not be prosecuted while one is incompetent to stand trial has been ruled by the United States Supreme Court to be guaranteed under the due process clause. If the court determines that a defendant's mental condition makes him unable to understand the proceedings, or that he is unable to help in his defense, he is found incompetent. The competency evaluation, as determined in Dusky v. United States, is whether the accused \\"has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding-- and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\\" Being determined incompetent is substantially different from undertaking an insanity defense; competence regards the defendant's state of mind at the time of the trial, while insanity regards his state of mind at the time of the crime. In New York a hearing on competence to stand trial may be referred to as a \\"730 exam\\", after the law that governs the conduct of the exam, New York CPL Sec. 730. In 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit considered the legal standards for determining competence to stand trial and to waive counsel using the standards of objective unreasonableness under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. A ruling of incompetence may later be reversed. A defendant may recover from a mental illness or disability, and a court may require a defendant to undergo treatment in an effort to render the defendant competent to stand trial. For example, in 1989, Kenneth L. Curtis of Stratford, Connecticut was found mentally incompetent to stand trial following the murder of his estranged girlfriend. But years later, as he had attended college and received good grades, this ruling was reversed, and he was ordered to stand trial. ===Competence to be executed=== An inmate on death row has a right to be evaluated for competency by a psychologist to determine if sentence can be carried out. This is a result of Ford v. Wainwright, a case filed by a Florida inmate on death row who took his case to the United States Supreme Court, declaring he was not competent to be executed. The court ruled in his favor, stating that a forensic professional must make that competency evaluation and, if the inmate is found incompetent, must provide treatment to aid in his gaining competency so the execution can take place. ===Competence to enter into a contract=== Generally, in the United States, a person has the capacity or competence to make the decision to enter into a contract if the person has the ability to understand and appreciate, to the extent relevant, all of the following: (a) The rights, duties, and responsibilities created by, or affected by the decision. (b) The probable consequences for the decisionmaker and, where appropriate, the persons affected by the decision. (c) The significant risks, benefits, and reasonable alternatives involved in the decision. See, e.g., California Probate Code §812. ===Competence and Native Americans=== Competency was used to determine whether individual Native Americans could use land that was allotted to them from the General Allotment Act (GAA) also known as the Dawes Act. The practice was used after in 1906 with the passing of the Burk Act, also known as the forced patenting act. This Act further amended the GAA to give the Secretary of the Interior the power to issue allotees a patent in fee simple to people classified ‘competent and capable.’ The criteria for this determination is unclear but meant that allotees deemed ‘competent’ by the Secretary of the Interior would have their land taken out of trust status, subject to taxation, and could be sold by the allottee. The Act of June 25, 1910 further amends the GAA to give the Secretary of the Interior the power to sell the land of deceased allottees or issue patent and fee to legal heirs. This decision is based on a determination made by the Secretary of Interior whether the legal heirs are ‘competent’ or ‘incompetent’ to manage their own affairs. ===Competency case law=== Adjudicative competence has been developed through a body of common law in the United States. The landmark cases are the following: *Dusky v. United States (1960) *Jackson v. Indiana (1972) *Drope v. Missouri (1975) *Ford v. Wainwright (1986) *Godinez v. Moran (1993) *Pate v. Robinson (1966) *Estelle v. Smith (1981) *Medina v. California (1992) *Riggins v. Nevada (1992) *Cooper v. Oklahoma (1996) *Sell v. United States (2003) ==United Kingdom== In the laws of England and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, the term \\"fitness to plead\\" is used, as in designating a person \\"unfit to plead\\". The concept is identical to \\"competence\\", although detailed law differs. ==See also== *Age of consent *Age of majority *Principle of conferral, regarding the competences of the European Union versus those of its member states *Suitable age and discretion *United States federal laws governing offenders with mental diseases or defects ==Footnotes== Category:Evidence law Category:Forensic psychology Category:Mental health law Category:Criminal defenses Category:Capacity (law) ","title":"Competence (law)"},{"id":"3260786","text":"An order of merit is conferred by a state, government or royal family on an individual in recognition of military or civil merit.

Kurt Schlosser memorial stone before the Hellerau German Workshops (Dresden); the caption simply reads \\"To our work colleague, the resistance fighter Kurt Schlosser, executed 16.8.1944\\" Between 1919 and 1923, Schlosser worked as a polisher, stainer and assembler in the \\" Hellerau German Workshops\\" (\\"Deutsche Werkstätten Hellerau\\"), and was also a member of the works council there. In 1923, he joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), he belonged to the KPD factory cell and the Revolutionary Trade Union Opposition (Revolutionäre Gewerkschafts-Opposition) at the Deutsche Werkstätten Hellerau. In 1930, he was finally rebuked as a Communist works councillor and barred from the woodworkers' association. Before the labour court, he struggled to keep working at the Workshops. Since Schlosser was a member of the strike leadership in 1931, it was within the Workshops' power to exclude him, which led to him losing his job. Not long afterwards, however, he had set up his own cabinet-making workshop on Leipziger Straße in Dresden. He was also leader of the singing company of the United Climbing Companies, which later became the \\"Sächsischer Bergsteigerchor 'Kurt Schlosser' Dresden\\" (\\"Kurt Schlosser Saxon Mountaineers' Choir, Dresden\\"). From 1933, Schlosser was active with other mountain climbers in illegal \\"border work\\". His cabinet-making workshop became a meeting place for resistance fighters who were struggling against the Nazi régime. There arose a tight connection between German and Czechoslovakian working-class sportsmen. Kurt Schlosser contributed to the civic singing club \\"Melomanie\\" and the \\"Meißner Hochland\\" section of the German Alpine Club (Deutscher Alpenverein). From 1942 Schlosser was a member of the leadership of the illegal Dresden KPD organization, now newly established after countless arrests, and he forged new connections with illegally active trade union representatives from Dresden and nearby areas. On 3 December 1943, Kurt Schlosser and other active antifascists were arrested. On 30 June 1944 at the Volksgerichtshof, together with his comrades Herbert Blochwitz, Otto Galle and Arthur Weineck, he was sentenced to death for \\"high treason and favouring the enemy\\". On 16 August 1944, Kurt Schlosser was beheaded in the courtyard of the Dresden State Court at Münchner Platz. The Sächsischer Bergsteigerchor 'Kurt Schlosser' Dresden has borne the murdered antifascist's name since 1949. ==Literature== *Zimmering, M.: Widerstandsgruppe Vereinigte Kletterabteilungen.

Following this release, Jennings was replaced by another future Cathedral member, Adam Lehan (formerly of Lord Crucifier), and the band gained support slots opening for such acts as Flotsam and Jetsam and Death Angel. Acid Reign struck up a friendship with label mates Nuclear Assault and Exodus, and toured the UK and Europe as support to the Survive and Fabulous Disaster tours. The band released their debut album, The Fear, in 1989. In support of the album, Acid Reign toured with Nuclear Assault again in 1989 across Europe with Dark Angel and Candlemass, with bassist Ian \\"Mac\\" MacDonald replacing Gangwer. Their second album, Obnoxious, arrived in 1990 to generally poor reviews. ===Post- split (1991–2014)=== Acid Reign broke up in 1991 after parting ways with Music For Nations. They played their final show at the London Marquee Club. In January 2014, H started the world's only comedy/Heavy Metal podcast called \\"Talking Bollocks\\" for the UK metal webzine All About The Rock. On 30 November 2014, Acid Reign frontman H told UK Heavy Metal website All About The Rock \\"I tried to put the old line up back together but Adam and Ramsey were unable to do it for differing reasons. That news came this time last year and it looked like that was that as Kev isn’t able to commit to anything as he’s constantly on the road, although he has an open invitation to join us when he’s not, that’s a given. Then, in the summer, I started toying with the idea of a new line up and it came together quite quickly. We’re taking it slowly, learning the old stuff and playing with new ideas too. It’s not a reformation it’s a reboot. Even if it was the old line up it would be different, it’s been 24 years! The main thing is that the goodwill toward Acid Reign has never been stronger, everywhere I go people are saying we should come back and eventually I actually fucking listened! We’ll make an “official” announcement when we’re ready and have plans but for now it is just have a merry Xmas and an Obnoxious New Year.\\" ===Reboot (2015–present)=== On 5 May 2015, Acid Reign announced on their Facebook page that they had reformed. Frontman Howard \\"H\\" Smith, who is the only original member of Acid Reign involved in the reboot, commented, \\"Finally the rebooted line up is complete, it's taken nearly two years but I can honestly say it's been worth the wait. Typically we're doing things differently to everyone else as where they reformed (and believe me we tried) we are now rebooting. Everyone in the band has Acid Reign in their DNA, some of the guys knew the band back in the day and some didn't but everyone is on the same page and we can't wait to get out there and show the world how much it has been missing us.\\" Two months later, Acid Reign released their first song in 25 years, \\"Plan of the Damned\\", via streaming platforms. On 27 September 2019 the band released their first full-length studio album in 29 years, The Age of Entitlement, via Dissonance Productions to worldwide critical and fan acclaim. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *The Fear (album, 1989) (UK Indie No. 10) *Obnoxious (album, 1990) *The Worst of Acid Reign (compilation, 1991) *The Apple Core Archives (Box Set, 2014) *The Age of Entitlement (album, 2019) ===Singles, EPs and mini albums=== *Moshkinstein (Mini Album, 1988) *Humanoia (EP) *Hanging on the Telephone (single) *\\"Plan Of The Damned\\" (Single) 2015 *\\"The Man Who Became Himself\\" (Single) 2017 ==Band members== ===Current members=== *Howard \\"H\\" Smith – vocals (1985–1991, 2013–present) *Cooky – guitar (2015–present) *Paul Chanter – guitar (2013–present) *Pete Dee – bass (2015–present) *Marc Jackson – drums (2014–present) ===Former members=== *Mark Ramsey Wharton – drums, keyboards (1985–1991) *Garry Jennings – guitar (1985–1988) *Ian Gangwer – bass (1985–1988) *Kevin \\"Kev\\" Papworth – guitar (1987–1991) *Adam Lehan – guitar (1988–1990) *Ian \\"Mac\\" MacDonald – bass (1988–1991) ==References== Category:Musical groups established in 1985 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1991 Category:Music and politics Category:English thrash metal musical groups Category:Musical groups from Harrogate Category:1985 establishments in England Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2015 ","title":"Acid Reign"},{"id":"3260813","text":"Fish doctor may refer to: *eelpout *fish medicine ","title":"Fish doctor"},{"id":"3260816","text":"Dabolim Airport is the sole international airport in Goa. It is operated by the Airports Authority of India as a civil enclave in an Indian Navy naval airbase named INS Hansa. The airport is located in Dabolim, 4 kilometers from the nearest city Vasco da Gama, 23 kilometers from Margao, and about 30 kilometers from the state capital Panjim. The airport's integrated terminal was inaugurated in December 2013. In fiscal year 2017–18, the airport handled over 7.6 million passengers. Several European charter airlines fly to Goa seasonally, typically between November and May. Flights from the UK (London Gatwick and Manchester Airport) are operated by TUI Airways. There are also several seasonal charter flights to various Russian cities. Because of capacity constraints at the terminal and air traffic congestion due to a strong military and naval presence, a second airport at Mopa was proposed. It is under construction with scheduled completion in 2022. ==History== The airport was built in 1955 by the Government of the Estado da Índia Portuguesa, on of land, as the Aeroporto de Dabolim, which was later officially renamed to Aeroporto General Bénard Guedes. Until 1961, the airport served as the main hub of the Portuguese India's airline TAIP (Transportes Aéreos da Índia Portuguesa), which on a regular schedule served Daman, Diu, Karachi, Mozambique, Portuguese Timor, and other destinations. During the Annexation of Goa, in December 1961, the airport was bombarded by the Indian Air Force with parts of the infrastructure being destroyed. Two civilian planes that were in the airport – a Lockheed Constellation from TAP (Transportes Aéreos Portugueses) and a Douglas DC-4 from TAIP – managed to escape with refugees, during the night, to Karachi. In April 1962, it was occupied by the Indian Navy's air wing when Major General K.P. Candeth, who had led the successful military operation into Goa, \\"handed over\\" the airport to the Indian Navy before relinquishing charge as its military governor to a Lieutenant Governor of the then Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu in June 1962. For civilian air travel out of Vasco da Gama and Goa, the Indian Navy and the Government of India invited the public sector airline (known now as Indian) to operate at Dabolim from 1966 after the runway was repaired and jet-enabled. A new domestic terminal building was built in 1983, designed to process 350 arrivals and departures simultaneously, while the international terminal, built in 1996 was designed for 250. Once two vital road bridges across the main waterways of Goa were built in the early 1980s, and Goa hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in 1983, the charter flight business began to take off at Dabolim a few years later, pioneered by Condor Airlines of Germany. In 2006, the Indian Civil Aviation Ministry announced a plan to upgrade Dabolim Airport. This involved constructing a new international passenger terminal (after converting the existing one to domestic) and adding several more aircraft stands over an area of about . The construction was scheduled to be completed by the end of 2007.Dabolim airport upgrading will be over by end of 2007. The Hindu. Retrieved on 18 February 2007 However delays in transfer of the required land from the Navy held up proceedings. The modernisation project of Goa Airport was one of 35 airport expansion projects undertaken by the AAI and, in terms of size and money, was its third largest project after the ones at Chennai and Kolkata airports. It included the construction of an integrated terminal building to replace the older terminals, a multi-level car parking (MLCP) facility to accommodate between 540 and 570 cars and construction of additional parking stands for aircraft. The AAI acquired additional land from the Indian Navy and the State Government for apron expansion and the expansion of the older international terminal building complex. The foundation stone for the terminal was laid on 21 February 2009, the project work began in May 2010 and construction of the terminal began in May 2011. The terminal can handle 2,750 peak hour passengers, cost 3.45 billion and was inaugurated on 3 December 2013. ==Facilities== ===Structure=== The airport is spread over (and possibly ) and consists of a civil enclave of nearly , an increase from its original size of . The civil enclave is operated by the AAI. Of the 180 flights daily, there is a very large concentration of civilian traffic in the period between 1:00 pm and 9:00 pm during weekdays, with the balance in the early morning hours. This is because of naval restrictions for military flight training purposes throughout the year. In September 2017, the AAI and the Indian Navy entered into a Memorandum of understanding (MoU) to construct a full length, parallel taxi track suitable for Boeing 747 type of aircraft and agreed to share the cost of construction. The environmental clearance for the project was received in January 2018. The project, which involved development of a 3,710 metre long parallel taxi track along with associated facilities, would be completed in three phases. The first phase was completed by November 2019. The completed taxiway was opened in December 2019. It raised the capacity of the runway from 15 air traffic movements (ATMs) per hour to 18-20 ATMs per hour. The Navy's premises straddle the Dabolim runway and consequently its personnel would cross the runway at one point (on foot or bicycles or in vehicles) between flights. As part of the works taken up in 2018, a peripheral road was built and the local traffic would no longer affect flight movement. ===Terminal=== Model of the new integrated terminal building on display Departing area at Goa Airport Waiting hall on the second floor The airport's integrated terminal building handles both international and domestic passengers. It was opened in December 2013. The building design features aesthetic glass, large steel span structures and frameless glazing. The 36,000 square metre terminal is designed to cater to five million passengers annually. It is equipped with eight aerobridges. The terminal features an in- line baggage scanning system and a state-of-the-art sewage treatment plant. It has 75 check-in counters, 22 immigration counters for departures, 18 immigration counters for arrivals, 14 security check booths and eight customs counters. The basement of the four-level terminal has utilities like electricity and cargo handling. The check-in counters are placed on the ground floor while the first floor has security check booths. The second floor has the security hold area where passengers may wait before boarding an aircraft. The old terminal buildings were closed after the commissioning of the new terminal. ==Airlines and destinations== Aircraft at Dabolim airport, Goa Aircraft at Goa airport ===Passenger=== ===Cargo=== ==Economic factors== Dabolim's air traffic control is in the hands of the Indian Navy, which earns revenues from this service on account of aircraft movements. Landing fees are of the order of each while Route Navigation Facility (RNF) Charges are about . The Airports Authority of India could be eligible for aircraft parking fees of per day. It receives a part of the passenger service fee which is shared between it and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF). The AAI's prime source of earning is from non-traffic services like passenger facilitation, car park, entry tickets, stalls, restaurants and shops at the main terminal building and advertising boards. Capital expenditures (such as for runway expansion) at the airport are covered by AAI. The Dabolim Airport runway has increased from about initially to as of April 2013 and can accommodate Boeing 747s. There is a shortage of night parking bays which are at a premium in metro airports like Mumbai. A local association has estimated that about 40 hectares are needed for the civil enclave in comparison to the 14 hectares earmarked at present.HASG.

The figure for 2004–05 was placed at nearly 1.3 million, giving a daily average of 3,467.Data for April 2005 and 2006 are given in an Airports Authority Of India report. The airport director has claimed that 2.2 million passengers used the airport in CY 2006\\\\. This rose to about 2.6 million in CY 2007\\\\. The airport is ranked among the top ten in the country in terms of passenger traffic. Airport authorities consider that it has been operating at saturation levels since 2004. Today, Goa's estimated 1200 international flights per year account for some 93% of India's international charter tourist flights. It is estimated that about 300 to 350 thousand international tourists arrive at Dabolim on charter flights. Goa's total international tourists (roughly double the charter passengers) account for 5–10% of the national figure and 10–15% of the country's foreign exchange receipts from tourism. As the weekend morning hours approach saturation due to waves of chartered flights especially from the UK and Russia, attention is shifting to the night and early morning hours of weekdays for accommodating such flights. Tourists from UK to Goa by air were estimated to number about 300,000 in 2013–14 while those from Russia numbered about 49,000 (by 280 charter flights) in the same period. ==Naval station at Dabolim== INS Hansa is India's biggest naval airbase. The air station of the Indian Navy at Dabolim was transferred here from the Sulur Air Force Base in Coimbatore after the annexation of Goa in December 1961. In 1983, the Indian Navy began inducting the BAE Sea Harrier into service, basing training activities at Dabolim. The Harriers were replaced by MiG-29KUBs in 2016. INS Hansa is also the site of Asia's first Shore Based Test Facility (SBTF), built in 2014 to train pilots of the MiG-29K for the aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya. INS Hansa is home to several squadrons of the Indian Navy, operating aircraft such as Kamov Ka-28 anti submarine helicopters, Ilyushin Il-38 May and Tupolev TU-142M Bear Maritime Reconnaissance aircraft apart from the MiG fighters. The Navy's Sagar Pawan aerobatic team is also based at Dabolim. Apart from being a naval airbase, INS Hansa hosts the Coast Guard Air Enclave (CGAE) - Goa and also sees regular exercises by Indian Air Force aircraft. The Navy also operates a naval aviation museum near Dabolim Airport. ===Military flight training=== Military flight training at Dabolim is carried out on five days of the week from 0830 hrs to 1300 hrs, during which civilian flights cannot operate. Some exceptions have been made on rare occasions by the naval ATC, chiefly in the case of foreign airlines. Charter airlines carrying international tourists during the season tend to use the freer civil aviation regimes on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) and in the early morning hours. The blocked time is about 15% of the total on a weekly basis albeit during peak morning hours for civilian flights. ===Campaign to revert to civilian status=== There has been a demand in local political circles for the restoration of Dabolim's civilian status by relocating the Indian Navy' air station to the proposed Karwar airfield in the new INS Kadamba naval base at Karwar, south of Dabolim in the adjoining state of Karnataka. However, the Indian Navy's top officers in Goa have hinted that the investment at Dabolim naval air station is and that it would be impossible to replicate this at Karwar.D'Cunha, C. \\"Room for more flights at Dabolim: Adm. Mehta\\". Goa Plus (The Times of India supplement). 5 January 2007. In early 2007, there were reports of a concerted move by the Navy, the AAI, and the state of Karnataka to extend the runway planned at the naval base at Karwar to 2,500 metres (8,200 ft) to accommodate Airbus A320s and to acquire 75 extra hectares for this purpose.Government Exploring Possibilities opening of Karwar Airport for Civilian Air Services Press Information Bureau Government of India In 2011, the Navy affirmed that Hansa would retain its assets and position as an important station for the Indian Navy, despite the commissioning of INS Kadamba. ==Air cargo== An estimated of cargo were handled annually as of a few years ago and may have declined since then. Most air cargo is carried in the belly-space of airlines such as Air India rather than in dedicated freighters. As of 2016, all domestic cargo is handled at Dabolim airport. GoAir, Vistara and other airlines use AAI's facilities, including machines, to process cargo during non-peak hours. AAI has plans to build and operate a 24x7 cargo terminal at Dabolim in the old international terminal. Once completed, the common user terminal for cargo would be able to cater to both domestic and international cargo flights on a continuous basis. ==Ground transportation== Passengers can reach the airport using taxis, buses, trains, or automobiles. Public buses go to the nearby city of Vasco da Gama, approximately away, and also stop at the closer Chicalim bus stop, about from the airport. Local mini-buses connect both Vasco da Gama and Chicalim to the airport. Pre-paid taxis are available from the airport. There are various new transportation plans in the works, including the addition of a second bridge. Meanwhile, plans for a 6-lane, north-to-south expressway are on hold in Goa. A monorail system is also being considered. All these plans have implications for the proposed Mopa Airport and its link to Dabolim and Goa's population centres. Railway tracks of Indian Railways, which also run through Goa, pass beside the airport. The nearest station is Dabolim railway station. The port at Mormugao is located about away. Konkan Railway provides services to Margao in South Goa, Tivim in North Goa, Carambolim, and Ponda. ==Incidents and accidents== *On 1 October 2002, two Ilyushin Il-38s collided and crashed near Dabolim Airport, killing 12 naval personnel in the planes and three civilians on the ground. *On 15 October 2012, two pilots and a technical sailor on board a HAL Chetak helicopter of the Indian Navy were killed after the helicopter crashed whilst landing towards the eastern side of the runway. *On 27 December 2016, Jet Airways flight 9W 2374, a Boeing 737-800 jetliner, took a 360-degree spin as it veered of the runway damaging the landing gear. Of the seven crew members and 154 passengers, 15 passengers suffered minor injuries. *On 3 January 2018, a MIG-29K fighter aircraft of the Navy with an trainee pilot crashed off the runway during takeoff at the Goa airport. There were no casualties. *On 17 December 2019, a SpiceJet Flight SG 3568, a De Havilland Canada Dash 8 was on final approach for landing when the runway controller noticed that the nose landing gear was not deployed. He immediately alerted the ATC tower and informed the aircraft to abort the landing and make a second attempt after a go around. The second attempt proved unsuccessful. In the third attempt the landing gear was partially deployed and the aircraft safely landed at the Goa Airport. There were no casualties. ==See also== * Airports in India * List of busiest airports in India by passenger traffic ==References== 43\\\\.

This is the 5th book featuring the author’s primary protagonist, Dirk Pitt. Published in 1981, it is set in the near future of 1989, a date with ironic significance (see below). The book's plot includes a major element of secret history. ==Plot introduction== The world is in the throes of an energy crunch and the United States is on the brink of financial disaster. Desperate to find any solution that can save the nation from national bankruptcy, the President of the United States looks to Dirk Pitt and NUMA to pull off an audacious double salvage operation. ===Explanation of the novel's title=== Cussler, through the character Pitt, claims that \\"Night Probe\\" is an old diving term for exploring the darkness of underwater caves. ==Plot summary== It is 1989 and the United States is in an economic decline because \\"From Franklin Roosevelt on, every chief executive has played a game of tag, pinning a multiplying financial burden on the office of his successor,\\" (said by the POTUS in part 1) and by increasing scarcity of oil. CIA estimates put the depletion of the Middle East oilfields at just two years away. The total worldwide demand for oil is more than 50% of estimated supplies and while nuclear and other alternative energies are trying to make up the difference they are coming up short. Canada is now the exclusive supplier of electricity to 15 states in the Northeastern U.S. after investing billions in a massive new hydro-electric power plant in Quebec. To make matters worse, a top-secret experimental sub developed by NUMA has recently discovered a stratigraphic trap, potentially the richest kind of oil deposit, which lies just across the border in the territorial waters of Quebec. Radicals in Quebec resembling the FLQ, secretly led by French Canadian MP Henri Villon, are pushing for a referendum on the independence of Quebec from Canada. Newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Charles Sarveux fears that if Quebec declares independence Canada will disintegrate as the other provinces either follow Quebec into independence or possibly petition the U.S. for statehood. Heidi Milligan, a U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander, is working on her PhD in history by researching the naval policies of President Woodrow Wilson between assignments. She stumbles across a reference to a \\"North American Treaty\\" in a long forgotten letter and is intrigued when she finds out that all traces of the treaty appear to have been erased from the National Archives. The North American Treaty, it is later revealed, was a landmark agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom. In 1914, the U.K. had found itself in economic hard times with a world war looming on the horizon. Fearing that the nation will not survive without a large infusion of capital, the British Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, with the cooperation of King George V, quietly approached the United States government and offered, for the sum of one billion dollars, to sell Canada to the United States. President Wilson quickly agreed and paid a down payment of $150 million to seal the deal. Tragedy strikes when, on the same day in May 1914, the American copy of the treaty plunges to the bottom of the Hudson River when the Manhattan Limited express passenger train attempts to cross a downed railroad bridge and the British copy plunges to the bottom of the St. Lawrence River when the liner RMS Empress of Ireland is accidentally rammed by a Norwegian collier. With both nation's copies of the treaty lost and the British cabinet outraged at having Canada sold off without their knowledge, Wilson orders all records of the treaty destroyed and records the $150 million payment as a war loan. Now that knowledge of the treaty has once again emerged, the President of the United States orders NUMA and Dirk Pitt to attempt to recover the copies of the treaty, which have both lain submerged for more than 70 years. The treaty becomes the cornerstone in the President’s plan to save the United States from national bankruptcy by proposing an audacious plan, to merge the United States and Canada into one nation, \\"the United States of Canada.\\" The British see the loss of Canada to the United States as the start of the unacceptable and unthinkable disintegration of their Empire. If Canada is allowed to leave the Empire, so too might Australia, or even Wales and Scotland. The British Secret Intelligence Service recalls one of their best former agents, Brian Shaw, from retirement and orders him to keep an eye on the American salvage efforts and to ensure the destruction of the North American Treaty at all costs. The salvage team decides to try for the St Lawrence copy of the treaty on the grounds that this copy would have been packed in waterproof material to guard against the risk of damage on the sea voyage. Despite efforts by Shaw and hired thug Foss Gly to sabotage the project, the treaty is recovered, but it transpires that the waterproof covering was unable to withstand several decades of immersion and the document has turned to pulp. They then try to recover the Hudson copy, hoping that some freak of chance will have saved it from a similar fate. The atmosphere becomes increasingly panicked as extensive searches fail to discover any trace of the wrecked train, either in the wreckage of the bridge or elsewhere in the river. Extra suspense is provided by the mystery of the \\"ghost train\\" which on stormy nights howls up the abandoned trackbed and suddenly vanishes on reaching the site of the bridge. Pitt solves this particular mystery by chance - walking along the trackbed one night the \\"ghost train\\" passes him and he sees that it is faked by means of a locomotive headlight and a PA playing locomotive sounds running along a cableway strung above the trackbed. This gives him the clue as to the whereabouts of the real train - it was in fact the victim of an elaborate scheme to rob it of a cargo of bullion. One group of robbers demolished the bridge with black powder charges, then staged a holdup of the nearest station; while one of them kept the stationmaster at gunpoint on the floor, another, who remained outside, played a gramophone record of train sounds and flashed a lantern through the windows to give the impression of a passing train, misleading the stationmaster into thinking that he had failed to prevent the train tumbling off the downed bridge. In fact another group of robbers had hijacked the train further up the line, diverted it along a disused spur into an abandoned underground quarry, and then blown up the entrance to the quarry concealing the train and allowing them to remove the heavy load of bullion at their leisure through the quarry's old ventilation tunnels. Pitt locates the quarry and discovers that the robber gang had failed to ascertain whether the ventilation tunnels were actually passable; in fact they were flooded, trapping both robbers and train passengers in the quarry to starve to death. Pitt passes through the tunnels by means of diving equipment and finds the train. Shaw, meanwhile, has mined into the quarry from above and arrives at almost the same moment. There is a fight for the possession of the treaty - which is intact - and Pitt is victorious. Pitt races desperately to deliver the treaty to the President before he delivers a crucial address in which possession of the treaty will be decisive. He makes it by the skin of his teeth. The President receives the treaty, announces that from now on Canada and the U.S. will be united as \\"The United States of Canada\\". Heidi Milligan and Pitt say goodbye at John F. Kennedy Airport, where Pitt has arranged for Shaw (who is currently under arrest as an enemy agent) to also say goodbye. After Heidi leaves to board her plane, Pitt informs Shaw that he has arranged for Shaw's release and departure on the same plane with Heidi, claiming that \\"The President owes me a favor.\\" Shaw releases himself from his handcuffs and Pitt remarks, \\"James Bond would have been proud of you ... I hear you two were quite close.\\" ==Characters in \\"Night Probe!\\"== *Dirk Pitt – Special Projects Director for the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA) *Admiral James Sandecker – Chief director of NUMA *Al Giordino – Assistant special projects director for NUMA. *Rudi Gunn – Director of logistics for NUMA. *Heidi Milligan – U.S. Navy lieutenant commander working on her PhD in history in her spare time.

Most of the wreck was recovered save for the locomotive. Ironically, in 1989 (the year the novel takes place) it was discovered that the Kansas Pacific Railway had secretly recovered the locomotive and placed it back into service, yet still wrote it off and therefore committed insurance fraud. A further ironic point was that Canada would sever its last legal dependence on the British government in 1982, the year after the book was published, with the passage of the Canada Act. A unique facet to the Dirk Pitt novels is that they generally feature a prologue set in an earlier period of history than when the primary action is set. This period can be anywhere from a few dozen to a few thousand years in the past and generally sets up some important element of the primary plot that will later be revealed. In Night Probe! the prologue is set in May 1914 just prior to the outbreak of World War I. Several historical figures of the period are referenced fictionally including President Woodrow Wilson, Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan, British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, Canadian Prime Minister Robert Borden and King George V. Also a common feature of the Dirk Pitt novels are references and story themes based on maritime and ecological science. In Night Probe! the introduction of advanced Side-scan sonar technology to search for oil and other energy and mineral content below the surface of the sea is a primary plot device. ==Release details== *1981, USA, Bantam Books , August 1981, Hardback *1984, USA, Bantam Books (Reissue Edition) , June 1, 1984, Mass Market Paperback *1988, USA, Bantam Books , July 1988, Paperback Category:1981 American novels Category:Dirk Pitt novels Category:American adventure novels Category:American thriller novels Category:Canada–United States relations in popular culture Category:Novels set in New York (state) Category:Novels set in Canada Category:Novels set in Quebec Category:Fiction set in 1989 Category:Peak oil books Category:Viking Press books Category:Secret histories Category:Secret Intelligence Service in fiction ","title":"Night Probe!"},{"id":"3260851","text":"The Canon ELPH 490Z, sold as the IXUS Z90 in Europe and IXY G in Japan, was a compact Advanced Photo System point and shoot camera introduced in June 1996.

Photo taken in 2003 at Hilo, Hawai'i. Charles Nainoa Thompson (born March 11, 1953 in Oahu, Hawaii) is a Native Hawaiian navigator and the president of the Polynesian Voyaging Society. He is best known as the first Hawaiian to practice the ancient Polynesian art of navigation since the 14th century, having navigated two double-hulled canoes (the Hōkūle‘a and the Hawai'iloa) from Hawaii to other island nations in Polynesia without the aid of western instruments. ==Early life and career== Hokule'a sailing off Honolulu, 2009 Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Thompson is a descendant of Alexander Adams and James Harbottle, foreign advisors and harbor pilots of Kamehameha I. He graduated from Punahou School in 1972 and earned a BA in Ocean Science in 1986 from the University of Hawai\`i.Biography from Kamehameha Schools Thompson was trained by master navigator Mau Piailug from the island of Satawal. His first solo voyage was from Hawaiii to Tahiti in 1980. Since then, Thompson has been the lead navigator on the subsequent voyages of Hōkūle‘a, including the Voyage of Rediscovery from 1985 to 1987. On March 18, 2007, Thompson and four other Native Hawaiian navigators were inducted into Pwo as master navigators. The ceremony was conducted by Piailug on Satawal. ==Currently== Thompson currently serves as the Chair of the Board of Trustees for Kamehameha Schools (a post that his father Myron \\"Pinky\\" Thompson also held), and a member of the Board of Regents for the University of Hawaii. ==Family and personal life== Thompson is married to KHON-TV2 television anchor Kathy Muneno.

In this case, and subsequently in R v Smith (1992), R v B (KG) (1993), R v U (FJ) (1995), R v Starr (2000), and finally, R v Khelawon (2006), the Court developed the “principled approach” to hearsay, where hearsay statements can be admitted if they are sufficiently reliable and necessary. ==Background== In March 1985, Mrs. O and her three- and-half-year-old daughter T went to Dr. Khan for an examination. Khan first examined the daughter in front of her mother, then, while O was changing into hospital gowns in the other room, Khan was alone in his office with T for five to seven minutes. Roughly 15 minutes after leaving Khan's office, the child described to her mother how Khan had sexually assaulted her. A wet spot was found on the sleeve of T's jogging suit, which was later examined by a forensic biologist who determined that the fluid constituted a mixture of semen and saliva. Khan was charged with the assault. At trial, the judge held that the child was not competent to give unsworn testimony and that he would not admit the statements made by the child to her mother about the assault as it was hearsay and could not fall into the “spontaneous declaration” exception as it was not contemporaneous. On the basis of this finding, Khan was acquitted. On appeal, the Court of Appeal found that the trial judge had been too strict in the consideration of both testimony and the hearsay. The acquittal was overturned and a new trial ordered. The issues before the Court were: # Did the Court of Appeal err in concluding that the trial judge misdirected himself in ruling that the child witness was incompetent to give unsworn testimony? # Did the Court of Appeal err in holding, contrary to the ruling of the trial judge, that a \\"spontaneous declaration\\" allegedly made by the child to her mother after the alleged sexual assault was admissible? ==Reasons of the court== McLachlin, writing for a unanimous Court, held that the child was competent to testify and the statements should be admitted. On the first issue, McLachlin noted that the trial judge improperly applied section 16 of the Canada Evidence Act that gave the conditions under which a child can testify. The judge was wrong in finding that since the child did not understand what it meant to tell a lie in court that she could not give testimony. For a child to testify under section 16, the judge must only determine if the witness has sufficient intelligence and an understanding of the duty to tell the truth. Here, the judge found that both criteria were satisfied but inevitably placed too much emphasis on the child's age. McLachlin noted, as an issue of policy, leniency must be given to child testimony otherwise offences against children could never be prosecuted. On the second issue, McLachlin observed that the judge correctly applied the test for spontaneous declarations. To admit the statement as a \\"spontaneous declaration\\" would be to deform the exception beyond recognition. However, rather than have the issue disposed at this juncture, McLachlin went down a different route, changing the course of hearsay law for years to follow. She held that a \\"principled approach\\" must be taken to hearsay statements: if the statement was reliable and necessary, it should be admitted. In the instant case, the child, having aged considerably since the events, was unable to remember what happened, thus making the statement necessary. The statement was deemed reliable for a number of reasons: T should not have had an awareness of the type of acts that had taken place at her young age, she made the statement without any prompting from her mother, and she was disinterested in the litigation, in that she had no reason to lie to her mother and was not aware of the implications of what had happened to her. Finally, T's statement was corroborated by the semen found on her sleeve. ==See also== *List of Supreme Court of Canada cases (Lamer Court) ==External links== * *Child Witness Project Category:Canadian evidence case law Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases Category:1990 in Canadian case law ","title":"R v Khan"},{"id":"3260875","text":"The collared peccary (Dicotyles tajacu) is a species of mammal in the family Tayassuidae found in North, Central, and South America. They are commonly referred to as javelina, saíno, or báquiro, although these terms are also used to describe other species in the family. The species is also known as the musk hog. In Trinidad, it is colloquially known as quenk. Although somewhat related to the pigs and frequently referred to as one, this species and the other peccaries are no longer classified in the pig family, Suidae. ==Description== Dentition, as illustrated in Knight's Sketches in Natural History The collared peccary stands around tall at the shoulder and is about long. It weighs between . The dental formula is: 2/3,1/1,3/3,3/3. The collared peccary has small tusks that point toward the ground when the animal is upright. It also has slender legs with a robust or stocky body. The tail is often hidden in the coarse fur of the peccary. ==Range and habitat== The collared peccary is a widespread creature found throughout much of the tropical and subtropical Americas, ranging from the Southwestern United States to northern Argentina in South America. They have been reintroduced to Uruguay in 2017, after 100 years of extinction. The only Caribbean island where it is native, however, is Trinidad. It was once and until fairly recently also extant on the nearby island of Tobago, but is now exceedingly rare (if not locally extirpated) due to overhunting by humans. It inhabits deserts and xeric shrublands, tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands, flooded grasslands and savannas, tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests, and several other habitats, as well. In addition, it is well adapted to habitats shared by humans, merely requiring sufficient cover; they can be found in cities and agricultural land throughout their range, where they consume garden plants. Notable populations are known to exist in the suburbs of Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona. ==Diet== Collared peccaries are omnivorous. They normally feed on cactus, mesquite beans, fruits, roots, tubers, palm nuts, grasses, invertebrates, and small vertebrates. In areas inhabited by humans, they also consume cultivated crops and ornamental plants, such as tulip bulbs. ==Behaviour== Collared peccaries are diurnal creatures that live in groups of up to 50 individuals, averaging between six and 9 members. They sleep in burrows, often under the roots of trees, but sometimes can be found in caves or under logs. However, collared peccaries are not completely diurnal. In central Arizona, they are often active at night, but less so in daytime. Although they usually ignore humans, they will react if they feel threatened. They defend themselves with their tusks. A collared peccary can release a strong musk or give a sharp bark if it is alarmed. ==Gallery== File:Collared peccaries as seen by a fixed camera in Scottsdale, Arizona.webmA herd seen by a fixed camera in Scottsdale, Arizona File:Running Javelina.jpgRunning collared peccary File:Mother javelina and baby.jpgMother and juvenile File:Ancestral Pueblo, Roosevelt black on white javelina effigy canteen, 1250-1300 CE, Heard Museum.JPGA Pueblo drinking vessel ==References== ==External links== * Smithsonian Institution - North American Mammals: Pecari tajacu * Smithsonian Wild: Pecari tajacu *Arizona Game and Fish Department – Living With Javelina Peccary, Collared Category:Mammals of the United States Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Category:Mammals described in 1758 Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Collared peccary"},{"id":"3260887","text":"The Battle of Meung-sur-Loire took place on 15 June 1429. It was one of Joan of Arc's battles following relief of the siege at Orléans. This campaign was the second sustained French offensive in a generation in the Hundred Years' War. ==Background== Meung-sur-Loire (now in Loiret) was a small town on the northern bank of the Loire river in central France, slightly west of Orléans. It controlled a bridge of strategic significance during the latter part of the war. Captured by the English a few years earlier as a staging point for a planned invasion of southern France, the French offensive recaptured the bridge and hampered English movement south of the river during the campaign. The French Loire Campaign of 1429 consisted of five actions: :1. The Siege of Orléans. :2. The Battle of Jargeau. :3. The Battle of Meung-sur-Loire. :4. The Battle of Beaugency. :5. The Battle of Patay. Virtually all of France north of the Loire had fallen to foreign occupation by the end of 1428. The bridge at Orléans had been destroyed shortly before the siege lifted. The French had lost control of all other river crossings. Three swift and numerically small battles at Jargeau, Meung-sur-Loire, and Beaugency demonstrated renewed French confidence and laid the groundwork for subsequent French offenses on Rheims and Paris. The Loire campaign killed, captured, or disgraced a majority of the top tier of English commanders and decimated the numbers of the highly skilled English longbowmen. ==Tactics== English defenses at Meung-sur-Loire consisted of three components: the walled town, the fortification at the bridge, and a large walled castle just outside the town. The castle served as headquarters to the English command of John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury and Thomas Scales. Joan of Arc and Duke John II of Alençon controlled a force that included captains Jean d'Orléans, Gilles de Rais, Jean Poton de Xaintrailles, and La Hire. Estimates of numerical strength vary with the Journal du Siège d'Orléans citing 6,000 – 7,000 for the French. A number that large probably counts non-combatants. Bypassing the city and the castle, they staged a frontal assault on the bridge fortifications, conquered it in one day, and installed a garrison. This hampered English movement south of the Loire. ==Bibliography== * Devries, Kelly. Joan of Arc: A Military Leader (Gloucestershire: Sutton Publishing, 1999). * Richey, Stephen W.

(CBC.ca). *01 ","title":"January 2006 in sports"},{"id":"3260913","text":"Ángela Meyer (born August 2, 1947) is a Puerto Rican actress, comedian and producer of television and theatrical works. Meyer is the founder and/or co- founder of various entertainment production companies. Among the production companies which have been associated with Meyer are Meca Productions which produced theater and television productions and Meyer de Jesus Productions which produced soap operas. ==Early years== Meyer was born as Ángela del Carmen Maurano Debén in Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico. Her mother, Margot Debén, was a Puerto Rican actress and comedian, and her father Mario Maurano, was a musician and native of Argentina. Meyer was 18 months old when her parents divorced and with her mother went to Colombia to live with her mother's brother Luis Ricardo Debén, a magician known as \\"Richardine\\". She was raised by her uncle and considered him her father. She made her debut on the stage before she was two years old in one of her uncle's presentations. Her mother remarried and returned to Puerto Rico leaving her daughter behind in her uncle's care. She continued to perform with her uncle in South America until 1968 when she returned to the island to live with her mother and stepfather. In Puerto Rico, she received her secondary education.Ángela Meyer profile, aarp.org; accessed December 6, 2017. ==Television debut== In 1973, Meyer traveled throughout Europe and the Middle East performing with her uncle. In 1968 she returned to the island, where her comic talent was recognized by Puerto Rican comedian José Miguel Agrelot. He invited her to participate in his show Ja, ja, ji, ji, jo, jo con Agrelot and when Tommy Muniz started his production of 'telenovelas' she became one of its young leading ladies. She adopted her first husband's surname, \\"Mayer\\", and changed to \\"Meyer\\" (he died in an airplane crash) which she was to use as her stagename. She also auditioned and was cast in minor roles in the soap operas Marcelo y Marcelino and Mujeres sin hombre (Women without men). Meyer's talent as an actress was soon recognized and she was cast in the lead roles of Tomiko, El Ultimo Adios (The Last Good-bye), Rebelde (Rebel) and Un Amante al rojo vivo (A red-hot lover). ==Soap operas== In the soap opera (The son of Angela Maria), Meyer was cast (in blackface) in the role of \\"Chianita\\", a poor black country girl who, despite the fact that she never attended school, was a very wise person with a sense of humor. The character of Chianita was to change the life of Meyer forever. The character was so loved by the Puerto Rican public that Meyer continued to make public presentations in various television shows such as Luis Vigoreaux's El Show del Mediodia. As Chianita, Meyer recorded three albums, including \\"Chianita Gobernadora\\" in 1973, which sold over 100,000 copies. Some people even wanted Chianita to run for governor, becoming a part of Puerto Rican folklore. However, the black makeup she used provoked an allergy on Meyer's face and in 1984 Chianita made her last public appearance. Meyer participated as actress and assistant producer in the soap operas Primera Fila (First Row) and El Regreso (The Return). Puerto Rican artists were beginning to face the dilemma of local television stations importing soap operas from Mexico and Venezuela which were more cost efficient. Meyer and her friend and fellow actress, Camille Carrión, founded Meca Productions with the idea of producing theater and television productions. Their first theater production was Casa de Mujeres (House of Women), which went on for 105 presentations. They also produced for Tele-Once the show Ellas al Mediodia and the soap operas La Isla (The Island), Ave de paso and Yara Prohibida. ==Meyer de Jesus Productions== In 1988, Meyer founded \\"Meyer de Jesus Productions\\" (Jesus is her second husband's surname), after Meca Productions was dissolved. She joined Telemundo and produced three series based on historical events: Mission Cumplida (Mission Accomplished) based on the events which took place at the Cerro Maravilla, Gaviota de Esperanza based on the life of Sandra Zaiter and Hasta el fondo del dolor based on the life of Sylvia Rexach, portrayed by Sylvia's own daughter, Puerto Rican actress & singer, Sharon Riley and Adamari López, as Sharon. During this decade she became very active in theatrical presentations. One of her most acclaimed works was the monologue: Tengamos Sexo en Paz (Let's make love in peace). She served in the Department of Puerto Rican Culture for the city of San Juan (1995-96) and as advisor for cultural and educational events in 2000, for the city of Bayamón.

Bau rose to prominence in the mid-1800s and became Fiji's dominant power; until its cession to Britain, it has maintained its influence in politics and leadership right through to modern Fiji. ==Territories and landmarks== Bau is the capital of the Kubuna Confederacy (Kubuna Tribe) and the chiefly centre of Tailevu Province. It is divided into three villages - Bau, Lasakau and Soso. Among Bau’s landmarks are Fiji’s oldest Christian church and a stone on which the skulls of cannibalism victims were crushed. ==Chiefly titles== Significant chiefly titles from Bau include the Vunivalu (considered to be Fiji’s premier chiefly title), and the Roko Tui Bau, currently held by Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi, the former Vice-President of Fiji. The village of Lasekau who are inhabited by the clan Nabou (referred to as \\"Na Bai kei Bau\\") is ruled by the Komai Nadrukuta. The village of Soso is occupied by the clan Rara, often referred to as the Rara o Soso and is headed by the Tunidau. ==Language== The Fijian language has many dialects, but the official standard is based on the speech of Bau.Lewis, M. Paul (ed.), 2009. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. Online version: http://www.ethnologue.com/. ==History== Bau, the capital of Feejee (1848) It was at Kubuna that the great ancestral chief, Ratu VuetiTukutuku Raraba – History of Bau, page 1, chapter 1, National Archives Fiji Koroi-Ratu mai Bulu, Serui-Ratu mai Bulu, the first Roko Tui Bau Vuani- ivi (according to the legend he was the fourth generation from Ratu Lutunasobasoba) established the Kingdom of Kubuna and formed one of the earliest known Fijian settlements after hostilities ceased the people of Nakauvadra and the victorious Bauan army upon leaving the mountains and finding their way to the sea made a Cairn named Ulunivuaka\\"Fiji Page 54\\" A History of Fiji ,Chapter 4 Page 54 and 55 and later called it Bau in honour of Ratu Vueti and his achievements. It was named after a shrine in the Nakauvadra range. He took the titles of Roko Tui Bau Vuani-ivi and Koroi Ratu Maibulu. After his death, he was buried in Kubuna. After his death, a division arose between Bucaira and Vunibuca over the installation of a successor to Ratu Vueti. Other clans went to Namuka and wandered from place to place. Eventually, a new Roko Tui Bau, Ratu Serumataidrau, was selected from the Vuaniivi, a Tokatoka Valelevu of the Mataqali and the Yavusa Ratu Vuani-ivi Buca clan, which had settled at Namuka.Ai Tukutuku Kei Viti - By Rev. Epeli Rokowaqa Naulivou was installed in 1791 as the Vunivalu (in modern Fiji this is now the highest chiefly title in the Kingdom of Kubuna, but was not so in Fiji's early history) after the death of his father BanuveFiji and the Fijians Volume 1, Page 19 who had three sons: Naulivou, Tanoa II and Celua in 1791. Ratu Raiwalui of the Roko Tui Bau Vuaniivi Clan, Yavusa-Ratu, became the sixth Roko Tui Bau Vuani-Ivi which was the highest chiefly title in the greater area of Kubuna and the second Roko Tui Bau Vuani-Ivi that occupied the Island Delainakorolevu or Ulunivuaka,A History of Fiji ,Chapter 4 Page 54 & 55 which was then called Bau in 1760 which was named by the fifth Roko Tui Bau Vuani- ivi Ratu Lele who was then buried at Delai Daku. The relationship between these two men was not a happy one. When they came into conflict, the Vuaniivi clan fled to Kubuna and sought the protection of Titokobitu, the Chief of Namara. Together with some other chiefs of Namara, they reached Koro and from there went to Vuna, on the island of Taveuni, and thence to Vanuabalavu. The Namara people who later joined their early travellers now of Levukana village on Lomaloma were left behind at Vuna and they fled to the mountains lest the Bauans should pursue them. The Vuaniivi warriors left some of their war canoes high and dry on the beach at Vuna when they set off for Vanuabalavu. With the aid of Charlie Savage, who brought firearms to Bau, opportunities for new wealth and power, symbolized by the acquisition of muskets, intensified political rivalries and hastened the rise of the Kingdom of Bau, ruled by Naulivou as Vunivalu and then by his nephew Cakobau. By the 1850s Bau dominated western Fiji. Cakobau’s main rival was the Tongan chief Enele Ma'afu, who led an army of Christian Tongans and their allies from eastern Fiji. After a short-lived alliance with Ma’afu, Cakobau became a Christian in 1854. The Bauan people quickly established themselves as an undefeatable military force. With that unmatched power, Seru Epenisa Cakobau was able to unite all of Fiji’s disparate tribes under his authority in 1871.Encyclopædia Britannica ==See also== * Lasakau sea warriors ==Footnotes== ==References== * Gone Native in Polynesia: Captivity Narratives and Experiences from the South Pacific (Page 24, 64, 121) - by Ian Christopher Campbell - 1998 - 167 pages * James Calvert ; Or, From Dark to Dawn in Fiji - Page 44, by R.

In his native country he is widely known under the nickname Rambo while in Brazil he is known as Pet. He played six times for the FR Yugoslavia, scoring one goal. Petković played for seven Brazilian clubs in his career, and was made an honorary consul of Serbia in Brazil. ==Early life== Born to father Dobrivoje (traffic technician from Niš) and mother Milena (construction technician from Petrovac na Mlavi) who met in the small mining town of Majdanpek where they both arrived in search of work, young Dejan immediately took to football. ==Club career== ===Radnički Niš=== Petković's playing career started in 1988 at Radnički Niš. In the same year, he met his future wife Violeta. He became the youngest player ever to play an official match in the history of old Yugoslav First League, debuting on 25 September 1988 when he was 16 years and 15 days old, against Željezničar Sarajevo\\"A boa vida dos gringos\\", Placar nº. 1239, September 2002, Editora Abril, pp. 48–49. thus beating Mitar Mrkela's record by 1 day. Radnički ended up winning 4–0 in that match. Petković's age record has since been broken by Slavko Perović and Danijel Aleksić. Petković still helps his first club,\\"Petkovício\\", Rafael Maranhão, Placar nº. 1289, December 2005, Editora Abril, pp. 62–67. which has since then declined. ===Red Star Belgrade=== In July 1992, Petković was bought by Red Star Belgrade. Though not even 20 years of age, he arrived with a reputation as a skilled technical playmaker. As established Yugoslav internationals such as Dejan Savićević, Darko Pančev, Vladimir Jugović, and Siniša Mihajlović left the club during the same summer, Petković was given a first-team run straight away by new head coach Milan Živadinović, appearing in 30 league matches and scoring 5 goals in his first season in Belgrade. He ended up staying with Red Star until December 1995 (three and a half seasons), winning two Yugoslav First League titles. His transfer to Real Madrid was principally agreed during summer 1995, but Red Star decided to hang on to him for the 1995–96 UEFA Cup where the club expected to do well after finally being allowed back on the European scene following years of sporting sanctions due to regional conflicts. However, Red Star was eliminated by Swiss club Neuchâtel Xamax in the preliminary round. ===Real Madrid=== In December 1995, 23-year-old Petković joined the Spanish giants Real Madrid. At the time of his arrival, the club was not where it wanted to be in the league, hovering just outside the European spots in 6th and 7th place. Playing under head coach Jorge Valdano, Rambo made his league debut on 17 December versus Celta de Vigo as a 65th minute sub for the legendary club veteran Míchel as Madrid won 1–0 at home. Petkovic would see action again on 3 January at home versus Real Valladolid — Madrid was comfortably 4–1 ahead when Valdano threw Petković on for Iván Zamorano in the 61st minute. What would turn out to be Petković's last appearance of the season for the club came the following week away at lowly CP Mérida — Real let the 0–2 lead slip by conceding two goals and in the 81st minute Valdano sent Petković in for Freddy Rincón in search of a goal, but the score stayed 2–2. Within a fortnight Petković was loaned out to Sevilla before being able to have a first-team run during his one month at the Bernabeu. ====Loan to Sevilla==== Arriving to Estadio Sánchez Pizjuán in mid-January 1996, Petković was once again parachuted into a club battling turmoil. Sevilla was barely above the relegation zone with head coach Juan Carlos Álvarez (already their second head coach of the season) on thin ice. Juan Carlos gave his new Serbian acquisition his debut at home on 24 January vs Albacete as a starter. Playing upfront with Davor Šuker as strike partner, Petković had an average outing as Sevilla drew 1–1 with Castillan visitors, which cost head coach Juan Carlos his job. Four days later away at Real Sociedad, new head coach Víctor Espárrago gave Petković the starting assignment again alongside Šuker, but subbed him off for Ramón \\"Monchu\\" Suárez Del Valle early into the second half in the 53rd minute. The next week versus Racing de Santander, Petković was moved back into attacking midfielder role just behind Šuker and Monchu, however Sevilla again lost 0–1 while Petković got subbed off in the 59th minute. The following week Petković got relegated to the bench, only getting a bit part as an 89th-minute sub as Sevilla improbably triumphed away at league- leaders Atletico Madrid, however, the week after that he was back in the starting assignment. Petković finished out the 1995–1996 La Liga season in Sevilla, appearing in 8 league matches (7 as a starter) and scoring 1 goal. ====Return==== During summer 1996, Petković returned from the loan spell in Sevilla. The Real squad that he returned to was radically different from the one he left six months earlier: starting with new head coach Fabio Capello over to attack-minded left back Roberto Carlos from Inter Milan, right back Christian Panucci from AC Milan, attacking midfielder Clarence Seedorf from Sampdoria right down to the all new forward line with Petković's former teammate Šuker from Sevilla, and fellow Yugoslav Predrag Mijatović from Valencia. The competition for spots up front thus got even tougher. Despite having a reputation for cautious and defensive football, Capello played a three-man attack of Raúl, Mijatović, and Šuker, with Seedorf just behind them. It became clear that Capello was not counting on Petković, as he did not play a match until coming on as late substitute in the fourth match of the season.Real Madrid-Rayo Vallecano 1:0;La Liga, 22 September 1996. Retrieved 27 October 2017. A week later Petković came on as a late substitute at Real OviedoReal Oviedo-Real Madrid 2:3;La Liga, 29 September 1996. Retrieved 27 October 2017. for his last Madrid appearance. ====Loan to Santander==== Petković got loaned out to Racing de Santander in January 1997. He then briefly returned to Real before being discovered by Vitória in a friendly tournament in which both clubs were involved. along with Real Mallorca and Flamengo. ===Vitória=== He joined Vitória along with Bebeto and Túlio Costa, the three signed for the club thanks to the sponsorship of Banco Excel.\\"500 Times do Brasil\\", Placar nº. 1263-A, October 2003, Editora Abril, pp. 20 In the rubro-negro baiano he started his successful Brazilian career, winning two Bahia State Championships and a Copa do Nordeste. He stayed until 1999 at Vitória, when he joined Venezia of Italy, after an 8 billion lire transfer. ===Flamengo=== Petkovic did not succeed at Venezia, and quickly returned to Brazil, where he joined Flamengo of Rio de Janeiro. In Flamengo his skills were fundamental in helping the team win the last two titles of the historic three in a row series against arch-rivals Vasco, from 1999 to 2001. One month later, another free kick goal by Petkovic, against São Paulo, allowed Flamengo to win the Copa dos Campeões and return to Copa Libertadores next year. Hugely popular at the time, he was known as \\"Pet\\" by the supporters. However, at 2001 Campeonato Brasileiro, Flamengo finished only one position above the relegated teams. The club also lost, in January 2002, the Copa Mercosul final against the Argentine side San Lorenzo, in a match in which Petkovic was sent off. ===Vasco da Gama=== In 2002, he moved to Vasco da Gama, where he stayed until 2004. He played for a short time at the Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua during this period where he won the 2003 league title with them. Unfortunately, in 2013 the Chinese Football Association would revoke the league title after it was discovered the Shenhua General manager Lou Shifang had bribed officials to be biased to Shenhua in games that season. During his second spell at Vasco he helped his team avoid relegation at Campeonato Brasileiro, being the club's top scorer and top assistant.\\"Salvo pelo gringo\\", Placar nº. 1278-A, January 2005, Editora Abril, pp. 53 Vasco failed to record a win the 10 matches without Petkovic, acquiring only 10% of available points; with him the cruzmaltinos obtained 45.7% of these points. After helping them stay up, Petković was awarded Bola de Prata from the Placar magazine as one of the two best midfielders in the league. During that year he often played with an ex- teammate from Radnički, Montenegrin goalkeeper Željko Tadić, who was scouted by him.\\"Vai dar suco?\\", Lédio Carmona, Placar nº. 1292, March 2006, Editora Abril, pp. 73. ===Fourth team in Brazil: Fluminense=== After a half-year in Saudi Arabia, where he played for Al-Ittihad, he returned to Rio de Janeiro in August 2005, now to play for Fluminense. Already 33 years old, Petković had to face a certain mistrust from the club's fans due to his association with Flamengo. However, his amazing performance in his third match against Cruzeiro Esporte Clube, put an end to fan's misgivings, as he scored twice in a 6–2 away win. His first was the 1000th goal score by the Fluminense in the Brazilian Championship, earning Petković a commemorative plate in his honour at the club's headquarters. In this goal, Petkovic passed through three opponents in a short space, shooting just in time to avoid the oncoming goalkeeper. In the second one, he placed a powerful left-foot shot from outside the penalty box.\\"Petkovic – O gringo mais brasileiro\\", Sérgio Xavier Filho, Placar nº. 1287, October 2005, Editora Abril, pp. 16. After other great exhibitions, he received his second consecutive Silver Ball in the Brazilian federation annual award ceremony. After a bad season in 2006, when Fluminense had to fight relegation, he left the club. ===Other clubs=== In 2007, he played at Santos after signing a short term deal from Goiás until the end of the 2007 season. In 2008, Petkovic played for Atlético Mineiro, signed in late March 2008 as the great star of the club's centennial celebrations. Nevertheless, his contract was not renewed at the end of the season on orders from the newly arrived coach, Emerson Leão who previously also released Petković from Santos when he arrived there in December 2007. ===Return to Flamengo=== On 20 May 2009 Flamengo announced the free transfer signing of Petkovic, despite previously having taken the club to court over unpaid wages in the amount of US$9 million. Though the two parties managed to settle the outstanding financial issues out of court prior to his signing, Petković's return was still met with a lot of scepticism, even outright opposition, from many people within the club as well as outside observers all of whom had doubts about his ability to perform at such an age. Some also expressed concern over the fact that he missed the Rio de Janeiro state championship part of the season, meaning that he hadn't played any competitive football in the 6 months since his dismissal from Mineiro. However, much to the surprise of many people, 37-year-old Petkovic played a pivotal role for Flamengo, scoring 8 goals (including 2 direct from corners) and leading the club's challenge to eventually win its fifth Brazilian Championship title, the first of his career. He overcame being left out of the team by manager Cuca when his replacement in July, Andrade, included him in the team and allowed him to help the club rise from 14th place. Petkovic was praised by the Brazilian press for a number of outstanding performances, including a brace he scored in round 30 for a 2–0 win away at league leaders Palmeiras on 18 October 2009, as well as his round 34 contribution on 8 November away at Atlético Mineiro where the team recorded important 1–3 win. On 20 November 2009 he was inducted into the Brazilian Hall of Fame in the Maracana, thus becoming only the fifth non- Brazilian and third European to receive such an honour in Brazil. Then on 7 December, as the season finished and Flamengo celebrated their title, Petković won the traditional Bola de Prata (Silver Ball) organized by the sports magazine Placar and ESPN Brasil for best midfielder of the 2009 Brazilian Championship. It was the third time that he was awarded the prize. Starting the new season from the very beginning, Petkovic entered his first match of the 2010 Rio state championship as a late substitute and scored a goalPetkovic for 1–3 at Volta Redonda on what was virtually his first touch of the contest at Volta Redonda on 20 January 2010. On 5 June 2011, Petković retired as a professional player after playing the first half of the league match against Corinthians. To commemorate his retirement, all Flamengo players had Petkovic's name on the back of their jerseys in the match. ==International career== Petković started playing by SFR Yugoslavia youth teams when he was 15 years old. In that age, he even scored one of the fastest goals in football, after just three seconds in a match against Cyprus. He was later called to 1992 Toulon Tournament, alongside players like Savo Milošević, Zoran Mirković, Željko Cicović, Elvir Bolić, Spira Grujić, Mitko Stojkovski, Srđan Bajčetić, Miladin Bečanović, Igor Taševski, Sretko Vuksanović and Željko Tadić. His team made a runner-up campaign, in which Petković scored two goals in a 3–0 triumph over United States (against players such as Brad Friedel, Claudio Reyna, Alexi Lalas and Cobi Jones). While still playing in that youth tournament, he received his first call up to the senior national team, being included for the UEFA Euro 1992 squad. Yugoslav coaches had already called eighteen from the twenty allowed players, without Croats, keeping some Macedonians, two Slovenes and just one Bosniak alongside the Serbs and Montenegrins. It was expected that the later two players would be Miroslav Đukić and Dragiša Binić, but Petković and Slobodan Krčmarević were included instead, at 29 May, just two days after that 3–0 winning game against USA at the Toulon Tournament. He and Krčmarević then came immediately to Sweden, where their teammates were already preparing for the Euro. But Yugoslavia would be suspended at 31 May due to its civil wars, just ten days before the opening match. After that, Petković was called to FR Yugoslavia first matches after its banning, in December 1994, although staying in the bench – curiously, the first match of Yugoslav return was against Brazil. In a South American tour, the second match would be against Argentina. In that day, Petković started disagreements with the then coach Slobodan Santrač. The player was praised in the training sessions and, under Santrač's orders, warmed up from the 30th minute to the 80th one and then decided to seat, as thinking he would not play anymore. Santrač was disgusted and called another reserve to enter;Dejan Petković – um carioca raro (December 2009). Revista ESPN n. 2. Ed Spring, pp. 20–21 it was Darko Kovačević, who mad his senior debut as replacing Predrag Mijatović. After two another matches without being used, Petković then earned his first cap on 31 March 1995, against Uruguay, in Belgrade. He was included in the starting players as of the next Yugoslav match, against Russia. In his second cap, he scored a goal just one minute after a Valery Karpin one, but Yugoslavia still lost by 2–1. Petković also played the three later matches of Yugoslavia in 1995. All of them were winnings in away fields. In the last 1995 match, however, he again had disagreements with Santrač, even after giving three assists and scoring an incorrectly invalid goal. After such a performance, the player did not like criticism from the coach, who appointed two wrong passes of Petković, who did objections to Santrač qualities. Petković still received a Santrač call up for a match against Romania in March 1996, after some good initial performances for Real Madrid and Sevilla. It was the first 1996 game of Yugoslav team. However, two weeks before it, in a Sevilla training, Petković suffered a serious injury which would withdraw him for the rest of the season. Santrač would not call him anymore and the player did not took part in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. It was only after Milan Živadinović took the helm of the Yugoslavia national team that Petković earned another chance with his national side – curiously, in another friendly against Brazil, in September 1998. Playing for Vitória at the time, Petković traveled to São Luís in the same flight as the Brazilian team. He was even a starting player in a 1–1 draw, being later replaced by Saša Ćurčić. It would be his last official match for the national team. Because of that, Petković later expressed his belief in being called up for that game just because he would be a good Portuguese language translator to Yugoslav crew. He still later played another two unofficial matches for Yugoslavia, in December 1999, under Vujadin Boškov rule. Petković was a starting player and even captain against Canary Islands (scoring a goal in a 2–2 draw against Luis Molowny coached players) and Catalonia (a 1–0 defeat). He was meanwhile a Venezia player, but some days later he left Italy to play again in Brazil, for Flamengo. Some also blame Petković's few and far in between call-ups on the fact he played for Brazilian sides most of his career, and thus was not always readily available for Yugoslavian coaches to watch him perform, evidenced by the fact he was omitted by Boškov from the Euro 2000 roster after coming to Flamengo. Furthermore, Petković declared in an interview to Placar magazine that he was more likely to get a call-up had he stayed at Venezia, a club he regarded as \\"ten times weaker club than Flamengo\\". Petković was also rumoured to not have very favorable relationships with the Football Association of Yugoslavia, yet another speculation for his few caps. According to him and his family, another reason was his denial in accept bribes charged by high ranked Federation officials. In 2004, some have even felt Petković would have made the Seleção if he were Brazilian. To that end, after the changing of the former FR Yugoslavia into Serbia and Montenegro the previous year, he publicized his dream in being picked by the Brazil national side,\\"Pátria amada, Brasil\\", Flávia Ribeiro, Placar nº. 1274, September 2004, Editora Abril, pp. 50–53. but he did not have Brazilian citizenship. In 2006, a campaign in his native country urged the Serbian FA to select Petković for Serbia and Montenegro's final roster for the World Cup in Germany. Striker Savo Milošević even went as far as saying Petković would be a welcome addition. In January 2006, it was announced that Petković would be called up for friendly matches in February, but nothing ever came of it. The then Serbia and Montenegro coach Ilija Petković, who is not a relative of him, thought Dejan Petković would disrupt the team's harmony, as he had a reputation for having a very loud personality. However, even before the nation upcoming final breakup, the harmony was disrupted by the coach himself, after Ilija called his son Dušan Petković, a defender who played just a few matches until 2004 for the team, to replace the injured forward Mirko Vučinić. Embarrassed after huge criticism, Dušan asked to not take part of the squad. In a first moment, it was believed that the replacement player would be Dejan Petković, as he told in 2018 to El País journal: \\"I came from a fantastic 2005 Campeonato Brasileiro for Fluminense. My matches in Brazil were broadcast in Serbia. The whole country asked my calling up. They always created an excuse to not bring me. When the Cup squad list was launched, people asked themselves why I was not selected. In those days, Zico said that Serbia would win the Cup: 'they have 23 players better them Pet'. So, Vučinić injured himself. And then they announced the substitute: 'D. Petković'. Some people started calling to congrat me, but, actually, the chosen one was Dušan Petković, the coach's son. He exchanged a forward for a defender. It resounded so negatively, reaching the point that, in the preparation for the Cup, the boy could not stand the pressure and left, ashamed of being there. We played the Cup with one player less. They never gave me an official statement. Off the records, they told that, if they call up me, I would have to play. Unfortunately, I lost two World Cups. I joined the select group of the good players who never played a World Cup. I have not any frustration for not playing the Cup, because it was not a failure of mine. In football, a few people have power to ruin a lot ot things. The people who managed my country team did bad things to me, the institution itself did not. I do not hold any sorrow\\". Petković retired from professional football without ever playing for the White Eagles. In 2009, Serbia coach Radomir Antić praised Petković's success as an incoming 2009 Brazilian champion for Flamengo, but confirmed the player's too unlikely chances in being included for 2010 FIFA World Cup. Petković never had such expectations anymore, feeling himself too old as having 37 years: \\"I would like having ten years less to at least go to a World Cup\\", he said while celebrating his country confirmation to South Africa. He just kept some desire in playing a last friendly match for his national team. ==Playing style== He is considered one of the best foreign players to have played in Brazil, a great free and corner kicker and passer. In 2006 while playing for Fluminense, he scored a goal directly from a corner against Grêmio. In the next game, he scored another, but the ball hit the hand of a player from Fluminense and entered the goal; nonetheless, the officials counted it as one. Overall, he scored eight goals from corner kicks in his career, the last one on 8 November 2009 for Flamengo against Atlético Mineiro in the Brazilian Série A. He is currently the record holder for most goals from corners scored in football history. ==Legacy== *His form in the first half of 2001 preceded the arrival of five more Serbs to Brazilian football. Željko Tadić (who would play later with Petkovic at Vasco), Miodrag Anđelković, Nikola Damjanac, Vladimir Đorđević, Dejan Osmanović, and Vladimir Petković (unrelated to Dejan Petkovic). *In November 2009, following Petković's pinnacle season at Flamengo, Serbian film director Darko Bajić started shooting a documentary on Petković's life and career path. Initially with the working title of Rambo Petković – 90 minuta sa produžecima, životni meč and later O Gringo, the film is meant to be shown before the 2010 World Cup. Apparently, the director wanted to make the film ever since Petković's initial successes with Flamengo in 2001, but the player wasn't thrilled with the idea. Petković eventually agreed during his second stint with Flamengo. The yet unfinished movie was promoted in Belgrade on 29 December 2009. *His pivotal role in Flamengo's road to its fifth league title motivated a pop song, \\"É o Pet\\". *Although his return home to possibly finish out his career with Red Star and/or perhaps take an administrative role in the club once his playing career is over was occasionally mentioned in Serbian media, Petković said in early 2010 that he'll continue living in Brazil even after stopping playing.

His father worked as a train conductor. Otto Schmirgal trained as a lathe operator. Following the frontier changes mandated by the Treaty of Versailles, the family home became part of Poland. Surviving family members, comprising eighteen-year-old Schmirgal, his mother and four younger siblings, were obliged to flee to the west, ending up in Reppen. There Schmirgal initially worked on the railways, later becoming an industrial enamel burner. He moved around in search of work, but because of his trade union activities he lost jobs with two firms, the first in Küstrin and in the second Thüringen. Ultimately he relocated to Berlin in 1924 and, from 1927, was employed at the Berliner Verkehrsgesellschaft (BVG / The Berlin Public Transport organisation). A member of the Communist Party of Germany from 1925, he was elected as its candidate to the Prussian Landtag in 1932. He was among the strike leaders when the BVG's workforce struck in November of that year. In January 1933 the NSDAP (Nazi Party) took power and lost little time in switching to one-party government in Germany. While all political parties other than the Nazi Party were banned, the new chancellor, Adolf Hitler was particularly vitriolic in his opposition to the Communist Party. Starting in October 1933, Otto Schmirgal was repeatedly arrested by Nazi authorities and detained in Nazi concentration camps. During an intervening period, after September 1934, he worked in Autobahn construction as a relief worker. During the Second World War, he worked in the antifascist group led by Robert Uhrig. In February 1942, he was arrested once more. In September 1944, he was sentenced to death by the Volksgerichtshof and executed at Brandenburg-Görden Prison. His grave is located at the Seestraße city urn cemetery in Berlin- Wedding. ==External links== *Page about a street named after Otto Schmirgal ==References== Category:1900 births Category:1944 deaths Category:People from Zbąszyń Category:Communist Party of Germany politicians Category:People condemned by Nazi courts Category:People from the Province of Posen Category:Executed communists in the German Resistance Category:Prussian politicians Category:German people executed by Nazi Germany ","title":"Otto Schmirgal"},{"id":"3260948","text":"Ragna (Ragnheiður) Sigurðardóttir (born in Reykjavík on 10 August 1962) is an Icelandic writer, translator and artist.

It was painted in about 1599, and is held in the Museo del Prado, Madrid. Two later versions of the same theme are currently to be seen in Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (David with the Head of Goliath), and in Rome's Galleria Borghese (David with the Head of Goliath). The David and Goliath in the Prado was painted in the early part of the artist's career, while he was a member of the household of Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte. It shows the Biblical David as a young boy (in accordance with the Bible story) fastening the head of the champion of the Philistines, the giant Goliath, by the hair. The light catches on David's leg, arm and flank, on the massive shoulders from which Goliath's head has been severed, and on the head itself, but everything else is dark. Even David's face is almost invisible in the shadows. A wound on Goliath's forehead shows where he has been felled by the stone from David's sling. The overwhelming impression is of some action intensely personal and private - no triumph, no armies, no victory. Caravaggio originally showed Goliath's face fixed in wild-eyed open-mouthed terror, tongue rolling, eyeballs swivelled to the edges of the sockets. In the finished painting the melodrama is banished: the drama is transferred from Goliath to the quietly efficient David, his face almost hidden, intent on his work with his hands in his enemy's hair, kneeling almost casually on the man's torso. This painting and two others done at about the same time – the first version of Sacrifice of Isaac and the first John the Baptist – were taken to Spain shortly after they were made, where they were frequently copied and made a deep impression on art in that country. ==References== * * Category:1599 paintings Category:Paintings by Caravaggio Category:Paintings of the Museo del Prado by Italian artists Category:Paintings about death Category:Paintings depicting David Category:Christian art about death ","title":"David and Goliath (Caravaggio)"},{"id":"3260965","text":"Karel Geraerts (; born 5 January 1982 in Genk) is a former Belgian football player who last played for Charleroi in 2016 and after being without a club for half a year has announced his retirement in January 2017. ==Career== Geraerts played for Club Brugge from 1998 to December 2003.

During his playing career, he was part of two Olympic bronze medal squads, one for FR Yugoslavia at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, the other for Serbia at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, and one Olympic silver medal squad for Serbia and Montenegro at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. Savić started training with the Partizan water polo club at the age of five and he debuted for the first team (seniors) at the age of thirteen, while still a pupil in elementary school. His last club was VK Crvena Zvezda where he was team captain. He retired from active playing at the end of the 2010/11 season. At international level, Savić represented FR Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro and Serbia, in 444 matches and scored 405 goals. He is the most capped player in Serbian water polo. He began coaching VK Crvena Zvezda in 2011, and also became head coach of the Serbia men's national water polo team in autumn 2012. ==Club career as coach== ===Crvena Zvezda=== In 2011, after finishing his long playing career, Savić remained with his club Crvena Zvezda in the position of head coach. ==National career== Savić is one of a few sportspeople who won Olympic medals in water polo as players and head coaches. ===As player=== Savić made his debut for the national team in 1994, during a time of sanctions for Yugoslavia, following All-Star selections in a tournament in Italy. He became the standard no. five (wing) player for the team almost without a break over the whole of his national career. Holding the record for the highest number of matches played (444), and also being a highly successful scorer (405 goals), he is considered to be among the true legends of Serbian sports. During his career, he developed into the strongest pillar of Serbia's defense in front of the goal. With his power and imagination, he was a prominent member of the team. From 1997, Savić was part of the Yugoslav/Serbian water polo team in every competition in which they won a medal. In a duel with Montenegro at the 2008 Olympic Games, he was one of the players most responsible for Serbia's triumph when they won the bronze medal that year. Savić played his last match with the national team in China in 2011. ===As coach=== Savić was named as head coach of the Serbian National team after Dejan Udovičić left the position in 2012. Under Savić's leadership, the national team won the 2016 Olympic Games, the 2015 World Championship, three European Championships (2014, 2016 and 2018), and six World League titles (2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2019). In little over twelve months, between August 2015 and August 2016, the Serbian National team won consecutively all four of the biggest titles in Water Polo – the 2015 World Championship, the 2016 European Championship, the 2016 World League, and the 2016 Olympic Games – an unprecedented achievement. ==Honours== ===As player=== ====VK Partizan==== * National Championship of Yugoslavia: 1994–95 * National Cup of Yugoslavia: 1989–90, 1990–91, 1991–92, 1992–93, 1993–94, 1994–95 * LEN Cup: 1997–98 * LEN Supercup: 1991 * LEN Cup Winners' Cup: 1990 * Mediterranean Championship: 1989 ====CN Barcelona==== * Copa del Rey: 1998–9 ====CN Atlètic- Barceloneta==== * División de Honor: 2000–01 * Copa del Rey: 2000–01 * Supercopa de España: 2001 ====Rari Nantes Florentia==== * LEN Cup Winners' Cup: 2001 ====Pro Recco==== * LEN Supercup: 2004 ====Sintez Kazan==== * National Championship of Russia: 2006–07 * National Cup of Russia: 2004–05, 2009–10 * LEN Cup: 2006–07 ===As coach=== ====VK Crvena Zvezda==== * National Championship of Serbia: 2012–13 and 2013–14 * National Cup of Serbia: 2012–13 and 2013–14 * Regional A2 League: 2017/18 * LEN Champions League: 2012–13 * LEN Supercup: 2013–14 ==Individual honours== It was announced on 1 June 2010 that Dejan Savić won the national sports award, which includes lifetime monthly fees.

(there are rumours that he has made the 4 runs in another match that was miscounted) *William Buckley – Australian convict who escaped and became famous for living in an Aboriginal community for more than thirty years. Believed by many Australians to be the source of the saying \\"You've got Buckley's Chance\\". *Azaria Chamberlain – the name of two-month-old Australian baby who disappeared on the night of 17 August 1980 on a camping trip with her family. Her parents, Lindy Chamberlain and Michael Chamberlain, reported that she had been taken from their tent by a dingo, but they were arrested, tried, and convicted of her murder in 1982. Both were later cleared, and thus the case is best remembered for what was an injustice. The Chamberlains were Seventh-day Adventists and an urban myth had developed that they were required to sacrifice a child as part of their religious beliefs and that the name Azaria meant \\"sacrifice\\".

Conspiracy theories include Holt being picked up by a Chinese submarine, faking his own death, suicide, and CIA involvement. Formal investigations determined that he drowned accidentally. *Ned Kelly – Australian 19th-century bushranger, many films, books and artworks have been made about him, possibly his exploits have been exaggerated in the public eye and become something of folklore. It especially surrounds his capture at Glenrowan where the Kelly gang tried to derail a train of Victorian police which were arriving, and were surrounded in the hotel. Kelly had made armour from stolen iron mould boards of ploughs, and came out shooting, whereupon he was shot in the legs. Some consider him as Australia's Robin Hood whiles others would disagree. Peter Lalor *Peter Lalor – An Irish-Australian rebel in the Eureka Stockade who later became the only outlaw to make it to parliament. *Eddie Mabo – challenged the Australian Government as to who owned the island of Mer where he was born and lived.

Neighboring, smaller rivers are just as old. Pine Gap in The Northern Territory *Franklin House – Historic house in Launceston that has had reports of ghost sightings. *Gallipoli – the name of a peninsula in Turkey, but also the name given to the Allied campaign on that peninsula during World War I. There were around 180,000 Allied casualties and 220,000 Turkish casualties. This campaign has become a \\"founding myth\\" for both Australia and New Zealand, and Anzac Day is still commemorated as a holiday in both countries. The idea that Australian soldiers were mowed down by Turkish gunfire following stupid decisions of the British commanding officers is part of the folklore, as is the escape from Gallipoli, where the Anzacs used rifles rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger to make it seem like there were still soldiers in the trenches as they were leaving. Another aspect of the ANZAC spirit is the story of Simpson and his donkey. *Gentle Annie – Name for selected especially steep sections of bush roads, difficult to climb in wet weather. The folk term may have arisen as early as in bullock team days, whether drawing wagons or timber jinkers. *Gympie Pyramid – A small pyramid like structure in Gympie, Queensland (That has been mostly destroyed) that many believe to be a construction made by Chinese or Incan origin. Although researchers would more likely argue that it is a hoax. *Monte Cristo Homestead – Historic estate in Junee, New South Wales, said to be the most Haunted property in Australia. *Parkes Observatory – Landmark in New South Wales, responsible for helping NASA broadcast the moon landings to the world.

It was this very rivalry that ultimately acted as the catalyst for the eventual founding of Canberra as the capital city of Australia. The Opera House, backed by the Sydney Harbour Bridge, seen from the eastern Botanic Gardens *Snowy River – immortalised in another Banjo Paterson poem, \\"The Man from Snowy River\\". The river has received much attention of late for now being nothing more than a trickle, and in fact has become a symbol for wider Australian interest in the health of its great rivers, particularly those in the Murray-Darling basin. *Sovereign Hill - An Open-Air Museum in Ballarat depicting an 1850s gold rush town. *St James station tunnels – The tunnel is home to many urban legends including being a secret military bunker during World War II and a large bell that sounds like Big Ben. *Sydney Harbour Bridge & Sydney Opera House – Two of Australia's most famous national landmarks.

A visiting American politician at the time wryly observed that he was sure he had only heard the tip of the ice cube. Gough Whitlam's speech \\"Well may we say God save the Queen, because nothing will save the Governor General\\" is replayed frequently. Eureka Stockade battle by J. B. Henderson * Eureka stockade – A miners' revolt in 1854 in Victoria, Australia against the officials supervising the gold- mining region of Ballarat, in particular, the high prices of digging licenses. It is often regarded as the \\"Birth of Australian Democracy\\" and an event of equal significance to Australian history as the storming of the Bastille was to French history, but almost equally often dismissed as being of little or no consequence. * The Stolen Generation – From the late 1800s to the early 1970s, young Aboriginal people were forcibly removed from their families as children between the 1900s and the 1960s, to be brought up by white foster families or in institutions. In 1999 then-prime minister John Howard avoided using the word \\"sorry\\", to the families.

On the morning of the victory (Australian time) the then Australian Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, famously said that any employer who sacked any of their employees for not coming in that day was a \\"bum\\". The challenge also resulted in the popularisation of the boxing kangaroo representation. Portrayal of Phar Lap winning the 1930 Melbourne Cup, from the 1983 movie \\"Phar Lap\\" *Colliwobbles – The \\"colliwobbles\\" refers to the Collingwood Football Club's apparent penchant for losing grand finals over a 32-year period between 1958 and 1990. During this premiership drought, fans endured nine fruitless grand finals (1960, 1964, 1966, 1970, 1977 (drawn, then lost in a replay the following week), 1979, 1980, 1981). The term \\"Colliwobbles\\" was to enter the Victorian vocabulary to signify a choking phenomenon. *The Invincibles – First Test match side to play an entire tour of England without losing, and is often considered to be one of the greatest cricket teams of all time. *Kennett curse – A 5-year winning streak Geelong had over Hawthorn over comments made by then Hawthorn club President Jeff Kennett saying that Geelong does not have the mental drive to defeat Hawthorn.

The park interprets the site of Old Crow Wing, one of the most populous towns in Minnesota in the 1850s and 1860s. The entire park was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. A section of the Red River Trails that passed through Old Crow Wing is also separately listed on the National Register. ==Natural history== The park lies on an outwash plain formed from the outwash of Glacial Lake Grantsburg. The present-day vegetation is oak forest with red, white, and jack pine; and aspen, with prairie and wetland openings. ==Wildlife== It is home to wildlife species such as coyote, white-tailed deer, eagle, beaver, hawk, muskrat, waterfowl, fox, and various songbirds. ==Cultural history== ===Native American history=== The confluence of the Crow Wing and Mississippi Rivers formed a natural crossroads, attracting humans with its easy travel routes and quality hunting. At the beginning of the historical period the region was inhabited by Dakota, who clashed with Ojibwe being displaced from farther east. It is told that in 1768 a Dakota war party raided an Ojibwe village and carried off several women in their canoes. The village's warriors, returning from their own unsuccessful raid, laid an ambush on a high bank over the river, digging shallow pits from which to fire their rifles. As the Dakota convoy passed under the Ojibwe, the men opened fire, while the captured women overturned the canoes they were in and swam for shore. The Dakota regrouped and counterattacked by land, but were repulsed. The two-day battle cemented Ojibwe control over the area. ===Old Crow Wing=== European fur traders began frequenting the area in the late 18th century. A trading post was opened in 1823, around which a town slowly grew. The town lay on the route of a new section of the Red River Trails blazed in 1844, and the local economy boomed. Several Crow Wing traders went on to great prominence in early Minnesota, including the men after whom Morrison County, Aitkin County, and Rice County are all named. A Métis named Clement Beaulieu ran the American Fur Company's trading post while another named William Whipple Warren wrote an early history of the Ojibwe. Three churches were established in town, including a Catholic mission by Father Francis Xavier Pierz. Crow Wing's heyday came to a swift end. In 1868 the Ojibwe were resettled in the White Earth Indian Reservation. In 1871 railroad magnate James J. Hill decided to route his Northern Pacific Railroad over the Mississippi River in Brainerd, to the north. By 1880 most of Crow Wing's residents had moved on. ===Park development=== The Crow Wing County Historical Society led efforts to establish a state park around the townsite. The park was authorized by the Minnesota Legislature in 1959. Some controversy arose when the Knights of Columbus built a chapel on the site of Father Pierz' mission. However the chapel was located on a small parcel of privately held land and no public funds were used for its construction, so legally separation of church and state was maintained. State funds and private donations enabled the park to expand by in 2006, adding of frontage on the Mississippi River. There are plans to extend the Paul Bunyan State Trail through Crow Wing State Park along this section. ==Recreation== Crow Wing State Park offers of hiking trails, some of which are open to cross-country skiing or snowmobiling in winter. There is a campground with 61 sites and a camper cabin. There is also a group camp and a riverside campsite for canoeists. A boat ramp provides access to the rivers, with rental craft available. Although most of the structures of Old Crow Wing have decayed or were moved away, some are left and interpretive signs commemorate others. Clement Beaulieu's house, with its Greek Revival architecture, was moved back to its original location in 1988. Several headstones are still visible in the Catholic cemetery. Oldest of all, the shallow depressions marked as the Indian Rifle Pits may be the vestiges of the 1768 Ojibwe ambush. ==References== *Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.

Palming is a technique for holding or concealing an object in the hand. It is used frequently by magicians to conceal a card, coin, or other object. When it is done skillfully, the hand containing the palmed object is perceived to be completely empty. ==Methods== A method for palming is known as a palm. These methods differ depending on the object intended to be concealed: its particular size, shape and flexibility. Any method of holding the object in the hand so that it cannot be directly seen by the spectators and such that the position of the hand does not arouse suspicion, i.e. the hand is perceived to be empty, can be used as a palm. ==Uses== Palming an object generally allows for one of four effects to take place: * Vanishing an object can be achieved by palming it. Used properly, the object will seem to have disappeared completely, and the performer's hands will appear to be empty. * Producing an object can also be achieved by reversing the action of palming. * Transposing two different objects can be achieved by simultaneous vanish and production. * Transforming similar to Transposing, to make an object appear to change into a different type or colour. ==See also== * Miser's Dream * Sleight of hand * Tenkai palm ==References== * Card Sleights * Coin Sleights ==External links== * Category:Magic tricks Category:Card magic Category:Coin magic Category:Sleight of hand ","title":"Palming"},{"id":"3261056","text":"Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White was installed upon the roof of the Vancouver Art Gallery in 2001 Kenneth Robert \\"Ken\\" Lum, OC (; born 1956)http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n93098484 is a Chinese-Canadian artist and educator.

(2001). Ken Lum: Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White. [Brochure]. Vancouver, British Columbia: Vancouver Art Gallery.

It is set in an analogue of Southern California in an imaginary past shortly after the sinking of Atlantis about 14,000 years ago in the twilight of a civilization then struggling and now vanished for lack of a crucial natural, and essentially non-renewable resource upon which almost all of its economy and technology depended. The vanishing resource is not oil but mana, something vital to the technology of magic and the metabolism of the supernatural. As mana becomes scarce gods sleep and finally die, unicorns get smaller and finally turn into hornless ponies, and magic becomes less and less effective and finally vanishes. The book was published in 2000, and was followed by a sequel, Burning Tower in 2005. It is part of the same timeline as The Magic Goes Away. ==Plot summary== The first and last parts of the novel are set in Tep's Town, on the site of modern Los Angeles. The town consists of three classes: the Lords, the ruling class, who live in a separate area of the town; the kinless, essentially a slave class forbidden to carry weapons, descendants of a people conquered by the allied ancestors of the Lords and the Lordkin; and the Lordkin, proud, uneducated, undisciplined and indolent knife fighters organised into street gangs, who live by \\"gathering\\" whatever they wish from the kinless. The Lords supervise the kinless and placate the Lordkin. The kinless are unarmed and untrained in the use of weapons, and cannot resist the Lordkin. Some leave the town, but the surrounding vegetation is malevolent. The town is the base of a fire god, Yangin-Atep, who possesses the Lordkin every few years to burn the town down and rape any kinless woman they can catch. The main character, Whandall, is an 11-year-old Lordkin boy severely beaten unto scarring and broken bones by Lordsmen (police) for associating with a Lord girl and illegally entering the segregated Lord's Hills. As an adult he becomes a product of his culture — a thief, a rapist, and a murderer, but, strangely, not without regret, not without honor, and not without the reader's sympathy. He teams up with an ex-Atlantis wizard and some kinless and they escape from the city. Beyond the city they find traders and Whandall founds a successful trading empire. Eventually, he returns to the city to establish a trade route there, and defeats Yangin-Atep. In the epilogue the authors add further information to the timeline of the described reality: long after the described events, the savage people who became the \\"so-called Native Americans\\" appear on the stage and wipe out the existing civilization, including horses (and presumably cats and wheels) in their conquest of the Americas. ==Allegory== According to the afterword published with the book, Larry Niven originally developed the story in order to channel his feelings of frustration relating to the 1992 Los Angeles riots. In keeping with the spirit of the allegory Niven and Pournelle drop into the text several anagrams and other oblique references that bring to mind modern people, places and events. Some examples: * Jispomnos, anagram for O.J. Simpson: A legendary (in the story) Lordkin who married a kinless woman and adopted kinless ways. His story was made into an opera that is referenced several times in the book. As the story goes, Jispomnos killed his wife and her lover for her infidelity. On trial before a Lordkin jury Jispomnos claimed he was still a Lordkin and thus had the right to kill his cheating woman. He was, of course, acquitted. Here the authors imply their personal opinions on the O.J. Simpson affair, when they do not have Jispomnos even pretend to be innocent of the killing. * Arshur the Magnificent, oblique reference to Rodney King: Arshur is clearly meant to sound like \\"Arthur,\\" as in King Arthur so that as events unfold the reader would link King to Arshur. Arshur is a lawless bear of a man from outside the Tep's Town (a looker) who is adopted as an honorary Lordkin. In one incident Arshur is beaten severely with sticks by kinless peacekeepers when he refuses to just lie still. Lordkin anger over this \\"unjust beating\\" leads to another Burning. * Tras Preetor, anagram for Star Reporter: A looker, an outsider who has come to Tep's Town hoping to see the Burning. Tras makes his living by telling stories and trading information, so he sees the Burning as source of exciting stories that will make him rich. The authors present Tras as a \\"well- intentioned fool\\" who nearly gets young Whandall (and himself) killed with a hare-brained scheme to curry favor with the Lords. The authors' treatment of Tras is somewhat nuanced, but they make their negative opinion of such 'lookers' fairly obvious by the end. * Duddigract and Coscartin, anagrams for \\"drug addict\\" and \\"narcotics\\": Two minor characters, both Lordkin, who are used by the authors to make cautionary points about drug abuse; respectively, a user who dies of an overdose and a dealer who is killed for his drugs. * Vedasiras Range, nearly an anagram for Sierra Nevada: Not long after Whandall joins up with the trader caravan, he glimpses the beast-god Behemoth in these huge mountains to the east. * Mount Carlem, transparent anagram for Mount Carmel, near Carmel-by-the-Sea, California: A mountain near the sea north of Tep's Town. The Atlantian wizard is trapped there in the post-exodus part of the novel. The authors also add a \\"Carlem Marcel\\", the remains of a town on the bay near the mountain, drowned when the sinking of Atlantis caused world sea levels to rise. * Others: Many other names are anagrams as well: Pothefit / top thief, Resalet / stealer, Dargramnet / grandmater, Seshmarl / harmless, Wulltid / dullwit, Tarnisos / arsonist. Forigaft is an anagram for graffito. And the name of the Toronexti betrays their main profession, which is extortion. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2000 American novels Category:2000 fantasy novels Category:Literary collaborations Category:Novels by Larry Niven Category:Novels by Jerry Pournelle Category:Novels set in Los Angeles ","title":"The Burning City"},{"id":"3261072","text":"Daughters of Today was a 1928 silent film from Lahore, in present-day Pakistan (then British India).

When she returns a lost cell phone to an oddly dressed salesman, she mentions wanting a boyfriend. To thank her, he directs her to his company's website, Kronos Heaven. When she visits the site, Riiko finds it's a site to create your perfect lover. Thinking it's a game, she customizes and accidentally orders one. The next day, her new lover arrives. Following the instruction manual, she kisses him to wake him up, which configures him to be in love with only her. She names him \\"Night\\". Three days later, she is shocked to learn that she only had him for a free trial for 72 hours. The salesman, Gaku Namikiri, tells her that she must now pay for Night, however, they will waive the fee if she helps them to collect data about how women think and feel to help perfect future models. Riiko must now keep Night's true nature a secret from everyone around her. She also soon finds herself in a love triangle between Night and her childhood friend Soshi, who declares his love for her out of fear he will lose her. As the series progresses, Night begins to develop real human emotions, enabling him to truly love Riiko but also resulting in system malfunctions. When Riiko almost loses Night due to the malfunctions, she realizes that he is the one she really loves. She apologizes to Soshi, who moves to Spain with his brother to live with their dad. Night and Riiko spend a few happy weeks together, during which they go on dates, get their picture taken together, and purchase matching rings as symbols of their undying love.

Before he died, he wrote a letter directed to Soshi telling him what was happening and asking him to take care of Riiko. He also sends his ring, which Riiko noticed he has not been wearing immediately prior to his death. In the letter, he tells Riiko that she doesn't have to cry for him any more but to always smile.

Designed to fulfill intimate relations for a woman, Night constantly offers to have sex with Riiko, who steadfastly declines the offer. Not knowing a sense of privacy, he often takes off his clothes under the slightest prompting of him having to sleep with Riiko even at public places, and often tries to hug or kiss Riiko, which makes her uncomfortable and embarrassed. :While Night at first functions as Riiko's perfect boyfriend due to his programming, his relationship with Riiko eventually makes him develop true humanlike emotions, culminating in him having his own will. Even if Night's allegiance to Riiko can be switched by means of kissing, his relationship with her is so strong that when a customer of a host club makes him her lover, he still remembers Riiko, albeit as an ex- girlfriend; upon kissing Riiko again, he quickly switches allegiance to her while completely forgetting his experiences with the customer beforehand. Eventually, he grows to love Riiko genuinely and trespasses orders given to him by Kronos Heaven. :However, Night is secretly dying from battery failure as his relationship with Riiko goes intimate, although he does not want to make Riiko worry by informing her. Before he shuts down, he writes a letter for Soushi to return for Riiko, while telling Riiko not to cry and to move on from him. :;Night's Ring ::Functions similarly to a mood ring, with one difference: it reads the moods of people around Night. This helps him collect data about interacting with them. ::What the different colors mean: Red - Happy, Pink - Pleasure, Black - Sad, Blue - Angry and Jealous, and White - Neutral/Calm. ::In the Japanese series, his data-collecting equipment is a bracelet instead of a ring. ::In the Taiwanese series, an additional color, yellow, is added, which can be generated when Night has a sex drive. ::In the South Korean series, Da-da wears the ring instead of Young-gu. It has only two colors: Red for happy or love, and black for angry or sad. :;Live-action ::In the Japanese series, Night is initially much more annoying than his manga incarnation as he often embarrasses Riiko by telling everyone that he is her \\"ideal boyfriend\\", which infuriates her. He finds a job as a janitor at Asamoto and embarrasses her further. ::By developing his own will, Kronos Heaven worries about the problems he may cause to the company and they try to delete his data. Though Night manages to keep his system from deletion for some time, his data chip begins to overheat due to his newfound independence and eventually stops working altogether. ::In the special episode in Japan, his system is restored by a doctor who wishes to use his independence for her selfish reasons. He eventually is forced to make the ultimate decision: to give up Riiko for her future. ; :Played by: Saki Aibu :Riiko is a young, flat- chested (according to Soushi, 32-A cup) 16-year-old girl who has bad luck with boys. When she helps a strange salesman named Gaku Namikiri, she ends up ordering a cybernetic boyfriend. Though initially shy around her new boyfriend, Riiko begins to fall in love with him, while also finding herself struggling with her new admirer, Soushi Asamoto. Riiko is rather naïve, clumsy, and simple-minded, but kindhearted, hardworking, and serious. :Riiko doesn't want to admit she is in love with Night and constantly reminds herself that he is just a doll. This, however, isn't completely true because she gets jealous or even angry when he flirts with other girls for \\"data.\\" :;Live- action ::In the Japanese version, Riiko is an office lady at Asamoto who has trouble with guys, so she is introduced by the manager of Kronos Heaven to try out a cybernetic boyfriend for one week. Over the course of the series, she grows increasingly attached to her new boyfriend, Night Tenjo, and her boss, Asamoto Soshi. She chooses to give up her dream of becoming a pâtissier to be with Night, but she ends up going anyway after Night's computer system is destroyed. ::In the special episode in Japan, Riiko has become an official pâtissier after three years of training and is forced to make the choice of her life when Night is suddenly restored. ; :Played by: Hiro Mizushima :Soushi is Riiko's childhood friend. He lives alone with his brother because his father is a travel photographer. He watches over Riiko and takes care of her while her parents work far away. At first, he simply treats her as a very good friend. But as the story progresses, Soushi realizes that he has stronger feelings for Riiko and confesses his love to her. :;Live-action ::In the Japanese version, Soushi's personality is switched between that of his brother; instead of a serious individual, Soushi is a flamboyant and playful young man who cares more about the origins of his grandfather's company than what it has become. He grows romantically attached to Riiko and declares his love for her, who reciprocates her feelings. He also encourages Riiko to pursue her dream of becoming a pâtissier. At the end of the series, Soushi invites Riiko to study further in becoming a pâtissier at France with him. In the special episode, Soushi and Riiko return to Japan after three years of study to reopen the Asamoto's original base of home. The two have also become a couple, but their relationship is strained by the sudden return of Night. Eventually however, the two reconcile after Night decides to let go of his relationship with Riiko. ; :Played by: Kuranosuke Sasaki :Gaku is a salesman for Kronos Heaven, a company specializing in making highly realistic robots, or \\"figures\\". Though usually businesslike and down-to-earth, Gaku is often mistaken for a cosplayer because of his odd manner of dress. When Riiko cannot return Night or pay the bill for him, Gaku allows her to keep him so Night can collect data on how to become a better lover for use in future models. Whenever there is a problem with Night, Gaku is the one to fix him. Gaku keeps close tabs on the progress in the relationship between Riiko and Night, and he often appears randomly out of nowhere, ie. out of Riiko's closet, mostly for comic relief. A stereotypical Japanese salesman, he speaks with a heavy Kansai dialect and tends to interject Spanish words in his conversations. Gaku's family owns a business of selling takoyaki; at the end of the series, Gaku quits his job at Kronos Heaven to inherit his family business. Gaku is the one whom Night trusts to give his letter asking Soushi to return for Riiko once the latter has calmed down from her grief of losing Night. :;Live-action ::In the Japanese drama, Namikiri is the creator of Nightly 01, and he decides to sell his 01 to Riiko to prove that his robot is ready for mass production. Like everyone in the series, Namikiri is depicted to be quite older than in the manga. Contrary to with his fellow employees' ideas at Kronos Heaven, he believes that Night developing humanlike emotions is a good thing and tries to defend him from being scrapped. At the end of the series, he stores the now- shut down Night while praising the latter for what he had done in his short life. In the special episode, Gaku expresses surprise when Night comes to function without his authorization. He later reluctantly scraps Night, as per the latter's wishes. ; :Played by: Natsuhi Ueno :A frenemy and classmate of Riiko, having been Riiko's friend since middle school. A beautiful and charming girl, she attracts the attention of many boys, whom she occasionally dates, if only briefly. She offers support and reassurance when Riiko feels miserable after being rejected by Ishizeki. However, later on, it is shown that she is the reason why boys always reject Riiko after she asks them out, as she has been spreading rumors around school that Riiko is slutty and goes out with boys for their money. Mika has been dating Ishizeki ever since Riiko takes interest in him and quickly breaks up with him once he has rejected Riiko's confession, as she is only interested in things that belong to other people. Later on, Mika sets Night's violent fanclub on Riiko and tries to make Night break up with Riiko and date her instead. In the end, her scheme backfires, and she stops being friends with Riiko. :;Live-action ::In the Japanese drama, Mika, as in the manga, starts out as Riiko's understanding friend who offers support for Riiko's love life. However, she is secretly jealous of Riiko's popularity and charm to attract many men. She has been trying her hardest to ruin Riiko's life, first by dating with Ishizeki when the latter is still being pursued by Riiko, and later by seducing Night with a kiss, which temporarily switches his allegiance to Mika until Riiko manages to kiss him back. She also secretly sends Natsumi, Riiko's competitor in a pastry competition, recipes that allow her to win. When her schemes are discovered, Mika is humiliated and quits her job at the office. She later reconciles with Riiko and helps to protect Night's secret. ; :Played by: Miki Maya (Japan) :An aloof friend of Riiko. Due to her antisocial attitude, Riiko and other students find Miyabe \\"weird\\". However, Miyabe is actually very kind and sometimes offers her deadpan advice about love for Riiko. She is the first to learn that Riiko has been lured to be humiliated by Night's crazed fanclub led by Mika during an outdoor trip; while she claims that it is not her problem, Miyabe tells Mika that her actions will yield consequences. Riiko later finds out that Miyabe is very rich due to having worked as a stock trader, which she has interest to take part on to pay Night's maintenance bills. Miyabe becomes the second person, after Soushi, to know that Night is in fact a robot, during her borrowing of a miniature Night. She reveals to Night that ever since her parents' deaths, she has lost her will to fall in love with anyone, although she is able to be convinced by Night to fall in love again. :;Live-action ::While Miyabe does not appear in the Japanese series, her character and personality seems to be incorporated to . Fujiko is a bartender of the bar adjoining the Asamoto office building who smokes and is quite close to Riiko. Like Miyabe, Fujiko offers advice to Riiko about her troubled love life and is also the second person in the office, after Soushi, to discover that Night is a robot. ; :Played by: Eisuke Sasai :Gaku Namikiri's superior at Kronos Heaven, Yuki sends a Nightly 02 model, Toshiki, to seduce and have sex with Riiko, due to Night's repeated failure to sleep with Riiko. He at first pretends to be Toshiki's younger brother who knocks out Night by whispering a code to his ear so Toshiki can have a chance to seduce Riiko. He drops his disguise just before Night's inevitable fight with Toshiki, stating that whichever model that successfully sleeps with Riiko will be the finished product, while the failure one will be disposed. After Night wins the fight, Yuki shuts down Toshiki so it can be reprogrammed. However, when Night runs away from Kronos Heaven during his maintenance period, Yuki is sent alongside Gaku by his superiors to capture him, due to Night's possible danger as a doll with humanlike emotions. Despite his attempts to capture him, including sending another model of Nightly 01, he fails and is convinced by Gaku to give up the act. :;Live-action ::In the Taiwanese version, Baiqi (Yuki) is the COO of Kronos Heaven. He is the creator of the perfect lover robots. A child prodigy, he along with the founder of Kronos Heaven, created Nightly 01 based on the founder's son (which Xiaofei met briefly when she was young) who died in his twenties. He eventually helps Lei Wuwu help Zongshi in repairing Night. ; :Played by: Tsuyoshi Abe (Japan) :Another line of cybernetic dolls manufactured by Kronos Heaven in the same liege as Night, Toshiki is part of the Nightly 02 series, which is technologically more advanced than the Nightly 01 series. He carries a high resemblance to Night in facial features, body structure, and even wears the same jewelry, although he is much stronger and has better reflexes than him. Under the guise of , Riiko's first crush, he is sent to replace Night as Riiko's boyfriend due to Night's failure to sleep with Riiko, with his benefactor, Yuki, under the guise of his little brother. During Night and Riiko's stay at a hotel, Toshiki manages to knock out Riiko upon kissing her, then claims that he had fun with her the next morning; while the two have not in fact slept together, Riiko believes so, and this temporarily creates a strain between her and Night. Toshiki uses the opportunity to seduce Riiko, but he is stopped by Night, who tears his arm after a brutal fight. Toshiki is then shut down by Yuki and taken away for testing and reprogramming. Later, he becomes the boyfriend of a wealthy girl and establishes a friendship with Riiko and Night. :;Live-action ::In the Japanese drama, Riiko encounters Toshiki sitting at a bench on the riverside when she is let down. Toshiki simply tries to get along with her staying at Riiko's landlady's house and starting working as a janitor as Night at her company. He locks Night up in a room to go out with Riiko, but his plan fails as Night escapes and confronts him at the parking lot. As Nightly 02, Toshiki is developed by another team at Kronos Heaven in the Japanese version. In the competition between Nightly 01 and 02, Toshiki loses as he calculates too much for his sake when Riiko is at the risk of a car accident while Night saves her without thinking of his own safety. As a result, Toshiki is disposed permanently and Night 01 is chosen for mass production. ; :Played by: Shunsuke Nakamura :Soushi's little brother. Like Soushi, Masaki is also a childhood friend of Riiko. He strongly supports his brother to date Riiko, much to Soushi's embarrassment. At the end of the series, alongside Soushi, Masaki moves to Spain to rejoin with his father and stays there permanently while Soushi decides to return back to Japan six months later. :;Live-action ::In the Japanese TV series, Masaki, who is renamed as Masashi, is Soushi's older brother and takes up the characteristics of Soushi in the manga (having black hair, wearing glasses, etc.) as well as his personality. Serious and no- nonsense, he constantly criticizes and laments Soushi's immaturity and indifference when handling the family pastry business, of which he takes up the seat of vice-chairman. He also looks down on Riiko because of the latter's low social standing and general unprofessionalism in the job. As the series goes on, however, Masashi begins to admit that Soushi is able to take care of the business in his own ways, and at the end of the series, he approves of Soushi's appointment for Riiko to accompany him to France. ; :Played by: Nobuo Kyou :A boy whom Riiko has had a crush on since the school entrance. Riiko confesses her love for Ishizeki at the start of the series, but he rejects, saying that he is already in love with another girl. It is later revealed that the girl is in fact Riiko's friend, Mika, who breaks up with him in return and is the one who made him as well as every boy Riiko had tried to date believe that Riiko is a gold digger. Ishizeki harshly discusses his rejection to his friends, which Riiko (and unknowingly, Soushi) overhears, and later publicly humiliates Riiko; he receives his comeuppance when both Night and Soushi beat him up. Ishizeki then calls Riiko a \\"slut\\" upon knowing her relationship with Night; Night once again beats him and his friends while telling them never to mess with him or Riiko again. :;Live-action ::In the Japanese drama, Ishizeki is a staff member of Asamoto whom Riiko seems to be fond of until she realizes with some prompting from Mika that he has been playing with her feelings. ::In the Taiwanese version, Shi Guan (Ishizeki) is one of Xiaofei's colleagues that she has a crush on.

The two work overseas and seldom return to Japan, forcing Riiko to live in an apartment by herself. In spite of their rare visits for their daughter, they, especially Yoshiharu, truly care for Riiko's well-being. They are first shown in a comedic segment when Riiko, in her initial shock of seeing Night arriving naked, reminiscences that she used to innocently ask her father about male genitalia when she was a child. The two return to Japan midway in the series and expresses surprise (in Yoshiharu's case, disapproval) that their daughter is living with a man. To try to shoo off Night, Yoshiharu attempts to make Riiko attend a dinner with Soushi, whom he particularly wants in becoming his son-in-law, though the plan falls through. The two remain unaware of Night's actual state as they take their leave from Japan. :;Live- action ::In the Japanese drama, Yoshiharu and Makiko decide to visit Riiko during their business visit in Tokyo.

The Roan's Creek Church of Christ in Carroll County, Tennessee, was the first such congregation formerly established west of the Tennessee River in 1825. Some of the early settlers arriving in southern Graves County, Kentucky, and northern Weakley County, Tennessee, brought with them the teachings of Barton W. Stone and the \\"Christians Only\\" movement, and wanted to have a local church where they could worship. These settlers located John Parkhill from Calloway County, Kentucky and sent one of their members to summon him to help found the congregation. In June 1834, Parkhill established the congregation, incorporating the \\"Christians Only\\" teachings of Stone and the \\"Reformed Baptist\\" teachings of Alexander Campbell, Stone and Campbell having merged their movements in 1832. The church was established in the home of member Simon Foy and his wife Charlotte Simms Foy, who had migrated to the area in about 1828 from Limestone County, Alabama, and whose homestead was on Knob Creek, near the present Clinard farm. The first church building was erected in about 1845, south of the Foy homestead on the border between Kentucky and Tennessee, about a mile west of where the present building stands. Although no longer located on Knob Creek, the congregation retained the original name. This was one of the earliest Restorationist congregations to use the name \\"Church of Christ\\", a name now in use by thousands of Restoration Movement congregations worldwide. The founding members were Simon and Charlotte Foy, their daughters Charlotte and Elizabeth, their sons James and William, John Johnson and his wife Elizabeth, and Uel Olive. The Church has since been through three buildings. The latest was built in 1957 and sits on State Line Road, east of Dukedom, Tennessee, on the Kentucky/Tennessee state line. It currently has 19 members. The church jokes about sitting on the state line, and the line is literally in front of the communion table. The minister stands in Kentucky and preaches to the congregation which sits in Tennessee during the services. Many other Churches of Christ have branched from this particular church and are still in existence today. The current minister is Steve Cochrum. Past ministers include Charles Wall, Dennis Crutchfield, David Wilson, James Shockley and Jimmy Canter. According to Carl H. Royster's (the great-great-great-great-grandson of Simon and Charlotte Foy) directory \\"Churches of Christ in the United States\\", the congregation was established in 1834.

Léon Poliakov (; 25 November 1910, Saint Petersburg – 8 December 1997, Orsay) was a French historian who wrote extensively on the Holocaust and antisemitism and wrote \\"The Aryan Myth\\". Born into a Russian Jewish family, Poliakov lived in Italy and Germany until he settled in France. He cofounded the Center of Contemporary Jewish Documentation, established to collate documentation on the persecution of Jews during World War II. He also assisted Edgar Faure at the Nuremberg Trial. Poliakov went on to serve as director of research at the National Centre for Scientific Research (Centre national de la recherche scientifique) from 1954 to 1971. According to historian Jos Sanchez, Poliakov was the first scholar to assess the disposition of Pope Pius XII critically on various issues connected to the Holocaust. In November 1950, Poliakov wrote \\"The Vatican and the 'Jewish Question' - The Record of the Hitler Period-And After\\" in the influential Jewish journal Commentary. The article was the first to consider the attitude of the papacy during World War II and the Holocaust, but it was not until 1963, when German playwright Rolf Hochhuth published his play Der Stellvertreter, that discussion of Poliakov's initial investigations in this area took on worldwide significance. Although little noted at the time, Poliakov's 1951 Breviaire de la haine (\\"Harvest of Hate\\") was the first major work on the genocide, predating Raul Hilberg's Destruction of the European Jews by a decade. It received some good reviews in opposition to the prevailing opinion in studies at the time that a major genocide of six million Jews was logistically impossible and so could not have happened. Poliakov said in his Memoires that he refrained from even using the word genocide, which was considered unfit for publication in 1951 when his groundbreaking work was first published. as cited in p247 of == Publications == * L'étoile jaune - La situation des Juifs en France sous l'Occupation - Les législations nazie et vichyssoise (Editions Grancher, October 1999 - three texts: a book of 1949, an article in Historia magazine in 1968 and a text of 1980) * , translated 1956 as Harvest of Hate: The Nazi Program for the Destruction of Jews in Europe * The History of Anti-Semitism: From the Time of Christ to the Court Jews (orig. 1955; this tr. 1966; repr.

Malhar Rao II, Tatya Jog and others escaped to Alot. A peace treaty was signed on 6 January 1818 at Mandsaur. Holkars accepted all the terms laid down by Britishers in the Treaty of Mandsaur. At the conclusion of this Third Anglo- Maratha War, the Holkars lost much of their territory to the British and were incorporated into the British Raj as a princely state of the Central India Agency. This battle led to the final destruction of Maratha power. Baji Rao II, who was trying to consolidate Marathas, finally surrendered in June 1818. British abolished the position of Peshwa, and Marathas were limited to the small kingdom of Satara until its annexation to Bombay state in 1848. == References == Mahidpur Mahidpur Mahidpur Category:History of Malwa Mahidpur Mahidpur Category:1817 in India Category:December 1817 events ","title":"Battle of Mahidpur"},{"id":"3261135","text":"Kusu or KUSU may refer to: * Kusu, Mie, a former town in Mie Prefecture, Japan * Kusu, Ōita, a town in Ōita Prefecture, Japan * Kusu District, Ōita, a district in Ōita Prefecture, Japan * Kusu Station, a railway station in Japan * , a patrol frigate of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force * Kusu Island, an island in Singapore * KUSU-FM, a radio station in Logan, Utah, United States * KUSU-TV, a former television station in Logan, Utah, United States * Keele University Students' Union, a university students' union at Keele University, United Kingdom * Kusu, an aged awamori, a drink native to Okinawa, Japan == See also == * Kusunoki (disambiguation) ","title":"Kusu"},{"id":"3261140","text":"Buffalo River State Park is a state park of Minnesota, United States, conserving a prairie bisected by the wooded banks of the Buffalo River. Together with the adjacent Bluestem Prairie Scientific and Natural Area owned by The Nature Conservancy, it protects one of the largest and highest-quality prairie remnants in Minnesota. With the closest swimming lake to the Fargo–Moorhead metropolitan area, however, it is most popular for swimming and picnicking. The park is located just off U.S. Route 10 in Clay County, east of Glyndon and east of Moorhead. Buffalo River State Park was established in 1937 and developed by the Works Progress Administration. Three buildings and three structures built in the National Park Service rustic style were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. The park was originally focused on providing outdoor recreation amenities like the swimming pool, since there were few other opportunities in the area. It was expanded beginning in the 1960s as the quality and rarity of the surrounding prairie were recognized. The Scientific and Natural Area (SNA) section is used for environmental education by local schools and regional colleges and universities. It is also a destination for viewing the spring courtship ritual of the greater prairie chicken. ==Natural history== ===Geology=== The topography of Buffalo River/Bluestem Prairie largely formed beneath a proglacial lake at the end of the last glacial period. The region had previously been covered and exposed many times by successive glaciations. As the ice of the Wisconsin glaciation melted, the Red River Valley was covered by Glacial Lake Agassiz 10,000–8,000 years ago. Fine sediments formed a level lakebed. However beach ridges of sand and gravel formed in various places as the shorelines shifted. There is a beach ridge on the east edge of the state park called Campbell Ridge, and another to the southeast in the SNA called Norcross Ridge. The bedrock—a thin layer of shale over granite, slate, and schist—lies beneath of silt deposited by Lake Agassiz. The lake finally drained away to the north, leaving behind a distinctly flat plain with very rich soil. Today the park slopes slightly westward, dropping in elevation from its eastern border to its western border. The fairly flat prairie is interrupted by the two sandy beach ridges and associated rolling hills. Where it crosses the ridges the Buffalo River has formed steep and unstable cut banks up to high. A few glacial erratics stud the prairie. ===Flora=== The Buffalo River and Bluestem prairies preserve one of the largest remnants of northern tall grasslands, an ecoregion largely confined to the Red River Valley. The prairie is of high quality, much of it never having been cultivated. It is characterized by big bluestem and little bluestem interspersed with forbs like coneflowers, blazing star, and prairie clover. Some 250 species of wildflowers and grasses have been cataloged in the park. Rare plants include sticky false-asphodel, small white lady's slipper, northern gentian, plains reedgrass, blanket flower, and the endangered western prairie fringed orchid. Yuccas and cacti can be found at the south end of the property. A gallery forest extends across the prairie on either side of the Buffalo River. It is characterized by elm, ash, cottonwood, oak, and basswood. The understory comprises young basswood, ash, and elm along with boxelder, hazel, and gooseberry. The drier soil along the lip of the riverbank supports bur oak. Patches of willow, aspen, and boxelder occur on the prairie in spots with poor drainage. ===Fauna=== 200 species of bird and 40 species of mammal have been documented in Buffalo River State Park. Mammals include moose, white-tailed deer, coyotes, red foxes, badgers, white-tailed jackrabbits, beavers, plains pocket mice, and northern grasshopper mice. Several uncommon prairie birds find refuge in the park, including greater prairie chickens, marbled godwits, and upland sandpipers. Also present are sandhill cranes, loggerhead shrikes, and Henslow's sparrows. Other vertebrates include the Great Plains toad and western hognose snake. Three rare butterflies have been documented in the prairie: the regal fritillary, Poweshiek skipper, and Dakota skipper. ==Cultural history== ===Native American history=== American bison reliably wintered on the site of the future park, prompting Ojibwe people to call a stream Pijijiwizbi, meaning \\"Buffalo River.\\" Although this originally referred only to a tributary of the modern Buffalo River, settlers misapplied the name to the larger waterway. Far back into prehistory, Native Americans commonly used the river and beach ridges as travel corridors. The Minnesota Historical Society has postulated that the park is likely to contain archaeological resources, but little research has been done. ===Settlement=== Euro-Americans arrived in the 1820s and recognized the fertile prairie soil as ideal farmland. A leg of the Red River Trails followed the ancient route along Campbell Ridge in the vicinity of the park. Bowing to mounting pressures against their traditional lifestyle, the local Ojibwe ceded the region to the United States in their 1855 Treaty of Washington. In 1864 work began on the Northern Pacific Railway across the northern United States. Rail access brought homesteaders to the area in the 1870s. In 1875 J.H Smyser, who'd served as a captain in the Union Army during the American Civil War, purchased much of the future park property for a horse and cattle ranch. His impressive 1875 manor stood on the grounds for many years but burned down in 1959. Most of the land was used for pasture and hayfields rather than crop farming, which had the effect of preserving more of the native species. To reduce a taxing gradient for their trains, Northern Pacific in 1906 began building the massive embankment that still marks the park's northern border. ===Park creation and development=== Buffalo River State Park was created in the late 1930s, taking advantage of federal job creation programs during the Great Depression. The Moorhead Rod and Gun Club championed the site and the Minnesota Legislature officially added it to the state park system in 1937. At the time it was the only state-owned recreational facility in the region. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) established a camp and began developing the park's original . WPA workmen established infrastructure like the swimming area, entrance road, parking area, water supply, and toilets. They also built a bath house, a latrine, and a diversion dam in the National Park Service rustic style using split stone and logs. The original boundaries of the park were drawn with an emphasis on recreation. As recognition grew of the size and quality of the surrounding prairie, the park was expanded in the 1960s. The Nature Conservancy purchased additional land south of the park beginning in 1975. The Nature Conservancy's property lies partly within the state park's official boundaries and partly without. In 1989 the park's WPA developments were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. The district comprises six contributing properties—three buildings and three structures. The buildings consist of a 1938 latrine (now the campground storm shelter), the 1940 bath house, and a 1940 garage/residence (now the interpretive center). The structures consist of a 1938 diversion dam on the Buffalo River, the 1940 swimming beach, and some 1940 stone curbs in the parking lot. The district boundary includes a well house constructed in the 1960s, which is non-contributing. The contributing properties are considered historically significant for their association with the Great Depression and the resulting federal work relief programs of the New Deal, and with the early development of Minnesota's state parks. They were also recognized for their finely crafted and labor-intensive split stone architecture. ==Recreation== Buffalo River State Park's swimming pool and bath house Buffalo River State Park sees high local use, particularly for its swimming pool. Overnight visitors, conversely, are often far from home and using the park as a stopover on the way to a farther destination. Many campers come from Canada or the Dakotas. The campground has 44 sites—35 with electric hookups—plus showers, flush toilets, and a dump station. A separate group camp accommodates up to 50 people. The campground, picnic area, and swimming pool are located in the shade of the forest. The swimming pool features a sand bottom, filtered water, lifeguards, accessible features, and is surrounded by an artificial beach. The Buffalo River provides fishing opportunities. View of the Buffalo River from hiking trail. There are of hiking trails, of which are groomed for cross-country skiing in winter. The rest of the park is open to snowshoers. In March and April The Nature Conservancy operates two viewing blinds from which visitors can observe the dramatic lek mating ritual of the greater prairie chicken. ==References== ==External links== * Buffalo River State Park–Minnesota Department of Natural Resources * Bluestem Prairie Scientific and Natural Area–The Nature Conservancy * Regional Science Center–Minnesota State University Moorhead Category:1937 establishments in Minnesota Category:Grasslands of Minnesota Category:Grasslands of the North American Great Plains Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:National Register of Historic Places in Clay County, Minnesota Category:Park buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:Prairies Category:Protected areas established in 1937 Category:Protected areas of Clay County, Minnesota Category:Rustic architecture in Minnesota Category:State parks of Minnesota Category:Works Progress Administration in Minnesota ","title":"Buffalo River State Park (Minnesota)"},{"id":"3261144","text":"Jón Stefán Sveinsson, better known as \\"Nonni\\" (16 November 1857 in Möðruvellir in Hörgárdalur - 16 October 1944 in Cologne) was an Icelandic children's writer and member of the Society of Jesus.

The town is situated on the Dukes Highway and the Adelaide-Melbourne railway line. It is in The Coorong District Council local government area, the South Australian House of Assembly Electoral district of MacKillop and the Australian House of Representatives Division of Barker. At the 2016 Australian census, the town and district had a population of 527. The origin of the name has been debated. One possibility is that a local Aborigine in the area was named Tin-Tin, and the 'ara' was appended to form the place name; or that the Aborigine, one of the Boothbys' employees, was named Tintinara. It has also been suggested that the name may have been a corruption of an Aboriginal word, tinlinyara, which is the word for the stars in Orion's belt. ==History== The area was first settled by Europeans in the 1840s when graziers moved their flocks of sheep into the district. Shortly afterwards the 'Tintinara' homestead was erected by the brothers T. W. Boothby and J. H. Boothby, who held a lease of 165 sq.miles here. In 1865 the new owners, William Harding and George Bunn, built a 16-stand shearing shed which is now classified by the National Trust, along with the homestead. The Tintinara wells and Reedy Wells were regular watering points for Tolmer's gold escort team. Tintinara post office was opened in the 1860s. Tintinara is situated in what was an unproductive region because of its poor sandy soils, and low mallee scrub and heath vegetation. After clearing of some of this vegetation, and the addition of trace elements, the district has become a productive farming area. One of the main environmental areas that Tintinara has is Lake Indawarra. ==Community organisations== Tintinara Tennis Courts 2009 Grand Final ===Generally=== Tintinara has many different community organisations including the Tintinara Action Club and Tintinara Lions Club as well as many different facilities including: *Tintinara Cricket Club * Border Downs Tintinara Football & Netball Club *Tintinara Bowling Club *Tintinara Golf Club *Tintinara Tennis Club ===Tintinara Tennis Club=== The Tintinara Tennis Club was established in 1919 by Edward B.

The facilities consisted of two courts that were used for many years, then in the summer of 1951–52 games started on four new courts. Since then more courts have been added and a new clubhouse was completed in 1966.Twelftree, Pat (1974) The History of Tintinara and District, Coudrey Offset Press Pty.

Note the characteristic smooth, tubular shape, similar to that of a waterspout. Landspout is a term created by atmospheric scientist Howard B. Bluestein in 1985 for a kind of tornado not associated with a mesocyclone. The Glossary of Meteorology defines a landspout as : \\"Colloquial expression describing tornadoes occurring with a parent cloud in its growth stage and with its vorticity originating in the boundary layer. : The parent cloud does not contain a preexisting mid-level mesocyclone. The landspout was so named because it looks like \\"a weak Florida Keys waterspout over land.\\" ==Characteristics== Landspouts are a type of tornado that forms during the growth stage of a cumulus congestus cloud by stretching boundary layer vorticity upward and into the cumulus congestus's updraft. These generally are smaller and weaker than supercell tornadoes and do not form from a mesocyclone or pre-existing rotation in the cloud. Because of this, landspouts are rarely detected by Doppler weather radar. Landspouts share a strong resemblance and development process to that of waterspouts, usually taking the form of a translucent and highly laminar helical tube. Landspouts are considered tornadoes since a rapidly rotating column of air is in contact with both the surface and a cumuliform cloud. Not all landspouts are visible, and many are first sighted as debris swirling at the surface before eventually filling in with condensation and dust. == Life cycle == Forming in relation to miscyclones and under updrafts, a landspout generally lasts for less than 15 minutes; however, they can persist substantially longer, and produce heavy damage. They progress through recognizable stages of formation, maturation and dissipation, and tend to decay when a downdraft or significant precipitation occur nearby. They may form in lines or groups of multiple landspouts. == Damage == Landspouts are commonly weak; however, in rare occasions, a landspout can be as strong as an EF3 tornado. ==See also== * Dust devil * Fire whirl * Funnel cloud * Tornadogenesis * Vortex * Vortex engine * Waterspout * Whirlwind == References == == External links == * Advanced Spotters' Field Guide * Online Tornado FAQ Category:Severe weather and convection Category:Tornado Category:Vortices fr:Tornade#Trombes terrestres ","title":"Landspout"},{"id":"3261210","text":"Dragonquest is a science fantasy novel by the American-Irish author Anne McCaffrey. It is the sequel to Dragonflight, set seven years later and the second book in the Dragonriders of Pern series. Dragonquest was first published by Ballantine Books in May 1971. ==Origins== According to her son Todd, McCaffrey's agent Virginia Kidd and editor Betty Ballantine provided crucial advice and assistance in her struggle with the sequel to Dragonflight. After the agent first read a draft, the author followed her advice to \\"burn it\\", and she met with the editor in long sessions. It was near completion before she emigrated to Ireland in September 1970, with her two younger children Todd and Georgeanne, one month after divorcing her husband. She finished it soon after the move. ==Plot summary== As it opens, tensions are rising between the Oldtimers, those dragonriders who came forward in time 400 turns (Pernese years) to help the undermanned contemporary dragonriders protect the planet Pern and its inhabitants from the destructive Thread. F'nor (rider of Canth, a Brown dragon that rivals the size of the Bronze dragons) attempts to mediate, but things escalate to the point that an Oldtimer, T'reb (who is disturbed by his green dragon being in heat), stabs F'nor. F'nor is sent to the Southern Continent to recover, where he falls in love with Brekke and discovers the wicked deeds of Weyrwoman Kylara. F'lar, F'nor's half- brother, is eventually forced into a duel with T'ron, the leader of the Oldtimers, which ends in banishment for the Oldtimers who will not accept F'lar's leadership and in a grave injury for F'lar. Brekke's queen dragon (Wirenth) rises in mating flight but is attacked by Kylara's queen dragon (Prideth), and both dragons die, leaving their riders in near-catatonic states. Only Brekke recovers, mostly because she can hear other dragons (besides her own queen, Wirenth). With the Lords Holder adamant that the dragonriders attempt to eliminate Thread at its source, F'nor attempts to direct himself and his dragon, Canth, to the Red Star, but they find the atmosphere inhospitable, and they fall back to Pern, badly injured. Brekke's cry for F'nor not to leave her was also the inspiration for a song by Menolly, after she found that a certain guitar chord sounded amazingly like Brekke's voice when she screamed. This is chronicled in Dragonsinger. ==Awards== Dragonquest was one of six nominees for the 1972 Hugo Award for Best Novel (voted by participants in the annual World Science Fiction Convention) and it placed fifth for the 1972 Locus Award for Best Novel (voted by Locus magazine readers). The American Library Association in 1999 cited the two early Pern trilogies (Dragonriders and Harper Hall), along with The Ship Who Sang, when McCaffrey received the annual Margaret A.

The relation can be generalised to nth-order linear ordinary differential equations. The identity is named after the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel. Since Abel's identity relates the different linearly independent solutions of the differential equation, it can be used to find one solution from the other. It provides useful identities relating the solutions, and is also useful as a part of other techniques such as the method of variation of parameters. It is especially useful for equations such as Bessel's equation where the solutions do not have a simple analytical form, because in such cases the Wronskian is difficult to compute directly. A generalisation to first-order systems of homogeneous linear differential equations is given by Liouville's formula. ==Statement== Consider a homogeneous linear second-order ordinary differential equation : y + p(x)y' + q(x)\\\\,y = 0 on an interval I of the real line with real- or complex-valued continuous functions p and q. Abel's identity states that the Wronskian W=(y_1,y_2) of two real- or complex- valued solutions y_1 and y_2 of this differential equation, that is the function defined by the determinant : W(y_1,y_2)(x) =\\\\begin{vmatrix}y_1(x)&y;_2(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\y'_1(x)&y;'_2(x)\\\\end{vmatrix} =y_1(x)\\\\,y'_2(x) - y'_1(x)\\\\,y_2(x),\\\\qquad x\\\\in I, satisfies the relation : W(y_1,y_2)(x)=C \\\\exp\\\\biggl(-\\\\int_{x_0}^x p(x') \\\\,\\\\textrm{d}x'\\\\biggr),\\\\qquad x\\\\in I, for every point x0 in I, where C is an arbitrary constant. ===Remarks=== * In particular, the Wronskian W(y_1,y_2) is either always the zero function or always different from zero with the same sign at every point x in I. In the latter case, the two solutions y_1 and y_2 are linearly independent (see that article about the Wronskian for a proof). * It is not necessary to assume that the second derivatives of the solutions y_1 and y_2 are continuous. * Abel's theorem is particularly useful if p(x)=0, because it implies that W is constant. ===Proof=== Differentiating the Wronskian using the product rule gives (writing W for W(y_1,y_2) and omitting the argument x for brevity) : \\\\begin{align} W' &= y_1' y_2' + y_1 y_2 - y_1 y_2 - y_1' y_2' \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = y_1 y_2 - y_1 y_2. \\\\end{align} Solving for y in the original differential equation yields : y = -(py'+qy). Substituting this result into the derivative of the Wronskian function to replace the second derivatives of y_1 and y_2 gives : \\\\begin{align} W'&= -y_1(py_2'+qy_2)+(py_1'+qy_1)y_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -p(y_1y_2'-y_1'y_2)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -pW. \\\\end{align} This is a first-order linear differential equation, and it remains to show that Abel's identity gives the unique solution, which attains the value W(x_0) at x_0. Since the function p is continuous on I, it is bounded on every closed and bounded subinterval of I and therefore integrable, hence :V(x)=W(x) \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\int_{x_0}^x p(\\\\xi) \\\\,\\\\textrm{d}\\\\xi\\\\right), \\\\qquad x\\\\in I, is a well-defined function. Differentiating both sides, using the product rule, the chain rule, the derivative of the exponential function and the fundamental theorem of calculus, one obtains :V'(x)=\\\\bigl(W'(x)+W(x)p(x)\\\\bigr)\\\\exp\\\\biggl(\\\\int_{x_0}^x p(\\\\xi) \\\\,\\\\textrm{d}\\\\xi\\\\biggr)=0,\\\\qquad x\\\\in I, due to the differential equation for W. Therefore, V has to be constant on I, because otherwise we would obtain a contradiction to the mean value theorem (applied separately to the real and imaginary part in the complex-valued case). Since V(x_0) = W(x_0), Abel's identity follows by solving the definition of V for W(x). ==Generalization== Consider a homogeneous linear nth-order (n \\\\geq 1) ordinary differential equation : y^{(n)} + p_{n-1}(x)\\\\,y^{(n-1)} + \\\\cdots + p_1(x)\\\\,y' + p_0(x)\\\\,y = 0, on an interval I of the real line with a real- or complex- valued continuous function p_{n-1}. The generalisation of Abel's identity states that the Wronskian W(y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n) of n real- or complex-valued solutions y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n of this nth-order differential equation, that is the function defined by the determinant : W(y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n)(x) =\\\\begin{vmatrix} y_1(x) & y_2(x) & \\\\cdots & y_n(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ y'_1(x) & y'_2(x)& \\\\cdots & y'_n(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_1^{(n-1)}(x) & y_2^{(n-1)}(x) & \\\\cdots & y_n^{(n-1)}(x) \\\\end{vmatrix},\\\\qquad x\\\\in I, satisfies the relation : W(y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n)(x)=W(y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n)(x_0) \\\\exp\\\\biggl(-\\\\int_{x_0}^x p_{n-1}(\\\\xi) \\\\,\\\\textrm{d}\\\\xi\\\\biggr),\\\\qquad x\\\\in I, for every point x_0 in I. ===Direct proof=== For brevity, we write W for W(y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n) and omit the argument x. It suffices to show that the Wronskian solves the first-order linear differential equation :W'=-p_{n-1}\\\\,W, because the remaining part of the proof then coincides with the one for the case n=2. In the case n=1 we have W=y_1 and the differential equation for W coincides with the one for y_1. Therefore, assume n \\\\geq 2 in the following. The derivative of the Wronskian W is the derivative of the defining determinant. It follows from the Leibniz formula for determinants that this derivative can be calculated by differentiating every row separately, hence : \\\\begin{align}W' & = \\\\begin{vmatrix} y'_1 & y'_2 & \\\\cdots & y'_n\\\\\\\\\\\\ y'_1 & y'_2 & \\\\cdots & y'_n\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_1 & y_2 & \\\\cdots & y_n\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_1 & y_2 & \\\\cdots & y_n\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_1^{(n-1)} & y_2^{(n-1)} & \\\\cdots & y_n^{(n-1)} \\\\end{vmatrix} \\\\+ \\\\begin{vmatrix} y_1 & y_2 & \\\\cdots & y_n\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_1 & y_2 & \\\\cdots & y_n\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_1 & y_2 & \\\\cdots & y_n\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_1 & y_2 & \\\\cdots & y_n\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_1^{(n-1)} & y_2^{(n-1)} & \\\\cdots & y_n^{(n-1)} \\\\end{vmatrix}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\qquad+\\\\ \\\\cdots\\\\ + \\\\begin{vmatrix} y_1 & y_2 & \\\\cdots & y_n\\\\\\\\\\\\ y'_1 & y'_2 & \\\\cdots & y'_n\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_1^{(n-3)} & y_2^{(n-3)} & \\\\cdots & y_n^{(n-3)}\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_1^{(n-2)} & y_2^{(n-2)} & \\\\cdots & y_n^{(n-2)}\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_1^{(n)} & y_2^{(n)} & \\\\cdots & y_n^{(n)} \\\\end{vmatrix}.\\\\end{align} However, note that every determinant from the expansion contains a pair of identical rows, except the last one. Since determinants with linearly dependent rows are equal to 0, one is only left with the last one: : W'= \\\\begin{vmatrix} y_1 & y_2 & \\\\cdots & y_n\\\\\\\\\\\\ y'_1 & y'_2 & \\\\cdots & y'_n\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_1^{(n-2)} & y_2^{(n-2)} & \\\\cdots & y_n^{(n-2)}\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_1^{(n)} & y_2^{(n)} & \\\\cdots & y_n^{(n)} \\\\end{vmatrix}. Since every y_i solves the ordinary differential equation, we have : y_i^{(n)} + p_{n-2}\\\\,y_i^{(n-2)} + \\\\cdots + p_1\\\\,y'_i + p_0\\\\,y_i = -p_{n-1}\\\\,y_i^{(n-1)} for every i \\\\in \\\\lbrace 1,\\\\ldots,n \\\\rbrace. Hence, adding to the last row of the above determinant p_0 times its first row, p_1 times its second row, and so on until p_{n-2} times its next to last row, the value of the determinant for the derivative of W is unchanged and we get : W'= \\\\begin{vmatrix} y_1 & y_2 & \\\\cdots & y_n \\\\\\\\\\\\ y'_1 & y'_2 & \\\\cdots & y'_n \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_1^{(n-2)} & y_2^{(n-2)} & \\\\cdots & y_n^{(n-2)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ -p_{n-1}\\\\,y_1^{(n-1)} & -p_{n-1}\\\\,y_2^{(n-1)} & \\\\cdots & -p_{n-1}\\\\,y_n^{(n-1)} \\\\end{vmatrix} =-p_{n-1}W. ===Proof using Liouville's formula=== The solutions y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n form the square-matrix valued solution :\\\\Phi(x)=\\\\begin{pmatrix} y_1(x) & y_2(x) & \\\\cdots & y_n(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ y'_1(x) & y'_2(x)& \\\\cdots & y'_n(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_1^{(n-2)}(x) & y_2^{(n-2)}(x) & \\\\cdots & y_n^{(n-2)}(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_1^{(n-1)}(x) & y_2^{(n-1)}(x) & \\\\cdots & y_n^{(n-1)}(x) \\\\end{pmatrix},\\\\qquad x\\\\in I, of the n-dimensional first-order system of homogeneous linear differential equations :\\\\begin{pmatrix}y'\\\\\\\\\\\\y\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\y^{(n-1)}\\\\\\\\\\\\y^{(n)}\\\\end{pmatrix} =\\\\begin{pmatrix}0&1&0&\\\\cdots&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&0&1&\\\\cdots&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots&\\\\vdots&\\\\vdots&\\\\ddots&\\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&0&0&\\\\cdots&1\\\\\\\\\\\\ -p_0(x)&-p_1(x)&-p_2(x)&\\\\cdots&-p_{n-1}(x)\\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix}y\\\\\\\\\\\\y'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\y^{(n-2)}\\\\\\\\\\\\y^{(n-1)}\\\\end{pmatrix}. The trace of this matrix is -p_{n-1}(x), hence Abel's identity follows directly from Liouville's formula. ==References== * Abel, N. H., \\"Précis d'une théorie des fonctions elliptiques\\" J.

In much of the Communion the body by which this representation is achieved is called the diocesan synod. (In the Episcopal Church in the USA, the corresponding body is called a diocesan convention.) The precise composition of a diocesan synod is subject to provincial and local canon and practice. ==The Church of England== In the Church of England diocesan synods exist under the terms of the Synodical Government Measure 1969.Synodical Government Measure 1969 on the UK Statute Law Database - retrieved 9 May 2008 A diocesan synod consists of three Houses, as follows: *The House of Bishops consists of the diocesan bishop, together with any stipendiary suffragan bishops or area bishops, and assistant bishops as nominated by the diocesan bishop with the agreement of the archbishop. *The House of Clergy consists of clergy representatives chosen by the clergy in each Deanery Synod, together with a number of ex officio members -- any other assistant bishops working in the diocese; the dean of the cathedral; the archdeacons of the diocese; the clergy elected to the General Synod for the diocese (known as Proctors to the Lower House of Convocation), and some others. *The House of Laity consists of representatives of the laity, elected from each Deanery by the members of that deanery's Deanery Synod. There are also ex officio members, including the lay representatives elected by the Diocese to the General Synod. Clergy and lay elected representatives are elected for a three-year term of office. The first Diocesan Synods met in 1970, and elections have been held every three years since, most recently in 2018. Election is by the members of the Deanery Synods of the diocese, and the number of representatives of each deanery is in proportion to the total number of 'members' of the churches in that deanery, compared with the diocese as a whole. The House of Clergy and the House of Laity should have approximately the same number of members. The method of election may be by simple plurality (i.e, first past the post) or by single transferable vote, and each Diocesan Synod may choose between these two.Church Representation Rules, as amended by General Synod, Church House Publishing, London In general the three Houses of the Diocesan Synod meet together, debate together and vote together, and a majority is assumed to be a majority of each of the three Houses. However, a vote by Houses can be requested, and in certain cases is required. In a vote by Houses, the consent of each of the three Houses is required in order for the assent of the Synod to be given. In addition, the diocesan bishop may declare that the House of Bishops shall only be deemed to have assented if the assenting majority includes the bishop. This means that the diocesan bishop may exercise a veto over the Diocesan Synod if they so wish. == Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia == The governing bodies of Episcopal Units in the three- tikanga church are each referred to by names appropriate to their tikanga's language: the New Zealand and Polynesia dioceses by diocesan synods, Te Pīhopatanga o Aotearoa by Te Rūnanganui / great assembly and the other pīhopatanga by hui amorangi.

In 1910, L. E. J. Brouwer was the first to describe an indecomposable continuum. Indecomposable continua have been used by topologists as a source of counterexamples. They also occur in dynamical systems. ==Definitions== A continuum C is a nonempty compact connected metric space. The arc, the n-sphere, and the Hilbert cube are examples of path connected continua; the topologist's sine curve and Warsaw circle are examples of non-path connected continua. A subcontinuum C' of a continuum C is a closed, connected subset of C. A space is nondegenerate if it is not equal to a single point. A continuum C is decomposable if there exist two subcontinua A and B of C such that A eq C and B eq C but A \\\\cup B = C. A continuum which is not decomposable is an indecomposable continuum. A continuum C in which every subcontinuum is indecomposable is said to be hereditarily indecomposable. A composant of an indecomposable continuum C is a maximal set in which any two points lie within some proper subcontinuum of C. A continuum C is irreducible between c and c' if c, c' \\\\in C and no proper subcontinuum contains both points. An indecomposable continuum is irreducible between any two of its points. ==History== Fifth stage of the Lakes of Wada In 1910 L. E. J. Brouwer described an indecomposable continuum which disproved a conjecture made by Arthur Moritz Schoenflies that the joint boundary of two open, connected, disjoint sets in \\\\mathbb{R}^2 was the union of two closed, connected proper subsets. Zygmunt Janiszewski described more such indecomposable continua, including a version of the bucket handle. Janiszewski, however, focused on the irreducibility of these continua. In 1917 Kunizo Yoneyama described the Lakes of Wada (named after Takeo Wada) whose common boundary is indecomposable. In the 1920s indecomposable continua began to be studied by the Warsaw School of Mathematics in Fundamenta Mathematicae for their own sake, rather than as pathological counterexamples. Stefan Mazurkiewicz was the first to give the definition of indecomposability. In 1922 Bronisław Knaster described the pseudo-arc, the first example found of a hereditarily indecomposable continuum. == Bucket handle example== Indecomposable continua are often constructed as the limit of a sequence of nested intersections, or (more generally) as the inverse limit of a sequence of continua. The buckethandle, or Brouwer–Janiszewski–Knaster continuum, is often used the simplest example of an indecomposable continuum, and can be so constructed (see upper right). Alternatively, take the Cantor ternary set \\\\mathcal{C} projected onto the interval [0,1] of the x-axis in the plane. Let \\\\mathcal{C}_0 be the family of semicircles above the x-axis with center (1/2,0) and with endpoints on \\\\mathcal{C} (which is symmetric about this point). Let \\\\mathcal{C}_1 be the family of semicircles below the x-axis with center the midpoint of the interval [2/3,1] and with endpoints in \\\\mathcal{C} \\\\cap [2/3,1]. Let \\\\mathcal{C}_i be the family of semicircles below the x-axis with center the midpoint of the interval [2/3^i,3/3^i] and with endpoints in \\\\mathcal{C} \\\\cap [2/3^i,3/3^i]. Then the union of all such \\\\mathcal{C}_i is the bucket handle. The bucket handle admits no Borel transversal, that is there is no Borel set containing exactly one point from each composant. ==Properties== In a sense, 'most' continua are indecomposable. Let M be an n-cell with metric d, 2^M the set of all nonempty closed subsets of M, and C(M) the hyperspace of all connected members of 2^M equipped with the Hausdorff metric H_d defined by H_d(A,B) = \\\\max\\\\\\\\{\\\\sup\\\\\\\\{d(a, B) : a \\\\in A\\\\\\\\}, \\\\sup\\\\\\\\{d(b, A) : b \\\\in B\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\}. Then the set of nondegenerate indecomposable subcontinua of M is dense in C(M). ==In dynamical systems== In 1932 George Birkhoff described his \\"remarkable closed curve\\", a homeomorphism of the annulus that contained an invariant continuum. Marie Charpentier showed that this continuum was indecomposable, the first link from indecomposable continua to dynamical systems. The invariant set of a certain Smale horseshoe map is the bucket handle. Marcy Barge and others have extensively studied indecomposable continua in dynamical systems. == See also == *Indecomposability *Lakes of Wada, three open subsets of the plane whose boundary is an indecomposable continuum *Solenoid *Sierpinski carpet ==Referencesexplains Brouwer's picture of his indecomposable continuum that appears on the front cover of the journal.

He wrote and directed the 1972 cult classic Deep Throat, which starred Linda Susan Boreman aka Linda Lovelace. He also directed the smash hit The Devil in Miss Jones, which ranked #7 in Varietys list of the top-grossing pictures of 1973. (Deep Throat came in at #11 that year, its second consecutive year on the list.) Damiano is one of the seminal directors of what is known as The Golden Age of Porn (1969–1984). ==Biography== ===Early life=== Gerard Damiano was born Gerardo Rocco Damiano to an Italian American Catholic family in the Bronx, New York City. When he was 6, his father died; his mother never remarried. The day he turned 17, he enlisted in the United States Navy, in which he served for 4 years. Before this, he was a shoeshine boy in Times Square and worked in an automat. After his discharge at the age of 21 years, Damiano studied X-ray technology on the G.I. Bill and was an x-ray technician at Jamaica Hospital in Queens, New York, then opened a hairdressing salon with a friend in New York City. Frequently overhearing sexual gossip at the salon convinced him that pornographic films made to appeal to couples would be a commercial success. ===His entrance into porn=== Damiano took an interest in film-making after his accountant introduced him to a producer who was making a low-budget horror film. Intrigued, Damiano began helping out as he could on the set, and went on to work as a crew member on numerous New York sexploitation films in the late 1960s.Deep Throat: Damiano, Lovelace.. and “Lovelace”, The Rialto Report, September 8, 2013 ====Deep Throat==== He directed the famous film Deep Throat, which was released in 1972 and starred Linda Lovelace and Harry Reems. The film is regarded as pioneering, and its success, plus that of The Devil In Miss Jones, which starred Georgina Spelvin, the following year, is credited with helping to launch the modern adult-entertainment industry. Damiano was surprised that the film attracted such attention. The film was financed by organized crime, and Damiano did not benefit from the film's substantial commercial success. Other notable films made by Damiano included The Devil in Miss Jones (1973), Memories Within Miss Aggie (1974), The Story of Joanna (1975), Let My Puppets Come (1976), Odyssey (1977), The Satisfiers of Alpha Blue (1980) and Skinflicks (1981). ====Recognition in Variety==== In 1973, The Devil in Miss Jones made the Variety list of the top ten highest-grossing pictures of the year; Deep Throat, then in its second year of release (and second year on the list), just missed the top 10, coming in at #11 for the year. The Devil in Miss Jones racked up box office receipts of $7.7 million for the year, coming in just below the James Bond-franchise entry Live and Let Die and Peter Bogdanovich's Paper Moon. Deep Throat grossed $4.6 million for the year, placing it ahead of the prestige picture Sleuth, which featured Oscar-nominated performances by Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. In 1975, Inish Kae, the film's distributor, launched an ad campaign touting the movie for Academy Award nominations. The ads in the entertainment industry trade press touted Miss Aggie for Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director (Damiano) and Best Actress (Deborah Ashira). Damiano often appeared in his own films in small non-sexual side roles, and used the names \\"Albert Gork,\\" \\"Al Gork,\\" \\"Jerry Gerard,\\" under which name he had actually produced and directed Deep Throat, or \\"D. Furred.\\" He directed more than 50 adult films during his career. ===Personal life=== He married three times; with his second wife, Barbara Walton, he had two children, Christar and Gerard, Jr. He was interviewed for the 2005 documentary Inside Deep Throat. ===Death=== Damiano died on October 25, 2008 in a Fort Myers, Florida hospital, at the age of 80 years, following complications from a stroke he had suffered in September. == Filmography (partial)== #We All Go Down (1969) #Deep Throat (1972; as Jerry Gerard) #The Devil in Miss Jones (1973) #Memories Within Miss Aggie (1974) #Legacy of Satan (1974) #The Story of Joanna (1975) #Let My Puppets Come (1976) #Joint Venture (1977) #Odyssey (1977) #Fantasy (1979) #People (1979) #For Richer, for Poorer (1979) #The Satisfiers of Alpha Blue (1981) #Consenting Adults (1982) #Throat 12 Years After (1984) #Cravings (1985) #Splendor in the Ass (1989; alternative title: Sex Express) #Young Girls in Tight Jeans (1989) #Just for the Hell of It (1991) #Manbait (1991) #Naked Goddess (1992) ==Awards== *2008 XBIZ Award – Lifetime Achievement in Movie ProductionXBIZ Award Winners, XBIZ, February 2011 ==See also== The following listing includes related award-winning directors of adult erotic films: * Andrew Blake * Bill Osco * Mario Salieri * Michael Ninn * Philip Mond * Radley Metzger * Tinto Brass ==ReferencesRoger Ebert Review (\\"best\\" of genre; rated 3 of 4) of The Devil in Miss Jones, directed by Gerald Damiano (June 13, 1973). * Roger Ebert Interview with Deep Throat director Gerard Damiano (July 26, 1974).

Work on the translation began in 1991, took 5 years to finish, and the completed translation was published in 1999. This translation is available in both traditional and simplified Chinese. ==Format== Based on existing versions of the Christian Community Bible, the Pastoral Bible: *uses easy-to-understand language *includes extensive annotations *has culturally appropriate and pastorally relevant annotations ==Criticisms== Since its publication, this translation has been in the center of some controversy due to: *being edited by a team of non-experts with no formal training in bible translation *being translated not from the original languages (recommended by joint Catholic- Protestant guidelines laid out in Hong Kong in 1987), but instead from the English and other editions of the Christian Community Bible *containing noted errors *containing commentaries leaning towards Liberation Theology, which may not agree with official church teaching *using a transliteration scheme that matches neither the Studium Biblicum Version nor the Chinese Union Version. Due to its criticisms, some regard this translation as being a poor translation unsuitable for lay people without extensive prior theological training; at the same time, there are also people who recommend this translation to lay people. ==Typography== The Pastoral Bible uses modern typographical conventions and is typeset horizontally from left to right. It distinguishes between passages the editors feel to be more important and those felt to be less important, and the less important passages are typeset in a smaller font. This treatment allows the bible to stay within a reasonable thickness despite its extensive annotations, which often take up as much as half of the page. ==Online versions== The Pastoral Bible is copyrighted, but the publisher has chosen to allow it to be accessed and downloaded online from their web site free of charge. The downloadable version is in Microsoft Word format; a browsable HTML version is also available. ==See also== * Chinese Bible Translations *Christian Community Bible *Chinese Union Version *Studium Biblicum Version ==References== *Kung Kao Po, issues 2871, 2881, and 2923 (in Chinese) — As of November 2005, these three issues have been taken out of the paper’s web site, but still in Google’s cache; however, the cached copies are expected to expire any time. *Zenit News Agency news releases, September 7, 1999 and February 2, 2000 *Web site of Claretian Communications -- publisher of the Pastoral Bible ==External links== *Browsable HTML version of the Pastoral Bible *Other browsable HTML version of the Pastoral Bible Category:1999 books Category:Bible translations into Chinese Category:1999 in Christianity ","title":"Pastoral Bible (Chinese)"},{"id":"3261308","text":"Ohio's 2nd congressional district is a district in southern Ohio.

They were recognized in the late 1980s, as lineal descendants of the two families who lived at the Lytton Rancheria in Healdsburg, California from 1937 to about 1960. The tribe now has around 275 enrolled members. It has a casino in San Pablo, California, and has proposed to build housing for tribe members, plus a winery and a hotel, just west of Windsor, California, in Sonoma County. ==History== The tribe was founded in 1937 by Bert Steele, who was one-quarter Achomawi and part Nomlaki, and his wife, a Pomo from Bodega Bay, when they successfully petitioned the U.S. Office of Indian Affairs for the right to build on a plot north of Healdsburg north of Lytton Station Road after Steele's home was destroyed in a flood. Along with his brother-in-law, John Myers, and his wife, Mary Myers Steele (both Pomo from Sonoma), he moved onto the land, which the government had set aside for Native Americans.Artichoke Joe's California et al. v. Gale Norton, Secretary of the Interior, Memorandum of Order and Opinion, United States District Court for the Eastern District of California This land became the Lytton Rancheria and the namesake for the tribe. In 1958, in accordance with a policy of assimilating Native Americans into the rest of American society, Congress terminated the federal trust in the reservations lands of over forty California bands, including the Lytton Rancheria. The Lytton band was dissolved and its land was deeded to its members. As part of the agreement, the government agreed to perform several improvements on the land, such as building roads and installing sewage service, but failed to do so. Within a year, the land-owning Lyttons had all sold, for reasons that are not clear; some current tribe members say that their ancestors did not understand property taxes and so were forced to sell, while other sources dispute that claim. In 1991 the Lyttons successfully petitioned the government to restore their tribal status. Though the Lytton Band does not divulge a complete list of members, as of April 5, 2005 there are about 275 members. Other bands of Pomo include the Guideville Band of Pomo Indians and the Scotts Valley Band of Pomo Indians. ==Language== Taken from Pomoan languages, see more: Pomoan languages The Pomoan, or Pomo ,Laurie Bauer, 2007, The Linguistics Student’s Handbook, Edinburgh languages are a small family of Native Californian languages spoken by the Pomo people who formerly occupied the valley of the Russian River and the Clear Lake basin. The Pomoan languages are severely endangered – with the exception of Kashaya, which had few dozen speakers in the 1990s, they are spoken by only a handful of elderly people. Northern Pomo and Northeastern Pomo are without known speakers and presumed to be extinct. A vast majority of people in the Lytton Rancheria speak English. ==Government== The Lytton Band of Pomo Indians Tribal Office is located on 1300 N Dutton Ave # A, Santa Rosa, CA 95401. They are governed by a democratically elected tribal council, with a working constitution. The tribe does not reveal its list of members, nor its constitution, so a majority of administration is unknown to the public. Their current administration is as follows: *Marjorie Mejia, Tribal Chairperson ==Casino in San Pablo == === Acquisition === After the community of American Canyon rebuffed the Lyttons' attempts to turn an existing cardroom into a casino, the Lyttons set their sights on the city of San Pablo, home of the Casino San Pablo (CSP) cardroom. Cardrooms are California gambling establishments where the house has no stake in the games. Customers typically pay a fixed amount to the house per hand, regardless of whether they win or lose. With the assistance of the city of San Pablo and the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, the Lyttons lobbied local Congressman George Miller to help turn Casino San Pablo into their reservation. Under the terms of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, only tribes who acquired land prior to 1988 would be eligible to operate casinos on their land.Bernice Yeung (June 6, 2001) \\"Gambling Their Future\\". San Francisco Weekly Because the Lyttons had regained their tribal status in 1991, and so were ineligible. Miller added a provision to the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act of 2000 that took CSP into federal trust and backdated its acquisition to 1988. When President Clinton signed the bill into law, the Lyttons gained the right to turn the CSP, formerly a low-stakes cardroom, into a full-fledged casino with much more profitable gambling devices and games such as slot machines and blackjack. Miller's backdating clause, in a section labeled \\"technical corrections,\\" has been described as \\"midnight legislation\\" and \\"underhanded\\". Professor I. Nelson Rose, a gambling law expert from Whittier College, said the bill \\"bordered on illegal\\". Others dispute that the language was added inappropriately; a former staffer for U.S. Senator Daniel Inouye described the process as nothing out of the ordinary, saying, \\"That's the way the republic works\\". ===Expansion plans=== In order to operate so-called Class III games, such as slot machines, Native American casinos must negotiate a compact with the state; the Lyttons have revised their casino plans several times in the hopes of procuring such a compact from California. One element of the plan has been the Lyttons' request that the state grant them a monopoly on gaming within a radius of CSP. After acquiring CSP, the Lyttons announced plans to expand it from into a , six- to eight-story casino, with up to 5,000 slot machines,Robinson, Bruce. \\"How Many Indian Casinos Are Too Many?\\" Gambling Magazine. July 24, 2005 which would make it bigger than the MGM Grand casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) expressed opposition in 2003, citing concerns that \\"off-reservation gambling\\" would be a strain on local resources, aggravate traffic congestion and increase crime.Josh Richman (September 27, 2003) \\"Dianne Feinstein bill would delay Indian casino .\\" Oakland Tribune. But on August 19, 2004, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced an agreement to create such a casino, an agreement that required approval by the State Legislature and the U.S. Department of the Interior. There was immediate local opposition to the agreement, including the California Assemblywoman Loni Hancock, and mayor of the neighboring city of Richmond.John M. Hubbell, Cecilia M. Vega (August 19, 2004) \\"Politicians shocked by casino deal; size of project alarms mayor, congressman\\". San Francisco Chronicle. Facing bipartisan opposition from the California State Legislature, within a week of the agreement with the governor, the Lyttons revised the proposed figure to 2,500 slots. In February 2005, San Pablo City Council voted unanimously to urge state legislators to pass the required enabling act, while in the city council in nearby Albany unanimously voted to oppose that. In April 2005, U.S. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) attacked the proposed compact.Zachary Coile (April 6, 2005) \\"McCain blasts tribe over bill allowing San Pablo casino; Bush likely to support Feinstein proposal to derail pact with governor\\". San Francisco Chronicle. Tribal spokespeople countered that the casino was \\"the final act in redressing the wrongs\\", the reparations for the government's dissolution of their tribe's legal status and reservation lands. In addition, they said the casino would create 6,600 jobs and would provide the city, county, and state governments with 25 percent of gaming revenue. In August 2005, after failing to get a compact based on the revised plan, the Lyttons added 500 \\"video bingo\\" machines to CSP. As Class II machines, these did not require a state compact.Janine DeFao (July 31, 2005) \\"Video bingo machines are tribe's new gamble; devices no different from slots, say critics of East Bay casino\\". San Francisco Chronicle. By mid-2006 there were over 800 new gaming devices in use. In 2007, the tribe reached an agreement with Feinstein: the tribe would no longer try to get approval to build a larger casino, or get Class III slot machines, and Feinstein would drop legislation that would have forced the tribe to go through rigorous federal and state approvals to offer even the existing Class II gaming in their casino. === Operations === Annual proceeds from the casino were estimated to be more than $180 million annually as of 2014. Under a 1999 Municipal Services Agreement, the tribe pays the city of San Pablo 7.5 percent of revenues; in 2014, that was more than $15 million, a decrease from $22.6 million in 2003. The amount is tied to the casino's status as a Class II facility. If it became a Class III (Las Vegas-type) facility, the annual payment amount would be much smaller. The tribe pays nothing to the State of California. As of 2011, about 200 workers at the casino belonged to a union, Unite Here Local 2850. That year, their average salary was $9.50 per hour. In May 2014, after years of dispute, the union and the tribe reached an agreement that provided for wage increases and minimized the increase in health care costs to be paid by employees. ==Charity== The Lytton Band of Pomo Indians supports many charities. Their current sponsorship as follows: * Schulz Celebrity Golf Classic * Luther Burbank Center for the Arts * Windsor Fire Protection District * The Boys & Girls Club of Central Sonoma County * PDI Surgery Center in Windsor ==Sonoma County lands== In 2002, an investor group that had collaborated with the tribe on the San Pablo casino project purchased 50 acres of land west of Windsor, California, a town just to the south of Healdsburg. The tribe, which expected to acquire that land from the investor group, said it wanted to build homes, a community center and a ceremonial roundhouse on the land. The Windsor town council responded by going on record as opposing the tribe's plans to develop the land beyond the one home per five acres allowed by the county's general plan. In April 2009, the tribe applied to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to have 100 acres of land - it had purchased more land to the west of Windsor - taken into federal trust. The tribe said it wanted to build 145 homes and a community center for tribal members on the site. In May, the Windsor town council voted 4-1 to oppose the tribe's plans. Tribal representatives said if they could not get Windsor to extend utility service to the land, they would use well water and build their own sewer plant. In 2012 and 2013, the tribe purchased more than a dozen properties in Sonoma County, paying more than $47 million. About 2,000 acres were owned by the end of 2013, including more than $22 million of vineyards and pasture in the Alexander and Russian River Valleys, 650 acres near the Sonoma Coast, and about 400 acres in the Windsor area. In March 2015, the Sonoma County supervisors approved an agreement with the tribe that prohibits the tribe from developing a casino, but allows development of a 200,000-case winery and a 200-room resort. Under the 22-year agreement, the tribe would pay the county $6.1 million for one-time impacts, and would pay the same property taxes and hotel-bed taxes that would be required if the lands were not in federal trust. A representative for the tribe said that future plans could also involve building 214 houses in addition to the approximately 150 it had proposed in its application to BIA. In May 2015, Congressman Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael) introduced a bill to take land near Windsor, owned by the tribe, into federal trust for housing and other non-gaming purposes as part of a new Lytton Rancheria reservation for the tribe.Lytton Rancheria Homelands Act of 2015, H.R. 2538, May 22, 2015 Huffman said he proposed to create the Indian lands through an act of Congress instead of through the BIA process because a Congressional act could completely prevent a casino, and could bring more certainty over what could be built and how the impacts would be offset. In July, opponents packed a Windsor town council meeting to request that the council oppose Huffman's bill. The tribe, which has given millions of dollars to the Windsor school and fire districts to offset the impacts from its planned housing project, is negotiating with the town of Windsor to get water and sewer service. Such an agreement would have to be approved by Windsor voters because the tribal housing project is outside the town’s urban growth boundary. In exchange, the tribe would build a 30-meter-long pool, which could be used by the Windsor High School swim team, a second pool for recreational use, restrooms, a changing facility, a community building, and parking, near the High School and the town center. ==References== ==External links== Category:Native American tribes in Sonoma County Category:San Pablo, California Category:Windsor, California Category:Pomo tribe ","title":"Lytton Band of Pomo Indians"},{"id":"3261311","text":"All the Weyrs of Pern is a science fiction novel by the American-Irish author Anne McCaffrey. Published in 1991, it was the eleventh book published in the Dragonriders of Pern series.. Retrieved 2011-10-09. ==Plot summary== The story follows immediately from the final scene of Renegades of Pern, in which the Admin building from Pern's first generation of colonists is discovered, along with an advanced computer called AIVAS (Artificial Intelligence Voice Address System), at the Landing site that is being excavated. AIVAS has remained undisturbed since the events of Dragonsdawn some 2500 years earlier and, in addition to holding a huge volume of stored information long since lost to the Pernese society, claims to be able to eliminate the threat of Thread forever. The Weyrs, led by Lessa and F'lar, enthusiastically embrace this possibility, and with the support of the Holds (led in particular by Jaxom) and the Crafthalls (championed by Masterharper Robinton) proceed to implement the ambitious plan under the careful guidance of AIVAS. Aivas itself had been programmed to speak with a masculine-analogue, inquisitive, somewhat humorous personality, which gave the impression of a light-hearted counsellor to the Pernese, who have no real concept of what artificial intelligence entails. Over the course of the next four years, Pernese society systematically regains much technology that was lost to the colonists in early attempts to survive Threadfall, including marvels such as electricity, plastics manufacture, heating & cooling, printing presses, and surgery. Although most technological development focuses on the tools and knowledge needed to eliminate the threat of Thread, there are huge developments in the areas of Medicine and Science, and along the way new Crafthalls are created, including the Print Hall, Paper Hall, Computer Hall, and Dolphin Hall (this last occurs in a parallel story later in the series The Dolphins of Pern). The phenomenal advancements in technology lead to a kind of culture shock, manifesting in certain traditionalist elements among the Pernese who label AIVAS an \\"Abomination\\" that is corrupting their society. This dissenting opinion results in attempts to sabotage AIVAS itself and the projects it initiates, culminating in the kidnapping of the beloved Masterharper Robinton in an attempt to ransom his life for the destruction of AIVAS. When the conspirators responsible for the kidnapping are brought to justice, two Lords Holder and a Craftmaster are among those sentenced to exile for the crime. The Weyrs, Holds, and Halls are successful in carrying out AIVAS's plan to transfer the anti-matter engines from the ships used to colonize Pern to the Red Star, and detonate them. The explosion alters the Red Star's orbit, eliminating the configuration that allowed Thread to land on Pern. AIVAS earlier reveals to Jaxom that in order for the project to succeed, he must lead the other Dragonriders into using the lesser-known Draconic capability to transfer between time to deposit two of the three engines 1800 and 600 years in the past. Only the cumulative effect of three interspersed explosions will provide sufficient force to alter the planet's orbit. Jaxom's Ruth, who has an unusually precise ability to know exactly his location in time, is the only Dragon capable of performing this feat. In parallel to the primary task to alter the Red Star's orbit, a team of medical researchers led by Masterhealers Oldive and Sharra develop an improved parasitic vector which is capable of infecting the space-born Ovoids that are the precursors to Thread. During the course of the three engine-transfer missions, Green Dragons are deployed to seed the surface of the Red Star with these infected Ovoids so that they can be dragged back to infect the Oort Cloud, which is the origin of Thread in the Pernese system. The combination of Jaxom's time travel and this infestation is responsible for the two Long Intervals in the history of Pern wherein Thread failed to appear. The book concludes with a final conversation between AIVAS and Masterharper Robinton, with AIVAS expressing both satisfaction that its objective of eradicating future Threadfall has been achieved and concern over the possibility that Pernese society could come to idolize the facility as an all-knowing Oracle, thereby stifling further development. To prevent the latter, AIVAS deactivates its artificial intelligence functions, leaving its wealth of knowledge available to the Pernese via computer access, but without the crutch of AIVAS' direct guidance. Robinton, whose health has declined since the kidnapping, and himself satisfied that Pern has a promising future ahead, passes away in his sleep alongside his fire-lizard Zair. ==Awards== All the Weyrs of Pern was one of six nominees for the annual Hugo Award for Best Novel and it placed fifth for the annual Locus Award for Best Novel.

Of the many Judahs in the Talmud, he is the one referred to simply as \\"Rabbi Judah\\" and is the most frequently mentioned sage in the Mishnah.Drew Kaplan, \\"Rabbinic Popularity in the Mishnah VII: Top Ten Overall [Final Tally] Drew Kaplan's Blog (5 July 2011). ==Biography== Judah bar Ilai was born at Usha in the Galilee.Cant. Rabbah 2 His teachers were his father Rabbi Ilai I (himself a pupil of Eliezer b. Hyrcanus), Rabbi Akiba, and Rabbi Tarfon. He studied under Tarfon in early youth,Megillah 20a and was so closely associated with R. Tarfon that he even performed menial services for him.Tosefta Negaim 8:1 He was ordained by Rabbi Judah ben Baba at a time when the Roman government forbade ordination. Judah bar Ilai was forced to flee Hadrian's persecution. Almost at the beginning of Hadrian's persecution, Judah ben Ilai was forced to flee from Usha and conceal himself; and he often related episodes of the \\"times of peril\\".Tosefta Eruvin 8:6; Sukkah 1:7 When, after the revocation of Hadrian's edicts of persecution, the pupils of Akiba held their reunions and councils in Usha, Judah received the right to express his opinion before all others, thus being \\"Rosh ha-Medabbebrim\\" (leader among the speakers), on the ground that he was the best authority on the traditions.Jewish Encyclopedia Judah ben IlaiFor other grounds for this title see Cant. Rabbah 2:4; Berachot 63b; Shabbat 33a He was intimately associated with the patriarch Simeon ben Gamliel II, in whose house he is said to have been entrusted with the decision in matters pertaining to the religious law.Menachot 104a He was also able to win the confidence of the Romans by his praise of their civilizing tendencies as shown in their construction of bridges, highways, and marketplaces.Shabbat 33a Judah's personal piety was most rigid; and he observed many of the practises of the Ḥasidim and the Essenes. He drank no wine except on the days when the Law required, and preferred to eat only vegetable food.Nedarim 49b On Friday, after he had bathed and clad himself in white to prepare for the Sabbath, he seemed to his pupils an angel. According to a later rule of interpretation, Judah b. Ilai is meant in all passages reading, \\"It once happened to a pious man\\".Bava Kamma 104a He was naturally passionate and irascible,Kiddushin 52b but such was his self-control that he seemed the reverse. Thus he once showed exceptional mildness when he had an opportunity to reconcile a married couple.Nedarim 66b The study of the Law was his chief and dearest occupation; and he lamented the fact that such a devotion was no longer wide-spread as in former times. Yet his interest in the joys and sorrows of his fellow men was keener still. Whenever a funeral or a wedding-procession passed, he interrupted his study to join it.Ketubot 17a Judah lived in the utmost poverty. His wife made with her own hands a cloak which served them both in turn: the wife as she went to the market; the husband on his way to the college. Nevertheless, he declined all assistance, since he had accustomed himself to the simplest mode of life, and on principle desired to have no delight in this world.Nedarim 49b ===Tomb=== Judah lived to a ripe old age, surviving his teachers and all of his colleagues. Among his disciples who paid him the last honors was Judah ha- Nasi. His grave was shown at Ein Zeitim beside the tomb of his father.\\"Seder ha-Dorot,\\" p. 169 Tomb of Judah bar Ilai, Ein Zeitim, Israel. Obadiah of Bartenura, after visiting his tomb, wrote in 1495: > \\"About as far from Safed as one may walk on a Sabbath is the grave of the > talmudic master Rabbi Judah bar Ilai; and there is a little village there > called Ein Zetim. On the grave is a handsome tomb at which candles are > lit...\\" Italian pilgrim Moses Basola (1523) wrote: > \\"They say that once a Muslim woman climbed the tree on the grave in order to > gather almonds, upon which the other women told her to first ask the saint's > permission. But she showered them with curses. She fell off the tree, > breaking all her limbs. She then pledged the gold bracelets on her hands to > the saint, purchasing olive trees with them. Subsequently others made > pledges as well, and at present he [the saint] has four hundred olive trees. > This episode of the woman took place about sixty years ago.\\" ==Teaching== ===Halacha=== Judah often teaches the Mishnah of Eliezer, which he had received from his father.Menachot 18a He frequently explains the traditional halakhot by particularizations introduced by the phrases \\"Ematai?\\" (= \\"When does this statement apply?\\") and \\"Bameh debarim amurim?\\" (= \\"In what connection was this said?\\").Hullin 5:3; Berachot 2:4 His most frequent teachings, however, are the doctrines of his master Akiba. His own halakhot he sets forth in the form of midrashim, for in his view, mishnah and midrash are identical.Kiddushin 49a Those who devote themselves only to \\"mishnah\\" (that is, to the stereotyped halakhah without its Scriptural basis, he terms \\"enemies\\";Bava Metziah 33b but those who direct their attention to the Scriptures are \\"brothers.\\" Yet it is only they who interpret or expound the Bible who receive this latter name; for he who makes a literal translation of a verse of Scripture is a \\"liar,\\" and he who adds to it a \\"blasphemer\\".Tosefta, Megillah, end In his Biblical interpretation and in the deduction of legal requirements from it, Judah adheres strictly to the method of his teacher Akiba, whose rules of exegesis he adopts. It is thus that he explains a word apparently superfluous,Bekhorot 43b; Pesachim 42a and employs the rules of \\"al tiḳri\\"Arachin 13b and \\"noṭariḳon\\".Menachot 29b Nevertheless, he interprets also according to the older Halakah in cases where he deduces a definition from the literal wording of a passage, and bases his explanation strictly on its obvious meaning, \\"debarim ki-ketavan\\".Pesachim 21b, 91a; Zebachim 59b Most of the Sifra is to be attributed to Judah, nearly all the anonymous statements in it being his, \\"Setam Sifra R. Yehudah\\".Eruvin 96b Of his exegetical principles only one need be noted: \\"In the Holy Scriptures certain phrases which border on blasphemy have been altered\\".Mekhilta, ed. Weiss, 46a ===Aggadah=== Many aggadic utterances and traditions of Judah's have been preserved. His traditions regarding the Temple at Jerusalem are very numerous; and special interest attaches to his accounts of the origin of the Temple of OniasMenachot 109b and of the Septuagint,Megillah 9 as well as to his description of the synagogue at AlexandriaSukkah 51b and of the conditions and institutions of antiquity.Tosefta Terumot 1:1; Shabbat 5:2; and many other passages His high conception of the calling and the responsibility of a teacher of the Law, as well as his mild judgment of the multitude, was expressed in his interpretation of Isaiah 58:1: \\"Show my people their transgression\\"—that is, the teachers of the Law, from whose errors wickedness arises—\\"and the house of Jacob their sins\\"—that is, the ignorant, whose wickedness is only error.Bava Metziah 33b Many of Judah's maxims and proverbs have likewise been preserved; they include: * \\"Great is the giving of charity, as it brings near the [day of] redemption.\\"Bava Batra 10a * \\"Great is labour, as it improves man's lot\\"Nedarim 49b * \\"He that does not teach his son a trade, it is as though he had taught him brigandage\\"Kiddushin 29a * \\"The best path lies midway\\"Avot of Rabbi Natan 28 ==References== * Category:Mishnah rabbis Category:2nd-century rabbis Category:People from Northern District (Israel) ","title":"Judah bar Ilai"},{"id":"3261350","text":"Elis was a gothic metal band from Liechtenstein, formed by Sabine Dünser and Pete Streit in 2003 after the split of Erben der Schöpfung in 2002. The band temporarily split up in February 2012 after lead singer Simone Christinat's departure. However, a month later, the band began doing a search for Christinat's replacement and the search was successful. Elis has since \\"disbanded\\" in order to form a new group called Zirkonium, with Swiss singer Kathrin Schlumpf as their lead vocalist. ==History== ===God's Silence, Devil's Temptation=== Elis began their musical career under the name 'Erben der Schöpfung' in 2000. In 2001, they released their first single \\"Elis\\" as well as their debut album Twilight. The band has appeared live at the Wave Gotik Festival in Leipzig, among others, has held on to favorable positioning on the DAC-Charts, and has remained well represented in the scene's press. Germany's Orkus Magazine, for example, featured Erben der Schöpfung as their top newcomer act of the month. This choice was later more than confirmed by the publications readership, who extended the honor by choosing the band as their newcomer of 2001. Following their split with Oliver Falk, the band re-emerged in 2003 under the new alias Elis (taken from the single/song by their former band). Produced at Mastersound Studio by Alexander Krull (Atrocity, Leaves' Eyes), God's Silence, Devil's Temptation was simultaneously released on Napalm Records with the re-release of Erben der Schöpfung's 2001 debut, Twilight. Soon after the release of God's Silence, Devil's Temptation, Elis focused their energy on writing new material for their second offering. Between their song writing and recording duties, they found time to tour in a headlining capacity with label mates Eisheilig and The Vision Bleak. The tour took them to Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium. God's Silence, Devil's Temptation was inspired by the works of Trakl and drawing on the experience gained with Erben Der Schopfung, the newly created formation recorded immediately full-length album God's Silence, Devil's Temptation. In January 2004, the disc God's Silence, Devil's Temptation was # 1 in the charts at The Gothicworld.de. The same success has made the single 'For Such A Long Time'. ===Dark Clouds in a Perfect Sky=== In March 2004, they returned to the studio, under the guidance of band manager and producer Alexander Krull once more, to record the twelve new tracks featured on their second album. Released in October 2004, Dark Clouds in a Perfect Sky, showed a maturation of the band's sound. A video clip for the album's opener, \\"Der Letzte Tag\\" (translated to: The Last Day), was included with the release as well. The second CD 'Dark Clouds in a Perfect Sky' caused obvious association with the best works of Within Temptation or The Gathering. The Dark Clouds tour took place in April 2005. Elis played in Germany, Austria and Belgium, and were supported by Visions of Atlantis and Lyriel. The band offered a preview of the new material during festival performances at the Wave-Gotik-Treffen and M'era Luna Festival. Further opportunities for the fans to experience the new album live were planned for October, as the band embarked on a European Tour with Atrocity, Leaves' Eyes, and Battlelore. This tour ended with a performance at the Metal Female Voices Fest 3. This concert wasn't just the last of this little tour, it also was the last concert with guitarist Jürgen \\"BigJ\\" Broger, who left the band amicably soon after. Elis also appeared on a television show on German television, and video appeared in the program of 'Hell's Kitchen' channel Viva! ===Griefshire and death of Sabine Dünser=== The third release from Elis, a concept album titled Griefshire, was planned for release in late 2006 or early 2007. The band wanted to complete a tour with Leaves' Eyes and Atrocity, but, unfortunately, on July 8, 2006, Sabine died of a cerebral hemorrhage. An announcement on the band's official website a day later stated that the album Griefshire would be released in Sabine's memory. A further announcement in September announced that the band would continue with a new singer. ===Griefshire and new female singer=== Griefshire was released in Europe on November 24, 2006 on Napalm Records. The North American release date was January 16, 2007. On December 28, 2006, it was finally announced that the new female singer is the Austrian metal singer Sandra Schleret, former vocalist of Dreams of Sanity and Siegfried, and guest singer on some Samael albums. After that, they started a tour that took them for the first time to Mexico (as guest stars for the Festival Oscuro event in August 2007). In order to show how Sandra's voice would appear on the next studio album, the band released the MCD Show Me The Way, on November 2, 2007 in Europe and on November 6, 2007 in the U.S., that features Sandra Schleret on the two new versions of the song \\"Show Me the Way\\" as well as three non-album tracks from Grieshire's recording sessions, still with Sabine Dünser's voice. November 2, 2007 on the label Napalm Records released a new single of 'Show Me the Way'. ===Catharsis and onward=== In early 2008, the band posted on their official bandsite that they would be working on their 4th studio album that year. In September 2008 they went to a German Mastersound studio with producer Alex Krull with a new vocalist and recorded participated a song for the album with Michelle Darkness (End Of Green). The band performed a few live shows before entering the studio to record the new album. On November 22, 2008, it was announced that the name of the new album would be Catharsis, a title dear to Sandra Schleret due to the illnesses she went through shortly before joining Elis. Catharsis was released on November 27, 2009 by Napalm Records. Critics for the release were from mixed to positive. ===Departure of Sandra Schleret=== In May 2011, the Elis web site announced that Sandra Schleret had made a decision to leave the band. The following day, the band posted that the remaining members \\"agreed to give it one more try, but with a fresh start.\\" She was replaced by Simone Christinat in June 2011. ===Christinat's departure and new project=== In late February 2012, Simone Christinat announced to the rest of the band that she would be departing from the band, due to increased stress. A few days later, the band opted to call it quits. In March 2012, the band announced the search for a new singer for a new project. In April 2012, it was announced that the search had been successful and new material was being written. The new singer's identity was however not revealed. ==Style== Elis' music style is a very particular one in gothic metal. The influences of their sound come from both symphonic metal and doom metal, as clearly defined on their releases: the songs include most of the times an orchestral part and death grunts at the same time, making it hard to identify the band's true genre. The lyrics are another important element of Elis' music. Differently from many other gothic metal bands, whose lyrics are heavily influenced by literature, love and death, Elis' lyrics are mainly taken from life and experiences, as well as childhood (especially on the Griefshire album). Most of the song's lyrics are written in English, with two or three songs in German per full-length album and, before Sabine Dünser's death, she was the main songwriter of them. The only exceptions are (so far) \\"Heaven and Hell\\", a Black Sabbath cover; \\"I Come Undone\\", a Jennifer Rush cover; and \\"Ballade\\" and \\"In Einem Verlassenen Zimmer\\", whose lyrics are entirely taken from poems of the same (respective) names by Austrian poet Georg Trakl. ==Band members== ===Last-known line up=== *Pete Streit – guitar (2003–2012) *Tom Saxer – bass guitar, death growls (2003–2012) *Max Näscher – drums (2004–2012) *Chris Gruber – guitar (2006–2012) Touring member *Trevor – Drums (2009) ===Former members=== *Franco \\"Franky\\" Koller – drums (2003–2004) *Jürgen \\"Big J\\" Broger – guitar (2003–2005) *Tom Saxer - Bass (2003-2012) *Pete Streit - guitar (2003-2012) *Sabine Dünser – vocals (2003–2006) (died 2006) ===Timeline=== ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * God's Silence, Devil's Temptation (2003) * Dark Clouds in a Perfect Sky (2004) * Griefshire (2006) * Catharsis (2009) ===Singles=== * \\"For Such a Long Time\\" (2003) * \\"Der letzte Tag\\" (2004) * \\"Show Me the Way\\" (2007) ===Videos=== * \\"Der letzte Tag\\" (2004) * \\"Show Me the Way\\" (2009) ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Elis at Napalm Records Category:Liechtenstein heavy metal musical groups Category:Gothic metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 2003 Category:Musical quintets Category:Napalm Records artists Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2012 ","title":"Elis (band)"},{"id":"3261352","text":"The Heart Throbs were an indie rock band from Reading, England. They released three albums on the One Little Indian label before splitting up in 1993. ==Career== The Heart Throbs formed in 1986, initially by Rose Carlotti and Stephen Ward, both college students, who recruited Rose's sister Rachel DeFreitas and Mark Side. Rose and Rachel are sisters of the late Echo & the Bunnymen drummer Pete DeFreitas. The band released their first single in mid-1987 on Marc Riley's In-Tape label. They were then signed by Rough Trade, for whom they released two singles, both hits on the UK Independent Chart.Lazell, Barry (1998) Indie Hits 1980-1989, Cherry Red Books, , p. 111 After two further singles on their own label, Profumo (a reference to John Profumo), the Heart Throbs were signed by the UK label One Little Indian Records. Guitarist Alan Barclay a.k.a Alan Borgia joined at this time, allowing original guitarist Ward to move to keyboards. Their first album, Cleopatra Grip, was distributed in the US by Elektra Records, after which they were signed by A&M; Records, who released Jubilee Twist in the US. After disappointing sales, however, A&M; elected not to distribute their third and final album, Vertical Smile. The first and third albums were named after euphemisms for female genitalia, while the jubilee twist is a martial combat technique for attacking the male genitalia. The Heart Throbs' single \\"Dreamtime\\" reached a peak position of number 2 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1990, and their single \\"She's in a Trance\\" reached number 21 in the same year. Following the Cleopatra Grip tour, the rhythm section left the band, and were replaced by Noko (ex-Luxuria) on bass and Steve Monti (ex- Blockheads) on drums. By the third album, the band had switched to a third rhythm section of Colleen Browne on bass (formerly of the Parachute Men, who later joined Pale Saints) and Steve Beswick on drums. After the Heart Throbs split up in 1993, Rose Carlotti and Steve Beswick formed the group Angora, who then changed their name to Tom Patrol before eventually disbanding. ==Members== The initial lineup was: * Rose Carlotti (born Rosemarie DeFreitas, 16 December 1963) – lead vocals/guitar * Rachel DeFreitas (born 25 May 1966) – bass/backing vocals - left in 1991 * Mark Side (born 24 June 1969) – drums - left in 1991 * Stephen Ward (born 19 April 1963) – guitarStrong, Martin C.

Dr. Mark Puckett, Chairman of the Department of Geography and Geology at the University of Southern Mississippi, has studied the area for years. According to Pucket, many species of fossils from the river were the first of their kind to be studied anywhere on earth. Some sealife fossils that are now found worldwide, were first discovered in deposits along this river, from a period when it was part of the sea. Some species are named for local towns and landmarks. ==Course== The Chickasawhay is formed by the confluence of the Chunky River and Okatibbee Creek, where Enterprise developed in northwestern Clarke County, and it flows generally southward through present-day Clarke, Wayne and Greene counties into northern George County, where it meets the Leaf River to form the Pascagoula River. The Chickasawhay flows past the towns of Stonewall, Quitman, Shubuta, Waynesboro, and Leakesville.

It was first synthesized in 1996 by Aaron P. Monte. ==Chemistry== 2C-B-Fly in powder form 2C-B-FLY is 8-bromo-2,3,6,7-benzo-dihydro-difuran-ethylamine. The full name of the chemical is 2-(8-bromo-2,3,6,7-tetrahydrofuro[2,3-f] [1]benzofuran-4-yl)ethanamine. It has been subject to little formal study, but its appearance as a designer drug has led the DEA to release analytical results for 2C-B-FLY and several related compounds. ===Analogues and derivatives=== In theory, dihydrodifuran analogues of any of the 2Cx / DOx family of drugs could be made, and would be expected to show similar activity to the parent compound. So in the same way that 2C-B-FLY is the dihydrodifuran analogue of 2C-B, the 8-iodo equivalent 2C-I-FLY would be the dihydrodifuran analogue of 2C-I, and the 8-methyl equivalent 2C-D-FLY would be the dihydrodifuran analogue of 2C-D. Other related compounds can also be produced, where the alpha carbon of the ethylamine chain is methylated, the amphetamine derivative DOB-FLY can be made, this compound being the dihydrodifuran analogue of DOB, or conversely can be viewed as the saturated derivative of Bromo-DragonFLY. Where only one methoxy group of a 2Cx drug is cyclised into a dihydrofuran ring, the resulting compound is known as a \\"hemifly\\", and when an unsaturated furan ring is used, the compound is known as a \\"hemi-dragonfly\\". The larger saturated hexahydrobenzodipyran ring derivatives have been referred to as \\"butterfly\\" compounds. The 8-bromo group can also be replaced by other groups to give compounds such as TFMFly. A large number of symmetrical and unsymmetrical derivatives can be produced by using different combinations of ring systems. Because the 2- and 5- positions (using phenethylamine numbering scheme, 1,5-positions if numbered as benzodifuran) are not equivalent, all unsymmetrical combinations also have two possible positional isomers, with different potencies at the various 5-HT2 subtypes. Isomeric \\"Ψ\\"-derivatives with the oxygens positioned at the 2,6- positions, and mescaline analogues with the oxygens at 3,5- have also been made, but both are less potent than the corresponding 2,5- isomers. The symmetrical aromatic benzodifuran derivatives tend to have the highest binding affinity at 5-HT2A, but the saturated benzodifuran derivatives have higher efficacy, while the saturated benzodipyran derivatives are more selective for 5-HT2C. A large number of possible combinations have been synthesised and tested for activity, but these represent only a fraction of the many variations that could be produced. 540px ==Dosage== Alexander Shulgin lists a dosage of 2C-B-FLY at 10 mg orally. ==Toxicity== The toxicity of 2C-B-FLY in humans is unknown. Two deaths occurred in October 2009, in Denmark and the United States, after ingestion of a substance that was sold as 2C-B-FLY a small-time RC shop, but in fact consisted of Bromo-DragonFLY contaminated with a small amount of unidentified impurities. ==Legality== ===Canada=== As of October 31, 2016; 2C-B-FLY is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada. http://gazette.gc.ca/rp- pr/p2/2016/2016-05-04/html/sor-dors72-eng.php ===United States=== 2C-B-FLY is unscheduled and uncontrolled in the United States. However, it may fall under the scope of the Federal Analog Act if it is intended for human consumption given its similarity to 2C-B. ==Pharmacology== The hallucinogenic effect of 2C-B-FLY is mediated by its partial agonistic activity at the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor, but also has a high binding affinity for the 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors. ==References== ==External links== * 2C-B-FLY Entry at Erowid * 2C-B-FLY Entry at Isomerdesign Category:2C (psychedelics) Category:Bromoarenes Category:Designer drugs Category:Entactogens and empathogens Category:Phenethylamines Category:Psychedelic phenethylamines Category:Serotonin receptor agonists ","title":"2C-B-FLY"},{"id":"3261376","text":"Ísak Harðarson is an Icelandic poet and translator born in 1956.

Atomic hydrogen welding (AHW) is an arc welding process that uses an arc between two tungsten electrodes in a shielding atmosphere of hydrogen. The process was invented by Irving Langmuir in the course of his studies of atomic hydrogen. The electric arc efficiently breaks up the hydrogen molecules, which later recombine with tremendous release of heat, reaching temperatures from 3400 to 4000 °C. Without the arc, an oxyhydrogen torch can only reach 2800 °C. This is the third-hottest flame after dicyanoacetylene at 4987 °C and cyanogen at 4525 °C. An acetylene torch merely reaches 3300 °C. This device may be called an atomic hydrogen torch, nascent hydrogen torch or Langmuir torch. The process was also known as arc- atom welding. The heat produced by this torch is sufficient to weld tungsten (3422 °C), the most refractory metal. The presence of hydrogen also acts as a shielding gas, preventing oxidation and contamination by carbon, nitrogen or oxygen, which can severely damage the properties of many metals. It eliminates the need of flux for this purpose. The arc is maintained independently of the workpiece or parts being welded. The hydrogen gas is normally diatomic (H2), but where the temperatures are over near the arc, the hydrogen breaks down into its atomic form, absorbing a large amount of heat from the arc. When the hydrogen strikes a relatively cold surface (i.e. the weld zone), it recombines into its diatomic form, releasing the energy associated with the formation of that bond. The energy in AHW can be varied easily by changing the distance between the arc stream and the workpiece surface. In atomic hydrogen welding, filler metal may or may not be used. In this process, the arc is maintained entirely independent of the work or parts being welded. The work is a part of the electrical circuit only to the extent that a portion of the arc comes in contact with the work, at which time a voltage exists between the work and each electrode. This process is being replaced by gas metal-arc welding, mainly because of the availability of inexpensive inert gases. == Video documentation == * The Inside of Atomic Hydrogen Arc Welding, Part 1 - 1943 * The Inside of Atomic Hydrogen Arc Welding, Part 2 - 1943 ==See also== * Oxy- fuel welding and cutting#Hydrogen ==References== * Norton science encyclopedia 1st and 6th edition copyright 1921–1950 and 1976 * Van Nostrand's Encyclopedia of Science (Pg. 1311) * Welding Handbook Vol. 2 Library of Congress number 90-085465 copyright 1991 by American Welding Society * Kalpkjian, Serope and Steven R.

It was the first arc-welding process developed but is not used for many applications today, having been replaced by twin-carbon-arc welding and other variations. The purpose of arc welding is to form a bond between separate metals. In carbon-arc welding a carbon electrode is used to produce an electric arc between the electrode and the materials being bonded. This arc produces temperatures in excess of 3,000 °C. At this temperature the separate metals form a bond and become welded together. == Development == The patent for the arc welding method named Elektrogefest (\\"Electric Hephaestus\\") granted to Nicholas de Bernardos and Stanisław Olszewski in 1887 CAW could not have been created if not for the discovery of the electric arc by Humphry Davy in 1800, later repeated independently by a Russian physicist Vasily Vladimirovich Petrov in 1802.

As part of the Northern Coast Ranges, the King Range runs parallel to the coast, and its western slopes fall steeply to the Pacific Ocean. The King Range is adjacent to the Mendocino Triple Junction, where three tectonic plates — the Pacific Plate, the North American Plate, and the Juan de Fuca Plate — meet. The area experiences frequent earthquakes. Most mountains and ridges in the range are low to moderate in elevation. King Peak, at , is the highest mountain in the range. Snow falls above 3,281 feet (1,000 m) a couple of times per year. ==Natural history== The range is part of the Northern California coastal forests ecoregion. It is largely forested with climax-dominant trees including coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii ssp. menziesii), coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), and tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus). The rivers and streams that drain the range include the Mattole River. Four federally endangered species occur in the range: the Coho Salmon, Chinook Salmon, steelhead, and northern spotted owl. Other wildlife includes brown pelican, bald eagle, peregrine falcon, Roosevelt elk, osprey, otter, gray fox and black bear. ==History== Historically, the King Range was home to the Native American Mattole and Sinkyone peoples. In the 19th century, the region was opened to commercial logging, fishing, ranching, and tanning. In 1936 and 1937, due to the rugged terrain of the King Range and Mendocino Range to its south, engineers assigned to designing the new State Route 1 were forced to site the highway further inland/east towards the town of Leggett in its route north from Westport. Subsequently, the inaccessible coastal wilderness, known as the Lost Coast, remains the longest undeveloped stretch of coast in California. In 1970 the U.S. Congress designated of the range as the King Range National Conservation Area. It is primarily located within southwestern Humboldt County, and extends into the far northwestern corner of Mendocino County. In 2000 President Bill Clinton signed the law designating the rocks and islands just offshore as the California Coast National Monument. In 2006 the U.S. Congress designated of the National Conservation Area as the King Range Wilderness.

She was regarded as one of the outstanding goalkeepers of her age. Liz was one of the main advocates in helping women's water polo win a twenty-year battle to compete in the Olympic Games. So passionate were Weekes and her teammates about the acceptance of their sport, that they went as far as storming IOC meetings to gain recognition for their cause. Out of the pool, Weekes has become something of an international celebrity after she was voted \\"the most beautiful sportswoman in the world\\" by high-profile German magazine Sports Life who featured her Black & White Atlanta Dream modelling shots, although water polo is not very popular in Germany. Weekes now combines her water polo with corporate speaking, modelling and television appearances. Weekes is married to former rowing Olympian Robert Scott the CEO of the Australian listed conglomerate Wesfarmers. They have two children and live in Perth. ==See also== * List of Olympic champions in women's water polo * List of Olympic medalists in water polo * List of World Aquatics Championships medalists in water polo == References == ==External links== * Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Sportswomen from New South Wales Category:Sportspeople from Sydney Category:Australian female water polo goalkeepers Category:Water polo players at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for Australia in water polo Category:Recipients of the Medal of the Order of Australia ","title":"Liz Weekes"},{"id":"3261447","text":"Cogenhoe United Football Club is a football club based in Cogenhoe, near Northampton, Northamptonshire, England.

It was first developed by Alias Systems Corporation, before being acquired by Autodesk. Originally developed as commercial software, it evolved into a subscription model before eventually being made freeware for personal use. SketchBook features a radial/pie-menu user interface and has painting and drawing tools such as pencils, markers, and brushes. It uses pressure- sensitive features of digital drawing pads, tablet computers, and smartphones to create effects similar to traditional materials. A screenshot tool is also included for annotations, allowing one to show content during meetings, and to add notes for review. The program can also create flipbooks or animations, and it supports layers with the ability to import from and export to Adobe Photoshop (.psd) format. Other features include rulers, brush customization, and canvas rotation. == Versions == When Autodesk acquired Alias in October 2005, they discontinued Sketchbook Pro development for a time. Version 2.0 was released in July 2005, under Alias Systems Corporation. A beta version of version 3.0 was shown at MacWorld 2008 on display with the Axiotron Modbook. On April 2008, Autodesk SketchBook Pro 2009 was released to the public, followed by SketchBook Pro 2010, a year later. Autodesk continues to have a beta program for testing new versions of SketchBook Pro. There was a limited consumer version of Sketchbook Pro - SketchBook Express, which provides much of the same functionality as Pro, but does not include brush customization, layer controls, symmetric brushes, or guide lines. Earlier versions of Express could not save layers. Versions 5.5 and later, however, do allow the preservation of layers.

Android versions of both SketchBook Mobile and Express were to be later released on November 30, 2010. In August 2012, SketchBook Pro 6 was released, marking a return to conventional version numbering. Throughout May 2014, another new version of Sketchbook Pro was shown on the software application's website, referred to as SketchBook Pro 2015. In August 2014, SketchBook 7 was released, and with it, it introduced the current subscription model. In May 2017, the iOS 4.0 version of SketchBook was released. This update introduces new features; two-hand workflow, an improved quick-access toolbar, and an improved rendering engine. In April 2018, the full-featured version of Sketchbook was made completely free to all users; the subscription model has been phased out, and all premium features (including perspective guides, flood fill, layer effects, and brush customization) are unlocked.

The Battle of Beaugency took place on 16 and 17 June 1429. It was one of Joan of Arc's battles. Shortly after relieving the siege at Orléans, French forces recaptured the neighboring district along the Loire river. This campaign was the first sustained French offensive in a generation during the Hundred Years' War. ==Background== Beaugency was a small town on the northern bank of the Loire river in central France. It controlled a bridge of strategic significance during the latter part of the war. Conquered by the English a few years earlier as a staging point for a planned invasion of southern France, the French attack recaptured the bridge and the town, providing a vital supply conduit for the summer offensive in the north and the coronation of King Charles VII of France. The French Loire campaign of 1429 consisted of five actions: :1. The Siege of Orléans. :2. The Battle of Jargeau. :3. The Battle of Meung-sur-Loire. :4. The Battle of Beaugency. :5. The Battle of Patay. Virtually all of France north of the Loire had fallen to foreign occupation by the end of 1428. The bridge at Orléans had been destroyed shortly before the siege lifted. The French had lost control of all other river crossings. Three swift and numerically small battles at Jargeau, Meung-sur-Loire, and Beaugency demonstrated renewed French confidence and laid the groundwork for subsequent French offenses on Rheims and Paris. The Loire campaign killed, captured, or disgraced a majority of the top tier of English commanders and decimated the numbers of the highly skilled English longbowmen. French recruitment swelled following the victory at Orléans. During the assault on Beaugency one volunteer caused a particular stir among the French command. Constable Arthur de Richemont, who had been in disgrace at court for two years, appeared with a force of 1000 men and offered his services. At the risk of royal disfavor Joan of Arc accepted this aid. ==Tactics== The Loire campaign restored French control of strategic bridges. The one at Beaugency remains operational nearly six centuries after the battle. Joan of Arc and Duke John II of Alençon controlled a force that included the captains Jean d'Orléans, Gilles de Rais, Jean Poton de Xaintrailles, and La Hire. John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury led the English defence. Breaking with the then-prevalent form of siege warfare, the French army followed the capture of the bridge at Meung-sur-Loire on the 15 June, not with an attack on that town or its castle but with an assault on neighbouring Beaugency the next day. Unlike Meung-sur-Loire, the main stronghold at Beaugency was inside the city walls. It survives to the modern age and forms an imposing rectangular citadel. During the first day of fighting the English abandoned the town and retreated into the castle. The French bombarded the castle with artillery fire. That evening de Richemont and his force arrived. Hearing news of an English relief force approaching from Paris under Sir John Fastolf, d'Alençon negotiated the English surrender and granted them safe conduct out of Beaugency. The Battle of Patay followed on open territory on 18 June. ==Bibliography== * Devries, Kelly. Joan of Arc: A Military Leader (Glaucestershire: Sutton Publishing, 1999). * Richey, Stephen W.

Based in Oakland, California, the service carries a focus on recommendations based on the \\"Music Genome Project\\" — a means of classifying individual songs by musical traits. The service originally launched in the consumer market as an internet radio service, which would generate personalized channels based on these traits and songs liked by the user; this service is available in an advertising-supported tier, and a subscription-based version. In 2017, the service launched Pandora Premium, an on-demand version of the service more in line with contemporary competitors. The company was founded in 2000 as Savage Beast Technologies, and initially conceived as a business-to-business company licensing the Music Genome Project to retailers as a recommendation platform. In 2005, the company shifted its focus to the consumer market by launching Pandora as an internet radio product. Pandora is a freemium service; basic features are free with advertisements or limitations, while additional features, such as improved streaming quality, music downloads and offline channels are offered via paid subscriptions. In 2019, Pandora had about 63.5 million active monthly users, and 6.2 million subscribers. In February 2019, Sirius XM Holdings acquired Pandora for $3.5 billion in stock. ==History== === Early history === In 2000, Will Glaser, Jon Kraft and Tim Westergren founded the company as Savage Beast Technologies. Westergren had conceptualized the concept of classifying music by various traits and attributes — an effort that would be known as the \\"Music Genome Project\\". The company was originally pitched as an e-commerce service that would use the project as a recommendation engine, but this idea was scrapped after the Dot-com bubble hit its peak in March 2000. Afterwards, the company pursued licensing the technology to other retailers, such as AOL Music and Best Buy (who used it for in-store kiosks as a trial). The company faced increasing debt, and ran through its initial $2 million in funding by 2001. Westergren then convinced Savage Beast's 50 employees to work for two years without pay, prompting a lawsuit by former employees in 2003 due to deferred salaries being illegal under California law. After settling the suit, all but a few employees were laid off. In 2004, based on the success of the Best Buy pilot, Walden Venture Capital led an $8 million round of funding, and hired Joe Kennedy — formerly of automaker Saturn — as its new CEO. After agreements with Best Buy and Borders lapsed, the company began to shift its attention to the consumer market, resulting in the development of Pandora as an internet radio service using the Music Genome Project as a personalization system. After a beta period, Pandora officially launched in September 2005. Upon its launch, it was a subscription-based service, but added a free, ad-supported version in November after Westergren realized users were abusing its 10-hour free trial by making new e-mail addresses. Advertising could also be targeted based on the current song. === Growth === In 2011, Pandora went public via an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.In The War Over Tech IPOs, The New York Stock Exchange Is Drawing Some Blood June 24, 2011 At the time, Pandora had 800,000 tracks from 80,000 artists in its library and 80 million users. As of end of mid-year 2018, Pandora had 71.4 million active users. On March 7, 2013, Pandora chairman and chief executive officer Joseph J. Kennedy announced that he would leave the company after nine years. In April 2013, Pandora announced that its radio streaming service had 200 million users, including 70 million monthly active users. By December 2013, Pandora accounted for 70% of all internet radio listening in the United States. On September 1, 2013, Pandora removed a 40-hour-per-month limitation for free mobile listening. As of October 2014, less than 5 percent of active listeners were paying subscribers. By November 2014, Pandora had approximately doubled its library size, topping 1.5 million songs. By January 2015, songs played on Pandora had received more than 50 billion thumbs up from users. On September 15, 2016, Pandora launched \\"Pandora Plus\\", a new subscription service to compete with other streaming services; the price was set at $4.99 and was available in later months. In early 2017, Pandora revealed that 56 million of its 81 million active users subscribe to the Today's Country station and that country music accounted for more than 1.7 billion listening hours on the platform in 2016.Can country music save Pandora? The Verge Retrieved March 15, 2018 On July 31, 2017, Pandora discontinued services in Australia and New Zealand, citing a need to focus solely on the U.S. market. In September 2017, Roger Lynch became CEO and stated that he wanted to expand the service's focus on podcasts, with similar discovery features to those for music, as well as new monetization options. In January 2019, Lynch's departure was announced following the approval of Sirius XM's acquisition of Pandora. Lynch will be replaced by Sirius XM CEO Jim Meyer. On February 26, 2019, Pandora announced the launch of Pandora Stories, a new marketing tool for artists. The feature allows artists to build music playlists combined with voice tracks, where they can add a narrative and deeper insights. In October 2019, Pandora's parent company, Sirius XM, signed a multiyear deal with Marvel to launch a series of superhero-based podcasts in 2020. === Acquisitions === On June 11, 2013, Pandora announced it would purchase FM radio station KXMZ in Rapid City, South Dakota. On October 7, 2015, Pandora announced it had acquired independent ticketing agency Ticketfly for $450 million. In November 2015, streaming music service Rdio, founded by Skype co-founders Janus Friis and Niklas Zennstroem, declared bankruptcy and sold its assets to Pandora for $75 million.By James Risley, GeekWire. \\"Rdio to shut down streaming music service, sells assets to Pandora for $75M.\\" November 16, 2015. November 17, 2015. Pandora retained 100 Rdio employees, including Iain Morris and Rich Masio, who joined a growing licensing department in pursuit of direct licenses with labels and publishers. In March 2018, Pandora announced it would acquire digital audio ad technology firm AdsWizz for $145 million. In February 2019, Sirius XM Holdings acquired Pandora for $3.5 billion in stock. == Features == === Streaming === Listeners can tune into established genre stations, other users' stations or create their own stations based on their musical interests. The user can use thumbs up and thumbs down buttons to declare whether they like a track or not, which determines whether similar songs should be played in the station. A second thumbs down to the same artist will ban that artist from the selected station. A thumbs down immediately skips a song, but the number of times a user can skip tracks is limited unless they are using one of the paid subscription plans, or opts to watch a video ad. More than 450 musical attributes are considered when selecting the next song. These 450 attributes are combined into larger groups called focus traits, of which there are 2,000. Examples of these are rhythm syncopation, key tonality, and vocal harmonies. Pandora is available in a free advertising-supported service, and a subscription-based tier known as \\"Pandora Plus\\" (rebranded from \\"Pandora One\\" in September 2015), which also features offline playback support using a prediction mechanism, and more skips and replays. In March 2017, a third tier known as \\"Pandora Premium\\" was launched, which allows users to listen to and create playlists of individual songs on-demand (making it more in line with competing services such as Apple Music and Spotify). The recommendation engine can also be used to generate playlists of similar songs. Pandora also emphasized a use of machine learning and manual curation, including filtering out low-quality content such as \\"knock-off covers\\" and karaoke tracks. === Limitations === Initially, users with free accounts could listen to 40 hours of music a month, and could pay $0.99 per month for unlimited streaming. In September 2011, Pandora removed the 40-hour listening limit.\\"New Pandora for All\\" . Pandora Blog. September 22, 2011. Retrieved September 3, 2011. This 40-hour limit on free listening was re-introduced in March 2013 for mobile devices.Pandora caps monthly free tunes on mobiles to 40 hours — Tech News and Analysis. Gigaom.com (February 28, 2013). Retrieved January 17, 2014. However, this limit was removed once more in September of the same year. In September 2016, a rewind function was introduced allowing users to replay a song. The updated streaming service also allowed users to skip an unidentified number of additional songs per hour if they opted to watch an ad. Previous to that, users were only able to skip six songs in an hour. == Device support == Pandora apps are available for Android and iOS. Apps are also available for Apple Watch and Wear OS smartwatches. Integrations have also been offered with smart speakers. Support for voice control was added to the mobile apps in January 2019. == Business model == In the three months that ended October 31, 2011, advertising comprised 88% of Pandora's total revenues;Pandora Media, Inc. \\"2011 3rd Quarter Report, SEC Form 10-Q.\\" November 29, 2011. Retrieved December 2, 2011. that was reported as 80% in December 2013. RPM (revenue per thousands of hours) is determined based on CPMs (cost per thousand impressions). CPMs are largely dependent upon network effects and thus increase as a website scales and adds users. As such, Pandora's strategy in order to allow for widespread distribution was to offer a service unbundled from devices and transport. Pandora also works with system-on-chip manufacturers to embed its technologies on the chips they sell to consumer electronics manufacturers like Panasonic, Samsung, and Sony. Pandora's cost structure is highly variable, with content acquisition costs representing roughly 50% of total costs. There are three main costs associated with content acquisition. First, SoundExchange collects content fees on behalf of labels or artists on the recording themselves. These are by far the largest content acquisition costs. Second, Pandora pays licensing fees to agencies such as BMI, ASCAP, or SESAC in order to compensate composers, songwriters and publishers. Lastly, Pandora also pays TiVo Corporation for song and artist information; this has recently been structured as a flat monthly fee. High variable costs mean that Pandora does not have significant operating leverage, and in the next couple years might actually have negative operating leverage due to an unfavorable shift in product mix towards mobile. Pandora is currently estimated to monetize mobile hours at roughly one-ninth the rate of desktop hours. Since Pandora pays the same licensing cost per hour irrespective of the user's platform, the net contribution to earnings per mobile hour is even more skewed with respect to contribution to earnings from desktop hours. Mobile revenues will improve over time as Pandora shifts from relying on third-party ad networks to selling ad inventory internally at premium rates. In January 2011, Pandora met with investment banks to consider a possible $100 million IPO. The company filed with the SEC for a $100mm IPO on February 11, 2011 and officially began trading on the New York Stock Exchange with ticker symbol \\"P\\" on June 15, 2011 at a price of $16/share. This gave them a valuation of nearly $2.6 billion. Pandora announced $80.8 million in total revenue for their first quarter of fiscal 2012, which was up 58% over their previous year Q1 results. Of the $80.8 million, $70.6 million came from advertising, while the other $10.2 million came from subscription. In addition, Pandora has seen a 62% advertising revenue increase, and a 38% subscription revenue increase year- over-year. However, the vast majority of Pandora's users remain on the free, ad-supported model. == Royalties == Pandora's business model was threatened by changes to royalty structures affecting internet radio in the United States, with the Copyright Royalty Board having ordered increases to per-song performance royalties (which are not paid by terrestrial radio) in March 2007. Pandora was a member of an industry group, SaveNetRadio, which opposed the increases. In August 2008, Westergen told The Washington Post that they were \\"approaching a pull-the-plug kind of decision\\", arguing that \\"the moment we think this problem in Washington is not going to get solved, we have to pull the plug because all we're doing is wasting money.\\" On July 7, 2009, SoundExchange announced that agreements had been reached on royalty rates for internet radio, with larger webcasters paying a minimum of 25% of total revenue or rates per-song per-listener, whichever is higher. Pandora described the new rates as being \\"a middle ground that, while perhaps not meeting all of our aspirations, still represents a thoughtful and reasoned outcome under the circumstances.\\" Due to the new rates still being relatively high in comparison to terrestrial radio, Pandora announced that ad-supported service would be limited to 40 hours per-month, and that users would be required to pay a $0.99 fee (separate from the Pandora One subscription, which is ad-free) to receive unlimited listening for the remainder of the month With an update to the Pandora player in September 2011, the 40 hour cap was extended to 320 hours. On November 22, 2011, Pandora reported its Q3 earnings. Royalty costs accounted for 50% of revenue, slightly better than expected. Its revenue, most of it from advertising, continued to rise at respectable rates. Not only has Pandora attracted more users but the average number of hours per user have also increased. Pandora now accounts for an estimated 4% of total US listening hours. As Pandora grows, it hopes to gain leverage on music labels and drive royalty costs down.Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry and Henry Blodget, \\"Pandora Still Growing Like Gangbusters -- Now 4% Of Total US Radio Listening\\" , Business Insider, November 23, 2011. Pandora CEO Tim Westergren has supported The Internet Radio Fairness Act or IRFA (H.R. 6480/S. 3609), which would reduce the company's royalty payments to the performers by 80 percent. On November 5, 2012, Pandora filed suit in federal district court against ASCAP over royalty fees. In the suit, the company sought to advocate for lower licensing fees on all the songs represented by the ASCAP's 435,000 members. On February 27, 2013, Pandora announced a 40-hour-per-month limit on free mobile listening. Pandora CEO Tim Westergren cited escalating royalty costs as the reason for the mobile cap.Tim Westergren, \\"A note to our listeners\\", Pandora.com, February 27, 2013 In a ruling made public in March 2014, US District Judge Denise Cote ruled that Pandora's rate paid to ASCAP should remain the same, 1.85%. She cited (p. 97) \\"troubling coordination\\" between two of the biggest publishing companies (Sony and UMPG) and ASCAP that alludes to core antitrust concern in the industry.United States v. Am. Soc'y of Composers, Authors, & Publishers (In re Pandora Media, Inc.) March 18, 2014. Retrieved 24 August 2020. After arguing that both ASCAP and BMI were showing bias towards international broadcasters who own terrestrial radio stations, Pandora announced on June 11, 2013 that it would attempt to acquire KXMZ, a radio station in South Dakota, under the presumption that doing so would allow it to access the same preferential licensing terms offered to services such as iHeartRadio (which is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., itself America's largest radio broadcaster). The move was criticized by David Israelite, CEO of the National Music Publishers Association, who declared that Pandora was now \\"at war with songwriters,\\" and had lost its credibility because it was resorting to \\"lawsuits and gimmicks\\" to make its point. However, a member of Public Knowledge praised the move, by stating that it was \\"a perfect example of the twisted incentives and strange results we get from a music licensing system that is based on who wants a license instead of just what they want to do with the music they’re using.\\" ASCAP also objected to the deal, filing a petition to deny with the FCC. The organization argued that the acquisition was not in the public interest because of Pandora's intent to use it as a \\"bargaining chip\\" for royalty payments. ASCAP also alleged that Pandora did not provide enough information about its ownership structure, failing to prove that less than 25% of the company was owned by foreign interests. On January 14, 2014, the FCC denied the acquisition until Pandora \\"demonstrate[s] adequate support for its foreign ownership compliance certification.\\" The FCC relented in 2015 and allowed Pandora to acquire the station under the premise that whatever foreign ownership Pandora had was widely dispersed; Pandora ultimately sold the station to Houston Hargo, who owned and operated three other stations in South Dakota. On September 1, 2013, Pandora removed the 40-hour-per-month limit on free mobile listening (originally announced on February 27, 2013). Pandora stated that it was able to make this change \\"thanks to the rapid progress of its mobile advertising.\\"\\"Pandora Removes 40-Hour-Per-Month Limit On Free Mobile Listening\\", Pandora.com, August 22, 2013 In 2014, Pandora signed an agreement with some music copyright owners for lower royalties in exchange for more frequent streaming of songs. Though not illegal, this practice raised comparisons to payola, which is illegal payment for airplay on terrestrial radio. == Reception == In May 2010, Pandora was named in Lead411's 2010 Hottest San Francisco Companies list. In 2013, Entertainment Weekly compared a number of music services and granted Pandora a \\"B-\\", writing, \\"Free streaming radio, $36 a year for ad-free. Launched in 2005, Pandora is available on just about every platform. There's no on-demand, though, and stations tend to draw from a relatively small pool of albums.\\" As of March 2014, the annual option was eliminated, and the $3.99 monthly plan was the only way to get Pandora One. The price rose to $4.99 a month in July 2014. The annual subscription was brought back and is now $54.89 a year. == Advertising == Pandora initially offered a subscription-only service without commercials. However, the idea of paying did not sit well with most U.S. consumers and the company had to consider alternative business models to offer a free service. Then, in December 2005 Pandora sold its first advertisement.\\"Pandora Radio/Music Genome Project.\\" Innovation Masters: History's Best Examples of Business Transformation. Ed. Miranda H. Ferrara and Michele P. LaMeau. Detroit: Gale, 2012. 267-270. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. June 10, 2014. In 2015, Pandora began playing more advertisements per hour in certain geographies and demographics. Pandora normally plays no more than 6 advertisements per hour for free users. === Revenue === Pandora became fairly popular within just two years. Starting from 2010 to 2012 Pandora's registered users had increased from 45 million to 125 million. The company's revenue increased from $55 million to $274 million, in which a majority of it from advertising. In order to appeal to a large audience of consumers, Pandora offers ad-free access for $36 a year. During its 2011 fiscal year, Pandora reported $138 million in revenue with a $1.8 million net loss, excluding the cost of a special dividend associated with the IPO.Pandora Media, Inc. \\"Prospectus, SEC Form S-1.\\" June 14, 2011. Retrieved June 22, 2011. Overall, Pandora has a 78% of Internet radio, and it has a 9.3% share of the U.S. public radio. Finally, in 2013 industry-wide total radio ad revenue increased to $17.6 billion in the U.S. === Pitch to advertisers === Pandora obtains its advertisers by explaining that the company reaches a narrower audience compared to terrestrial radio. \\"Pandora's pitch to advertisers is that its technology can cater to consumers with far greater precision than radio – it can pinpoint listeners by age and sex, ZIP code or even musical taste.\\" === Methods of advertising === There are a few different methods of advertising on Pandora. Audio advertising comes in spots of 15 to 30 seconds, and run once every 20 minutes. However, users only encounter ads if they are engaging with the site, like contributing a thumbs up or a thumbs down when changing a song or station. Next, there are banner ads which are featured on the wallpaper of the site. As noted by the New York Times, banner ads are on Pandora in order \\"to promote engagement, audio segments can be accompanied by clickable display ads offering coupons or product information. Advertising on Pandora works through a method of collecting data from the users online browsing activity. Once the data is collected, the company uses the data to show the user target ads. This process of advertising is also known as behavioral advertising. Pandora offers its users the option of submitting out of the targeted ads, by an opt-out configuration on its website. Opting-out will only prevent targeted ads, meaning users may continue to see generic (non-targeted ads) from these companies after they opt-out. Eventually, Pandora offers either targeted advertisements or generic advertisements for its non-subscribed users. However, Pandora's advertising does not offer local content such as the local news, weather, traffic, and talk. === Market segments === Pandora has created two market segments, one for Spanish listeners, and another for English listeners. By creating multiple market segments, Pandora's advertising is customized to its users' needs. In order to create the first two market segments, the company cross-referenced its registered user data with U.S. census. Then, the cross reference allows the company to identify zip codes with high populations of Hispanic and Spanish-speaking people, and finally it ran tests overlaying the two data sets to infer which listeners fit into those buckets. == See also == * List of Internet radio stations * List of online music databases * List of streaming media systems == References == == External links == * * Pandora featured in Fast Company * Closing Pandora's Box: The End of Internet Radio?, May 3, 2007 interview with Tim Westergren * Pandora adds classical music * Interview with Tim Westergren about the Music Genome Project and Pandora * Dave Dederer & nuTsie Challenge Pandora * Inc.

Its primary source of data are surveys but researchers cross-check business policy and their implications for LGBT workers and public records independently.Corporate Equality Index 2009, p.10 The index has been published annually since 2002. ==Criteria== The Corporate Equality Index chooses companies to rank, and rates them on a scale of 0 to 100 based on flexible criteria grounded in the \\"10 principles\\" of the Equality Project.Corporate Equality Index 2009, p.8; principles These include * A written policy of nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. * Inclusion of sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression in its diversity and sensitivity training. * Parity in domestic partner benefits required by certain laws like the Family and Medical Leave Act. * Appropriate and respectful advertising to the LGBT community. * Transgender-inclusive health insurance benefits. * Rejection of any activities that would undermine the goal of equal rights for LGBT people. ==History== Since 2002, the Corporate Equality Index has been published by the Human Rights Campaign. It was originally modeled after the Gay and Lesbian Values Index, a rating system that was designed by journalist Grant Lukenbill. When the HRC modified it, it became a 100-point system, as opposed to Grant's 10-point one. In its first year, the Corporate Equality Index awarded its 100 percent rating to 13 businesses.http://www.hrc.org/issues/4783.htm Each year, there has been an increase in the number of businesses that achieve this rating. In the 2011 index, 337 companies received the 100 percent rating. The criteria for the index has changed since its first publication. Beginning in 2006, transgender rights issues became more imperative to the index than they had previously been; consequently, the 2012 index will include more updated criteria regarding benefits of partnerships and transgender inclusivity. ==Effects on Corporate America== There are competing opinions about the effect that a company's rating has on its business. Some say that having a high rating will have a positive impact, while others say that it will cause a company to lose popularity among conservative customers. A study in Colorado showed that having a good rating in the CEI does not harm a company's stocks. The index also encourages companies to change their policies regarding LGBT employees, and in many cases accomplishes this goal. From 2004 to 2005, 92 percent of the corporations listed included transgender discrimination protection where they previously had not. Additionally, many companies are pressured to change policies that have earned them a poor score on the index, due to bad press. This has led to a competitive atmosphere among businesses to stay current in the latest LGBT-related inclusive policies. Larger corporations are much more likely to change LGBT-related policies as a result of the index than small or medium companies are. The Human Rights Campaign focuses on larger companies in the CEI, so smaller businesses are subject to little public backlash due to the efforts of the Human Rights Campaign and the index. ==Consumerism== Since its beginning in 2002, the Corporate Equality Index has had a financial effect on the businesses included in its ratings system. In 2007, the Human Rights Campaign introduced a mobile guide for consumers, allowing anyone to see a company's rating before choosing whether to do business with it, simply by texting the company's name to the index's short code, receiving an immediate response. ==See also== * Stonewall Workplace Equality Index, maintained by Stonewall for United Kingdom-based businesses ==References== ==External links== * Human Rights Campaign official website * 2018 Corporate Equality Index Category:Index numbers Category:LGBT rights in the United States Category:Human resource management ","title":"Corporate Equality Index"},{"id":"3261519","text":"Say It to My Face may refer to: * Say It to My Face (album), a 2001 album by Area-7 * \\"Say It to My Face\\", a 2017 song by Maty Noyes * \\"Say It to My Face\\", a 2017 song by Madison Beer ","title":"Say It to My Face"},{"id":"3261535","text":"QFX is an image editing computer program developed by Ron Scott, a Texan photographer and software engineer. The first version was released in 1990. At the time of its release, QFX was one of the most feature-rich image editing applications available on the PC platform (DOS, later Windows). It was the software of choice for digital artists and image postproduction studios in the times when 1024x768 truecolor graphics were a luxury, far before Photoshop could have been considered a serious professional tool. Its clean interface and clever workflow helped build a devoted user base, some of whom continue using it, despite QFXs being long ago eclipsed in features and users by Photoshop. ==History== The first version of QFX was released around 1990. It ran on PCs equipped with AT&T; Truevision AT Vista and Targa ISA bus framebuffer graphics cards. Low end Targa cards were limited to 8 bits, but most were 24 bit with a hardware alpha channel; Vista cards were 24 bit, and capable of greater than video resolution. All could capture RGB video. Early versions of QFX had no brushes; the program was used for image processing and color correction, rather than image creation, providing basic filters (blur, noise, glow etc.) that were a collection of MS-DOS programs that could be run from the command line and included in batch files. This functionality continued with all Targa and Vista versions of the program, and allowed operation on images with a resolution far greater than the graphics display device. Later Windows releases introduced an internal scripting facility that pre-dated Photoshop's actions by many years. The early version ran on both Intel and DEC Alpha processors. The program was popular with PC-based computer animators, who would often use QFX tools to composite multiple image layers for single-frame output to a video recorder or film recorder. In 1991 the new version called Hires QFX priced around US$3500, provided additional features including brushes and expanded support for large image files. In that time the alternatives for professional digital image editing were over-200k-and-more- USD dedicated workstations like Quantel's Paintbox, Crossfield or Barco Creator software running on expensive SGI Power series multiprocessor boxes. QFX was one of the first multiprocessor optimized graphics programs. When running on dual processor systems, it would split the image in two, running half on each processor. Could use \\"all memory\\" without use of \\"memory manages\\" (QMM per example) through Motherboard's BIOS, when DOS can not handle more of 16MB!, and let user set the undo levels up to 999 years before others (aka; Photoshop) keep just one undo. Allow use customs icons for customs scripts! The boom of DTP and the rapid advances in PC hardware in the mid-1990s changed the market for graphics software. Photoshop, windows oriented, less technical and cheaper solution for anybody proved to be a winning approach. QFX continued adding new features including a windows-based interface and CMYK handling, but was unable to compete with the lower-priced and increasingly feature-rich Photoshop. ==Present== QFX was also the core code for a Computer Aided Jewelry Design System known as Digital Goldsmith, a 'paint' application which originally used an 'old' Tips Targa Plus format platform for image manipulation and architecture. Although the rastor based DG, the core of which is a stripped-down QFX code, which Ron Scott modified appropriately with programming assistance from Kenton West, has moved on into the Computer Controlled Mill utilizing Nurb Design with GemVision's Matrix software, yet, one may find Digital Goldsmith as the 'photoshop', world-wide, in the Jewelry Custom Design industry. During the mid-1990s Gemvision's CEO/Founder Jeff High along with Kent West and Simon Lonergan assisted Ron Scott as extensive beta testers, macro designers for DG while further lending valuable support and testing for what has become today's QFX(the addition of a thumbnails browser, among many more written for the DG application even, etc...). ==References== ==External links== * Category:Raster graphics editors Category:Windows graphics-related software Category:Technical communication tools ","title":"QFX"},{"id":"3261536","text":"Yvette Donna Higgins (born 5 January 1978 in Sydney) is an Australian water polo player from the gold medal squad of the 2000 Summer Olympics.

Frege argued that many philosophical errors, especially those related to psychologism in the philosophy of logic and philosophy of mathematics, could be avoided by adhering carefully to the context principle. The view of meaning expressed by the context principle is sometimes called semantic contextualism. This view need not be contrasted with the view that the meanings of words or expressions can (or must) be determined prior to, and independently of, the meanings of the propositions in which they occur, which is often referred to as compositionalism. The context principle also figures prominently in the work of other analytic philosophers, such as Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein, who were greatly influenced by Frege's work. == Formulations of the context principle == ;Gottlob Frege, Introduction to The Foundations of Arithmetic (1884/1980) : In the enquiry that follows, I have kept to three fundamental principles: :: always to separate sharply the psychological from the logical, the subjective from the objective; :: never to ask for the meaning of a word in isolation, but only in the context of a proposition :: never to lose sight of the distinction between concept and object. ;Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921/1922) : 3.3 Only the proposition has sense; only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning. ... : 3.314 An expression has meaning only in a proposition.

It has an area of . The park protects of shoreline on Albert Lea Lake. The nucleus of the park is Big Island, a island attached to the mainland by a causeway. In turn a causeway connects Big Island to Little Island. The park was formerly named Helmer Myre State Park after former Minnesota State Senator Helmer Myre. ==Natural history== The park is situated on the Bemis Moraine, which marks the southern extent of a glacial lobe during the Wisconsin glaciation 10,000 years ago. As the glacier retreated, the moraine caused the meltwater to back up behind it. Albert Lea Lake was created as a moraine-dammed lake and today covers . The park also contains an esker, a sinuous ridge of sand and gravel dropped by a stream running under the glacier. The mainland is primarily vegetated in oak savanna with several wetlands. Restoration ecology projects, including controlled burning and water retention strategies, are ongoing to maintain and improve these habitats. Big Island, protected from the wildfires that suppressed tree growth in the savannas and prairie of southern Minnesota, bears a closed forest savanna which looks like an old growth hardwood forest. It comprises maple, basswood, elm, green ash, ironwood, and red oak, with willows along the lakeshore. Albert Lea Lake is highly eutrophic. Moraine dammed lakes typically fill in, but this process has been exacerbated by agricultural runoff. ==Wildlife== This park is home to white-tailed deer, red and gray foxes, raccoons, muskrats, opossums, squirrels, and several species of bats. It is also known for its birdwatching opportunities, especially during the spring and fall migration. One particularly notable species is the American white pelican which congregates on Albert Lea Lake. ==Cultural history== Artifacts, many of them collected by a local amateur archaeologist named Owen Johnson in the mid-1940s, reveal that humans have been living around the area's lakes for 9,000 years. Johnson became an advocate for protecting Big Island as a state park, as did state Senator Helmer Myre, another resident of Albert Lea. At the time Big Island was divided into seventeen privately owned lots, and some of the owners were considering logging their trees. In 1947 a bill backed by Myre easily passed through the Minnesota Legislature which authorized the Department of Conservation to acquire the island. An organization of local supporters raised additional funds to buy out the current owners and develop a picnic ground and trails. While referred to as Big Island State Park, the park did not receive an official name until 1953, when it was formally dubbed Myre State Park to honor the senator, who had died two years previously. In the early 1960s a campground was added, but Big Island was too small to support much visitation. When it was announced that Interstates 90 and 35 would intersect near Albert Lea, a new local organization began pushing for more land to be added to the park. An additional area of on the mainland was authorized in 1963. In 1974 a real estate company acquired for development a tract northeast of the park, which included lakeshore and the esker. Again strong local support was the driving force in adding this land to the park, overcoming legal and financial constraints over a two-year advocacy. Owen Johnson donated his collection of Native American surface artifacts to the park in 1972. They are housed in the Owen Johnson Interpretive Center at the park entrance, where they are available for research but are not currently on public display. In 1990 the park's previous names were combined into the new official moniker, Myre-Big Island State Park. ==Recreation== *Boating: **Boat ramp on Little Island. **Rental canoes available. **Boat tours of Albert Lea Lake embark from town. *Camping: **Big Island Campground: 34 wooded sites (17 with electrical hookups), 1 camper cabin. **White Fox Campground: 59 open sites (15 electrical). **Little Island Pioneer Group Camp: 50 person capacity, tenting only. **New York Point Group Camp: Tent or vehicle camping with access to kitchen/mess hall & showers/restrooms. **4 backpacking sites. *Fishing: Black bullhead, carp, northern pike, and various panfish in Albert Lea Lake. *Trails: of hiking, of mountain biking, of cross-country skiing, and of snowmobiling trails. **Blazing Star State Trail: of paved, multi-use trail begin in Frank Hall Park in Albert Lea and end near the esker.

U.S. Highway 11 is at left. The Leaf River is a river, about 180 mi (290 km) long, in southern Mississippi in the United States. It is a principal tributary of the Pascagoula River, which flows to the Gulf of Mexico. ==Course== 250 px The Leaf River rises in the Bienville National Forest in southwestern Scott County and flows initially southward through eastern Smith, northeastern Covington, western Jones and northern Forrest Counties to Hattiesburg, where it collects the Bouie River. Below Hattiesburg, the river turns southeastward and flows through central Perry and southwestern Greene Counties, skirting the edge of the De Soto National Forest, into northern George County, where it joins the Chickasawhay River to form the Pascagoula River. ==History== The Leaf River served as a trade route in the area before roads and trails were widely developed. It is recorded that traders made regular trips to people living near the river bringing with them supplies from Pascagoula. Legend says that one of these traders buried his profits, several thousand dollars in Spanish coins, near the banks of the Leaf River. The coins were later found in about 1854. ==Alleged pollution== While the upper stretches of the river enjoy an excellent reputation, the lower river has been the subject of claims of pollution since the 1990s. At that time, thousands of area residents filed suit against the Georgia-Pacific Corporation, claiming that its pulp mill released the dangerous chemicals, dioxins, into the river. In 1996, these suits were dismissed when the courts decided that there was no scientific proof that dangerous dioxin levels were present in the river or that Georgia-Pacific was negligent. ==Variant names== According to the Geographic Names Information System, the Leaf River has also been known as: *Estapacha River *Estopacha River *Fiume *Hashuphatchee River *Hastabucha River *Hastehatchee River *Leaf Creek *Pescaooula River (in part) *Slapacha River *Tallahoma River (in part) *Tally Hooma Creek (in part) ==See also== *List of Mississippi rivers *Leaf River Wildlife Management Area ==References== *Columbia Gazetteer of North America entry *DeLorme (1998).

It is located on the university's campus in Eugene, Oregon, United States. The library design is emblematic of the architecture of the university's older buildings, and it serves as a hub of student activity. As of 2008 it has a collection of more than 3 million volumes. The library also holds collections of primary sources such as photographs and manuscripts on various topics at the Special Collections & University Archives. It is also a depository for the Federal Depository Library Program. ==Construction and history== The building was opened in 1937 to replace the original library building (the \\"Old Libe,\\" Fenton Hall, completed in 1907), which the University's collections had outgrown. Construction of the library was financed as a Depression-era Works Progress Administration (WPA) project, spearheaded by Oregon senator Frederick Steiwer and took more than two years to complete. \\"The New Libe\\" as the Oregon Daily Emerald student newspaper had christened the building, was designed by Ellis F. Lawrence of the Oregon-based architectural firm Lawrence, Holford, and Allyn. Lawrence was also a driving force in much of the core architecture of the UO campus and was the first Dean of the School of Architecture and Allied Arts. The rich architecture of the building reflects an Art Deco aesthetic with \\"modernized Lombardy and Greco- Roman\\" elements as well as many integrated artistic embellishments including \\"the fifteen stone heads by Edna Dunberg and Louise Utter Pritchard, ornamental memorial gates by O. B. Dawson, carved wooden panels by Arthur Clough, and two large murals painted by Albert and Arthur Runquist.\\"http://libweb.uoregon.edu/knight/history.html Three major renovations of the library, in 1950, 1966, and 1994, have kept the building up-to-date and it is a daily hub of learning and research to University of Oregon's more than 20,000 students. 1994's $27 million renovation added 132,000 square feet (12,000 m2) to the building. The project was partially funded by Phil Knight, UO alumnus and cofounder of athletic shoe company Nike. The library was renamed Knight Library in honor of Knight's family. In late June 2020 UO officials said the original 1937 portion of Knight Library had been vandalized with paint on the sidewalk and the front door. The vandalism was directed at the phrase \\"our racial heritage\\" in a mission statement on a mural. According to KEZI news, the same mural words had been vandalized in 2018. Library staff had posted a statement a week earlier, \\"We will cover the Knight Library murals that contain racist content by October 1st.\\" == Collections == Entrance to the Special Collections & University Archives The University of Oregon Special Collections & University Archives collects and preserves over 3000 collections of primary sources on a variety of topics. These collections range from rare books, manuscripts, original art, photographs, architectural drawings and many more. It is located on the second floor of the Knight Library of University of Oregon. They help not only students and community members, but also faculty research using special collections. ==Architecture== The original 1937 section of the library, designed by Lawrence, contains inscriptions along the tops of each of seven large windows on the main (north) facade. These read, \\"Philosophia,\\" \\"Historia,\\" \\"Religio,\\" \\"Ars,\\" \\"Natura,\\" \\"Societas,\\" and \\"Litterae,\\" and are meant to represent (in Latin), the seven major disciplines contained in the library's collection.

Formerly, he was a professor of sociology at the University of Pittsburgh, and in 1988 he was the President of the Association for the Sociology of Religion. Robertson's theories have focused significantly on a more phenomenological and psycho-social approach than that of more materialist oriented theorists such as Immanuel Wallerstein or Fredric Jameson. For Robertson, the most interesting aspect of the modern (or postmodern) era is the way in which a global consciousness has developed. He lays down a progression of \\"phases\\" that capture the central aspects of different eras in global history, asserting that the fifth phase, Global Uncertainty, has been reached. Robertson's main works are Globalization: Social Theory and Global Culture (1992) and the edited volume Global Modernities. In 1985, he was the first sociologist to use the term globalization in the title of a sociological article. His 1992 definition of globalization as \\"the compression of the world and the intensification of the consciousness of the world as a whole\\" has been credited as the first ever definition of globalization, though a more detailed analysis of the history of this term indicates it has many authors. He is also said to have coined the term glocalization in 1992. ==References== ==External links== *University of Aberdeen faculty information for Roland Robertson *More information on Roland Robertson Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:Academics of the University of Aberdeen Category:British sociologists Category:University of Pittsburgh faculty ","title":"Roland Robertson"},{"id":"3261607","text":"The Sri Lanka National Pharmaceuticals Policy was established in the 1970s following the submission of a report by Dr S.A. Wickremasinghe and Prof. Seneka Bibile. It aimed at ensuring that people get good quality drugs at the lowest possible price and that doctors would prescribe the minimum required drugs to treat the patient's illness. It was a pioneer in the field of rational National pharmaceuticals policy. == Background == At the time, pharmaceutical companies were making considerable money by selling drugs under their trade names, giving out biased information about the branded drugs as against those named generically. Doctors often prescribed branded drugs, which were far more expensive than generic drugs, which have the same efficacy. The United Front Government of 1970 appointed the Wickremasinghe-Bibile commission of inquiry into this issue and it recommended the establishment a national policy and of a state body to regularise the trade. In the 1970s Sri Lanka demonstrated that a state buying agency linked to a national formulary was a viable and powerful instrument for reducing drug costs without compromising quality, for saving foreign exchange, for rationalising drug usage and for supplying essential drugs at reasonable prices to the whole community. This was made possible by the formulation and implementation of an integrated national pharmaceutical policy. A unique phenomenon about Sri Lanka's pharmaceuticals policy was that the entire programme was conceived, formulated, developed and implemented by Sri Lankan nationals without any form of external aid or assistance. == National formulary == A careful selection of drugs is an essential prerequisite of a national pharmaceutical policy. In Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Health requested Prof. Seneka Bibile to look into his matter and he prepared the Ceylon Hospital Formulary (CHF) of about 630 drugs under their generic names. Subsequently the Ministry of Health established a National Formulary Committee (NFC), consisting of representatives from the public and private health sectors and the University Medical Schools, led by Bibile. It published Formulary Notes for doctors, keeping them updated on developments. == State buying agency == Accordingly, in 1971 the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation of Sri Lanka (SPC) was established with Bibile as Chairman. The SPC channelled all imports and production of pharmaceuticals, calling for worldwide bulk tenders which were limited to the approved drugs listed in the CHF. The public and private health sectors had to obtain all their requirements from the SPC. Hence the stranglehold of the Multinational corporations on the drug trade was successfully broken and they were made to compete with each other and with generic drug producers, enabling the country to obtain drugs much cheaper. Branded drugs were replaced by generic drugs in the prescription and sale of medicines. In 1972 it imported 52 drugs at a third of their previous prices. In 1973, the SPC itself bought the raw material necessary for 14 private processing laboratories established in the island. Some drug prices dropped by half or two-thirds. The SPC bought from an Indian company the raw material necessary for a widely used tranquilliser at a much lower price than that charged by a Swiss multinational. == Drug information == It is essential that correct information on drugs and therapeutics be given to all medical personnel. The promotional material provided by the drugs manufacturers tends to be distorted in favour of their own products and adds to the costs of supplying drugs. In Sri Lanka, drug information was provided from official sources. The Prescriber, a quarterly publication edited by the NFC, was published by the SPC and distributed to all medical personnel. The extravagant promotional practices of drugs manufacturers were stopped to remove the dangers and costs inherent in process. == International experience == The Sri Lanka experience became a model for the rest of the world. The policy was supported by the World Health Organization and other United Nations agencies with enormous benefit to Third World countries. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development Secretariat examined the Sri Lankan experience, concluding that an analysis of the Sri Lankan model could give other developing countries an insight into ways of formulating, developing and implementing integrated national pharmaceutical policies. With Bibile’s assistance, it published \\"Case Studies in the Transfer of Technology: Pharmaceutical Policies in Sri Lanka\\". This document has proved to be a very valuable guideline for developing countries intending to initiate pharmaceutical reforms. Translated into other languages, it may be found with health planners of almost every Third World country. == Reaction of pharmaceutical companies== The first response from the multi- national corporations came in May 1973. Executives of the major pharmaceutical companies in the United States met Sri Lanka's ambassador in Washington, D.C. and handed him a letter addressed to the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka from the President of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturer's Association (PMA) of the US. The letter concluded with a statement that the PMA believed that the proposed actions would have most serious effects not only on the pharmaceutical industry and on all private industry in Sri Lanka but potentially for the health of its citizens. The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations (IFPMA) issued a statement to UNCTAD strongly criticising the UNCTAD report on the Sri Lankan pharmaceutical policies. == Post-1977 policy == This policy was watered down by the multi-national- friendly United National Party Government of 1977. There was continued government control of the types of drugs imported, but permission was given to the private sector to import multiple brands. The SPC was never dissolved and continued to supply affordable drugs, continuing to be responsible for centralised procurement for the government health sector. In 1987 the Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation was established to import raw materials and manufacture generic drugs. This has effectively withstood very strong pressures for privatisation. The earlier centrally controlled system enabled effective monitoring. However, at present, because of decentralisation of drug supply, while standard treatment guidelines are available, there is no effective monitoring system for prescription practices is in place; there is little quality assessment and no incentive for rational use. In 2005 the United People's Freedom Alliance Government promised to establish a National Medicinal Drugs Policy (NMPD) that would enable Sri Lankans significantly to cut down on drug expenses and get quality drugs at affordable prices while saving billions of rupees in foreign exchange for the country. Implementation of the NMDP could reduce the number of drugs imported, prescribed and sold in Sri Lanka to about 350 varieties. == References == Dr. K Balasubramaniam , 'The neglected solution', Daily News, 30 September 2002.

In 1999 at the World Scout Conference in Durban, South Africa, Resolution 4/99 was adopted by the Conference on Gender Balance in Scouting, urging all National Scout Organizations to adopt gender balance programs. The Annual General Meeting of the Boy Scout Association of Nigeria was held later that year, the NSO name was changed to the gender-neutral Scout Association of Nigeria. ==Program== ===Activities=== This organization is open to both boys and girls of all religions, although its members are mostly Muslims and Christians of various denominations. Program emphasis is on citizenship training and community service projects, services at national, state and community events, and providing first aid in case of disaster. Fish farming is carried out in rural areas to improve diet. There is a national community development project at Igbo-Ora, in Oyo State, which includes fish farming, agriculture and a training center for Scouts from all over the country. Scouts have planted crops including maize, melons and pineapples, as well as learned about mortar/mesh technology for the construction of low-cost housing. The project provides a training service to help local farmers learn new techniques. Scouts sometimes organize social activities with Girl Guides, and the leaders of the two organizations maintain contact with each other. ===Sections=== The association is divided in three sections according to age: *Cub Scouts - aged 6–12 years *Scouts - aged 12–19 years *Rovers - aged 19–24 years ===Ideals=== ;Scout Promise On my honour I promise that I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country Nigeria to help other people at all times and to obey the Scout Law. ;Scout Law # A Scout honour is to be trusted. # A Scout is loyal to the president of Nigeria, his Scouters, his employers, and to those under him. # A Scout duty is to be useful and to help others. # A Scout is a friend to all and a brother to every other Scout no matter to what country, gender, class or creed the other may belong. # A Scout is kind, gentle and polite. # A Scout is a friend to animals. # A Scout obeys orders of his parents, Patrol Leader or Scout Leader without question. # A Scout is cheerful under all difficulties. # A Scout is thrifty. # A Scout is clean in thought, word and deed. ;Scout Motto Be Prepared. ===Air and Sea Scouts=== Some Scout Groups belong to separate Air Scouts and Sea Scouts branches. Both branches follow the core programme in all Sections but can add more aeronautical or nautical emphasis depending on the branch, with some Group branches choosing to be recognized by the Nigerian Air Force or Nigerian Navy. ==Campsites== Across the country, there are campsites owned by the Scout Association of Nigeria; usually they are owned and operated by a Scout District, Province, Division or State. ==See also== *The Nigerian Girl Guides Association *William Thomas George Gates == References == *http://lawnigeria.com/LawsoftheFederation/BOY-SCOUTS-ACT.html *http://nigeriascout.blogspot.com/2015/11/the-scout-association-of- nigeria_23.html *https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxbLJ4bspu8BNk02UUVlY19EZEk/view *https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxbLJ4bspu8BeUNJYVVSdkhMMDNYZXpFM0VSM1VITnN2YWlv/view *https://www.scout.org/nigeria* *https://www.scout.org/taxonomy/term/1628 *https://www.scout.org/user/36054 *https://www.scout.org/node/142781 *https://www.scout.org/sites/default/files/content_files/Nigeria%20Scout%20and%20WOSM%20Vision%202023.pdf == External links == * Category:World Organization of the Scout Movement member organizations Category:Scouting and Guiding in Nigeria Category:Youth organizations established in 1915 ","title":"Scout Association of Nigeria"},{"id":"3261622","text":"Adi Joana Rokomatu is a Fijian chief who holds the title of Tui Sigatoka, or Paramount Chief of Sigatoka.

Before starting his late-night phone show, Beswick presented the breakfast show on BBC Radio Manchester. ==Career== Prior to becoming a radio presenter, Beswick worked as a soldier, a bus driver and a mental health nurse and for the Citizen's Advice Bureau; during his time at the C.A.B. he began to appear as a guest on Dave Lincoln and Friends, a programme on Radio City 194m MW (1548 kHz) and 96.7 MHz VHF / FM, an independent commercial station in Liverpool. In the early to late eighties, he worked for Lancashire station Red Rose Radio [ 97.3 MHz later 97.4 MHz FM and 301m MW (999 kHz) ] where he initially presented an afternoon show which won him a Sony national radio award. He then presented a late-night phone-in The Allan Beswick Late Night Show. which drew listeners and controversy in nearly equal measure. His listening figures for this late night slot often drew audiences equal to those of many radio stations breakfast shows. The overall 'audience reach' of the programme drew in the region of 100,000 listeners per night, but a total listenership across the North West, West Yorkshire and North Wales often approached 500,000 listeners. He was well known for his straight-talking, uncompromising style, ability to argue his case stubbornly, often playing devil's advocate and he had a penchant for insulting callers with whom he disagreed or didn't like. He was also known for his on-air professed dislike of Liverpudlians (\\"scousers\\"), which perversely made him extremely popular with Liverpool listeners, as they felt he typified woollybacks – people from outside the city – and all that was wrong with them. He has since said it was an act and he has no problem with Merseysiders. Other groups to incur his ire were train spotters and freemasons. Callers were met usually with the introduction of 'How do'. The show ran from 10pm to 1am Monday to Thursday with the first hour usually having music content, which turned virtually exclusively to talk after the 11 pm news. The show 'or programme' as he referred to it, drew comparisons with similar northern based late night phone in shows with James Whale at Red Rose Radio's sister station Radio Aire in Leeds, James H Reeve and James Stannage at Piccadilly Radio in Manchester on 261m MW (1152 kHz) and 97.0 MHz FM later Key 103 on 103.0 MHz FM. During the Red Rose era Allan released, in limited quantities, 2 'Best of' cassettes and one 7\\" single record. 'Beswick's Big Blue Cassette', which featured some of the funniest callers to the programme on Telephone number on Preston (STD Code : 0772) 561000 - which later changed to (01772) 561000. During his time at Red Rose Radio, Beswick also hosted a Sunday morning call in game show called 'It's Your Turn.' His assistant was credited as Wobbly Warren. Allan occasionally took his show to live venues throughout the Red Rose area, mainly in Lancashire and on Merseyside. He recorded Jehovah's Witness at the Door for the double CD 'Guide Cats for the Blind' (songs and poems of Les Barker) in 2008 An on-air incident led to his being banned for a period by the Independent Broadcasting Authority for being abusive to a caller. Red Rose held a ballot to see if he should be re-instated, which he subsequently was. This second coming lasted about a year. He soon moved to BBC Radio Manchester where he presented a lunchtime show, the morning show and later the breakfast show, moving back to his familiar late night spot in early 2015. In April 2007 a humorous comment Beswick made about the death of Alan Ball on a lunchtime broadcast drew complaints, resulting in an apology both from the BBC and Beswick himself. Beswick has also worked on BBC Radio 5 live, presenting late night sporadically in the early part of the last decade, and on television, including a slot as presenter of \\"Beswick's Beat\\", a local current affairs segment on North West Tonight. On 2 February 2015 Allan took over the networked late show on both BBC Radio Manchester and BBC Radio Lancashire. The show, which broadcasts from Media City, is mainly a phone-in with one or two music tracks at the beginning of the first hour. == References == ==External links== *Interview with Allan Beswick at Meredith Productions Category:British radio personalities Category:English socialists Category:English agnostics Category:Living people Category:1948 births ","title":"Allan Beswick"},{"id":"3261642","text":"The Beginning of the End may refer to: ==Film and television== * Beginning of the End (film), a 1957 American science fiction film * \\"The Beginning of the End\\" (30 Rock), a 2012 episode of 30 Rock * \\"The Beginning of the End\\" (Lost), a 2008 episode of Lost * \\"The Beginning of the End\\" (Merlin), an episode of Merlin * \\"The Beginning of the End\\" (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1987), a 1996 episode of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles * \\"Beginning of the End\\" (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2003), a 2008 episode of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles * \\"Beginning of the End\\" (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.), a 2014 episode of American television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. * \\"The Beginning of the End\\" (Grimm), a 2016 episode of American television series Grimm ==Literature== * The Beginning of the End, a poem by Gerard Manley Hopkins * The Beginning of the End, a book on the May 1968 events in France ==Music== * The Beginning of the End (band), a Bahamian funk group * The Beginning of the End (Sworn Enemy album), 2006 * The Beginning of the End (UTP album), 2004 * Beginning of the End, a 2006 EP by Discharge * \\"The Beginning of the End\\", a song by Boogiemonsters from God Sound * \\"The Beginning of the End\\", a song by Nine Inch Nails from Year Zero * \\"The Beginning of the End\\", a song by Rob Zombie from Hellbilly Deluxe * \\"Beginning of the End\\", a song by Spineshank from Self-Destructive Pattern * \\"Beginning of the End\\" (Status Quo song), 2007 * \\"Beginning of the End\\", a song by Systematic from Somewhere in Between * \\"The Beginning of the End\\", a song by Testament from Souls of Black * \\"The Beginning of the End\\", a song by HIM from Greatest Love Songs Vol. 666 ==See also== * The End of the Beginning (disambiguation) * The Beginning or the End, 1947 docudrama film ","title":"The Beginning of the End"},{"id":"3261644","text":"Lorenzo Aragón Armenteros (born April 28, 1974) is a former amateur boxer from Cuba, who was a two-time world champion in the welterweight category. ==Amateur career== Aragón took up boxing at the age of 12.

In the case of a public service concession, a private company enters into an agreement with the government to have the exclusive right to operate, maintain and carry out investment in a public utility (such as a water privatisation) for a given number of years. Other forms of contracts between public and private entities, namely lease contract and management contract (in the water sector often called by the French term affermage), are closely related but differ from a concession in the rights of the operator and its remuneration. A lease gives a company the right to operate and maintain a public utility, but investment remains the responsibility of the public. Under a management contract the operator will collect the revenue only on behalf of the government and will in turn be paid an agreed fee. A grant of land or property by a government may be in return for services or for a particular use, a right to undertake and profit by a specified activity, a lease for a particular purpose. A concession may include the right to use some existing infrastructure required to carry out a business (such as a water supply system in a city); in some cases, such as mining, it may involve merely the transfer of exclusive or non-exclusive easements. In the private sector, the owner of a concession -- the concessionaire -- typically pays either a fixed sum or a percentage of revenue to the owner of the entity from which it operates.Definition of concession agreement investorpedia.com Examples of concessions within another business are concession stands within sporting venues and movie theaters and concessions in department stores operated by other retailers. Short term concessions may be granted as promotional space for periods as short as one day. Depending on what the law that is related to a sector states, concession can either allow the authority to retain or keep ownership of the assets, turning over to the concessionaire and reverting the ownership back to an authority once the duration of their concession ended, or both the authority and concessionaire own the facilities. ==Early history== Muhammad Ali of Egypt used contracts called concessions to build cheap infrastructure - dams and railroads - whereby foreign European companies would raise capital, build projects, and collect most of the operating revenue but would provide Ali's government with a portion of that revenue. For other examples of concessions, see Gibbons v. Ogden and United States railroad policy. ==European Union regulation== Within the European Union, the granting of concessions by public bodies is subject to regulation. Works concessions have been subject to award rules for some time as Directive 2004/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the European Council on public procurement applied to works concessions, and the award of services concessions with a cross- border interest has been subject to the principles of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. However, the European Parliament and the European Council issued a further Directive 2014/23/EU on the award of concession contracts on 26 February 2014,Directive 2014/23/EU of the European Parliament of the Council on the award of concession contracts which required EU member states to introduce national legislation covering the award of concession contracts in excess of EUR 5,186,000 awarded on or after 18 April 2016. In the UK, the threshold for concession contracts is £4,104,394. == See also == * Public-private partnership * Private finance initiative * Production sharing agreement ==References== Category:Business terms Category:Distribution (marketing) Category:Business models Category:Rights Category:European Union law ","title":"Concession (contract)"},{"id":"3261665","text":"The Bouie River, sometimes known as the Bowie River, is a tributary of the Leaf River, long, in southern Mississippi in the United States.

Occurring annually from 1995 to 2007, the trip traversed the United States from the East Coast to the West Coast. Co-Founded in 1994 by Yale University students Antony Brydon and Tina Teresa Pihl, the original Habitat Bicycle Challenge featured eight riders bicycling from New Haven to San Francisco, California in the summer of 1995. By the time the final ride took place in 2007, HBC attracted about 90 participants a year and had grown to include two additional routes, one ending in Portland, Oregon (after reaching the Pacific Ocean at Cape Lookout) and the other ending in Seattle, Washington. Even as it grew, HBC retained its origins as a student-run organization, with a core group of twelve leaders (four per route) organizing every aspect of the three trips, from planning routes to securing corporate sponsorships. Sponsors included Green Mountain Gringo Salsa, Clif Bar, Cannondale, Energy Brands, Bear Naked, and Mortgage Lenders Network, among others. Because the three trips served as benefit rides for Habitat for Humanity of Greater New Haven, each rider was required to raise a substantial amount of money ($4000 by 2007) prior to the trips' departure in June. Corporate sponsorships and grants from foundations covered the cost of the trips themselves, so every dollar raised went directly towards underwriting the construction costs of the Collegiate Build, a subsidiary of Habitat for Humanity of Greater New Haven that funds and constructs Habitat houses entirely through the efforts of students from Yale University and other colleges in the New Haven area. In its first year HBC raised about $50,000, and by 2004 it had become the single largest fundraiser for any Habitat affiliate in the world, raising over $400,000 a year, enough money to underwrite the construction of eight homes. Over the course of its 12-year run, the Habitat Bicycle Challenge raised roughly $2.4 million. On the road, participants served as roaming advertisements for Habitat for Humanity. They were supported by the generosity of the communities through which they traveled, typically sleeping in churches and eating food provided by the congregations of those churches. They gave nightly presentations about Habitat, its mission, and their trip, and at several points along the way, they worked on local Habitat build sites. Thus, they spread awareness of Habitat's mission to hundreds of communities across the United States. The Habitat Bicycle Challenge was plagued by three significant and independent casualties, all involving Yale students. In 2005, a female rider died when she was struck by a car on a road in Carbondale, Illinois. Just a few weeks prior to the 2006 trip, a male participant died when he was hit by a truck while biking to rowing practice in New Haven, and in 2007, a male rider was hit by a car in Kansas and suffered traumatic brain injury resulting in permanent impairment. Amid continued safety concerns, Habitat for Humanity of Greater New Haven announced on September 24, 2007 that the Habitat Bicycle Challenge would not continue. The Habitat Bicycle Challenge is the subject of the 2004 documentary Hammer and Cycle.Hammer and Cycle on IMDB Bike and Build, a similar program, was founded in 2002 by a former HBC rider. Though not directly affiliated with Habitat for Humanity, it carries on the legacy of the Habitat Bicycle Challenge. ==Notes== ==External links== *Official HBC Website, including rider rosters *http://oregonbiketrail.blogspot.com/ Habitat Bicycle Challenge 2007 Riders' Blog Category:Yale University Category:Cycling events in the United States Category:Habitat for Humanity ","title":"Habitat Bicycle Challenge"},{"id":"3261682","text":"Gurkha regiment may refer to: * Brigade of Gurkhas, Nepalese soldiers who serve within the British Army * Gorkha regiments (India), various infantry regiments in the Indian Army, recruited primarily from Nepal * 1st Gorkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment) * 2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles) * 3rd Gorkha Rifles * 4th Gorkha Rifles * Royal Gurkha Rifles * Gurkha Category:Gurkhas ","title":"Gurkha regiment"},{"id":"3261684","text":"Malcolm Arnold \\"Mal\\" Duncan, currently known as Vox (also known as the Guardian, Hornblower, and the Herald), is a fictional character, existing in the DC Universe. Introduced in April 1970, he was one of DC's first African- American superheroes. ==Publication history== Mal Duncan made his first appearance in Teen Titans #26 and was created by Robert Kanigher and Nick Cardy. In that issue, the African-American Mal kissed the Caucasian Lilith Clay goodbye, in a scene considered to be the first interracial kiss in comic book history. When editorial director Carmine Infantino objected to the scene, thinking it too controversial, editor Dick Giordano kept the scene, but colored it in blue as a night scene, to draw less attention to the moment. Giordano recalls receiving many letters about the kiss, both hate mail (including one death threat) and many supportive letters approving of the kiss. ==Fictional character biography== ===Pre-Crisis=== Mal Duncan, Art by Chuck Patton and Romeo Tanghal Malcolm \\"Mal\\" DuncanHis surname \\"Duncan\\" is revealed in Teen Titans #44 (November 1976), and his formal first name \\"Malcolm\\" is revealed in Teen Titans #45 (December 1976). Prior to these issues, he is known simply as \\"Mal\\" saves the Teen Titans from a street gang called the Hell Hawks by beating their leader in a boxing match.Teen Titans #26 (March–April 1970) Recruited by the Teen Titans, Mal feels unworthy due to his lack of abilities, and stows away on a rocket flight, which nearly costs him his life.Teen Titans #27 (May–June 1970) After a time, Mal discovers a strength-enhancing exoskeleton and the costume of the Guardian. Using these, he becomes the second Guardian.Teen Titans #44 (November 1976) After assuming the Guardian mantle, Mal fights Azrael, the Angel of Death. Believing it to be a hallucination, Mal is surprised to awaken with the mystical Gabriel's Horn. Having defeated Azrael, Mal is permitted to live, provided he never loses another fight. The horn grants Mal unspecified powers, whenever the odds are against him in battle. Armed with the horn, Mal assumes the name Hornblower.Teen Titans #45 (December 1976) Mal soon returns to his Guardian identity, claiming that too many people knew who he was. ===Post-Crisis=== Following the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Mal's uncostumed adventures are unchanged. However, in post-Crisis canon, he never took the identity of Guardian, and the Gabriel's Horn is given a very different origin. While the other Titans are on a mission, Mal inadvertently releases an old villain, the Gargoyle (formerly Mister Twister), from Limbo. He recaptures the villain, but finds the plans for a high-tech horn that would create spatial warps. With the help of Karen, he builds the horn and takes the identity of Herald. However, the Gargoyle implanted a computer virus into the horn that weakens the boundaries between the mortal world and Limbo, so he and his master, the Antithesis, will eventually escape. When Mal discovers this, he destroys the horn. He and Karen retire from super heroics, and move to California.Secret Origins Annual #3 (1989) While it seemed first that the introduction of the Herald identity retconned away the Hornblower name, later issues of Dan Jurgens' Teen Titans run confirmed that Mal had used the name Hornblower as well. During the JLA/Titans event, Mal acquires a new Gabriel's Horn,JLA/Titans #1-3 (December 1998-February 1999) and later, he and Bumblebee join the short-lived Titans LA.Titans Secret Files #2 (October 2000) In the Titans Tomorrow storyline, the Mal of the alternate future becomes president of the Eastern United States. When Doctor Light captures Green Arrow, taking him as a hostage and demanding to see the Titans (a plot to take revenge on the team that had often humiliated him), Mal, Bumblebee, and about two dozen other former Titans are assembled to fight him.Teen Titans #22 & 23 (May & June 2005) He and Bumblebee then join a team of heroes gathered by Troia to embark on an ominous mission into deep space during Infinite Crisis.Teen Titans #29 (October 2005) The group eventually encounters a rift in the universe caused by Alexander Luthor, who is re-creating the multiverse and restructuring it to create the \\"perfect\\" universe—a plan that would lead to the deaths of billions of people, and the entire post-crisis DC Universe. The team of heroes in space is able to temporarily stop Luthor, but in the resulting chaos they are scattered; some are killed, while others go missing for varying lengths of time, including Mal and Karen. ===52=== Four weeks after disappearing in space, Mal is rescued from a Zeta Beam transport accident. His lungs and vocal cords were damaged after the Gabriel's Horn blew up in his face. Mal's body rejected the cybernetic grafting of parts from the Red Tornado until Steel used his Pseudocyte technology to permanently graft the parts into Mal's body.52 #4 & 5 (May 31 & June 7, 2006) ===One Year Later=== One whole year after the events in Infinite Crisis, Mal has joined the Doom Patrol alongside his wife Bumblebee.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #35 (June 2006) Now going by the codename Vox, Mal speaks with a synthesized voice box which can create unusually strong hypersonic blasts and open dimensional portals, wormholes, and vortexes similar to the Gabriel Horn. Later, in an issue of the newest Doom Patrol series, Mal and Karen are now divorced. Following the disbanding of the Doom Patrol, Bumblebee appears as one of the former Titans who arrives at Titans Tower to repel Superboy-Prime and the Legion of Doom. ===The New 52=== In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Mal is introduced as an award-winning film composer and the husband of Karen, who is pregnant with their daughter.Titans Hunt #1 He is later kidnapped by Mister Twister, who reveals that as a teenager, Mal was a member of the original Teen Titans under the name Herald. The Titans had allowed their memories of each other to be erased in order to defeat Twister, but he now seeks to use Mal's sonic abilities to complete a ritual that will allow a powerful demonic entity to enter the human world.Titans Hunt #5 When Karen (who has now gained superpowers of her own) and the former Titans arrive, they are able to defeat Mister Twister once and for all.Titans Hunt #8 ===DC Rebirth=== Following this incident, Mal reveals to Karen that he underwent a procedure to remove his superpowers so that the couple could live a normal life.Titans (vol. 3) 8 When Karen suits up as Bumblebee to help the Titans battle the Fearsome Five, Mal steals a suit of blue and gold tactical body armor (resembling his Pre-Crisis Guardian costume) from Nightwing's room in Titans Tower to back her up. However, by the time he reaches the battle, he finds that Psimon has psychically removed all of Bumblebee's memories of Mal and the baby.Titans (vol. 3) 10 Spurning Mal's attempts to reconnect, the amnesiac Bumblebee chooses to stay with the Titans.Titans (vol. 3) 12 Enraged by this turn of events, Mal returns to his vigilante roots and partners with his former teammate Gnarrk to hunt down H.I.V.E., believing they hold the key to restoring Karen's memory.Titans (vol. 3) 13-14 During one of these raids, Mal and Gnarrk are brainwashed and turned into avatars of the mysterious entity Mister Twister serves. The entity is ultimately revealed to be Troia, an evil version of Donna Troy from a possible future. Troia forces Mal and Gnarrk to battle the Titans, but the two heroes are freed from her control when Donna manages to vanquish her future counterpart. With Karen's memories restored, Mal helps the Titans take down Mister Twister and the Key.Titans (vol. 3) 15-18 After the Titans are forcibly disbanded by the Justice League, Karen finally returns home to Mal and the baby.Titans (vol. 3) 19 ==Powers and abilities== Formerly, his Gabriel Horn could open up multi-dimensional portals, and generate unusually strong hypersonic blasts. He now relies more on his artificial lungs and voice box to achieve the same destructive, deafening sonic/audio effects. He also has a background in kickboxing, and hand-to-hand combat, and is in exceptional physical condition. In the New 52 continuity, Mal possesses sonic and harmonic abilities that he projects by using his voice. ==In other media== ===Television=== * The Herald first appears in the Teen Titans episode \\"Calling All Titans\\", voiced by Khary Payton. Unlike in the comic books, Herald wears a mask. Blowing his horn allows him to open circular rifts, wormholes and portals, to other worlds, planets, realms or other places in his present dimension, even outer space itself. Herald is an honorary Titan, and fights off See-More and Warp. While doing so, his communicator is disabled. In \\"Titans Together\\", he teams up with Jericho, Pantha, Más, and Beast Boy in a rescue mission to save the remaining Titans. They were overpowered, but reinforcements arrived. The Herald used his horn to get rid of Punk Rocket and the dragon Malchior. He also saved the Titans by teleporting the Brain's fusion bomb into outer space. * Mal Duncan appears in the Young Justice episode \\"Targets\\", voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. He is portrayed as a student at the high school Conner and M'gann attend. He and Conner are shown to be at odds with each other, \\"facing him down\\" (as Marvin puts it) before class starts. He is again shown in \\"Secrets\\" at the school's Halloween dance where he has dressed up as \\"Superman, done right\\" (Superboy's costume from his original comic appearance). However, in this episode, probably through the course of time, he and Conner appear to be at peace with each other. In \\"Happy New Year\\", Mal is still with Karen who has now officially become Bumblebee and joined the team at some point within the five-year gap between seasons one and two. Mal Duncan has also joined the team and serves as their mission coordinator. According to Greg Weisman, he assumes a superhero identity sometime in Season 2. In the Season 2 episode \\"Cornered\\" when Despero locks down the Hall of Justice and disables most of the team, Mal dons the uniform of Guardian and engages the villain, distracting him long enough for Superboy, Miss Martian and Zatanna to come up with a plan to disable Despero. He later continues to use the Guardian identity for the rest of the second season and is a full team member until in season three. In it, Mal and Karen visit Conner, M'gann and Snapper Carr's household for Thanksgiving. He is also now bald and has a beard. He is seen again in \\"Unknown Factors\\" supporting Karen when she gives birth to their daughter, Rhea. * Mal Duncan is mentioned in The Flash episode \\"The Nuclear Man\\". Barry Allen states that he is playing at an underground jazz club in Central City that night. * Mal Duncan appears as a background student in DC Superhero Girls. ===Miscellaneous=== Herald was also featured in an issue of Teen Titans Go! wherein he helped Raven find Pantha, Kole, Gnarrk, and Beast Boy. While he isn't married to Bumblebee in the animated continuity, their relationship is alluded to in #39 where Larry The Titan shoots them with Cupid's Love Arrows. In Teen Titans #48, he helps send Killowat back to his dimension in the Multiverse. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * World of Black Heroes: Vox biography Category:DC Comics superheroes Category:Fictional characters who can manipulate sound Category:Fictional African-American people Category:Fictional musicians Category:Comics characters introduced in 1970 Category:Characters created by Robert Kanigher ","title":"Mal Duncan"},{"id":"3261686","text":"The Chilean Pharmaceutical Policy was an attempt in the 1960s and 1970s to introduce a rational national pharmaceuticals policy. Chile was perhaps the first country in the world to introduce the concept of a limited number of essential drugs. In 1965 the government of President Eduardo Frei took measures to rationalise drug supply and use and in 1967, a national formulary with a limited list of drugs came into being. In 1970, Salvador Allende was elected to power and rationalisation of the pharmaceutical supply system continued. The next step was to organise centralised bulk procurement. The first international tender for raw materials was called in 1971. However, the pharmaceutical industry struck back: in the three months following the call for tender, widely used drugs, including analgesics and antibiotics, disappeared from the market. The manufacturers had cut their production. They agreed to replenish the market within one week only if the international tenders were called off. In 1972, the government was forced to succumb and called off the tenders. In 1973, the government of Allende was toppled and the first essential drug programme hitherto known was dead. ==See also== *Pharmaceutical company *Public health *Presidential Republic Era (1924-1973) Category:Pharmaceuticals policy Pharmaceutical policy Pharmaceutical policy Pharmaceutical policy ","title":"Chilean pharmaceutical policy"},{"id":"3261692","text":"Halyards (and edges) on a gaff rigged sail right In sailing, the throat halyard (or throat for short) is a line that raises the end of a gaff nearer to the mast, as opposed to the peak halyard which raises the end further from the mast.

The road runs from U.S. Route 27 (US 27 or SR 25) in Hialeah to Interstate 595 (I-595 or SR 862) and SR 84 in Davie. The section in Miami-Dade County, through Hialeah and Miami Lakes, is known as Red Road (also known West Fourth Avenue in Hialeah's street grid and West 57th Avenue in the countywide grid). In Broward County, the road turns northwest and merges into Flamingo Road, until its terminus in Davie, though the road continues without designation into Sunrise. South of a gap due to Miami International Airport, Red Road is State Road 959. ==Route description== ===State Road 823=== State Road 823 begins at the northside of the Miami Canal at Okeechobee Road (US 27), being the northern segment of Red Road, running through the city of Hialeah as their West 4th Avenue, with intersections with State Road 934 and State Road 932. It has an interchange with State Road 924, and exits Hialeah at the intersection with State Road 916 (West 84th Street) and again becomes Northwest 57th Avenue at the southwest end of the Opa-locka Airport. SR 823 continues north dividing the incorporated town of Miami Lakes to the west from Opa-locka Airport and the city of Miami Gardens to the east until it crosses the Palmetto Expressway (SR 826) where it continues to run north through unincorporated Miami-Dade County, with an intersection with State Road 860 in that stretch. North of Honey Hill Drive, SR 823 becomes the dividing line between Miramar, Broward County and unincorporated Miami-Dade County, before fully entering Broward County and Miramar just south of the Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike (SR 821). Curving northwest starting at the intersection with Miramar Parkway, SR 823 merges onto Flamingo Road, first intersecting State Road 820 by CB Smith Park and Pembroke Lakes Mall, followed by others at State Road 848, and State Road 818 before reaching its northern terminus with Interstate 595 (SR 826) and State Road 84. ===County Road 823=== Flamingo Road continues north beyond I-595 / SR 84 without state designation, providing access to Sawgrass Mills, one of the largest enclosed shopping centers in the United States, and the BB&T; Center, home of the Florida Panthers National Hockey League team. This extension has the hidden designation of County Road 823. The northern terminus of Flamingo Road is at an intersection with Oakland Park Boulevard, itself an extension of SR 816, and the Sawgrass Expressway (SR 869), 3.69 miles (5.94 km) north of I-595. ==History== State Road 368 was defined by state law in 1937. This route ran along Red Road (present SR 823) from pre-1945 SR 26 (now US 27) in Hialeah north to Opa Locka Road (Northwest 138th Street, currently SR 916). There it turned west until County Road 80, where it turned back south to SR 26. The other section of present SR 823 was defined in 1939 as State Road 517, running along Flamingo Road from Pembroke Road north to a branch of pre-1945 SR 26 (now SR 84). In the 1945 renumbering, all but the southernmost mile of SR 517 became State Road 823 (giving it a southern terminus of SR 820). At some point, it was extended south to Snake Creek Canal and Northwest 202nd Street, just south of the Dade (now Miami-Dade) County boundary. The other piece, partly former SR 368, was designated State Road 819 (SR 819) in the 1945 renumbering. This ran from SR 25 (now US 27) north to Golden Glades Drive (Northwest 167th Street, which later became part SR 826 before construction of the Palmetto Expressway), using former SR 368 south of Northwest 138th Street. The rest of SR 368 was not assigned a number, but part of it is now SR 916. This was extended north to SR 860 (Northwest 183rd Street) at some point; SR 819 was redesignated State Road 955 (SR 955) in 1983 as part of a statewide reorganization of State Roads. Around 1992, the diagonal connection between Red Road and Flamingo Road was built, allowing SR 823 to extend south over that connection, first ending at SR 860, then taking over SR 955 in the mid 1990s. The former piece of SR 823 on Flamingo Road to the county line was kept as an unsigned State Road (to be designated State Road 9823). ===\\"The Most Dangerous Intersection in America\\"=== In 2001, State Farm Insurance ranked the intersection of Flamingo Road and Pines Boulevard in Pembroke Pines, \\"The Most Dangerous Intersection in America\\". Using data from over a two-year period, the company found that 357 vehicular accidents happened during their study at the intersection, which is where C. B. Smith Park, Pembroke Lakes Mall, a hospital, and two shopping centers are located. This prompted the city to make drastic changes to the intersection, which included lengthening the turning lanes and adding red light cameras. The number of accidents have since dropped significantly at the intersection. ===State Road 9823=== In the early 1980s, there was apparently a reconfiguration of SR 823 in the Miami-Lakes area, but sources from FDOT to Miami-Dade County Planning to various commercial road maps disagree (in fact, contemporaneous documents from FDOT disagree on whether such a realignment actually happened). The majority of the sources contend that by 1983, SR 823 was rerouted along Northwest 68th Avenue and Miami Gardens Drive (SR 860) before returning to Ludlam Road. After the shifting of SR 823 to Red Road, some sources indicated that FDOT was maintaining an \\"unsigned State Road 9823\\" that was part of an earlier configuration of SR 823 that had since been orphaned. One FDOT document indicated that SR 9823 was the stretch of Flamingo Road from the Red Road connector to a point under the Florida's Turnpike underpass; another FDOT document indicated it extended to the Miami-Dade/Broward County line or the original southern terminus near Snake Creek Canal. Yet other FDOT documents don't even indicate it ever existed. Miami-Dade County planning maps do not show any indication of the existence of SR 9823, except for one that indicated the segment from the Palmetto Expressway to Broward County via Ludlam Road (with a \\"side trip\\" along Northwest 68th Avenue and SR 860) was SR 9823\\\\. This is also indicated by a handful of commercially prepared road maps (although a 2004 commercially prepared road map indicates SR 9823—as \\"County Road 9823\\"—is strictly Ludlam Road north of SR 826). Yet other sources do not indicate the existence of such a \\"hidden\\" State Road at all. While there is a preponderance of evidence indicating SR 9823 having existed and taken the \\"Miami Lakes detour\\", this remains an open question. ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== 823 823 823 ","title":"Florida State Road 823"},{"id":"3261711","text":"Scouts de Argentina (Scouts of Argentina) is one of the national Scouting associations of Argentina. Scouting was officially founded in Argentina in 1912, shortly after the publication of \\"Scouting For Boys\\" in Spanish, which was granted a National Charter in 1917, and was among the charter members of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1922. Scouts de Argentina has 75,000 members as of 2020. Scouts of Argentina is a non-profit aimed at non- formal education, one of the scouts associations in Argentina with national scope and multi-faith guidance, formed by the merger of the USCA (Argentine Catholic Scouts Union) and the Association of Scouts of Argentina. It was founded by Perito Francisco Moreno with the name \\"Boy Scouts Association Argentinos\\" and subsequently known as the \\"National Association of Boy Scouts Argentinos\\", \\"Boy Scouts Argentinos\\", then declared \\"National Institution of Argentine Scouting\\" by presidential decree Dr. Hipólito Yrigoyen in 1917. It is also known as \\"Argentine Scouting National Institute\\"; all these indistinct names refer to the same organization. USCA and INSA were dissolved on December 1, 1996 to join Scouts of Argentina, Civil Association. ==History== The emblem incorporates elements of the Coat of arms of Argentina A Scout patrol of Anglo-Argentine students greeted Baden-Powell on his way to visit Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile in 1908. In the late 1930s, a Catholic Scout Union (USCA) was created under the sponsorship of the Roman Catholic Church and operated separately until December 2, 1996, when INSA and USCA merged to form the Scouts of Argentina. In the mid-1990s there were two major Scout associations in Argentina: * Argentina Scout Association (INSA, also known as ASA), recognized by the World Organization of the Scout Movement * Argentine Catholic Scouts Union (USCA), an entity sponsored by the Catholic Church In 1980, there were talks to agree on a federation of the two organizations, but they succumbed to differences between the leaders of the associations, and restarted further talks in 1991 under the auspices of the Interamerican Scout Region (World Organization of the Scout Movement). In 1995, as a result of these discussions, they created a Constitution Committee which aimed to draft a merger of both associations to agree on a common educational project and establish convergence in education and land. As one of the partnerships was an organization of the Catholic Church, the Argentine Episcopal Conference in early 1996 tried to make the adoption of Terms of Reference for the unification, although each Bishop reserves the right to form a private association in their jurisdiction if they consider that it would weaken the identity of Catholic Scouts in its two key aspects, \\"Faithfulness to the Scout Movement and fidelity to the Catholic doctrine. As part of these agreements, the USCA set aside a private association of the Catholic Church through the establishment of a \\"Scout Catholic Pastoral Committee\\" (COPASCA). The COPASCA assumed a supra-institution in the new partnership that arises from the unit. On December 1, 1996, the Argentine Catholic Scouts Union (USCA) and the Association of Scouts of Argentina (ASA) merged, and a joint National Assembly was held in the town of Ezeiza on the grounds of the Textile Workers Union (SETI) next to the Matanza River. As a result of the merger, the organization became Scouts of Argentina, the name of the new unified association. In December 2016, the Catholic Archdiocese of La Plata announced that it will no longer sponsor Scouts of Argentina, because the organization has strayed from Christian values. == Characterization == It is an educational organization composed of girls, children, youth and adults. ==Program== The definition of Youth Program groups in Scouts of Argentina takes place in different stages. * Transition: Since the merger of USCA and INSA to 2000 the Scout Groups were phased out the program of the association from which they came. * Educational Renewal Stage: named the period beginning in April 2000 when the Executive Director approved the publication of 'Notes for the Scout Game' I and II and 'Notes for the leader of the Walkers and Rover Scout Branches'. For Cub Scout and Scouts Branches adopting publications by Interamerican Scout Region (World Organization of the Scout Movement). * Stage Review: The year 2002 a national consultation began called the Program Conference. As a result of this consultation, they detected a number of implementation problems that required changes to the program. As the Director of the Youth Program, Rodrigo González Cao started Indaba, which ended in 2008, with modifications to the following four branches: ===Scout branches=== * Manada - ages 7 to 11 On this branch kids participate of activities and learn the basics skills to prepare them to join the Unidad. The environment is thematically oriented after Rudyard Kipling's \\"The Jungle Book\\". The troop leaders are named after characters of the book like Bagheera, Baloo, Akela, Kaa, Kotick, Raksha and Rikki-Tikki- Tavi. Manada literally means pack, for pack of wolves. The children are called \\"Lobatos y Lobeznas\\", wolf cubs, representing the wolves from the book. When going on camping trips the Manada usually sleeps in one big tent as a group. * Unidad - ages 11 to 14 The Unidad is the main phase of the scouting experience. Kids are divided into small groups of about 4-7 people that are named after native animals of Argentina. Girls and boys are separated when forming these small groups as they will later sleep together as groups in one tent during the camping trips. The scouts will learn most of their skills in this phase. Activities are mostly organized in a competitive way between the different small groups called \\"Patrullas\\", patrols. The camping trips usually include a long-term competition that lasts the whole trip. Each patrol has a guide and sub-guide that take decisions as well as designated roles to be occupied by the members while on camping trips or during meetings. The guides and sub-guides themselves for their own patrol for special events where they meet guide-patrols from other scout groups. * Caminantes - ages 14 to 17 Caminantes is the phase were the scouts leave the competing units to work as one group and develop more as individuals. On this phase the meetings are no longer heavily organized by the troop leaders and the scouts have more freedom to do as they please. Their camping trips last a bit longer than those in the Unidad and are characterized by them being trecking trips where the scouts carry their own gear while walking long stretches from place to place. * Rovers - ages 17 to 21 ===Symbolism and progression=== Also, any Scout Groups could participate in the Sea Scouts option. Books written by Robert Baden- Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell in which underpin the Youth Programme and Scout method are: * Cub Scout: The Wolf Cub's Handbook * Scouts: Scouting for Boys * Rovers: Rovering to Success And the general guidelines for tasks of the adult leaders were presented in Aids to the Scoutmastership The Scout Motto is Siempre Listo (Always Prepared). The Scout emblem incorporates the color scheme of the flag of Argentina. ==Scout Oath== The Committee on Constitutions of the World Scout Movement, adopted in 1999, the words of the Scout Promise to Argentina: I, ... (name), promise on my honor and with the grace of God to do all that I can do to fulfill my debts to God, my country, to others and against myself, to always help my fellow men and to live the Scout Law. The Confessional Religious Commissions, in accordance with their respective terms of reference or preliminary agreements, \\"may include additional terms in the text of the Pledge and determine a badge that identifies them to be used on the uniform by members who profess their faith, in accordance with any international educational agencies Scouts of Argentina and respecting the methodological guidelines that are handed down. * Catholics: I (...), my honor and with the grace of God I promise to do everything in my power to fulfill my duty to God, the Church, the country, with others and myself, helping others and living Scout Law * Evangelical Christians: I (...), my honor and with the grace of God I promise to do everything in my power to fulfill my duty to God, the Church, the country, with others and myself, helping others and live the Scout Law * Buddhists: I (...), and taking refuge in the triple gem by my honor I promise to do everything in my power to fulfill my duties to my Buddhist faith, the Fatherland, with others and myself, helping others and living Scout Law * Latter Day Saint movement (Mormons), I (full name) on my honor I promise to do everything in my power to fulfill my duties to God, country, to others and myself, helping others and living Scout Law * Jews (...), on my honor I promise to do everything in my power to fulfill my duties to Gd, the Torah, the country, with others and myself, helping others and living the Scout Law ==Scout Law== Right The text of the Scout Law Scout Argentina was adapted from the original formulation of Robert Baden-Powell to the current youth language. As the new wording contains the expression of the three scout principles, incorporating the duties to the profession of religious faith was not present in the proposed Act by B-P. The final text was drafted in the National Conference of Commissioners held in Puerto Pibes, City of Buenos Aires in July 1998, and ratified by the National Assembly In October of that year. Then the Committee on Constitutions of the World Scouting Organization approved it in 1999 . # A Scout loves God and lives his/her faith fully. # A Scout is loyal and worthy of all trust. # A Scout is generous, courteous, and shows solidarity. # A Scout is respectful and the brother/sister of everyone. # A Scout defends and values the family. # A Scout loves and defends life and nature. # A Scout knows how to obey; he/she chooses and acts with responsibility. # A Scout is optimistic even through difficult times. # A Scout is economic, hard-working, and respectful of others' goods and properties. # A Scout is pure and leads a healthy life. == National Structure == * National Assembly: Define policies * Directive Board: Defining lines of action * Executive Committee: Perform action lines * Zone: province representation * District: territorial division structure, apply policies and actions and support of the Scout Groups * Scout Group: Application scenario of the Scout Method and fundamental part of the partnership structure. == Ephemerides == In Argentina it is customary to celebrate the Scout Good Turn Day every year on September 5 . In some cases, the scouts collect food for the homeless. But it has recently been extended to assemble in the city's square with a fleur de lis and disposable plastic bottle caps. The recyclable material is then donated to children's hospitals to take care of children with complex health problems. One of the major benefitting organizations is the Juan Pedro Garrahan National Pediatric Hospital Foundation. == Community Action == Scouts of Argentina has signed national, provincial and municipal various initiatives to promote peace education and prevent youth addictions. Among them are: * Play for Peace Program: awarded by the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, declared parliamentary interest by the Argentine Chamber of Deputies, by the Municipality of Rosario, Santa Fe and by the Senate of the Santa Fe Province. * Addiction prevention by the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. ==See also== * Scouting and Guiding in Argentina ==References== ==External links== * Official Homepage Category:World Organization of the Scout Movement member organizations Category:Scouting and Guiding in Argentina Category:Youth organizations established in 1912 Category:1912 establishments in Argentina ","title":"Scouts de Argentina"},{"id":"3261715","text":"John Horton Conway (1937–2020) was an English mathematician at Princeton University, known for Conway's Game of Life.

Megavitamin therapy is typically used in alternative medicine by practitioners who call their approach orthomolecular medicine. Vitamins are useful in preventing and treating illnesses specifically associated with dietary vitamin shortfalls, but the conclusions of some medical research are that the claims of disease treatment by advocates of megavitamin therapy are unsubstantiated by the available evidence. This seems to point to doses of any vitamin greatly in excess of nutritional requirements resulting either in toxicity (vitamins A and D) or in the excess simply being metabolised; thus the evidence in favour of vitamin supplementation supports only doses in the normal range.Novella, S: Medical Myths, Lies, and Half- Truths: What We Think We Know May Be Hurting Us, The Great Courses Critics have described some aspects of orthomolecular medicine as food faddism or even quackery. A short summary is in the journal's preface. Research on nutrient supplementation in general suggests that some nutritional supplements might be beneficial, and that others might be harmful; several specific nutritional therapies are associated with an increased likelihood of the condition they are meant to prevent. == Multivitamin vs megavitamin == Megavitamin therapy must be distinguished from the usual \\"vitamin supplementation\\" approach of traditional multivitamin pills. Megavitamin doses are far higher than the levels of vitamins ordinarily available through western diets. A study of 161,000 individuals (post-menopausal women) provided, in the words of the authors, \\"convincing evidence that multivitamin use has little or no influence on the risk of common cancers, cardiovascular disease, or total mortality in postmenopausal women\\". ==History== In the 1930s and 1940s, some scientific and clinical evidence suggested that there might be beneficial uses of vitamins C, E, and niacin in large doses. Beginning in the 1930s in Canada, a megadose vitamin E therapy for cardiovascular and circulatory complaints was developed, named the \\"Shute protocol\\". Tentative experiments in the 1930s with larger doses of vitamin C led to Frederick Klenner's development of megadose intravenous vitamin C treatments for polio and other viruses in the 1940s. William Kaufman published articles in the 1940s that detailed his treatment of arthritis with frequent, high doses of niacinamide. Rudolf Altschul and Abram Hoffer applied large doses of the immediate release form of niacin (Vitamin B3) to treat hypercholesterolemia. In a 1956 publication entitled Biochemical Individuality, Roger J. Williams introduced concepts for individualized megavitamins and nutrients. Megavitamin therapies were also publicly advocated by Linus Pauling in the late 1960s. ==Usage as therapy== Although megavitamin therapies still largely remain outside of the structure of evidence-based medicine, they are increasingly used by patients, with or without the approval of their treating physicians, often after recommendations by practitioners of orthomolecular and naturopathic medicine. The proposed efficacy of various megavitamin therapies to reduce cancer risk has been contradicted by results of one clinical trial. ===Vitamin C=== The US Recommended Dietary Allowance for vitamin C for adult women is 76 mg/day and for adult men 90 mg/day. Although Linus Pauling was known for highly respectable research in chemistry and biochemistry, he was also known for promoting the consumption of vitamin C in large doses. Although he claimed and stood firm in his claim that consuming over 1,000 mg is helpful for one’s immune system when fighting a head cold, the results of empirical research do not align with this view. A meta-analysis concluded that supplementary vitamin C significantly lowered serum uric acid, considered a risk factor for gout. One population study reported an inverse correlation between dietary vitamin C and risk of gout. A review of clinical trials in the treatment of colds with small and large doses of Vitamin C has established that there is no evidence that it decreases the incidence of common colds. After 33 years of research, it is still not established whether vitamin C can be used as a treatment for cancer. ===Vitamin E=== The US Recommended Dietary Allowance for vitamin E for adult women and men is 15 mg/day. The US Food and Nutrition Board set a Tolerable upper intake level (UL) at 1,000 mg (1,500 IU) per day derived from animal models that demonstrated bleeding at high doses. In the US, the popularity for vitamin E as a dietary supplement-popular doses 400, 800 and 1000 IU/day-peaked around 2000. Declines in usage were attributed to publications of studies that showed either no benefits or negative consequences from vitamin E supplements. One meta-analysis showed no association between vitamin E supplementation and cardiovascular events (nonfatal stroke or myocardial infarction) or cardiovascular mortality. Another meta-analysis concluded that high-dosage vitamin E increased all-cause mortality. ===Niacin=== The US Recommended Dietary Allowance for niacin for adult women is 14 mg/day and for adult men 16 mg/day. Niacin is available as a prescription product, either immediate release (500 mg tablets; prescribed up to 3,000 mg/day) or extended release (500 and 1,000 mg tablets; prescribed up to 2,000 mg/day). In the US, niacin is also available as a dietary supplement at 500 to 1,000 mg/tablet. Niacin has sometimes been used in combination with other lipid-lowering medications.Niacin tablet label Updated March 14, 2013. Page accessed Feb 11, 2016 Systematic reviews found no effect of niacin on cardiovascular disease or death, in spite of raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Reported side effects include an increased risk of diabetes. ==See also== Related topics * Codex Alimentarius * Essential nutrient * Health freedom movement * Life extension * List of ineffective cancer treatments Vitamin topics * Multivitamin * Naturopathic medicine * Orthomolecular medicine * Hypervitaminosis (toxic vitamin intake) ** Hypervitaminosis A ** Hypervitaminosis D ** Vitamin B3 § Toxicity ** Megavitamin-B6 syndrome ==References== ==External links== * Orthomolecular Therapy at Quackwatch Category:Orthomolecular medicine Category:Vitamins Category:Medical treatments Category:Therapy ","title":"Megavitamin therapy"},{"id":"3261723","text":"Start of the text in the Troyes manuscript of ca. 600 (see below); the first three lines are also in coloured ink, which has run or faded. :For the general phrase concerning emotional and spiritual support, see Pastoral care. Liber Regulae Pastoralis or Regula Pastoralis (The Book of the Pastoral Rule, commonly known in English as Pastoral Care, a translation of the alternative Latin title Cura Pastoralis) is a treatise on the responsibilities of the clergy written by Pope Gregory I around the year 590, shortly after his papal inauguration. It became one of the most influential works on the topic ever written. The title was that used by Gregory when sending a copy to his friend Leander of Seville. The text was addressed to John, the bishop of Ravenna, as a response to a query from him. Gregory later revised the text somewhat. ==Description== The personal, intellectual and moral standards Gregory enjoined did not at all points closely reflect 6th century realities: for example, one letter from the Bishop of Cartagena (Book II, letter 54 in Gregory's collected correspondence) praises the book, but expresses a reserve that it might prove beyond ordinary capacities. The influence of the book, however, was vast. After reading the Regulae, the Byzantine Emperor Maurice directed that it be translated and distributed to every bishop within the empire (Demacopoulos). Indeed, among the works of all the Latin authors in the patristic period, Gregory's alone were translated into Greek during his own lifetime. In the West, the book also retained its significance and broad dissemination. That the book had been taken to England by Augustine of Canterbury-- who was sent to the Kingdom of Kent by Gregory in 597-- was noted in the preface to it written by Alfred the Great, who in the late 9th century translated it into Old English as part of a project to improve education in Anglo-Saxon England. In addition to details of his translation methodology, the extensive preface describes the rationale and intentions behind the project: even hundreds of years after it was written, the work was still seen as the most essential guide for pastors, and Alfred wished every bishop in his kingdom to have a copy for the benefit of the less-educated clergy. Alfred the Great's translation is kept at the Bodleian Library, Oxford, and is the oldest known book written in English. In May 2011, it was inscribed in UNESCO's UK Memory of the World Register.\\"2011 UK Memory of the World Register \\", United Kingdom National Commission for UNESCO, 2011.

A page from a contemporary copy of Alfred the Great's translation of Pastoral Care into Anglo-Saxon. This copy was sent to the bishop of Worcester. Beyond England, Gregory's Regulae was recommended to Charlemagne's bishops at a series of councils held in 813, and a letter of Hincmar, Archbishop of Rheims 845-882, notes that a copy of it, together with the Book of Canons, was given into the hands of bishops before the altar at their consecration (Schaff). Among the numerous manuscripts of these widely read Regulae, perhaps the oldest is Troyes, Bibliothèque Municipale, MS 504;Troyes MS 504. See Christopher De Hamel, A History of Illuminated Manuscripts. (Boston: David R. Godine) 1986. it is an early seventh-century manuscript in an uncial script without divisions between words, probably originating in Rome. There are about twenty-five long lines per page.

Donegan began playing guitar as a teenager and eventually formed a band called Vandal, which was a 1980s-style glam metal band.http://www.noisecreep.com/2010/01/01/top-10-musicians-with-hair-metal- pasts/ He also played with some of the members of Vandal in another band that was called Loudmouth. Donegan was added to the guitar show \\"Chop Shop's\\" list of \\"Top 100 Most Complete Guitar Players of All Time\\" at number 76. Donegan is currently pursuing a side project band, Fight or Flight in collaboration with Disturbed band member Mike Wengren. == History and personal life == Donegan had very long hair during the early days of Brawl and Disturbed. According to Disturbed's DVD titled M.O.L., Donegan got a job with his father doing construction work. He was required to cut his hair for it, but instead opted to wear a wig to fool his dad and keep his long hair. It worked, and his dad eventually let him keep his long hair. == Technique and style == Donegan is a self-taught guitarist. He uses one handed and two handed tapping in many of his solos, with pull-offs, legatos and hammer-ons, sometimes using the \\"flick off\\" technique, as used in the solo for the song \\"Indestructible\\", and in others as well. His heavy riffs and sweep picking are seen in many music videos. He also combines arpeggios with finger tapping and many other techniques. He is known for shredding in some songs and uses finger vibrato on occasion. He uses the whammy bar in many songs to give it a certain sound effect. In the video \\"The Making of Indestructible\\", Donegan mentions that he prefers \\"tasteful\\" solos, as opposed to shredding solos that rely primarily on speed. Disturbed's frontman David Draiman mentions \\"he [Donegan] can rip with the best of them\\". David also mentions that \\"He's [Donegan], in my opinion, you know, among the best in existence, and he doesn't give himself enough credit\\". In the 80s, he was in a glam metal band known as Vandal, where many of his solos were shred guitar solos, but he would incorporate other techniques, which many consider his own style of playing. ==Equipment== While playing with Loudmouth, Dan played an Ibanez Iceman amplified through a Peavey Ultra 120 head with Peavey 4x12 cabinets. Early on with his career with Disturbed, Donegan played Gibson Les Paul Standards and SGs. In some early photos with Brawl, he can also be seen with a Gibson Explorer. Then, he switched to play a few Paul Reed Smith models, the Tremonti Model and a PRS Singlecut. In 2005, Washburn Guitars built Donegan his own signature model called the Maya, named after his daughter. For 2010, Dan built a signature guitar with Schecter guitars, that is based on the ultra classic model (his being the ultra DD). Donegan is a fan of GHS Boomer guitar strings and uses the 12-52 gauge set. He also uses Seymour Duncan pickups in his guitars. He is currently signed to Schecter Guitars and uses custom leather guitar straps made by Orion Guitar Gear. In 2016, Dan and Orion Guitar Gear teamed up to sell a limited quantity of his custom straps to Disturbed fans. ===Guitars=== The Schecter Ultra Dan Donegan signature model * Current: * Schecter Ultra Dan Donegan signature model * Schecter Solo-6 2010 limited edition (used in the studio for Asylum) * Past: * Washburn Maya DD81 signature model (Indestructible) * Washburn Maya signature model (Ten Thousand Fists) * PRS Singlecut (Believe) * PRS Mark Tremonti (Believe) * Gibson Les Paul Standards (The Sickness) * Gibson SGs (The Sickness) * Gibson Explorer (used in the early days with Brawl) * Ibanez Iceman (used in the early days of Disturbed) ===Amplifiers=== *Randall RM4 preamp with 1 \\"Clean\\" and 3 \\"1086\\" modules into a RT2/50 Power Amp.

The road is notable as it is only 1 km long but having played host to all five broadcasting outlets in Hong Kong at one point in the 1970s, and the hill on which the road is located was known in Chinese as Ng Toi Shan (五台山, lit. five- station hill) during that time. The five broadcasters were: *Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK), whose headquarters (Broadcasting House) was inaugurated in 1969 at 30 Broadcast Drive *Commercial Radio Hong Kong (CRHK) *Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) *Rediffusion Television (RTV), later renamed Asia Television (ATV); and *Commercial Television The area became known as Four- station Hill () in 1978 following Commercial Television's collapse. Its studio building was acquired by RTHK for its television unit, and was reopened as Television House in 1986. TVB moved its operations to the Clear Water Bay TV City in 1988, and ATV moved to Tai Po in 2007, leaving RTHK and CRHK the only remaining broadcasters on the road. RTHK has announced plans to move its operations to Tseung Kwan O within the next few years. The reason for the departure of broadcast stations is partly due to the rising value of the land occupied and stations cashing in the rise in value. The area is also a well known high end (though gradually aging) residential neighborhood, and is home to those mainly from professional and upper middle class backgrounds. ==TVB Headquarters== TVB first headquarters and studios were located on Broadcast Drive in Kowloon Tong and were neighbours with fellow broadcasters RTHK and ATV. The six storey office tower and studios were located along the hills along Broadcast Drive. By the late 1980s, TVB had out-grown the facility at Broadcast Drive, and built a new studio complex, named T.V. City, at 220 Clear Water Bay Road in November 1988. From the late 1970s to 1987, TVB also used the office of the defunct Commercial TV for additional studio space. The old headquarters were demolished to make way for residential flats. The old Commercial Television Building is now RTHK Television House.

Grant and J. Craig Barker (eds.), \\"Concession, concessionary contract\\", in Encyclopaedic Dictionary of International Law, 3rd ed. (Oxford University Press, 2009). Accessed 23 February 2019. The definition is that of Peter Fischer, Die Internationale Konzession. International concessions are not defined in international law and do not generally fall under it. Rather, they are governed by the municipal law of the conceding state. There may, however, be a law of succession for such concessions, whereby the concession is continued even when the conceding state ceases to exist. In international law, a lease is \\"an arrangement whereby territory is leased or pledged by the owner-State to another State. In such cases, sovereignty is, for the term of the lease, transferred to the lessee State.\\"John P. Grant and J. Craig Barker (eds.), \\"Lease, international\\", in Encyclopaedic Dictionary of International Law, 3rd ed. (Oxford University Press, 2009). Accessed 23 February 2019. The term \\"international lease\\" is sometimes also used to describe any leasing of property by one state to another or to a foreign national, but the normal leasing of property, as in diplomatic premises, is governed by municipal, not international, law. Sometimes the term \\"quasi-international lease\\" is used for leases between states when less than full sovereignty over a territory is involved. A true international lease, or \\"political\\" lease, involves the transfer of sovereignty for a specified period of time.

The park, known as the Canadian National Vimy Memorial, contains an impressive monument to the fallen, a museum and extensive recreations of the wartime trench system, preserved tunnels and cemeteries. ==Chinese concessions== Between 1882 and 1884, the Qing Empire obtained concessions in Korea at Incheon, Busan and Wonsan. The concessions were occupied by Japan in 1894 after the outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War. After China's defeat in that war, Korea (now with Japanese support) declared the unequal treaties with Qing China to be void, and unilaterally withdrew the extraterritoriality and other powers granted to China in respect of the concessions. The concessions were formally abolished in 1898. ==French concessions== *The French concession in Shanghai was established on 6 April 1849 (it had been a Treaty Port since 17 November 1843).

The licences were awarded on August 10, with Rediffusion Television receiving licences for two television stations (one broadcasting in Cantonese and the other in English), while Commercial Television only received one licence for a station broadcasting in Cantonese. The station launched at 6:00 pm on September 7, 1975. Its logo was a hexagon formed from six angled lines, representing the Six Arts () in Confucian philosophy, as well as the six major stakeholders. At the time, the station was reportedly mocked for using the Six Arts as the inspiration for its logo, as 御書數 (Charioteering, Calligraphy and Mathematics) in Cantonese sounds similar to the phrase 預輸數 (predicted/prepared for defeat).TVB programme \\"That Was Then\\", 2007 One of the station's licensing conditions was to air two hours of educational programming every week night, with no commercial interruptions.

ViuTV was issued a television license in 2015, and started a digital-only terrestrial television operation starting on April 2, 2016, using terrestrial television frequencies formerly used by ATV. A third television license was issued in 2016 to Fantastic Television, but the station was not given over-the-air frequencies to broadcast its content. Much blame flew around about the reasons for the failure. The Government was blamed for restrictive conditions of the licence; the management was blamed for bad programme scheduling and failing to control escalating costs; shareholders were blamed for having the short-term mentality of property developers. However, the Government blamed the collapse on the unwillingness of the shareholders to inject more capital, after it had spent its entire HK$20 million within one year.

It was established in 1905 to preserve Minneopa Falls, a large waterfall for southern Minnesota, and was expanded in the 1960s to include the lower reaches of Minneopa Creek and a large tract of prairie. Minneopa is Minnesota's third oldest state park, after Itasca and Interstate. Two park resources are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the 1862 Seppman Mill and a district of seven Rustic Style structures built by the Works Progress Administration in the late 1930s. The park is located almost entirely on the south side of the Minnesota River, west of Mankato. In 2015 the state reintroduced American bison to the park in a fenced enclosure, through which visitors can drive in their vehicles. ==Geography== Minneopa State Park is divided into two distinct sections by a corridor of roads, railroads, and private property. The original section contains the falls and Rustic Style structures. The much larger northern section, added in 1969, stretches along the Minnesota River and includes the campground and Seppmann Mill. Although the sections are contiguous, the only way to travel from one to the other is via a county road. Minneopa Creek drains a small watershed in Blue Earth County and a small part of eastern Brown County. Most of its flow through farmland before entering the park. upstream from its mouth, Minneopa Creek flows over two waterfalls. The creek cascades about 6 or 7 feet (2 m) over the upper falls and flows before dropping over the lower falls. The name is a shortening of Minneinneopa, which is translated from the Dakota language as \\"water falling twice.\\" Other translations have been given as \\"water of two falls\\" and \\"water of the dancing elk.\\" Although Minneopa Falls is often referred to as the highest waterfall in southern Minnesota, Minnemishinona Falls in a nearby Nicollet County park is slightly higher at , but is not as scenic or well-known. Lower Minneopa Falls can be called the region's largest, as it is wide, while Minnemishinona spans only . The region of the park has a continental climate of cold winters and hot summers. Temperatures are slightly milder along Minneopa Creek than in the prairie section due to the heavy woods. ==Natural history== ===Geology=== A glacial erratic in the park's prairie section Minneopa State Park is underlain by flat layers of dolomite and sandstone. Evidence from well-drilling indicates that beneath these sedimentary rocks is a steeply tilted formation of granite that slopes down to the east deep under Mankato. Atop everything is a thick blanket of till deposited by glaciers. At the end of the last glacial period, the continental glaciers were melting to the north. Glacial River Warren carried torrents of meltwater across Minnesota, eroding a wide valley. As the water level diminished in stages over time, fluvial terraces were left like steps on the sides of the valley. The glacial runoff ceased around 9,400 years ago, leaving a channel soon occupied by the vastly smaller Minnesota River. The park's flat prairie area is a terrace of the ancient river. The Dakota name is Tinta inya ota, meaning \\"prairie with many rocks\\", because it is studded with numerous glacial erratics. These boulders were carried far from their northern sources by ice over 15,000 years ago. The soil is quite thin over limestone bedrock. Tributaries flowing into the Minnesota River had to drop down into the deep glacial valley, creating numerous waterfalls. The waterfall on Minneopa Creek was likely once at the creek's mouth on the river. Over the millennia, downcutting of the creek has carved a gorge through the soft Jordan Sandstone, causing the waterfall to \\"migrate\\" upstream. The double waterfall in Minneopa is the result of there being three layers of differing hardness in the sandstone. The upper and lower layers are softer than the middle, which creates a short stretch of erosion-resistant creekbed between two waterfalls.Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Minneopa State Park interpretive signage. The gorge is littered with blocks of the middle sandstone that broke off as the supporting layer below wore away. Weathering from the constant spray of the falls helps keep the gorge walls nearly vertical. ===Flora=== The pre-settlement vegetation was tallgrass prairie, broken by a swath of Big Woods flanking Minneopa Creek, with oak savanna at the east end, and bottomland hardwood forest along the Minnesota River floodplain. Today, these plant communities are largely intact, as much of the future park was unsuitable for agriculture, being too rocky, steep, or wet. The prairie is the most deteriorated, as much of it was intensively used as livestock pasture. Its are dominated by junegrass, with a mix of other grasses, forbs, and small eastern red cedars. Larger red cedars ring the prairie. Southeast of the prairie are of old fields exhibiting ecological succession. Their vegetation includes bluegrass, bromegrass, Russian thistle, alfalfa, and seedlings of eastern cottonwood and willow. Controlled burning is being used to improve the quality of the prairie. A parcel is further along in its conversion from cultivation, with a very dense stand of young ash, basswood, elm, and boxelder. The valley sides of both the river and the creek support a northern hardwood forest of altogether. The key species are sugar maple, basswood, elm, and northern red oak, with some hackberry and ironwood. The basswoods and maples are becoming more dominant; Dutch elm disease claimed many elms, and the oaks are not replacing themselves as they mature and die due to their low shade tolerance. There is a stand of yellow birch at the extreme southwestern limit of this range. The bottomland forest comprises of cottonwood, silver maple, and elm. Saplings of those three species plus ash and basswood fill in the understory. The campground and nearby picnic area are within of oak savanna. Mature bur oaks dominate, with scattered birch, elm, hawthorn, and red cedar. A further of parkland are characterized as open woods, with just bur oaks and some elms. Just north of the falls parking lot is an old orchard of black walnut. The spot was poorly chosen, and the trees are stunted for their age. The park has very little in the way of wetlands. Near the river there is a area of standing water with cattails, bulrushes, and arrowhead. along the creek are classified as wet meadow, with reed canary grass, bluejoint, sedges, and cut-grass. ===Fauna=== A variety of wildlife is attracted to Minneopa State Park's diverse habitats. White-tailed deer are common, while coyotes are often heard if not seen. Beavers live along the Minnesota River. 213 species of birds have been recorded in the park. These include bald eagles, red-tailed hawks, eastern bluebirds, eastern and western meadowlarks, bobolinks, belted kingfishers, northern flickers, pileated woodpeckers, wild turkeys, and common pheasants. Few fish are found in upper Minneopa Creek due to warm water and agricultural pollutants, but the diverse habitats below the falls and closer to the Minnesota River support an unexpected variety of fish species. Bison were reintroduced to the park in September 2015, as part of a joint project to increase the state's population of genetically pure bison that was previously confined to Blue Mounds State Park and the Minnesota Zoo. Minneopa was selected because it had an existing prairie, suitable existing infrastructure, a large potential audience of nearby residents, and nearby academic institutions that could benefit from research opportunities. Eleven females comprised the initial release, and the herd grew to 30 in 2019. The bulls will be rotated out for genetic diversity. The maximum capacity of the site is about 40 individuals. They roam a fenced enclosure. Visitors drive through the habitat on a road that has cattle guards at either end, or view the bison from locations outside the fence. ==Cultural history== ===Early history=== The area of Minneopa State Park has been inhabited for thousands of years. Eight sites with stone artifacts have been recorded in the park, along with a group of burial mounds near the northwest corner of the property. The first Europeans in the area, led by Pierre-Charles Le Sueur, arrived in 1700 to mine a distinctive clay deposit from which the Blue Earth River gets its name, mistakenly thinking it contained copper. From their base at Fort L'Huillier, they are thought to have journeyed the to the future park, visiting Minneopa Falls and hunting bison on the prairie beside the Minnesota River. The Treaty of Traverse des Sioux opened up the region to white settlers, and a handful of individuals and families built homes along Minneopa Creek starting in 1853. The first of them, Isaac Lyons, used the creek to power a sawmill. The towns of South Bend and Mankato were founded a short distance to the east, on either side of the Blue Earth River. At this time, a band of Dakota led by Sintomniduta kept their village near the mouth of Minneopa Creek. They were known as \\"Six\\" for their habit of grouping tipis in multiples of six. In the fall of 1853 Sintomniduta's sister was accused by her husband of infidelity, possibly as a ruse to divorce her and marry a younger woman. She and the chief hid for a few days in a cave at the foot of lower Minneopa Falls, until his warriors returned from a hunt and were able to attack her husband's band. The sounds of this battle, and later a fight on June 9, 1860 between the Dakota and a party of Ojibwe warriors, terrified the settlers into thinking they were about to be attacked. However, the Dakota maintained good relations with the whites, and the children of both groups often played together. Sintomniduta's Cave, as it became known, collapsed around 1900. ===Growing popularity=== \\"Minneopa Falls, Minnesota\\" (1862) by Robert S. Duncanson The scenic falls and their shady glen became a popular destination, especially on hot summer days. Depictions of the falls by artists and photographers spread their fame across southern Minnesota. The first business to cater to visitors was the Minneinneopa Park Hotel, opening in 1858 on well-landscaped grounds east of the falls. Pioneering black artist Robert S. Duncanson toured Minnesota in September 1862 and made sketches of Minneopa Falls, upon which he based a painting later that year. 1862 also saw local stonemason Louis Seppmann begin construction on his stone windmill, on a hill a mile to the northwest. However the American Civil War and the Dakota War of 1862 greatly depressed travel for several years. The Minneinneopa Park Hotel closed in 1870 and served as a country home and then a dairy farm before burning down in 1906. In the late 1860s, the St. Paul and Sioux City Railroad laid a track along Minneopa Creek. At this time, the property around the falls was owned by D.C. Evans, also owner of the biggest interest in South Bend. The railroad opted not to build a train station in South Bend due to its proximity to Mankato, so Evans convinced them to build a station at the falls. Evans built bridges and stairs into the gorge. The agent at the train depot, J.B. Hodge, made great efforts to promote Minneopa Falls. He convinced the railroad company to advertise the destination and to offer four trains daily from Mankato in summer at a discount rate. Group excursions as large as 5,000 people came from Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Winona, along with closer towns. Visitors arrived by horse, wagon, and paddle steamer as well as train. Evans capitalized further on his falls property by platting the town of Minneopa in 1870. The town soon boasted a grain elevator, hotel, store, blacksmith shop, and a lumber business. However, a series of grasshopper plagues beginning in 1873 caused crops to fail for several years in a row, and the town was abandoned. ===James-Younger Gang=== The infamous James-Younger Gang hid out along Minneopa Creek following their disastrous September 7, 1876 bank robbery attempt in Northfield, Minnesota. After two weeks of rough travel while evading posses, the gang made camp under the railroad trestle over Minneopa Gorge. They hung up blankets as camouflage, but the hideout was spotted within a few days. Lawmen converged on the camp one morning, but made too much noise in their eagerness to capture the famous robbers. Alerted, the gang fled up the side of the ravine and over an adjacent hill. Bob and Jim Younger were still seriously injured from the Northfield raid, and the gang agreed to split up. That night Frank and Jesse James managed to flee on stolen horses as shots were fired at them. It was the final parting of the James-Younger Gang after ten years of banditry together. The rest of the gang circled back into the gorge and hid there for another three or four days before heading southwest. They were soon captured in a shootout near Madelia, Minnesota. ===State park creation=== Visitors in Minneopa Gorge, 1898 Minneopa Falls passed through a succession of owners after D.C. Evans sold the property in 1885. While it continued to be a popular destination, each private development went out of business. By 1903, the latest owner was considering simply clearcutting the glen and pasturing cattle in it. Local citizens concerned about losing access organized to advocate a public park instead. A supportive state representative, Ezra Gates, introduced a bill to the 1905 Minnesota Legislature. Lobbying from Mankato residents helped ensure the passage of the Minneopa State Park bill, which included $5,000 to purchase and develop the land around the falls. By then, the property had yet another owner, who reluctantly sold just to the state. Continued public support, though, induced the legislature to expand the boundaries and appropriate more funding the next year. J.B. Hodge, the railroad depot agent who had championed tourism at the falls, became the park's first superintendent. With state funding he was able to improve safety and access to the gorge, replacing the wooden stairs with cement steps and installing a railing, netting, and picnic tables. Over the next decades, other developments included a bridge into the park, a refreshment stand, a large picnic shelter, and stabilization of the waterfalls. Locals continued to take a strong, almost proprietary interest in the park. In 1927, the head of the park's local advisory board planted an orchard of black walnut trees (thinking nut sales could be a future source of funding), and only informed the state after the fact in a letter. ===State park development=== Originally centered on the falls, Minneopa State Park gained a noncontiguous parcel in 1931, with the donation of the Seppman Mill by the builder's son. Development stagnated during the Great Depression, until federal funds provided Works Progress Administration crews. From 1937 to 1940, young men improved the falls area with new stairs, a public shelter, restrooms, maintenance buildings, and other structures, all built from local sandstone. A district encompassing all seven of these enduring structures is on the National Register of Historic Places. Minneopa State Park remained quite small, had no campground, and attracted primarily local use. By the 1960s, Minnesota was removing many such parks from its state park system and transferring them to city or county management. Minneopa faced a downgrade to a county park unless it could be expanded. Local groups once again rallied to its cause, and in 1967, the state legislature secured funds and a federal grant for expansion. The addition, purchased mostly from Seppmann heirs, included lower Minneopa Creek and of Minnesota River shore, and finally connected the Seppman Mill parcel with the rest of the park. The new land was soon developed with a campground, picnic area, and a road to the mill, and dedicated in 1972. A hiking and skiing trail system was blazed by volunteers by 1977. ==Recreation== Minneopa State Park has a campground with 61 sites, six of them with electrical hookups. There are also four group camps, each accommodating up to 15 people, and a camper cabin. There are three picnic areas and two picnic shelters. The park has a hiking trail around the falls area. The northern section has of trail, which in the winter are groomed for cross-country skiing. There is no official trail along the Minnesota River because each attempt has been demolished by floods. A paved biking and walking trail connects Minneopa to Sibley Park in Mankato. It was completed in the fall of 2010 with a mix of federal, county, and state funds. There are fishing opportunities along the river, especially for channel and flathead catfish. Minneopa Creek below the falls also supports game fish. ==References== ==External links== * Minneopa State Park * Friends of Minneopa State Park Category:1905 establishments in Minnesota Category:Dakota toponyms Category:Grasslands of Minnesota Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:James–Younger Gang Category:Landforms of Blue Earth County, Minnesota Category:Minnesota River Category:National Register of Historic Places in Blue Earth County, Minnesota Category:Park buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:Prairies Category:Protected areas established in 1905 Category:Protected areas of Blue Earth County, Minnesota Category:Rustic architecture in Minnesota Category:State parks of Minnesota Category:Waterfalls of Minnesota Category:Works Progress Administration in Minnesota ","title":"Minneopa State Park"},{"id":"3261866","text":"Nobody Waved Good-bye is a 1964 National Film Board of Canada production directed by Don Owen, starring Peter Kastner, Julie Biggs and Claude Rae. It was followed twenty years later by a sequel, Unfinished Business, with the same director and two lead actors. ==Plot== In Toronto, Peter is an 18-year- old boy who dislikes the middle-class comfort of his family life, headed by his father, who sells cars for $300 per commission, and what he perceives as society's general fixation on profit. He has a girlfriend, Julie, whose parents dislike him, and his own parents feel he spends too much time with her, at the expense of his school work. Peter steals his father's company's car and rides with Julie, only to be arrested for dangerous driving without a licence. He starts meeting with a probation officer weekly, and also leaves home to rent his own place, and finds work. Unable to make much money, he pressures Julie to find a job. She comes to his residence after a fight with her parents and demands they leave Toronto, telling Peter to borrow money from his father. Peter meets his father at the car dealership, only to find him incensed with Peter's appearance. His father tells him he is a bad investment and he does not want to see him any more. Peter subsequently steals money and a car to leave with Julie. When Julie realizes the truth about Peter's theft, she tells him she is pregnant and that she can't raise her baby with him. ==Production== Owen had originally planned to shoot a half-hour television docudrama provisionally called First Offence about probation officers, with a budget of $35,000, and using occasional dramatizations to tell the story. After the start of principal photography, the director believed the story could be expanded into a feature film, and NFB executive producer Tom Daly allocated additional funds for a total of $75,000. Owen also decided to shift the focus of the film away from probation officers, onto a coming-of-age story of a young man from the suburbs growing into adulthood. He used a small crew of five people for Nobody Waved Good-bye —and no screenplay. Instead, he wrote a short outline that he would discuss with the actors and cameraman John Spotton before each scene, with dialogue then improvised based on these discussions. The film was shot over three weeks in the summer and winter of 1963. Spotton shot on 16mm in order to give the film a more documentary look. One scene, in which the protagonist is working at a parking lot, was shot with hidden cameras, with real patrons unaware they were being filmed. Owen later said that his work on Nobody Waved Good-bye was influenced by the Direct Cinema documentaries of fellow NFB filmmakers Michel Brault and Gilles Groulx. ==Cast== * Peter Kastner as Peter * Julie Biggs as Julie * Claude Rae as Father * Toby Tarnow as Sister * Charmion King as Mother * Ron Taylor as Boy friend * Bob Hill as Patrolman (credited as Robert Hill) * Jack Beer as Sergeant * Sean Sullivan as Probation Officer (credited as John Sullivan) * Lynne Gorman as Julie's mother * Ivor Barry as Interviewer * Sharon Bonin as Waitress * Norman Ettlinger as Landlord * John Vernon as Lot Supervisor ==Release== Nobody Waved Good-bye premiered at an international festival in Montreal on August 13, 1964, then screened at a film festival in New York City. The film was initially distributed in Canada by Columbia Pictures. The film's theatrical release began at the former Kent Theatre in November, where it performed very poorly, barely grossing $700 in a week. Columbia pulled the film and released it in Toronto over Christmas, where it performed somewhat better. Canadian film critics initially offered mixed reviews. Following its success in U.S. theatres, Columbia decided to release the film in Ottawa, Regina, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver, to better response. On July 23, 1965, a French-subtitled version, Départ sans adieux, was released in Montreal and throughout Quebec, also successfully. U.S.-based distributor Cinema V had seen Nobody Waved Good-bye at the New York festival and sought to acquire theatrical rights for the rest of the world minus Canada. The NFB refused due to pending sales in Europe, so Cinema V acquired U.S. theatrical rights and released the film in New York City on April 21, 1965, to acclaim. The film subsequently played in Washington, Boston, Los Angeles and many other American cities, to positive audience and critical reaction. Nobody Waved Good-bye played theatrically in such markets as Czechoslovakia, the United Kingdom, Israel and Yugoslavia, followed by TV sales to dozens of broadcasters including the BBC. However, an Irish distribution deal fell through when the NFB refused a demand from Irish censors to cut references to sex and pregnancy. ==Reception== After its screening at New York, positive reviews included Judith Crist of the New York Herald Tribune, who called it “A film that you should not miss.” A more mixed review came from The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther, who, while praising the film, concluded: \\"A good job of pictorial pamphleteering on the topic of parent-child relations is done by \\"Nobody Waved Good-bye,\\" but it comes to no forceful conclusion, either emotional or intellectual.\\" In 1984, the Toronto International Film Festival ranked the film ninth in the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.\\"Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time ,\\" The Canadian Encyclopedia, 2012, URL accessed 28 April 2013. TIFF organizers felt the 1984 poll, provided recognition for Owen, who they felt was an underappreciated director.Piers Handling, \\"Canada's ten best,\\" Take One, Fall 1994, pp. 22-23. It later fell off the Top 10 list, which was updated roughly every 10 years. Critic Norman Wilner said this was unsurprising, describing it and other films as \\"very much products of their time, and they haven’t aged well.\\"Norman Wilner, \\"The numbers game',\\" Now Toronto, 26 June 2015, URL accessed 28 August 2016. In 2004, Nobody Waved Goodbye was honoured as a MasterWork by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada. James Leach, writing in The Dalhousie Review, in 1980, described the film as having \\"virtually inaugurated the modern English-Canadian feature- film\\". ===Accolades=== Despite the fact that Nobody Waved Good-bye was a fiction film, it was awarded the Robert J. Flaherty Award for best non-fiction film by BAFTA in 1965. ==References== ==External links== * *Watch Nobody Waved Good-bye at NFB.ca Category:1964 films Category:Canadian films Category:English-language films Category:Canadian black-and-white films Category:Films set in Toronto Category:National Film Board of Canada films Category:BAFTA winners (films) Category:Films directed by Don Owen Category:1964 drama films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:Canadian coming-of-age drama films Category:Films scored by Eldon Rathburn Category:Films produced by Tom Daly Category:Canadian docufiction films ","title":"Nobody Waved Good-bye"},{"id":"3261884","text":"* Board game system * Role-playing game system * Video game system, is another name for video game console ","title":"Game system"},{"id":"3261888","text":"Vaux-devant-Damloup is a former commune in the Meuse department in Grand Est in north-eastern France.

It is a romantic melodrama dealing with friendship, jealousy and the ties that bind. ==Plot== (After spending a short amount of time 2001, the film uses a non-linear structure through extensive use of flashbacks and timeskips of indeterminate duration, including flashbacks within flashbacks. However, each of the sequences, 2001 and 1996, occur roughly in order.) Summer of 1996 Ji-hwan is an amateur photographer working part-time at his older friend's cafe. Two young women enter and when they leave Ji-hwan chases after them, declaring his love for Soo-in. Soo-in feels uncomfortable and Ji-hwan leaves only to shortly return holding a clock over his face with a note saying he has wound back time so that in the future they can meet again as friends as if his declaration of love never happened. The girls turn up at his workplace unannounced and they bond. After Ji-hwan stands up for Soo-in against two men disturbing her at the movie, all three quote a line from the movie (Il Postino) \\"I'm in love. It hurts but I want it to go on hurting.\\" with both the girls appearing to be developing feelings for Ji-hwan. Soo-in enlists Ji- hwan's help in dating the guy who works at a manhwa store, only she later tells Ji-hwan she has changed her mind as the man is insincere. (However, near the end of the film the guy is seen re-reading a note she wrote to him and he has a photo of her taped to his army bunk.) The trio take a magazine personality test and unseen by either of the other two, Gyung-hee is secretly happy when her personality and Ji-hwan's are seen as a good match. However, the cafe owner comes along and says how lucky the other two to have found love, a sentiment that hurts Gyung-hee. Gyung-hee and Soo-in fight which confuses Soo-in. They soon reconcile and runaway to go on a road trip, asking Ji-hwan along. During the trip, Soo-in watches Ji-hwan sleep and caresses a mole on his ear. In the morning she is absent and Ji-hwan nearly kisses a sleeping Gyung-hee. Going outside he asks Soo-in about her first love. She says it was a young boy at hospital when she was a young girl. They both spent a long time there but he never complained and kept her spirits up. She told the boy they would swap names so that even if they separated they would still be connected. Admiring the scenery in the rain trio promise to return in winter. Soo-in becomes ill due to the rain. While she rests alone in a hotel room, Gyung-hee cries, scolds Ji-hwan for being disturbed by seeing her cry (she is normally cheerful) and then she leans in and kisses him. After returning to Seoul, Soo-in is still ill and the other two go out with Ji-hwan commenting it's like a date. Gyung-hee becomes uncomfortable, insists they change plans and go drinking, then scolds Ji-hwan for acting like her boyfriend when he isn't. She storms off. Later, the girls attend a party at Ji-hwan's work. Ji-hwan comments that it is taking forever for her to get over her cold. Soo-in sings a love song about the three of them and then leaves early, asking Ji-hwan to walk with her. She touches his face to remember it. Before Gyung-hee leaves, Ji-hwan writes a note addressed to Soo-in declaring his love for Gyung-hee. He expects Gyung-hee to read it and includes lines written to her. He gives it to Gyung-hee to give to Soo-in. Thinking it is a love letter to Soo-in, when he has gone Gyung-hee starts to open it but then tears it up. Some time later, Gyung-hee visits Soo-in in the intensive care unit. Soo-in reads aloud a letter that she wrote to Gyung-hee. She says she has been brave while receiving treatment and that she was expecting Gyung-hee and Ji-hwan to come to her as a couple. It gets too much for Gyung-hee who says she'll read it later. Soo-in gives Gyung-hee a wax-sealed letter to be given to Ji-hwan. Late autumn or winter 1996 Ji-hwan has not seen his friends for months and he is chided by his boss for not getting their addresses or phone numbers despite all the time they spent together. Ji-hwan receives a phone call and meets Gyung-hee for a drink. He immediately asks about her injured right hand which she dismisses as just an injury. When he asks about Soo-in she tells him they became uncomfortable around him, he says the same about them, and tells her to go if she has nothing else to say. She leaves, he stays and gets drunk. When he leaves he falls down, punches the ground in anger and falls asleep. He awakes in his bedroom with his hand bandaged. (A brief flashback occurring later shows Gyung-hee tending to his injury in his bedroom while he is asleep, kissing him, then leaving.) 2001 Ji-hwan opens yet another handmade envelope containing only a black and white photo with no sender information on or in the envelope. He visits his former workplace, a cafe, where his friend the owner returns to him a box of photographs. Ji-hwan decides to track down his former friends, Gyung-hee and Soo-in, two young women whom he has not seen for five years. Going to their high school, a teacher who was their classmate tells him that both girls missed a lot of school as they were very sick. She says Gyung-hee died five years ago and Soo- in left Seoul after that. Ji-hwan goes to the small town where the envelopes are postmarked but the postman denies any knowledge of the sender. (However, in a brief flashback the postman is seen to sneak into a woman's house and take one of the envelopes from under her bed. In voiceover, the postman says he is in love with the woman, that he wonders why she has a suitcase full of the letters, and that he will deliver the letter because he's a postman.) Walking around the town Ji-hwan hears children calling his name, only to find it is the name of their dog. A neighbour of the woman from whose house the envelopes are taken from tells her they have found Ji-hwan. The woman goes out expecting to see her dog but instead she is greeted by her former friend and Ji-hwan sees that Gyung-hee is still alive, albeit not looking as vibrant as she did five years ago. They touch faces as Soo-in had touched Ji-hwan's face when they last met. She accompanies Ji-hwan to the wedding of the cafe owner where they make a wonderful couple. Other flashbacks * When Soo-in dies, Gyung-hee hops onto her bed and hugs her friend. ** A flashback inside the flashback shows that the young boy in the hospital in Soo-in's story was actually a young girl, Gyung-hee, and that Soo-in hid in Gyung-hee's bed prior to Gyung-hee's surgery. * The two girls swapped names as children, but the school used their official names. So, when the teacher said Gyung-hee died she was referring to the woman Ji-hwan (and the rest of the movie) called Soo-in. * Immediately following Soo-in's funeral, so she could wind it back like Ji- hwan had done, Gyung-hee punched a clock to break its glass cover, injuring her right hand prior to calling Ji-hwan. After the wedding Alone, Ji-hwan opens another envelope. It contains the sealed letter Soo-in wrote on her deathbed, saying she thinks she will be dying soon and giving him advice on how to date Gyung-hee.(In the flashback showing the letter being written, Soo- in draws a mark on her father's ear to match Ji-hwan's so that her dad will look more handsome.) The envelope also contains a letter from Gyung-hee. She confesses that she tore up his letter to Soo-in. She thanks him for his kindness and for passing on the love of photography to her. She thanks him for accepting her awkward kiss a long time ago. Then she says that she has been feeling very weak and has told her dad about what she wants at her funeral, including her beloved Ji-hwan. The camera pans to the beautiful blue sky, her voiceover says that she will be seeing Soo-in soon. \\"Goodbye Ji-hwan. I loved you before and I love you now. Goodbye.\\" The last shot is the trio in happier times, a photo taken on their road trip. ==Cast== * Cha Tae-hyun ... Lee Ji- hwan * Lee Eun-ju ... Kim Gyung-hee/Soo-in * Son Ye-jin ...

A typical pupu platter, as found in American Chinese cuisine, might include an egg roll, spare ribs, chicken wings, chicken fingers, beef teriyaki, skewered beef, fried wontons, crab rangoon and fried shrimp, among other items, accompanied by a small hibachi grill. The pupu platter was probably first introduced to restaurants on the United States mainland by Don the Beachcomber in 1934. It has since become a standard at most Polynesian themed restaurants such as Don's and Trader Vic's. Link via ProQuest.Link via ProQuest. The earliest known print reference to a pupu platter served at a Chinese restaurant is from 1969. Link via ProQuest. Later, other types of restaurants used pu pu platter to mean an appetizer combination platter.In the 1970s, Boston area Italian restaurants were marketing their appetizers combinations as Italian pu pu platters.Alternate Link via ProQuest. However, pu pu platters are currently more closely associated with American Chinese restaurants. ==Hawaiian origin and etymology== In the Hawaiian language, pū-pū denotes a relish, appetizer, canapé, or hors d'oeuvre; it originally meant \\"shell fish', but also referred to small bits of fish, chicken, or banana relish served with kava and beans. ==In Hawaiian cuisine== Since the introduction of commercial dining and drinking establishments in Hawaii, pūpū were, and remain, standard fare in island establishments.Unlike in American Chinese cuisine, the Hawaiian dish is referred to simply as pūpū or pūpūs, without the word platter. An establishment that serves \\"heavy pupus\\" will often have a buffet table with warming trays full of chicken, tempura vegetables, shrimp, poke (cubed and seasoned raw fish), small skewers of teriyaki meat or chicken, sushi, and other similar finger foods. An establishment that serves \\"light pupus\\" usually will offer only the cold foods such as poke, sushi, and vegetables. Some establishments will serve pūpū to the table. At Hawaiian bar, restaurants, catered events such as political rallies, and private parties, establishments, and hosts are known in \\"local\\" circles by the quality of their pupus. Event invitations often will state that \\"light pupus\\" or \\"heavy pupus\\" will be served so that attendees will know whether they should plan to have a full meal before the event or not. Today, the simple platter of dried fish, grilled chicken, and slices of banana has evolved into chefs' offerings of international delicacies arranged for visual as well as gustatory pleasure. Modern pupu platters can hold offerings of anything from traditional Hawaiian fare to exotic combinations. ==In Polynesian cuisine on the mainland== At the height of the tiki bar/restaurant craze, the New York Herald Tribune published several articles concerning the opening and the ambiance of one of the first Hawaiian themed restaurants in New York City, Luau 400, on East 57th Street. At the time of the restaurant's opening in 1957, pu pu platters were considered a part of the luau feast.Link via ProQuest. A typical platter at this establishment would have included baked clams, rumaki, Shrimp Vela (battered fried shrimp with coconut), chicken wings, egg rolls, spare ribs, or Javanese sate (satay) on skewers.Link via ProQuest. The appetizers were served on \\"a Lazy Susan made of monkey pod wood and equipped with a little stove fired with charcoal briquettes.\\" Recipes for some of the pu pu items were later published in the Herald Tribune in 1960.Link via ProQuest.

He was recruited by , where he played both under-19s and reserve grade football. After winning the Morrish Medal in 1984, he called , and in the hope of playing senior football. Mick Malthouse, who was Footscray coach at the time, invited Liberatore to train but made no guarantees that he would get a game. At his first training session with the club, Liberatore was teased by full- forward Simon Beasley, who said that due to his lack of height he would have been better off training to be a jockey at the nearby Flemington Racecourse. Although Liberatore made his senior level debut in 1986, he mainly played in the reserves that season, winning the VFL reserves' Gardiner Medal in both 1986 and 1988. He was a member of the team that won the 1988 VFL reserves premiership. Standing at 163 cm, Liberatore played only 18 senior games until the 1990 season, when he played 19 games and won the Brownlow Medal for the best and fairest senior AFL player. Liberatore played a total of 283 senior games for Footscray/Western Bulldogs in a career that included 13 finals, life membership of the club, and selection on the interchange bench in the club's Team of the Century. Liberatore was noted for his ability to read the play and his prolific tackling. Throughout his senior career, he made 1,225 tackles in his career; an average of 4.39 per game. In 1992 he became the first VFL/AFL player to exceed 100 tackles in a season, and then exceeded 100 tackles each season until 1996. His season tally of 142 tackles in 1994 stood as the VFL/AFL record until 2006, when James McDonald bettered it by one. ==Playing statistics== :Tony Liberatore's player profile at AFL Tables - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1986 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  60  4  1  1  19  22  41  5   0.3  0.3  4.8  5.5  10.3  1.3  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  1987 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  39  12  7  11  102  70  172  10  23  0.6  0.9  8.5  5.8  14.3  0.8  1.9 - eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1988 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  39  1  0  0  4  6  10  1  1  0.0  0.0  4.0  6.0  10.0  1.0  1.0 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  1989 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  39  1  0  0  12  2  14  1  3  0.0  0.0  12.0  2.0  14.0  1.0  3.0 - eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1990 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  39  19  13  8  249  245  494  33  82  0.7  0.4  13.1  12.9  26.0  1.7  4.3 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   1991 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  39  22  13  9  301  296  597  29  62  0.6  0.4  13.7  13.5  27.1  1.3  2.8 - eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  1992 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  39  25  14  4  326  286  612  47  136  0.6  0.2  13.0  11.4  24.5  1.9  5.4 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   1993 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  39  20  12  8  250  238  488  27  115  0.6  0.4  12.5  11.9  24.4  1.4  5.8 -eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1994 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  39  24  6  9  280  211  491  26  142  0.3  0.4  11.7  8.8  20.5  1.1  5.9 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   1995 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  39  23  9  6  304  234  538  36  116  0.4  0.3  13.2  10.2  23.4  1.6  5.0 -eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1996 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  39  22  6  6  250  232  482  24  111  0.3  0.3  11.4  10.5  21.9  1.1  5.0 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   1997 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  39  24  8  4  237  196  433  40  95  0.3  0.2  9.9  8.2  18.0  1.7  4.0 -eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1998 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  39  9  0  3  49  51  100  16  25  0.0  0.3  5.4  5.7  11.1  1.8  2.8 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   1999 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  39  21  2  3  197  154  351  28  69  0.1  0.1  9.4  7.3  16.7  1.3  3.3 -eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2000 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  39  23  3  6  204  230  434  56  99  0.1  0.3  8.9  10.0  18.9  2.4  4.3 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2001 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  39  17  1  3  120  150  270  26  90  0.1  0.2  7.1  8.8  15.9  1.5  5.3 -eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2002 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  39  16  0  2  60  90  150  22  56  0.0  0.1  3.8  5.6  9.4  1.4  3.5 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 283 ! 95 ! 83 ! 2964 ! 2713 ! 5677 ! 427 ! 1225 ! 0.3 ! 0.3 ! 10.5 ! 9.6 ! 20.1 ! 1.5 ! 4.4 } ==Honours and achievements== { style=\\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px #000 solid; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\\" - fff;\\"  colspan=\\"2;\\" style=\\"padding:3px; margin-bottom:-3px; margin-top:2px; font-family:Arial; \\" Brownlow Medal votes - ! style=\\"width:50%;\\" Season ! style=\\"width:50%;\\" Votes -  1986  — -  1987  4 -  1988  — -  1989  — - - D9F9E9;\\"  1990  18 -  1991  2 -  1992  12 -  1993  4 -  1994  16 -  1995  14 -  1996  7 -  1997  10 -  1998  — -  1999  8 -  2000  14 -  2001  3 -  2002  — -  Total  112 -  colspan=2 Key: - d9f9e9; border:1px solid #aaa; width:2em;\\"  colspan=2 Green / Bold = Won } Individual *Brownlow Medal: 1990 *Charles Sutton Medal (Footscray F.C.

Between 2003 and 2007, he held an assistant coaching position at and in 2008, he was the senior coach of the Sunbury Lions Football Club in the Ballarat Football League. In 2009, he became the senior coach of the West Footscray Roosters, a team playing in the Melbourne suburban Western Region Football League.Mallinder, Terry (4 Nov 2008)Liberatore a West Footscray Rooster In a radio interview in the 2008 pre-season, Liberatore accused then Bulldogs CEO Campbell Rose of causing dissension at the club and being more concerned with making money than winning football matches. His comments saw him briefly banished from the club until he came to apologize to the president David Smorgon later in the year. ==Family== Liberatore married his wife Jane, a schoolteacher, in 1991 and had two sons - Tom and Oliver - and one daughter - Meg. News of an acrimonious split became public in April 2008 when Jane demanded the sale of Liberatore's medals with the proceeds to be kept in a trust fund for their children's education. Liberatore was present at the 2016 AFL Grand Final with his daughter and mother to witness the Bulldogs' unlikely triumph, celebrating with Tom in the rooms after the game. ==Footnotes== :1. The true number of tackles is likely slightly higher than 1225, as tackle statistics were not recorded during 1986, in which Liberatore played the first four of his 283 games. ==References== ==External links== *Western Bulldogs player profile – Tony Liberatore * Category:Brownlow Medal winners Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Western Bulldogs players Category:Box Hill Football Club coaches Category:Australian people of Italian descent Category:Victorian State of Origin players Category:Charles Sutton Medal winners ","title":"Tony Liberatore"},{"id":"3261912","text":"The Knox School is an independent, co-educational, non-denominational day school, located in the eastern Melbourne suburb of Wantirna South, Victoria, Australia.

The school took over the campus from Taylors College at 220 Burwood Highway. The first principal was Dulcie Flinn, who was previously of the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Melbourne. From 1982 to 1985 there were eight portable classrooms – five for the Junior School and three for the Senior School. In 1985 Stage II building work was done. The second principal was Baxter Holly. Under Holly's leadership, Knoxfield College developed Stage III, including the Performing Arts Centre and the Art Gallery. 1987 saw the first Year 12 class. 1992 saw the purchase of a 1.6 hectare block of land adjoining the school from a plant nursery. That area is now the Tew Field (named after Wally Tew, a local councillor), the school's synthetic hockey pitch. This was opened in 1996. The third principal was Tony Conabere. He was appointed in July 1995. 1996 was another year of building, including the Pre-Prep campus and Tew Field, as well as the adjoining Pavilion. In 1998 and 2000 the Knox School was ranked in Victoria's top ten schools, and in 1998 won the gold medal for Assessment Practice. 2000 saw the renaming of the school to Knox Grammar, however only a year later the school was further renamed to The Knox School after a \\"disagreement\\" with Knox Grammar School over the naming. In 2002 the Information Common was opened by the then-Governor of Victoria, John Landy. This building incorporates four stories which include a library, many computer facilities, multimedia studio and numerous staff offices and front desk. In 2004 the fourth principal, Suzanne McChesney, was appointed. Also in that year the Philip Island Discovery Campus was purchased. In 2005, the Junior School Building was named the D. G. M. Flinn building after the School's first principal. 2006 saw the renaming of the Arts Centre to the Founders' Building, in honour of those who started the school. In 2007 The Knox School celebrated its 25th anniversary, along with unofficially opening its new auditorium, and beginning renovations to part of the Senior School, with renovations to the science labs and the conversion of the Year 12 Common Room into a hospitality kitchen, where students study the elective subject Food Technology and also serves as a small café for the staff. The school also contributed to the building of a crossing over Burwood Highway. The school developed sister school relationships with the Shonan Gauken school in Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan; The Nanjing Foreign Language School in Nanjing, China and Yio Chu Kang Secondary School in Singapore. The current Principal, Allan Shaw took up the position on 7 July 2014. In September 2015, a $1.5 million refurbishment of the Year 7 Centre began. It was completed by the beginning of the school year in 2016.http://www.knox.vic.edu.au/downloads/falcon/091015.PDF Significant building projects since 2014 have seen many classrooms and other rooms refurbished and a 30 Million Dollar building masterplan (2017–2027) was ratified in December 2016. == House system == The four Houses used for sporting and arts competitions and carnivals are \\"Chisholm\\" (named after Caroline Chisholm), \\"Flinders\\" (Matthew Flinders), \\"Lawrence\\" (Marjorie Lawrence) and \\"Paterson\\" (Banjo Paterson). == Schools == There are three sub- schools: The Junior School (Early Learning Centre, Prep to Year 6), Middle School (Years 7 to 9) and Senior School (Years 10 to 12). == Extracurricular activities == === Sport === The Knox School is a member of the Eastern Independent Schools of Melbourne (EISM). ==== EISM premierships ==== The Knox School has won the following EISM senior premierships.

They were used in one area or another from a few months after the end of World War II until a few months after the end of U.S. participation in the Vietnam War – from 1946 until 1973. MPC utilized layers of line lithography to create colorful banknotes that could be produced cheaply. Fifteen series of MPCs were created. However, only 13 series were issued. The remaining two were largely destroyed, although some examples remain.Military Payment Certificate (series 691 & 701) Among the 13 released series a total of 94 notes are recognized. == History of MPCs == MPCs evolved from Allied Military Currency as a response to the large amounts of US Dollars circulated by American servicemen in post-World War II Europe. The local citizens might not trust local currencies, as the future of their governments was unclear. Preferring a stable currency like U.S. dollars, local civilians often accepted payment in dollars for less than the accepted conversion rates. Dollars became more favorable to hold, inflating the local currencies and thwarting plans to stabilize local economies. Contributing to this problem was the fact that troops were being paid in dollars, which they could convert in unlimited amounts to the local currency with merchants at the floating (black market) conversion rate, which was much more favorable to the GIs than the government fixed conversion rate. From this conversion rate imbalance, a black market developed where the servicemen could profit from the more favorable exchange rate. To reduce profiteering from currency arbitrage, the U.S. military devised the MPC program. MPCs were paper money denominated in amounts of 5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents, 50 cents, 1 dollar, 5 dollars, 10 dollars, and starting in 1968 20 dollars. Unlike US currency, these certificates were issued under the authority of the Department of War (later Department of Defense) rather than the Department of the Treasury. Consequently, they do not bear the US Treasury seal found on virtually every example of US civilian currency. MPCs were fully convertible to U.S. dollars upon leaving a designated MPC zone, and convertible to local currencies when going on leave (but not vice versa). Because they were and are not obligations of the US Treasury, they are (unlike all US currency) no longer redeemable. It was illegal for unauthorized personnel to possess MPC, and that policy, in theory, eliminated U.S. dollars from local economies. Although actual greenbacks were not circulating, many local merchants accepted MPC on par with US dollars, since they could use them on the black market. This was especially evident during the Vietnam War when the MPC program was at its zenith. To prevent MPC from being used as a primary currency in the host country and destroying the local currency value and economy, MPC banknote styles were frequently changed to deter black marketers and reduce hoarding. A \\"conversion day\\" or \\"C-day\\" was the soldiers' only chance to trade in their old MPC for the new issue, after which the old MPC became worthless. C-days in Vietnam were always classified, never pre-announced. On a C-day, soldiers would be restricted to base, preventing them from helping Vietnamese civilians—especially local bars, brothels, bar girls and other black market people—from converting old MPC to the newer version. Since Vietnamese were not allowed to convert the currency, they frequently lost savings by holding old MPC that lost all value after the C-day was completed. People angry over their MPC loss would sometimes attack the nearest U.S. base the next night in retaliation. To illustrate the Vietnam War MPC cycle, in mid-1970, a soldier could have a friend in the United States mail him a standard $100 bill, take it off-base and convert it to $180 in MPC, then change the MPC to South Vietnamese piastres at more than the legal rate. The soldier could then spend freely, paying in low-cost local currency, and end the day with a sizable profit. If the $100 bill found its way into the hands of a high-level Vietnamese government official, it could be taken out of the country and deposited in a bank account abroad, where U.S. currency could be more safely hoarded, and/or transferred into a North Vietnamese European exchange account. Thirteen series of MPC were issued between 1946 and 1973, with varied designs often compared to Monopoly money due to their colors. After the official end of U.S. participation in the Vietnam War in early 1973, the only place where MPC remained in use was South Korea. In autumn of 1973, a surprise C-day was held there, retiring MPC and substituting greenbacks. MPC was never again issued, and the concept lay dormant until the late 1990s, when it was revived somewhat in the form of the Eagle Cash stored value card system, used by U.S. armed forces in Bosnia, Kosovo, Djibouti, Iraq, and Afghanistan, as well as other non-combat zones on a limited basis. ==MPC in popular culture== A Korean War C-day is a key plot element of \\"Change Day,\\" an episode from the sixth season of the television series M*A*S*H. Major Charles Emerson Winchester III schemes to purchase soon-to-be-worthless MPC from local farmers and merchants for cash at 10% of face value, then trade it in and pocket a 900% profit. His plan is foiled when Hawkeye Pierce and B.J. Hunnicutt arrange for the military police to set up a roadblock that delays him from reaching camp in time for the exchange. In the Vietnam War novel The Short-Timers by Gustav Hasford, Marine Sergeant James T. \\"Joker\\" Davis encounters an officer who habitually plays Monopoly with one of his subordinates. The two use MPC in place of the game's standard play money and divide all listed rents and prices by 10 (e.g. paying $35 rent instead of $350 for landing on Oriental Avenue with a hotel). In “Hard Stripe”, a 1989 episode of Tour of Duty, a Finance Corps lieutenant at Tan Son Nhut in 1968 spots a soldier in illegal possession of a five dollar treasury note and warns him to convert it to MPCs when the treasury office opens the next morning. ==References== * Fred Schwan (1997) Military Payment Certificates. == External links == * Vietnam era MPC * South Viet Nam: Soul Alley * MPC Central * A gallery of United States Military Payment Certificates at Banknote Museum Category:United States military pay and benefits Category:Payment systems Category:Inflation Category:Monetary reform Category:Banknotes of military authorities ","title":"Military payment certificate"},{"id":"3261953","text":"John Kirk Train Varnedoe (January 18, 1946 – August 14, 2003) was an American art historian, the Chief Curator of Painting and Sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art from 1988 to 2001, Professor of the History of Art at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton and Professor of Fine Arts at the New York University Institute of Fine Arts. ==Biography== Varnedoe was born and raised in Savannah, Georgia, and attended Savannah Country Day School. He studied at St. Andrew's School and Williams College, where he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Society. At Williams he began studying studio art, but soon switched to art history under the influence of Professor Lane Faison, and received his A.B. in 1967. He also played college football and, after graduating, returned to work as a coaching assistant and to lead art history discussion sections for a year.Oral History Program, interview with Kirk Varnedoe, 28 Nov 2001, p. 14-20. The Museum of Modern Art Archives, New York. In 1972 Varnedoe earned a Ph.D. at Stanford under Rodin scholar Albert Elsen, with whom he collaborated on an exhibition and catalog, The Drawings of Rodin (1971), about the profusion of drawings falsely attributed to Rodin.Finding Aid for the Kirk Varnedoe papers, 1890-2006, at the Getty Research Institute. Retrieved on 5 December 2014. He married the artist Elyn Zimmerman, taught art history at Stanford for a year, then taught at Columbia University and at New York University Institute of Fine Arts. In 1987 he published a book about the French painter Gustave Caillebotte, which helped to initiate a revival of scholarly and public interest in that little-known Impressionist. A 1982 exhibition Varnedoe curated, \\"Northern Light: Realism and Symbolism in Scandinavian Painting, 1880-1910\\" introduced American audiences to yet more unfamiliar artists. In 1984, the same year that he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship, he co-curated with William Rubin, the principal curator and future director of the Museum of Modern Art, an important and controversial exhibition at MoMA, \\"Primitivism in Twentieth-Century Art.\\" That relationship with Rubin led to his appointment at MoMA four years later to the prestigious position of Chief Curator of Painting and Sculpture, a position he held for thirteen years before leaving for Princeton. It was a precarious moment in which to take charge of the most highly regarded collection of modern art in the world; contemporary artists bitterly complained that MoMA had lost touch with the current art scene and those opposed to many of the new developments in the current art scene feared that MoMA would alter its historical allegiance to high Modernism from Matisse to Rothko. \\"Varnedoe inherits his mantle in difficult times,\\" one commentator observed.William Grimes, \\"Kirk Varnedoe is in the Hot Seat as MoMA's Boy,\\" New York Times, 3/11/90. Varnedoe curated or co-curated a number of major exhibitions at MoMA during his tenure, some which were considered highly controversial. A list of the exhibitions he brought to MoMA also indicates the breadth of his interests: \\"Vienna: 1900\\" in 1986, \\"High And Low: Modern Art and Popular Culture\\" (co-curated with the writer Adam Gopnik) in 1990, retrospectives of the art of Cy Twombly (1995), Jasper Johns (1997), and Jackson Pollock (1999), and \\"Van Gogh's Postman: The Portraits of Joseph Roulin (2001). He was highly regarded as a public speaker and lectured frequently; among his most notable lecture series were the Slade Lectures at Oxford and the Mellon Lectures at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Varnedoe left MoMA in 2001. His departure came, according to his wife and to Adam Gopnik, after a period of difficult relations with the museum's new director, Glenn Lowry.Martin Fuller, \\"MoMA: A Needless Act of Destruction,\\" New York Review of Books, LX, 9 (May 23, 2013), p. 4. He then became a scholar-in-residence at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Studies until his death two years later. Kirk Varnedoe died of cancer in 2003 at the age of fifty-seven. Adam Gopnik, one of his graduate school protégés in the mid-1980s, wrote a tribute in The New Yorker in 2004, which was subsequently republished in Reader's Digest.Personal History, \\"Last of the Metrozoids,\\" by Adam Gopnik, The New Yorker, May 10, 2004, p. 82 ==Publications== *Primitivism in Twentieth-Century Art (1984) *Vienna 1900 (1986) *Gustave Caillebotte (1987) *Northern Light: Nordic Painting at the Turn of the Century (1988) *High and Low: Modern Art and Popular Culture (1990) * A Fine Disregard (1990) *Cy Twombly (1994) *Jasper Johns (1996) *Jackson Pollock (1998) *Pictures of Nothing (2006) High and Low, written with co-curator Adam Gopnik, was the catalogue that accompanied the MoMA exhibition of that same name. That exhibition was an examination of the overlap between \\"high culture\\" (i.e., painting, art works created for display in galleries and museums) and popular culture (i.e., caricature, graffiti, advertising, comic books) that gave rise to the Cubism of Picasso, Kurt Schwitters' collages, Miró's surrealism, the Pop Art of Ed Ruscha and Claes Oldenburg, Jasper Johns' paint brushes and coffee cans, Robert Rauschenberg's Rebus, and late Philip Guston. The exhibition was faulted by some critics for the small number of contemporary works it displayed in proportion to the large number of works by better-known artists whose relation to pop culture had been previously studied. The value of the catalogue, then, was in its thoughtful essays which also discussed, and illustrated, the work of more recent artists whose roots were in pop culture: e.g., Jean-Michel Basquiat, Ashley Bickerton, Roger Brown, Peter Halley, Jenny Holzer, Jeff Koons, Sherrie Levine, Elizabeth Murray, David Salle, Peter Saul, Kenny Scharf, Cindy Sherman, among others. Varnedoe's last book, Pictures of Nothing, was published posthumously and was based on notes from his A.W. Mellon lectures in the Fine Arts, which he delivered at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. a few months before his death. His topic was abstract art after Jackson Pollock. His title was taken from a William Hazlitt essay about J.M.W. Turner. In making an impassioned case for post-1950s abstraction, Varnedoe was, in part, offering a response to a much earlier Mellon lecturer, E.H. Gombrich, who in Art and Illusion had extolled the history of representation since the Renaissance and characterized abstract art as a romantic but essentially primitivizing and limiting enterprise. Varnedoe's view, not surprisingly, was quite the opposite. Moreover, he knew that abstraction from Kandinsky to Rothko had achieved an Old master-like acceptance among a broad audience but that large numbers of educated art lovers still harbored doubts about art from Ellsworth Kelly, Robert Morris, and Cy Twombly to Donald Judd, Robert Ryman, and Sol LeWitt, and his lectures made an argument for the depth, variety, and meaningfulness of art after Abstract Expressionism. \\"What is abstract art good for? Why should we spend our time looking at 'pictures of nothing'?\\" Varnedoe accepted those as the fundamental questions that had to be addressed. He also acknowledged the gulf between those who revered the School of New York and those who embraced the un-painterly successors to Mark Rothko and Morris Louis, those artists who seemed to represent a repudiation of Abstract Expressionism. His lectures asked: \\"What have we gained in return for giving up the painterly beauty and sophistication of the art that Minimalism killed off?\\" Ultimately, he argued that Minimalism represented a profound gain, that it could be taken \\"both as a legitimate reflection of the way we think individually and as a valuable aspect of a liberal society.\\"Varnedoe, Pictures of Nothing, p. 29. He disputed the view that Minimalism was reductive, narrow, or mute: \\"Minimalism revives and renovates what it seems to kill...it is a radically new kind of art, not a sophisticated variation on traditional modernism.\\"Varnedoe, Pictures of Nothing, p. 121. ==References== ;Obituaries *Michael Malone, \\"Kirk Varnedoe: A Hooligan and a Gentleman\\" ==External links== * Kirk Varnedoe papers, 1890-2006 (bulk 1970-2003).

There are about 340km north from capital to here. It has an important military base and used to be the island's largest salt field. It has regularly been the site of battles during the civil war. ==Strategic importance== Elephant Pass controls access to the Jaffna Peninsula, therefore it is referred to as the Gateway to Jaffna. It is very crucial as it is on the isthmus connecting the peninsula to the Sri Lankan mainland, and to territory in the Southern Jaffna peninsula. Elephant Pass connects the militarily significant town of Chavakacheri in the Jaffna peninsula to the Sri Lankan mainland. ==History== Elephant Pass is beautifully described by the author Kalki Krishnamurthy in his much acclaimed Tamil Novel Ponniyin Selvan. Elephant Pass has been a strategic military base since 1760, when the Portuguese built a fort, which was later rebuilt and garrisoned by the Dutch in 1776 and later by the British. A modern military base was built there in 1952 by the Sri Lankan Army (SLA). At one time, the base and its outlying camps expanded to cover an area long and wide. ===Role during the Sri Lankan Civil War=== The base was under SLA control until 2000, despite repeated attempts to capture it by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE, also known as the Tamil Tigers). In the First Battle of Elephant Pass in 1991, the LTTE suffered heavy losses while trying to capture the pass. The base was used as a springboard for a number of SLA offensives during the 1990s, including Operation Yal Devi (named after the Colombo-Jaffna train) in September 1993 and Operation Sath Jaya (Truth’s Victory) in July 1996.Daimler Armoured Car rusting by a tree in the area around Elephant PassHowever, in a major military defeat, the Sri Lankan Army lost control of the pass to the LTTE on April 22, 2000 in the Second Battle of Elephant Pass. The pass was finally captured by Sri Lankan force in Third Battle of Elephant Pass, as part of campaign that led to destruction of Tamil Tigers. === Post-war developments === Before the war Elephant Pass Saltern produced 60,000 – 80,000 metric tons of salt production per annum and supplied 30 to 40% of the total salt requirement of the country. But due to the raging civil war the saltern operations were abandoned in 1990. Since the liberation of the area by Sri Lankan military forces the government has shown interest in rebuilding the Salterns in the Area and it has a large potential for exporting salt. De-mining has been completed in the area has been completed by Delvon Assistance for Social Harmony (DASH) with the support of the Australian Government. Chundikkulam Lagoon, often referred as Elephant Pass Lagoon Under the phase I programme which covers 330 acres. It is expected that the reactivation of phase I will lead to a production of 20,000 to 25,000 metric tons per annum of Salt production The second phase of the Elephant Pass Saltern of 447 acres will commence in 2015 and is expected to be funded under the Treasury funds. Additional 30,000 metric tons are expected and the total employment opportunities generated will be over 3,000. After completing the entire infrastructure development of the saltern, it is envisaged that the salt production will be around 70,000 to 100,000 metric tons of salt per annum. Under the reactivation of Elephant Pass Saltern Project, the construction of sea water intake canal, renovation of reservoir outer earth bunds, rip rap protection of reservoir, renovation of flood protection earth bunds, construction of spillways, electrification, renovation of buildings and purchase of tractors and trailers, tools and accessories are being carried out. In 2016 the Elephant Pass railway station which was destroyed by LTTE was rebuilt with contributions from students and teachers from around the country as well as contributions from the Ministry of Education. ==Transport== *Elephant Pass railway station == See also == *Place names in Sri Lanka *Elephant Pass Fort *The Road from Elephant Pass(Movie) ==References== Category:Pachchilaipalli DS Division ","title":"Elephant Pass"},{"id":"3261964","text":"Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics (SICM) is a classical mechanics textbook written by Gerald Jay Sussman and Jack Wisdom with Meinhard E.

In April 1086 Elizabeth's father was able to convince Pope Urban to issue a dispensation for the marriage, and departed on the Crusade preached by that pope, his last act being to see his daughter married to Robert.

The station lost both its community franchise and the battle to remain on the air on 8 December 2015 and ceased transmission on 20 December 2015 after almost ten years on the air. The station was not replaced. ==History== In 2003 the Australian Government called for tenders for what it called the \\"permanent\\" community TV licences. For many years community channels in the major capital cities had operated on narrowcast licences issued for limited 12-month periods. Everywhere but Sydney the incumbent channels secured the permanent licence. In Sydney a syndicate headed-up by the University of Western Sydney (UWS) was successful. TVS received its Iicence in early 2004. Transmissions officially commenced on analogue UHF channel 31 in February 2006 after three months of technical trials. Unlike the earlier temporary community channel (known simply as Channel 31) TVS, with the financial support of UWS TVS was able to acquire a high powered transmitter that meant for the first time community TV could be seen right across Sydney. In November 2009 the Government agreed to temporarily allocate TVS (and the other capital city Community Television channels) an additional (digital) channel so they could simulcast in the period up until the end of 2013 when analogue television will be turned off. TVS announced in December 2009 that it had appointed Broadcast Australia as its digital service provider and officially began simulcasting on Monday 1 March 2010 on LCN 44. Since February 2009 TVS simultaneously streamed its service via the internet. At the time Chief Executive, Laurie Patton, said the decision to transmit live via the web was part of the station’s long term strategy to be available across all distribution platforms. In 2009 the Australian Communications and Media Authority approved the station's request for the renewal of its broadcasting licence for a five-year period ending 22 April 2014. When it commenced on air operations TVS was Sydney's first new permanent free-to-air TV channel in twenty-five years. It was backed by the University of Western Sydney (UWS) and Metro Screen. TVS switched off its analogue signal on 1 March 2012. The station then only broadcast on LCN 44, with viewers requiring a digital television, or a digital set top box to use with an analogue television. In September 2014, Australian federal communications minister Malcolm Turnbull announced that licensing for community television stations would end in December 2015. In September 2015, Turnbull, now Prime Minister, announced an extension of the deadline to 31 December 2016, However, TVS' CEO Rachel Bentley stated that TVS could only continue broadcasting if it also launched a video on demand service before the amended deadline. TVS announced that it would cease broadcasting on 20 December 2015 in order to refocus programming strategy and develop a strong digital infrastructure, with plans to relaunch online in 2016. However, these plans never materialised or the channel was never replaced. ==Broadcast programs== TVS broadcast 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Despite a very limited marketing budget the channel progressively created a loyal audience. TVS recorded continual increases in cumulative audience numbers during the first few years. However, as digital take-up in Sydney increased the channel reported a leveling off of audience growth during 2009. When it launched its digital service in early 2010 audience levels began to increase again with a 15 percent increase in the first month (source OzTAM). TVS used the same Broadcast Australia tower as the ABC and SBS located at Gore Hill. The channel provided coverage across most of Sydney, with reports of clear reception from locations as far south as Wollongong, in the lower Blue Mountains and on the Central Coast. Its Digital 44 service had coverage that was equivalent to SBS (and the other free-to-airs), except that TVS did not have a number of in-fill repeaters that boost signals in some \\"black spots\\". TVS had a broadcast operations centre on the UWS Penrith campus. The station's digital automation system was based on the Playbox () software. The focus was on Sydney-specific programming with some programs sourced from interstate community channels (e.g. Vasili's Garden from Melbourne) and from professional program makers. As at February 2010 more than forty percent of the channel's programs were Sydney produced with a further thirty percent drawn from interstate community based producers. The station screened feature films in the public domain on weekday mornings and in prime time on Sunday and Wednesday evenings. On Friday nights it screened horror and science fiction films on the Schlocky Horror Picture Show hosted by a skeleton named Nigel Honeybone.http://www.myspace.com/nigelhoneybone From April 2015, The station screened children's programming on weekday mornings and afternoons and screens and sponsors Butterscotch's Playground shorts featuring former yellow Wiggle Greg Page. From May 2015, The station screened news programming on weekday mornings and afternoons with a replay and sponsors Seven News with Mark Ferguson presented by the news presenter himself. Not-for-profit community based producers received free program airtime. TVS announced the creation of the Television Sydney Foundation whose aim is to secure philanthropic donations that will be used to support the development of local programming. The TVS program schedule was based on a \\"modified wheel\\" concept where programs were run several times in the same week to allow audiences a choice of viewing times. The station's program line-up was published on its website, in most Australian electronic program guides (EPG's) and in the Sydney Morning Herald and Daily Telegraph newspapers. TVS accepted sponsorship advertising, limited to seven minutes per hour. It also sold program airtime (a maximum of eight hours per day as permitted under its licence conditions). ===Programmes=== * Pete Boone, Private Eye (2002–2004) * Vasili's Garden (2002–2006, 2009–) ==Staffing and management== The channel had a small team of paid employees and volunteers (many of them media students) and was initially headed up by former Seven Network executive Laurie Patton as CEO, Henri de Gorter as Program Manager and Adrian Alback (later Ian Sneddon) as Operations Manager. The original TVS Chairperson was UWS Vice-Chancellor, Professor Janice Reid AM and later UWS Deputy Chancellor Geoffrey Roberson. In August 2010, TVS announced the appointment of a new chairperson Harold Mitchell and a new CEO Rachel Bentley, a UWS academic. TVS was a founding member of the Australian Community Television Alliance (ACTA), the official sector representative. Then CEO Laurie Patton was the inaugural Secretary of ACTA and the sector's representative on the Government's Digital Switchover Taskforce Industry Advisory Group. TVS led the sector's campaign to secure digital spectrum and inclusion on the Freeview free-to-air platform. ==Identity history== * 2006–2012: You're Watching TVS * 2012–2015: A Different View ==See also== * Television broadcasting in Australia * Community television in Australia * Australian Community Television Alliance ==Notes== ==External links== * Official Website (archived site) * University of Western Sydney * Playbox Category:Australian community television Category:Television stations in Sydney Category:Television channels and stations established in 2006 Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2015 Category:English-language television stations in Australia Category:2006 establishments in Australia Category:2015 disestablishments in Australia Category:Defunct Australian television channels ","title":"Television Sydney"},{"id":"3262090","text":"Empress Bian, personal name unknown, was an empress of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China.

It was the top model of their final manual-focus SLR series before the introduction of the auto-focus Minolta Maxxum 7000. ==Features== The X-700 used the basic body of the XG-M with electronically controlled stepless speeds, but added full program autoexposure in addition to the XG-M's aperture priority and metered manual modes. This program mode was referred to as \\"MPS\\" or Minolta Program System. It also introduced through-the-lens (TTL) off the film flash metering in Aperture Priority or Program mode, which adjusted exposure and flash output automatically to produce a perfect exposure, without the user having to adjust anything at all, and added exposure lock and interchangeable focusing screens to the XG-M's features. The X-700 was aimed to appeal to the widest range of photographers possible. Its easy to use fully automated Program mode could turn it into a point-and-shoot that anybody could use, but its wide array of advanced features and available accessories and lenses made it appealing to professionals alike. Minolta later launched various other models based on the X-700 chassis : X-300 (X-370 for the North American market), X-300S, X-300N, X-500 (X-570 for the North American market) and X-600. The X-500 (X-570 in the North American market) lacked the X-700's program exposure mode and exposure compensation dial, but addressed one of the main complaints of X-700 users: the X-700 in fully manual mode only showed the recommended shutter speed by the meter in the viewfinderl this meant that to actually see what shutter speed was selected, the user had to take their eye off the viewfinder. Despite it being a small detail, many photographers preferred the X-500/570 which in fully manual mode showed both the recommended shutter speed and the selected one in the viewfinder. The X-500/570 also offered slower flash sync speeds than 1/60 of a second. http://www.rokkorfiles.com/X-570.htm http://www.rokkorfiles.com/X-700.html The X-300 also released in 1983 was the most basic model of X-series bodies. It lacked TTL flash metering, program exposure mode and the depth of field preview button, and it did not display the f-stop-setting of the lens in the viewfinder. Basic parts of all three cameras, such as the shutter, viewfinder, mirror system, and light metering system, were identical. Motivated by the huge success of the low-priced Canon AE-1 and other consumer-level cameras, Minolta followed suit in the new camera's design by offering a wide array of optional equipment, with the X-700 being the base of the \\"Minolta Program System\\" such as flashes, film winders, motor drives, data backs, multi function backs, power grips, wireless controllers etc. This lowered the budget for the camera's internal mechanism. In a step backwards, the new X-700 was not equipped with the fast vertical metal shutter of previous XE and XD cameras, and was instead fitted with a less expensive horizontal traverse silk shutter, enabling maximum sync speed of 1/60 second, and operated by an electromagnetic shutter release.Minolta Camera Co. Ltd., The Minolta X-700 Owner's Manual, Osaka, Japan (1982), p. 58 No mechanical shutter speed was provided, even in bulb mode. The resultant battery drain and inability to meter at light levels below EV-1 made the camera a poor choice for long exposures, as often needed for astrophotography. Minolta further lowered the price of the camera by fabricating certain parts in the film advance and rewind mechanism of less expensive materials, and by the use of less expensive electronic components. Even the rewind lever of the camera is made of plastic. ==History== In 1981, the X-700 was awarded the European \\"Camera of the Year\\". Its competitive pricing resulted in its becoming the most successful Minolta camera since the SRT line. In 1985 Minolta came out with their first autofocus cameras with the Maxxum / Alpha / Dynax series of cameras. This meant that further research and development of manual-focus 35mm SLR cameras was shelved and production of MF SR mount lenses and bodies was outsourced to a certain extent. Some internal components of the X-700 were changed over its long 18 year production run, such as the shutter capacitor which on early models was made from tantalum. Later on, due to rising costs of tantalum, Minolta decided to use cheaper materials which had the negative effect of stopping the shutter from firing. This fault also affects other X- series cameras, however the capacitor is easily replaced.http://www.twid.de/x700/http://pansfilmcameras.blogspot.com.es/2012/10/minolta-x-700.html Minolta was also one of the first major 35mm SLR manufacturer to outsource assembly of its cameras to countries outside Japan. They moved production of their X-300 to China in 1990, where the Seagull Camera factory took over production. In 1999, after 18 years in production, the X-700 was discontinued.

Historically, the two different meanings of magistrate have often overlapped and refer to, as the case may be, to a major political and administrative officer (usually at a subnational or colonial level) or a judge and barrister. ==Governing chief magistrates== If the jurisdiction he or she heads is considered to have statehood (sovereign or not), the official is generally its head of state and (in various degrees of authority) chief executive. However, the precise meaning depends upon the particular circumstances where it is given. ===European states=== Chief magistratures in antiquity include the following titles: *Consul *Dictator *Rex *Suffet Chief magistratures in the feudal era (and sometimes beyond) include the following titles: *Consul *Gonfaloniere *Lord Mayor, Mayor and various close equivalents such as Oberbürgermeister or Bürgermeister in German language, (Lord) Provost in Scotland *Podestà *Presidente del magistrato *Rettore \\"Chief magistrate\\" is also used as a generic term in English for the various offices in the role of head of state of the various Swiss (confederal) cantons, with such styles as Landamman. ===Colonial functions and titles=== *The Cayman Islands were part of the English, and later British, Empire since 18 July 1670. Initially part of Jamaica, they were proclaimed a crown colony on 4 July 1959, this Colony receiving its own Administrator and eventually a Governor. When the first permanent settlements were established, circa 1734, the highest colonial authority was styled Chief Magistrate. There were eight holders of the position until 1898, when the new post of Commissioner was created. *The Bay Islands, settled by the British in 1827, were claimed by Britain until 1860 as well as by their ultimate owner Honduras. Britain appointed two consecutive chief magistrates (William Fitzgibbon [acting] in 1850, and John James Hall, 1850-1852) before declaring the islands a crown colony under the Governor of Jamaica, represented locally by two consecutive Presiding Magistrates: Charles Henry Johnes Cuyler, 1852-1855, and Alexander Wilson Moir, 1855-1860. *In December 1832, the Port Cresson colony was founded by the Black Quakers of the New York and Pennsylvania Colonization Societies. After it was destroyed by Bassa natives in June 1835, it was reestablished the following month as Bassa Cove colony, which in 1837 annexed the Edina settlement, also formed by the New York and Pennsylvania Colonization Societies. Until its 1 April 1839 incorporation into Liberia, its de facto governors were styled Chief Magistrate. *Norfolk Island was since 1 November 1856 governed as a separate territory (subordinated to New South Wales), where on 8 June 1856 the Pitcairn islanders were resettled. The highest colonial authorities were its many consecutive chief magistrates, till its self- government was revoked on 15 January 1897; afterwards, administrators were appointed. *While Zululand was a separate British crown colony from 21 June 1887 until its 1 December 1897 incorporation into the Colony of Natal, it was nominally under the governorship of the British governors of Natal, but the highest colonial authority on the spot was titled Resident Commissioner and Chief Magistrate: **1887-1893 Sir Melmoth Osborn (1834-1899) **1893-1 December 1897 Sir Marshall James Clarke (1841-d. 1909) *When on 23 January 1894 South Zambesia (the future Southern Rhodesia, present Zimbabwe) was created from Mashonaland and Matabeleland protectorates (both had been privately owned by the British South Africa Company), it was administered by a Chief Magistrate of South Zambesia: **23 January 1894 - May 1894 Andrew Duncan (acting) **May 1894 - 9 September 1894 Leander Starr Jameson (b. 1853 - d. 1917), who stayed on as the first Administrator of the Rhodesia Protectorate (the 3 May 1895 union of South Zambesia and North Zambesia - present Zambia - as Rhodesia Protectorate). ===References to the U.S. presidency=== References to the President of the United States as \\"Chief Magistrate\\" were common in the early years of U.S. existence, although use of the term is rare today. In 1793, George Washington described himself as his country's \\"Chief Magistrate\\" in his second inaugural address. In 1800, Alexander Hamilton wrote in a private letter to Aaron Burr, later published by Burr with his permission, that he considered John Adams \\"unfit for the office of Chief Magistrate.\\" James Monroe told the 18th Congress, shortly before leaving office in a House report dated February 21, 1825, \\"By the duties of this office, the great interests of the nation are placed, in their most important branches, under the care of the Chief Magistrate.\\" Abraham Lincoln referred to the President as chief magistrate in his first inaugural address in 1861. In 1908, Woodrow Wilson remarked, \\"Men of ordinary physique and discretion cannot be Presidents and live, if the strain cannot be somehow relieved. We shall be obliged to always be picking our chief magistrates from among wise and prudent athletes, a small class.\\" Wilson was himself elected President four years later. ===British Lord Protector=== In the British Interregnum and during the existence of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, the Lord Protector was referred to as 'Chief Magistrate' in the state's two major constitutional documents: the Instrument of Government (1653) and the Humble Petition and Advice (1657). ==Judicial Chief Magistrates== Unlike the previous section, this does not require any political autonomy for the jurisdiction, so there can be additional circonscriptions, even created solely for the administration of justice. It is not uncommon for magistratures to perform additional functions separate from litigation and arbitration, rather as a registrar or notary, but as these are not their defining core-business, they are irrelevant in the context of this article. ===Sri Lanka=== In Sri Lanka, the Chief Magistrates Court in Colombo is the senior of the Magistrates Courts in the judicial division of Colombo.Judicial Service Commission Secretariat ==See also== *Chief justice ==Sources and references== *WorldStatesmen * Cornog, Evan and Whelan, Richard, Hats in the Ring: An Illustrated History of American Presidential Campaigns (Random House, N.Y. 2000) ==References== Category:Gubernatorial titles Category:Heads of state Category:Legal professions ","title":"Chief magistrate"},{"id":"3262123","text":"Crystal Clear may refer to: == Music and film == * Crystal Clear (Jaci Velasquez album), 2000 * Crystal Clear (David Dunn album), 2015 ** Crystal Clear (EP), a 2014 EP by David Dunn * \\"Crystal Clear\\", a 2003 song from Gallowsbird's Bark by The Fiery Furnaces * \\"Crystal Clear\\", a 2010 song from All Our Kings Are Dead by Young Guns * Crystal Clear, a 2000 short film by and with Jonathan Jackson * CLC (band), a South Korean girl group also known as CrystaL Clear == Other uses == * Crystal Clear (company), a Philippine brand of purified water * Crystal Clear, a computer icon set for Linux KDE ","title":"Crystal Clear"},{"id":"3262136","text":"Girindrasekhar Bose (30 January 1887 – 3 June 1953) was an early 20th-century South Asian psychoanalyst, the first president (1922–1953) of the Indian Psychoanalytic Society.Sudhir Kakar, 'Girindrasekhar Bose (1886-1953), International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis.

Friedrich Max Uhle (25 March 1856 – 11 May 1944) was a German archaeologist, whose work in Peru, Chile, Ecuador and Bolivia at the turn of the Twentieth Century had a significant impact on the practice of archaeology of South America. ==Biography== Uhle was born in Dresden, Germany on 25 March 1856 and received his Ph.D. in 1880 from the University of Leipzig. He married Charlotte Grosse from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he worked at the University of Pennsylvania for several years. Trained as a philologist, Uhle became interested in Peru while a curator at Dresden Museum. In 1888, a close friend, Alphons Stübel, who had recently published an article on the history of Peruvian archaeology, suggested Uhle concentrate his studies on that region. He first traveled to South America in 1892 to initiate research in Argentina and Bolivia for the Konigliches Museum fur Völkerkunde in Berlin, Germany. In that same year he published \\"The Ruins of Tiahuanaco in the Highlands of Ancient Peru,\\" with photographer and engineer B. von Grumbkow. This extensive work is considered the first in depth scientific account of the ancient site of Tiwanaku, Bolivia. Uhle returned to South America in 1896, now sponsored by the American Exploration Society in Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. He also enjoyed the patronage of Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, the mother of William Randolph Hearst. He undertook excavations at Pachacamac, near the coast of Peru, and on Mochica and Chimu sites. His site report of work at Pachacamac was highly praised and is still used as a basic text for studying South American archaeology. He recognized versions of Tiwanaku stone sculpture imagery on ceramics, textiles, and other artifacts in these coastal sites. On this trip, he recovered approximately 9,000 artifacts spanning over 3,000 years of Andean pre-history. These included Nazca pottery, shells, textiles, metals, objects made of wood and other plant material, and objects constructed of animal materials such as feathers, bone, and leather. He concentrated on the dating of these artifacts, and established a system primarily based on textile design. Artifacts found in the Mocha Valley were dated based on the sequential position of Inca ceramic styles. This early dating was later advanced by American archaeologist Alfred Kroeber and is one of the key points in understanding the chronology of pre-Inca Peru. Uhle later worked in the highlands of Bolivia, Ecuador, and Chile. In 1917 he was the first to scientifically describe the Chinchorro mummies. Max Ulhe also participated in numerous paleontological excavations. In 1926, Max Uhle and paleontologist, Franz Spillmann, excavated, about 12 km east of Quito, Ecuador, an almost complete mastodon skeleton, together with associated obsidian and bone tools and about 150 potsherds. Uhle also made a notable contribution to North American archaeology in excavations of the Emeryville shell-mound in San Francisco Bay, California. The German-Peruvian Max Uhle School in Arequipa, Peru was named after him. ==Bibliography== * Pachacámac (1903). * La esfera de influencia del país de los incas (1908). * Las relaciones prehistóricas entre el Perú y la Argentina (1912). * Los orígenes de los incas (1912). * Die Ruinen von Moche (1913). * Las fortalezas incaicas de Incallacta y Machupicchu (1917) * Los principios de las antiguas civilizaciones peruanas (1920). * Los principios de las civilizaciones en la sierra peruana (1920). * Las antiguas civilizaciones del Perú frente a la arqueología e historia del continente americano (1935). ==See also== * Martin Gusinde Anthropological Museum ==References== ==External links== * Category:1856 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Andean scholars Category:Archaeologists from Dresden Category:Archaeologists of California Category:Incan scholars ","title":"Max Uhle"},{"id":"3262156","text":"Waltz Waltz is one of the five dances in the Standard (or Modern) category of the International Style ballroom dances. It was previously referred to as slow waltz or English waltz. Waltz is usually the first dance in the dancesport competition rounds. It is danced exclusively in the closed position, unlike its American Style counterpart. ==History== The Waltz originated as a folk dance from Austria. Predecessors include the matenick and a variation called the furiant that were performed during rural festivals in Bohemia. The French dance, \\"Walt\\", and the Austrian Ländler are the most similar to the waltz among its predecessors. The \\"king of dances\\" acquired different national traits in different countries. Thus there appeared the English waltz, the Hungarian waltz, and the waltz-mazurka. The word \\"waltz\\" is derived from the old German word \\"walzen\\" meaning \\"to roll, turn\\", or \\"to glide\\". Waltz has been danced competitively since 1923 or 1924. ==Music== International Standard Waltz is a waltz dance and danced to slow waltz music, preferably 28 to 30 bars per minute (84 to 90 beats per minute).http://www.worlddancesport.org/doc/competition/rules%20and%20bidding/2010/IDSF_Competition_Rules_2010-1.pdfWDC Competition Rules Waltz music is in 3/4 time and the first beat of a measure is strongly accented.BallroomDancers.com ==Character== Like all Standard category dances, waltz is a progressive dance, meaning that dancers travel along a path known as the line of dance, that is counter-clockwise around the floor. It is characterized by pendulum swing movements and incorporates general elements of ballroom technique such as foot parallelism, rise and fall, contra body movement and sway. Figures can have one step per beat (three per measure) but also four, five or six steps per measure. The faster pace of the latter, especially when combined with dance turns, results in fast-paced, dynamic dancing despite the relatively slow music tempo. Slow steps and elegant poses are often used to contrast fast-paced dance segments, resulting in what is sometimes referred to as light and shade. ==Syllabus== This is the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing (ISTD) International Standard syllabus.The Ballroom Technique; Moore, Alex (2006).

The red and blue beams each undergo one total internal reflection at the air gap and air–glass boundary respectively, while the other reflections are dichroic. This construction has the advantage over the above type that all 3 separated images are laterally inverted (as with a single sensor). In the first type, the blue image is not laterally inverted but the other two are. A 3CCD imaging block consisting of a color separation prism of Philips type on which 3 CCDs are mounted A three-CCD (3CCD) camera is a camera whose imaging system uses three separate charge-coupled devices (CCDs), each one receiving filtered red, green, or blue color ranges. Light coming in from the lens is split by a complex prism into three beams, which are then filtered to produce colored light in three color ranges or \\"bands\\". The system is employed by high quality still cameras, telecine systems, professional video cameras and some prosumer video cameras. ==Overview== Compared to cameras with only one CCD, three-CCD cameras generally provide superior image quality by using full-frame dichroic filters to better separate the red, green and blue color bands, and better low-light performance. By separating red, green, and blue color ranges with a 1:1 pixel ratio (known as \\"4:4:4\\"), three-CCD cameras achieve much better precision than single-CCD cameras. In contrast, almost all single-CCD cameras use a Bayer filter, using less accurate dye filters in front of each pixel to separate the colors. Because each pixel on a single CCD sensor is covered with its own tiny color filter, a frame is necessary to keep the dye filters from leaking into adjacent pixels. The result is less light absorbed compared to a CCD without a Bayer filter. Typically there is a 2:1 ratio of green and red/blue pixels, producing less color detail. Three-CCD cameras are more expensive than single-CCD cameras because they use three sensors rather than one, and because they use a beam splitter to drive each of the three CCD chips. Additionally most 3CCD cameras use higher quality but more expensive dichroic filters to separate the color bands. The Minolta RD-175 introduced in 1995 is one of the earliest dSLR cameras and has 3CCD technology. ==See also== * Dichroic filter * Thin-film optics * Minolta RD-175 ==References== 3 monochrome sensors and color separation prism from Sony DCR-VX100E camera ==External links== * Diagram of the Philips prism and variations * Prism-Based Color Separation for Professional Digital Photography Category:Digital photography Category:Image sensors ","title":"Three-CCD camera"},{"id":"3262170","text":"Detail from one of the surviving seals of Waleran de Beaumont, showing chequy proto-heraldryCokayne, The Complete Peerage, new edition, Vol. XII, Part 1, Appendix J, \\"The Warenne Group of Chequered Shields\\", pp.26–9 Proto-heraldic arms shown on seals of Waleran de Beaumont and borne by his descendants: Chequy or and gules. These are a difference of the proto-heraldic arms adopted by his maternal uncle Ralph, Count of Vermandois Chequy or and azure, borne in differenced forms by Waleran's siblings and uterine half-siblings (and their descendants), including by Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester; William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey; and by Waleran de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Warwick, his nephew (son of his uterine half-sister Gundred de Warenne). Waleran de Beaumont, Count of Meulan, 1st Earl of Worcester (1104 - 9 April 1166, Preaux), was the son of Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester and Elizabeth de Vermandois, and the twin brother of Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester. He is not referred to by any surname in a contemporary document other than 'Waleran son of Count Robert'. ==Early life== Waleran was born in 1104, the elder of twin sons of Robert de Beaumont, count of Meulan, who was also to become earl of Leicester in 1107. On their father's death in June 1118, the boys came into the wardship of King Henry I of England. They remained in his care till late in 1120 when they were declared adult and allowed to succeed to their father's lands by a division already arranged between the king and their father before his death. By the arrangement, Waleran succeeded to the county of Meulan upriver on the Seine from the Norman border, and the principal family Norman honors of Beaumont-le-Roger and Pont Audemer. His great possessions included the forest of Brotonne, which was centred on his castle of Vatteville on the left bank of the Seine. As part of the family arrangement, Waleran also received a large estate in Dorset centred on the manor of Sturminster Marshall. == Rebellion and Imprisonment == Late in 1122, Waleran was drawn into a conspiracy with Amaury III of Montfort, count of Évreux, in support of the claimant to Normandy, William Clito, son of Robert Curthose. The king however detected the conspiracy, and Waleran and his young colleagues were caught unawares by a preemptive strike by the king's army against the rebel centre of Montfort-sur-Risle. Waleran rallied and based his resistance to the king at his castle of Brionne. In October 1123, he lost his fortress of Pont Audemer on the Norman coast to a siege, despite calling in military help from his French relations and allies. After a winter of raiding, on 25 March 1124, Waleran proceeded to the relief of his castle of Vatteville, with his three brothers-in-law, Hugh de Châteauneuf, Hugh de Montfort and William, Lord of Bréval. The returning column was intercepted by a force of knights and soldiers of Henry I's household between Bourgtheroulde and Boissy-le-Châtel, the royal commander being given variously as William de Tancarville or Odo Borleng. The royal household troops decisively defeated Waleran in the Battle of Bourgthéroulde when he attempted a mounted charge at the head of his men, shooting their horses from under them. Waleran's remaining castles continued to resist until 16 April 1124 when Waleran was forced by the king to order his seneschal Morin du Pin to surrender them. Waleran's lands were seized and he was imprisoned first at Rouen, then at Bridgnorth in Shropshire and finally at Wallingford Castle. Waleran was released for unknown reasons in 1129. He resumed an active role at court and he and his twin brother were both present at Henry's deathbed. He was probably involved in the discussions of the Norman magnates in December 1135 as to who should succeed to Normandy and England. == Lieutenant of Normandy == The accession of Stephen may have taken him by surprise but he had already offered his allegiance to the new king before Easter 1136. At the court he was betrothed to the king's infant daughter, Matilda, and received the city and county of Worcester as her marriage portion. After Easter he went to Normandy taking authority from the king to act as his lieutenant in the duchy. In September he commanded the army of Norman magnates which repelled the invasion by Geoffrey of Anjou, husband of the Empress Matilda, daughter of Henry I. He was also able to capture the chief rebel Roger de Toeni. He remained there until the following spring and then returned to England. The next year he attended the king on his tour of Normandy, crossed back to England with him at the end of the year, by which time he was beginning to undermine the previous ascendancy at court of the bishops of Winchester and Salisbury. He and his family began to monopolise favour and patronage at Stephen's court and they alienated the faction headed by Earl Robert of Gloucester, who in retaliation adopted the cause of his half-sister, the Empress. In June 1138, Waleran was in Normandy to confront successfully again an invading Angevin army. Waleran used his extensive connections at the French court to mobilize a large force of French knights to assist him. It was probably in 1138 that he received the second title of Earl of Worcester. He founded the Cistercian abbey of Bordesley at the end of that year to mark his arrival in the county. The same year his youngest brother Hugh received the earldom of Bedford and other relations were similarly honoured. Before Easter 1139, Waleran was in Paris on an embassy to his cousin, the new King Louis VII of France. On his return he was the motivating force behind the overthrow of the court faction headed by the justiciar, Bishop Roger of Salisbury. The bishop and his family were arrested in June, and their wealth and many of their possessions confiscated. ==Civil war== With the arrival of Robert of Gloucester in England in September 1139, the civil war between Stephen and Matilda's supporters got under way. One of the first attacks Gloucester sponsored was an assault on Waleran's English base at Worcester. The city was attacked and sacked on 7 November 1139. Waleran retaliated savagely against the rebel centers of Sudeley and Tewkesbury. Waleran was present at the Battle of Lincoln in 1141. He was one of the royalist earls who fled when they saw that the battle was lost. Waleran escaped, but the king was captured and imprisoned at Bristol. Waleran fought on for several months, probably basing himself at Worcester, where he had to deal with the defection of his sheriff, William de Beauchamp. It may have been at this time that he seized and fortified the Herefordshire Beacon for the bishop of Hereford complained of his lordship of this castle in 1148. At last late in the summer of 1141 Waleran gave up the struggle as news reached him that his Norman lands were being taken over by the invading Angevin army. He surrendered to the Empress Matilda, and had to accept her appropriation of the abbey of Bordesley as it had been founded on a royal estate. However, once in Normandy, Waleran was accepted at the court of Geoffrey of Anjou, and his lands in England and Normandy were confirmed to him. His first marriage, to the king's daughter Matilda, had ended with the child's death in London in 1137. Around the end of 1142, Waleran married Agnes, daughter of Amaury de Montfort, count of Évreux. As a result of the marriage he obtained estates in the Pays de Caux and the lordship of Gournay-sur-Marne in the Ile de France. Waleran had already obtained his mother's marriage portion of the honor of Elbeuf on the Seine on her death in or around 1139. Despite the political reverses on 1141, Waleran was considerably wealthier at the end of the year than he had been at the beginning. Waleran served with Geoffrey of Anjou at the siege of Rouen in 1143/4. During it he captured and burnt the suburb of Emendreville and the Church of St. Sever, where many of both sexes perished in the flames. He consolidated his position as leader of the Norman nobility by a formal treaty with his cousin Robert du Neubourg, seneschal of Normandy. However, Waleran seems to have turned his mind to the French court at this time. In 1144–1145, he left France to be on a pilgrimage to Camino de Santiago. In Easter 1146, he was at Vézelay for the preaching of the Second Crusade and attended the great assembly of magnates at Paris from April to June 1147 to meet the pope and Louis VII. On 29 June, he was joint leader of the Anglo-Norman crusaders on their rendezvous with Louis VII at Worms. He accompanied the crusades to Syria, and its unfortunate conclusion before Damascus, where he also received criticism for his role there. He seems to have left Palestine before King Louis, taking the sea voyage home. He was shipwrecked somewhere on his return, perhaps on the coast of Provence. He promised to build an abbey of Cistercians if he survived the wreck, and in due course he built the abbey of St Mary de Voto (of the Vow) or Le Valasse in fulfilment of his vow. == Political decline == In 1149, Waleran started to lose favor with King Stephen, and was gradually excluded from power in Normandy, as his influence waned with the coming of age of Duke Henry and Geoffrey Plantagenet. Waleran's great influence in Normandy survived till 1151, but the new regime of Duke Henry was not sympathetic to him. He made the fatal error of temporising with the Capetian court and assisting the campaigns of Louis VII, his overlord for Meulan. Though his support gained Waleran the hugely profitable wardship of the great county of Vermandois during the minority of his young cousin Count Ralph II, it also led to his downfall. In the second half of 1153, he was ambushed by his nephew and enemy Robert de Montfort, who held him captive in the castle of Orbec, due to his link with Louis VII, while his Norman and English estates were stripped from Waleran by Duke Henry's friends and officers. The earldom of Worcester was suppressed and his Worcestershire castles destroyed in 1155. Although Waleran was released, his power in Normandy was broken, and an attempt to reclaim Montfort-sur-Risle from his nephew was a humiliating failure. Waleran was an outsider at the court of Henry II, and between 1160 and 1162 lost his Norman lands and castles when he supported Louis VII against Henry II. His last years were eked out as a landowner and justice in the duchy. The last notice of his activities is a settlement of his affairs relating to his priory of Gournay-sur-Marne around the end of 1165. Twenty days before his death he entered the abbey of St Peter of Préaux, the ancestral abbey of his family south of Pont Audemer in Normandy, and died as a monk there on 9 or 10 April 1166. He was buried in its chapter house alongside several other members of his dynasty. == Aristocrat and humanist == Waleran was an important twelfth-century character in ways other than political. He was a literate man educated in the liberal arts and philosophy. The elegy to him by Stephen of Rouen, monk of Bec-Hellouin, reveals that he composed Latin verse. In 1142, he tells us that he personally researched the deeds in the archive of Meulan priory before confirming its possessions. Like his twin brother, he also seems to have been an assiduous writer of letters and a number of them survive. He was also a literary patron, as Geoffrey of Monmouth dedicated the earliest edition of his History of the Kings of Britain to him in 1136. Waleran founded Cistercian abbeys at Bordesley, Worcestershire (1139), and Le Valasse, Normandy (c.1150), though in both cases the abbeys were taken over by the king. He was a generous patron of the two ancestral Benedictine monasteries of Préaux (St Peter for men and St Leger for women). He was besides accepted as advocate of the abbey of Bec- Hellouin, and was patron of its priory at Meulan, founding another at Beaumont-le-Roger. He founded a Benedictine priory at Gournay-sur-Marne. He endowed a major hospital at Pont Audemer, which still survives. ==Family and children== He married, firstly, Matilda, daughter of King Stephen of England and Matilda of Boulogne, Countess de Boulogne, circa March 1136. She died in 1137 aged only four. He married, secondly, Agnes de Montfort, daughter of Amaury III de Montfort, Count of Évreux, and Agnes de Garlande, c. 1141. He had children with Agnes de Montfort (the boys as they appear in order in his 1165 charter to Gournay priory): #Robert de Beaumont, Count of Meulan. #Isabelle de Meulan (d. 10 May 1220), married twice: ##ca 1161 Geoffroy, lord of Mayenne; ##ca 1170 Maurice II, lord of Craon. #Waleran de Meulan #Amaury de Meulan, lord of Gournay-sur-Marne. #Roger de Meulan or Beaumont, viscount of Évreux. #Raoul (Ralph) de Meulan. #Etienne (Stephen) de Meulan. #Marie de Meulan, married Hugh Talbot, Baron of Cleuville ==See also== *The Anarchy ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * *Cokayne, G.E.; Vicary Gibbs, H.A.

Chase was prolific – with a career bridging the graphic design field's transition from the analog to the digital era, working with clients ranging from Selena and Prince to Mattel and Procter & Gamble. ==Early life and education== Margo Chase was born on February 20, 1958 in San Gabriel, CA. Chase grew up surrounded by the arts — both parents were musically-inclined, and Chase's mother was an accomplished calligrapher: \\"I grew up watching her make beautiful forms with strange pens and brushes.\\" Chase attended California Polytechnic, San Luis Obispo where she studied Biology with the intention of becoming a veterinarian. Wishing to bolster her GPA with an eye towards graduate school Chase began taking a variety of art classes, soon exhausting her options in CalPoly's arts department, leaving only an illustration class. What began as a quest for an easy 'A' lead her to abandon her veterinary aspirations for a career in medical illustration.Gilman (1994). Upon graduating with her B.S., Chase attended the University of California, San Francisco's medical illustration program though she dropped out after a year, citing boredom.Gilman (1994). == Work and career == Selection of materials designed for Matteo Linens by Margo Chase With a portfolio of medical illustrations, Chase found work at a small advertising firm in Long Beach, designing packaging for the Ralph's grocery store chain. She was soon hired away by Rosebud Books to design a series of tourist guidebooks. During this time, Chase met Laura LaPuma, who would go on to give her her first album cover design job at Warner Brothers Records.Gilman (1994), 39. As she accumulated more design work, Chase set up an office in her Silverlake home, hiring Nancy Ogami and studio manager Robert Short to assist in servicing clients such as Geffen Records, Virgin Records, and others. Chase designed logos for Prince's Lovesexy, as well as his Paisley Park production company. Attracting enough positive attention, she was asked to design the logo – and eventually the packaging – for Madonna's 1989 album Like a Prayer. This opened the door for other high-profile projects such as Cher's Love Hurts, the poster campaign for 1992's Bram Stoker's Dracula, and others.Bucher (2005), 114. Chase's work from this period of her career was quite distinct, taking inspiration from a wide variety of sources – calligraphy, illuminated manuscripts, and medieval architecture – leading publications to refer to her as the \\"Queen of Goth.\\" Wary of being aesthetically pigeonholed, she took on work for linen manufacturer Matteo. What initially began as a logo and stationary design project morphed into full-blown textile and product design.Bucher (2005), 117. During this time, Chase expanded her studio – hiring designer Terry Stone to help her launch into motion picture titles, as well as market her typographic work as a separate venture called \\"Gravy Fonts.\\" After working with clients across the entertainment industry, Chase decided that she was a print designer at heart and turned her attention to packaging design, stating, \\"What I like about designing print or packaging is that when the job is finished there is something physical to show for it – it's timeless. With the broadcast work, once it's been seen, it's already old.\\" Moving into the 2000s Chase, under the auspices of the Chase Design Group (formed 1997), previously known as Margo Chase Design (formed 1986), tackled branding and packaging for such varied clients as CVS, Procter & Gamble, Califia Farms, and others. ==Personal life== Chase had a keen interest in piloting and aerobatics. Introduced to the sport through her father, she likened it to drawing in the sky. In 2008, Chase married Patrick Dugan, her flight instructor. An active member of the International Aerobatics Club, she participated in many club competitions. She died in a plane crash on July 22, 2017. ==Awards and accolades== Chase received numerous awards and accolades throughout her career. Graphic Design USA named her as one of the \\"most influential graphic designers of the era,\\" placing her in the company of Saul Bass, Massimo Vignelli, and Paula Scher. The magazine also listed her eponymous studio among the \\"most influential design firm[s] of the era.\\"Staff (2006), 17. ==References== ==External links== *Chase Design Group *Gravy Fonts Category:1958 births Category:2017 deaths Category:American graphic designers Category:Women graphic designers Category:California Polytechnic State University alumni Category:California Institute of the Arts faculty Category:Art Center College of Design faculty Category:People from Los Angeles ","title":"Margo Chase"},{"id":"3262179","text":"Cobham's thesis, also known as Cobham–Edmonds thesis (named after Alan Cobham and Jack Edmonds), asserts that computational problems can be feasibly computed on some computational device only if they can be computed in polynomial time; that is, if they lie in the complexity class P. In modern terms, it identifies tractable problems with the complexity class P. Formally, to say that a problem can be solved in polynomial time is to say that there exists an algorithm that, given an n-bit instance of the problem as input, can produce a solution in time O(nc), the letter O is big-O notation and c is a constant that depends on the problem but not the particular instance of the problem. Alan Cobham's 1965 paper entitled \\"The intrinsic computational difficulty of functions\\" is one of the earliest mentions of the concept of the complexity class P, consisting of problems decidable in polynomial time. Cobham theorized that this complexity class was a good way to describe the set of feasibly computable problems. Jack Edmonds's 1965 paper \\"Paths, trees, and flowers\\" is also credited with identifying P with tractable problems. ==Limitations== The graph shows time of solution of problem in milliseconds (msec) vs. problem size, n, for knapsack problems solved by a state-of-the-art specialized algorithm using a 933 MHz Pentium III computer (average of 100 instances, data from:D. Pisinger, 2003. \\"Where are the hard knapsack problems?\\" Technical Report 2003/08, Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark, see , accessed 31 January 2015.). The fit of the quadratic equation suggests that empirical algorithmic complexity for instances with 50–10,000 variables is O((log n)2) despite having exponential worst-case complexity estimate in theory. While Cobham's thesis is an important milestone in the development of the theory of computational complexity, it has limitations as applied to practical feasibility of algorithms. The thesis essentially states that \\"P\\" means \\"easy, fast, and practical,\\" while \\"not in P\\" means \\"hard, slow, and impractical.\\" But this is not always true, because the thesis abstracts away some important variables that influence the runtime in practice: * It ignores constant factors and lower-order terms. * It ignores the size of the exponent. The time hierarchy theorem proves the existence of problems in P requiring arbitrarily large exponents. * It ignores the typical size of the input. All three are related, and are general complaints about analysis of algorithms, but they particularly apply to Cobham's thesis since it makes an explicit claim about practicality. Under Cobham's thesis, a problem for which the best algorithm takes n100 instructions is considered feasible, and a problem with an algorithm that takes 20.00001 n instructions infeasible--even though one could never solve an instance of size n = 2 with the former algorithm, whereas an instance of the latter problem of size n = 106 could be solved without difficulty. In fields where practical problems have millions of variables (such as Operations Research or Electronic Design Automation), even O(n3) algorithms are often impractical. ==References== Category:Computational complexity theory ","title":"Cobham's thesis"},{"id":"3262182","text":"In the Roman Catholic Church, protonotary apostolic (PA; Latin: protonotarius apostolicus) is the title for a member of the highest non-episcopal college of prelates in the Roman Curia or, outside Rome, an honorary prelate on whom the Pope has conferred this title and its special privileges. An example is Prince Georg of Bavaria (1880–1943), who became in 1926 Protonotary by papal decree. ==History== In late antiquity, there were in Rome seven regional notaries who, on the further development of the papal administration and the accompanying increase of the notaries, remained the supreme palace notaries of the papal chancery (notarii apostolici or protonotarii). In the Middle Ages, the protonotaries were very high papal officials and were often raised directly from this office to the cardinalate. Originally numbering seven, Pope Sixtus V (1585–90) increased their number to twelve. Their importance gradually diminished, and at the time of the French Revolution, the office had almost entirely disappeared. On 8 February 1838, Pope Gregory XVI re-established the college of real protonotaries with seven members called protonotarii de numero participantium, also known as numerary protonotaries, because they shared in the revenues, as officials of the Roman Chancery. Since the sixteenth century, the popes had also appointed honorary protonotaries, who enjoyed the same privileges as the seven real members of the college; and titular protonotaries, who held a corresponding position in the administration of the episcopal ordinariate or in the collegiate chapter. By the motu proprio Inter multiplices of 21 February 1905, Pope Pius X defined the position of the protonotaries, ... privileges, dress, and insignia of the members of the four classes: *the protonotarii apostolici de numero participantium, members 'within the number' of the college of prelates, who exercised their office in connection with the acts of consistories and canonizations, had a representative in the Congregation of the Propaganda, and, according to the reorganization of the Curia by the Constitution \\"Sapienti consilio\\" of 29 June 1908, signed the papal Bulls instead of the earlier abbreviatores. They enjoyed the use of pontificals and numerous privileges, and also, after examining the candidates, named annually a fixed number of doctors of theology and of canon law; *the protonotarii apostolici supranumerarii, a dignity to which only the canons of the four Roman patriarchal basilica majors (the Lateran, St. Peter's, St. Mary Major, St. Paul Outside the Walls), and of cathedral chapters outside Rome to which the privilege had been granted, could be raised; *the protonotarii apostolici ad instar (sc. participantium), who were appointed by the pope and had the same external insignia as the real protonotaries; *the protonotarii titulares seu honorarii, who were found outside Rome, and who received this dignity from the nuncios or as a special privilege. ==Present practice== Since 1969 (following Pope Paul VI's issuing of two motus proprios, Pontificalis Domus of March 28, 1968 and Pontificalia Insignia of June 21, 1968), the four classes are reduced to two: *Apostolic protonotaries de numero—who continue the work of the College of Protonotaries and still have certain duties with regard to papal documents; they may be addressed formally as \\"Most Reverend Sir or Monsignor (in Italian: Reverendissimo Signore, Monsignore)\\", and they may wear the mantelletta, the purple choir cassock and rochet for liturgical services, the black cassock with red piping and purple fascia at other times, and may add the purple ferraiuolo and the biretta with red tuft to the black cassock for formal ceremonies of a non-liturgical nature (e.g., a graduation). *Apostolic protonotaries supernumerary—The title is awarded to priests by the pope, however the title is purely honorary and is not attached to any duties in the Curia. This is the type of protonotary found outside Rome, and it is considered the highest grade of monsignor found in most dioceses. Priests so honored are addressed as \\"reverend monsignor\\", may put the post-nominal letters \\"P.A.\\" after their names, may wear the purple choir cassock (with rochet) for liturgical services, the black cassock with red piping and purple sash at other times, and may add the purple ferraiuolo to this for formal non- liturgical ceremonies, but use none of the other accoutrements mentioned above. This title will no longer be bestowed by the Pope , except in the case of the Ordinaries of the three Personal Ordinariates who are not to be made bishops (because they are married), but all existing supernumerary protonotaries are allowed to keep their titles. The name of the prothonotary warbler derives from the supposed similarity between its plumage and the golden robes worn by protonotaries.

The railway was finished as far as Alice Springs on 6 August 1929, and as far as Darwin in 2003. The Australian Overland Telegraph Line was a telegraph line that connected Darwin with Port Augusta in South Australia. Completed in 1872, the Overland Telegraph Line allowed fast communication between Australia and the rest of the world. An additional section was added in 1877 with the completion of the Western Australian section of the line. It was one of the great engineering feats of 19th-century AustraliaW.A. Crowder's diary: the Overland Telegraph Line National Library of Australia. and probably the most significant milestone in the history of telegraphy in Australia. ==Conception and competition== Planting the first pole on the Overland Telegraph line to Carpentaria. By 1855 speculation had intensified about possible routes for the connection of Australia to the new telegraph cable in Java and thus Europe. Among the routes under consideration were either Ceylon to Albany in Western Australia, or Java to the north coast of Australia and then either onto east coast, or south through the centre of the continent to Adelaide.Exploring the Stuart Highway : further than the eye can see, 1997, p. 24 Competition between the colonies over the route was fierce. The Victorian government organised an expedition led by Burke and Wills to cross the continent from Menindee to the Gulf of Carpentaria in 1860. Although the route was traversed, the expedition ended in disaster. The South Australian government recognised the economic benefits that would result from becoming the centre of the telegraph network. It offered a reward of £2000 to encourage an expedition to find a route between South Australia and the north coast. John McDouall Stuart had meanwhile also been endeavouring to cross the continent starting from the northern Flinders Ranges, and was successful on his sixth attempt in 1862. James Chambers had gained an interest in the concept of a telegraph line across the outback. Chambers paid the costs for Stuart's expeditions into northern Australia. Stuart had the proposed telegraph line in mind as he travelled across the desert, noting the best places for river crossings, sources of timber for telegraph poles, and water supplies. On 24 July, his expedition finally reached the north coast at a place Stuart named Chambers Bay, after his employer and sponsor. South Australian Governor Richard MacDonnell gave his strong support to the project. In 1863 an Order in Council transferred Northern Territory to South Australia, aiming to secure land for an international telegraph connection. Now with a potential route, South Australia strengthened her position for the telegraph line in 1865 when Parliament authorised the construction of a telegraph line between Adelaide and Port Augusta, 300 km to the north. This move provoked outrage in Queensland amongst advocates of the Darwin–Burketown route. The final contract was secured in 1870 when the South Australian government agreed to construct 3200 km of line to Darwin, while the British-Australian Telegraph Company promised to lay the undersea cable from Banyuwangi, Java to Darwin. The latter was to be finished on 31 December 1871, and severe penalties were to apply if the connecting link was not ready. ==Construction== The South Australian Superintendent of Telegraphs, Charles Todd, was appointed head of the project, and devised a timetable to complete the immense project on schedule. Todd had built South Australia's first telegraph line and extended it to Melbourne. The contract stipulated a total cost of no more than £128,000 and two years' construction time. He divided the route into three sections, each of : northern and southern sections to be handled by private contractors, and a central section which would be constructed by his own department. The telegraph line would comprise more than 30,000 wrought iron poles, insulators, batteries, wire and other equipment, ordered from England.Exploring the Stuart Highway : further than the eye can see, 1997, p. 25 The poles were placed 80 m apart and repeater stations built every 250 km. Planting the first telegraph pole, near Palmerston (Darwin) in September 1870. Todd appointed staff to whom the contractors would be responsible: Explorer, John Ross; Surveyor, William Harvey; Overseer of Works, Northern Territory, William McMinn; Sub-Overseer, R. C. Burton; Operators, James Lawrence Stapleton (murdered 1874 at Barrow Creek) and Andrew Howley. Surveyors and Overseers, central portion of line: A. T. Woods, Gilbert McMinn, and Richard Randall Knuckey; Overseer, James Beckwith; Sub-Overseers, J. F. Roberts (perhaps J. Le M. F. Roberts), Stephen Jarvis, W. W. Mills, W. Charles Musgrave, and Christopher Giles. He assembled a team of men for his central section: surveyors, linesmen, carpenters, labourers and cooks. The team left Adelaide with horses, bullocks and carts loaded with provisions and equipment for many weeks. The central section would be surveyed by the explorer John Ross and Alfred Giles, his second-in-command. The southern section from Port Augusta to Alberga Creek was contracted to Edward Meade Bagot. Darwent & Dalwood, who won the contract for the northern section of , arrived in Port Darwin aboard in September 1870 with 80 men, 80 draught horses, bullocks, equipment and stores. Stephen King Jr. was their surveyor and explorer. The northern line was progressing well until the onset of the wet season in November 1870. Heavy rain of up to a day waterlogged the ground and made it impossible for work to progress. With conditions worsening, the men went on strike on 7 March 1871, rancid food and disease-spreading mosquitoes amongst their complaints. On 3 May 1871, Overseer of Works William McMinnPapers of G.R. McMinn held by State Records of South Australia GRG 35/360Diary of G.R. McMinn, Surveyor and Overseer during construction of the Overland Telegraph Line to Port Darwin held by State Records of South Australia GRG 154/9 cancelled Darwent & Dalwood's contract and sent all the workers back to Adelaide, on the basis of insufficient progress (they had erected poles to a distance of and strung wire for to that date) and the insurrection of the men. This last, the workers claimed, was exaggerated; they only refused to work after they had been sacked. These actions were certainly within his powers, and spelled out in the contract, but he was dismissed on his return to Adelaide in July 1871. Joseph Darwent had protested the original appointment of McMinn, who had submitted a losing tender, but was overruled. William T. Dalwood was eventually awarded compensation of £11,000. The South Australian Government was now forced to construct an extra 700 km of line, and threw every available resource into its completion, down to purchasing horses and hiring men from New South Wales. It was another six months before reinforcements led by engineer Robert PattersonOfficial journal of Robert C. Patterson, Engineer in charge of construction of the northern section of the Overland Telegraph Line held by State Records of South Australia GRG 154/9 arrived in Darwin. As the central and southern sections neared completion, Patterson decided to take a different strategy with the construction of the northern section. It was divided into four sub-sections with the majority of the men on the most northerly section.Exploring the Stuart Highway : further than the eye can see, 1997, p. 26 The undersea cable was finished earlier than expected, with the line from Java reaching Darwin on 18 November 1871 and being connected the following day.

S. Low, Marston, Searle & Rivington, Limited and a repeater station built in 1872.1880 photograph caption Because of the problems still facing the northern section, the Queensland Superintendent of Telegraphs called for the abandonment of the project, and for the line to connect to the terminal at Burketown, but Todd was adamant and pressed on. By the end of the year there was still over 300 km of line to erect, but the line was substantially in use from May 1872 by the expedient of carrying messages by horse or camel across the uncompleted section. During this time, Todd began visiting workers along the line to lift their spirits. The message he sent along the incomplete line on 22 May 1872, took 9 days to reach Adelaide. ==Completion== Alice Springs, Running more than seven months behind schedule, the two lines were finally joined at Frew's Ponds on Thursday, 22 August 1872.Exploring the Stuart Highway : further than the eye can see, 1997, p. 27 Todd was given the honour of sending the first message along the completed line: :WE HAVE THIS DAY, WITHIN TWO YEARS, COMPLETED A LINE OF COMMUNICATIONS TWO THOUSAND MILES LONG THROUGH THE VERY CENTRE OF AUSTRALIA, UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO A TERRA INCOGNITA BELIEVED TO BE A DESERT +++ After the first messages had been exchanged over the new line, Todd was accompanied by surveyor Richard Randall Knuckey on the return journey from Central Mount Stuart to Adelaide. The line proved an immediate success in opening the Northern Territory; gold discoveries were made in several places along the northern section (in particular Pine Creek), and the repeater stations in the MacDonnell Ranges proved invaluable starting points for explorers like Ernest Giles, W. C. Gosse, and Peter Egerton-Warburton who were heading west. Within the first year of operations 4000 telegrams were transmitted. Maintenance was an ongoing and mammoth task, with floods often destroying poles. Tennant Creek converted into telephone circuits. In February 1875, a small contingent of Overland Telegraph employees left Port Darwin for Adelaide on the ill-fated SS Gothenburg. A few days later, at least ten were among the hundred-odd who lost their lives after she encountered a severe storm, and was driven into the Great Barrier Reef and sank.The Wreck of the Gothenburg (1875). On her voyage from Port Darwin to Adelaide. Printed by J.H. Lewis, Printer & Publisher, Adelaide. The final stage of connecting Australia to the world was begun in 1875 when the Western Australian and South Australian governments agreed to build a line across the Nullarbor plain. This equally challenging project was completed in 1877. Around 1871, a second cable connected Java with an overland line from Perth to Cable Station, Roebuck Bay. When Darwin was bombed in World War II the line was deliberately cut just before the attack. In 2008, its engineering heritage was recognised by the installation of markers provided by the Engineers Australia's Engineering Heritage Recognition Program at a location in Darwin near the place where the cable reached the shore, the Alice Springs Telegraph Station and the General Post Office in Adelaide. == Attack at Barrow Creek == Life was hazardous for the line's isolated workforce. On 22 February 1874, eighteen months after the line opened, a group of Aboriginal men attacked the staff of the repeater station at Barrow Creek, killing linesman John Frank, mortally wounding stationmaster John L. Stapleton, and seriously wounding two others, one an aboriginal youth employed at the station. Contemporary press reports described the incident as the \\"Barrow's Creek outrage\\". A punitive expedition resulted in the death of several Aboriginal men believed to have been involved. == The Australian connection == In 1870 the British Australia Telegraph Company (BAT) was formed to link Australia directly to the British telegraphic cable system, by extending the cable from Singapore via Java to Port Darwin. In 1873, three British companies, The British India Extension Telegraph Company, The BAT and The China Submarine Telegraph Company were amalgamated to form the Eastern Extension, Australasia and China Telegraph Company (EET Co). The driving force behind the British cable companies was a Scottish born entrepreneur Sir John Pender, founder of Cable and Wireless. On 19 November 1871, Australia was connected telegraphically with the rest of the world after a cable was laid by BAT from Banyuwangi (Banjoewangie), at the eastern end of Java, to Darwin. This coincided with the completion of the construction of the overland telegraph cable from Adelaide to Darwin. The first message sent directly from London to Adelaide occurred on 22 October 1872. A second submarine cable from Java to Darwin was laid in 1880. The site in the intertidal zone where the cables come ashore in Darwin, where they are still visible during very low tides, was heritage listed in 2020.Australia's undersea telegraph cables listed under the NT Heritage Act, 150 years on ABC News, 28 June 2020. Retrieved 28 June 2020. == Eastern extension and undersea upgrades == The original cable station, Broome, Western Australia On 9 April 1889 a third undersea telegraph cable opened for business, running from Banyuwangi, Java to Cable Beach, Western Australia and continuing overland to Perth, to complement the two cables already laid in 1871 and 1880 from Banyuwangi to Darwin. This cable was laid to increase security in communications to prevent disruption from seismic activity that kept breaking the Banyuwangi to Darwin cables. The contract for the cables called for the manufacture of 970 nautical miles of cable containing a single galvanised copper core with 220 nautical miles being brass sheathed, laid by the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company for the Eastern Extension, Australasia and China Telegraph Company, by the SS Seine. The operation took only 10 days and was completed on 26 February 1889. These were all British companies. Cable Beach is named after this cable that connected Java to Cable Station, that served this purpose until March 1914. After operating for 25 years it closed due to the opening of more competitive, cheaper-to-run stations; most cables were subsequently recovered. Cable Station was left empty, and in 1921 it was purchased and transformed into its current use as the Broome Court House, which was placed on the Western Australian State Register of Heritage Places in 2001 as it is the only station that is still standing in Australia.Cable and Wireless Archives, London - Correspondence with the Colonial Office, Agents-General , in reference to the Banjoewangie-Roebuck Bay Cable 1888 – 1889Engineers’ Final Report &Appendices;, dated 7 June 1889 : Eastern Extension, Australasia, and China Telegraph Company, Limited, Banjoewangie and Western Australia Cable 1889, provided by the Historical Society, BroomeHeritage Council of Western Australia, Register of Heritage Places – Assessment Documentation Broome Court House, 28 August 2001.Broome Cable Station 1889 – 1914 by Max AndersonCable and Wireless Archives, London – Copies of Relevant Correspondence as provided through the Historical Society, BroomeInstitution of Engineers, Australia, Nomination of the East – West Telegraph for a National Engineering Landmark, June 2001.Ann Moyal – Clear Across Australia – A History of Telecommunications - 1984.G.R.M.

Elisala was the son of Tui Manua Alalamua whose genealogy descended from the Sa Tagaloa. ==Biography== Tui Manu'a Elisara was born on the island of Ta'u as the second son of Tui Manu'a Alalamua and Sofe, a daughter of Matiu of Ta'u island. Tui Manu'a Alalamua (of the female branch called the Avaloa clan in the Tui Manu'a family) was the successor of Tui Manu'a Tauveve, also from the Avaloa clan. Shortly after the death of Tui Manu'a Alalamua a vigorous debate ensued among potential heirs. From the three main branches of the Tui Manu'a family, three candidates emerged from each clan as each endorsed by their own branches of the Tui Manu'a family and their political allies: Alalamua's own son, Elisara (from the Avaloa clan) was named as an obvious contender although Elisara himself refused the title in lieu of his religious calling. The other two claimants were Taofi (from the female branch called the Falesoā clan of the Tui Manu'a family) and a young woman named Matelita (a descendant of Tui Manu'a Taliutafa Tupolo, son of Tui Manu'a Moaatoa of the Anoalo clan). With Elisara temporarily out of the succession, Taofi remained as one of the lesser direct heir and his party named him Tui Manu'a. Matelita's party, however, was able to amass even more support for her campaign (mainly through her male-side lineage of the Anoalo clan of the Tui Manu'a family and Eastern and Western Samoan relatives of her half-caste father Arthur Stephen \\"Pa'u\\" Young); Taofi capitulated to her sovereignty and she held the title until her death in 1895. As there were no other available family member of the male branch from the Anoalo clan after Tui Manu'a Matelita to take the title, in 1899 chiefly assembly of the Faletolu and Anoalo appointed the title to one of the female branches the Avaloa clan from Alalamua's line by persuading Elisara to take the throne. Tui Manu’a Elisara Alalamua attended the London Missionary Society seminary in Malua on 'Upolu island and returned to his native village where he served as the Congregationalist minister of Fitiuta. When the Faletolu (chiefly assembly) of Ta'u approached Elisara about taking the Tui Manu'a throne the request was initially denied on the grounds of his ministry. However, when the Berlin Act placed the Manu'a islands under the protection of the United States, he was petitioned zealously by the people of Manu'a. He accepted the leadership role and was bestowed the paramount title of Tui Manu'a on the island of Ta'u on 25 October 1899. The Manu'a islands were grouped with Tutuila and Aunu'u as the United States possession now called American Samoa. The presidency of the United States, and the military authorities of the US Navy, supplanted the native administrative role of the Tui Manu'a, through the arrests of his talking chiefs and eventually two trials of the Tui Manu'a, one off the coast of Ta'u, called the \\"Trial of the Ipu\\". On 6 July 1904 Tui Manu'a Elisara officially ceded the islands of Manu'a to the United States through the signing of the Treaty of Cession of Manu'a. He was relegated the office of Governor of Manu'a for the term of life and the understanding that the Tui Manu'a title would follow him to the grave. He died on 2 July 1909. After a fifteen-year break, the office was revived in 1924 when Chris Taliutafa Young, a member of the Anoalo clan of the Tui Manu'a family and the brother of Tui Manu'a Matelita who reigned between 1890–95, was named Tui Manu'a by the general assembly of the Faletolu and Anoalo. American officials were worried that the Manu'ans were restoring a \\"king\\" who would cause trouble for the administration. Governor Edward Stanley Kellogg opposed the bestowal and had the new Tui Manu'a brought to Tutuila where he was prevented from exercising the powers of his office. The Governor did not recognise the title on the basis that a monarchy was incompatible within the framework of the Constitution of the United States, and the previous Tui Manu'a had pledged to be the last person to hold the title. ==References== ==Bibliography== * *McMullin, Dan Taulapapa. 2005. \\"The Passive Resistance of Samoans to US and Other Colonialisms\\", article in \\"Sovereignty Matters\\" , University of Nebraska Press. * Office of the Governor. 2004.

The scandal began with complaints from two Chinese female citizens about being stripped, having their breasts groped, and being forced to do squats (this has been described as 'ear squats' in most reports, meaning they were touching their ears as they did squats). Member of Parliament (MP) Teresa Kok of the Democratic Action Party accompanied one of them to lodge a police report. Later that month, Kok was given a video compact disc (VCD) by an anonymous whistle-blower that contained a video depicting a female police officer ordering a female detainee, now identified as Hemy Hamisa Abu Hassan Saari, do ear squats in the nude. Kok later showed the video to some other MPs, triggering shock and outrage. Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi insisted that there would be no cover-up, and his deputy, Najib Tun Razak, said the same. Initially the federal Deputy Inspector General, Musa Hassan, made remarks to a similar effect, but also defended the ear squats as \\"standard procedure\\". He later stated, \\"It is the perpetrator behind the video clip whom we are after and not the policewoman, who was carrying out a routine check.\\" His comments led the leaders of all three opposition parties and an MP from the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition to call for Musa's resignation or dismissal. Deputy Internal Security Minister Noh Omar also stirred up controversy when he told foreigners upset about the scandal to \\"go home\\". He later made an apology, saying that he was misunderstood. However, a recording of his remarks indicated that he was not misquoted or taken out of context. An independent commission was later set up under Abdullah's orders to investigate the scandal. ==Early accusations== The first indications of abuse came in early November, when a Chinese housewife, Yu Xuezhen, went public with the story of her alleged abuse. According to her, she was travelling in a car with another Chinese national on 3 November when they were detained at a police roadblock because their passports were allegedly invalid. The policeman then demanded a RM500 bribe from them. The housewife later said, \\"Since both of us were carrying valid passports, we refused to give the policeman anything. We were then taken to the police station.\\" She claimed that at the police station, a policewoman took RM50 from her purse and divided it among four police officers. Then during a body search there, she was instructed to strip and that \\"A policewoman grabbed my breast and slapped me when I blushed. I was then forced to take off my undergarments and do five ear squats.\\" She also alleged that a policeman peeped into the room through an open door, and that the door was only shut tight when she screamed. When her husband later arrived with their marriage certificate, the police officer at the station refused to accept it as genuine. The women were released four days later after the Immigration Department confirmed their passports were real. The woman lodged a complaint with the police the next day, but insisted on anonymity. In another unrelated case, a remisier with a wife from China was asked for a bribe by a police officer so that the process of confirming her passport could be sped up. ==Abuse video== On 25 November, the existence of the video recording of a female detainee, apparently of Chinese ethnicity, being forced to do ear squats in the nude was made public. As the woman turned to face the camera, one of her nipples was visible. The poor quality of the clip indicated it had been recorded by a mobile phone. Well-known Malaysian blogger Jeff Ooi immediately compared the scandal to the Abu Ghraib scandal in Iraq where United States military personnel forced prisoners to strip and abused them. The video clip with the name gadis lokap (lady in custody, literally 'lock-up girl' in Malay) was distributed among the public in the form of a Multimedia Messaging System (MMS) clip. Initially some thought the clip to have been faked in an attempt to shame the police force, but the clip was later confirmed to have been filmed at the police headquarters in Petaling Jaya, Selangor. The Malay officer, identified as a constable, was identified and had her version of the events recorded by the police. On 29 November 2005, it was reported in the local newspapers that the woman is a Malaysian who was detained during a drug raid at a nightspot, and who was later charged in court over a drug-related offence. On 13 December 2005, the woman, identified as a 22-year-old Malay who was three-months pregnant, testified before the Commission of Inquiry probing the incident.\\"Naked woman in MMS video clip a Malay\\" . (13 December 2005). The Sun. In November 2006, a Washington Post front-page article reporting on the case identified the woman as Hemy Hamisa Abu Hassan Saari, a 23-year-old Malaysian babysitter. ==Response== After the first reports of abuse broke, the Prime Minister ordered Home Minister Azmi Khalid to travel to China to improve Malaysia's image there. Reportedly, the number of Chinese tourists had been dropping over the past few months, and it was feared the abuse scandal would further exacerbate the situation. It was later revealed that the Cabinet directed Azmi to go on the trip before the scandal blew open. When the video clip broke, the Prime Minister immediately insisted that \\"There should be no cover-up at all,\\" while his Deputy stated \\"It should not have happened.\\" Azmi also declared, \\"If police personnel are really involved, then this is police abuse.\\" Lim Keng Yaik, a Minister and the leader of the Gerakan party, called for the establishment of a Police Complaint and Misconduct Commission. Abdullah later announced an independent body would be set up to investigate the scandal. ===Defense of the police=== Deputy Inspector General of the Police (IGP) Musa Hassan also initially promised that the perpetrators would be punished, but later stated \\"It is the perpetrator behind the video clip whom we are after and not the policewoman, who was carrying out a routine check,\\" and that whoever filmed it would be charged under the Penal Code with insulting the woman's modesty, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in jail. Musa also stated that such actions are standard fare and are used to examine body cavities for possible contraband. The police began their investigation by quizzing staff of the China Press, which had also independently obtained footage of the incident. They also attempted to determine the identity of the detainee by blowing up some stills from the video and having them distributed to prisons and immigration detention centres. Azmi promised that the woman would be protected if she came forth to provide evidence, whatever her legal status. The New Sunday Times confirmed Musa's claim that strip searches were standard police procedure carried out after being arrested. The squats were used to dislodge objects possibly concealed in body orifices, and in some cases, detainees were hosed with strong jets of water to dislodge material hidden in their hair. The New Sunday Times also reported that only officers of the same sex as the detainee were permitted to examine him or her and that officers of the opposite sex would not be allowed in the room where the examination was going on. However, Deputy Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak had earlier denied that strip searches were part of standard police procedure and that \\"There is no reason to embarrass and humiliate people in that manner.\\" The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was told by doctors that performing ear squats was an inefficient means of examination and could not dislodge anything hidden in the vagina or rectum. The leaders of three opposition parties – the DAP, PAS and Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) – immediately called for Musa's dismissal. The next day, the weekday edition of the newspaper, the New Straits Times, reported that although such procedures were permitted by the standard operating procedures of the police, the Lock-up Rules 1953 did not permit a body cavity search nor ear squats for any purpose. This would thereby make it illegal for the police to employ such procedures after making an arrest. ===Controversial comment by Cabinet member=== The same day, Deputy Internal Security Minister Noh Omar told the press \\"I dare say everything was done following the rules. ... If the law does not provide for it, ask the lawyers to sue the Government and summon the police.\\" He promised to elaborate at Parliament the following day, but as Speaker of the Dewan Rakyat Ramli Ngah Taib did not permit discussion of the incident, he was unable to. However, he did tell the press \\"If the orang asing (foreigners) think we are zalim (cruel), ask them to go back to their own country.\\" Most media outlets, many of which are owned by political parties in the governing Barisan Nasional coalition, did not report these comments after being reportedly told not to by the Prime Minister's office, but the comments received coverage in the evening edition of some local newspapers and many foreign ones. The Chinese embassy requested Malaysia probe the assault cases further. Later, Noh made what the BBC described as a \\"grudging\\" apology; he stated \\"What I meant was Malaysia is a safe country. If foreigners think our police are cruel and the country is not safe, then they would have gone back home long time ago. I did not tell them to go back.\\" The BBC also construed his comments as \\"a direct challenge\\" to the Prime Minister. Reportedly, Abdullah reprimanded Noh, who at first denied he had told anyone to \\"go back\\". ===Azmi's China visit=== In December, Azmi Khalid visited China as had been planned. Azmi expressed sadness about the incident, but did not apologise, and called the squats standard procedure. Azmi was in China to investigate the root causes of the drop in the number of Chinese visitors to Malaysia. Some of his aides stated that it appeared to be due to concern over the tsunami triggered by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the opening of other travel destinations. ===Parliamentary backlash=== After it was revealed that the gadis lokap was a Malay, several Senators, or members of the Dewan Negara (the upper house of Parliament), asked that Kok and Opposition Leader Lim Kit Siang be referred to the Parliamentary Committee of Privileges for \\"causing confusion\\" and making groundless accusations based on allegedly misleading information. It was also contended that Kok's showing of the video clip had shamed the woman's modesty. Some also said that Azmi's China visit was for nothing, as the gadis lokap was a Malay, and argued that Lim and Kok deserved to be punished for causing an unnecessary trip. However, Deputy Internal Security Minister Chia Kwang Chye insisted that Azmi's visit was not to apologise for the video clip in question.\\"Kit Siang, Teresa patut kena tindakan\\". (15 December 2005). Berita Harian. Earlier, some had accused Kok of breaking the law pertaining to the display of pornographic material, which could lead to imprisonment. However, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Nazri Aziz insisted that Kok's actions were not in violation of the law.Kaur, Manjit (5 December 2005). \\"Kok did not break law by showing clip, says Nazri\\". The Star. ===Detainee's race=== Initially it was thought that the detainee filmed doing ear squats in the nude was a Chinese national. However, it was later revealed that she was in fact a Malay citizen of Malaysia. On 16 December Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak insisted that neither he nor Prime Minister Abdullah was made aware of this until it became public.\\"Nude Squat Incident Not A Racial Issue, Says Najib\\". (16 December 2005). BERNAMA. Noh, too, denied that he knew of the detainee's race or nationality until it was made public.Leong, Shen-Li & Letchumanan, A. (19 December 2005). \\"PM: Nobody would’ve believed police then\\" . The Star. Some opposition bloggers (including Lim) and independent journalists postulated that this information had been hidden to avoid giving the opposition party PAS ammunition for its campaign in the Pengkalan Pasir by-election that was eventually won by Barisan Nasional, which currently controls the federal government.Lim, Kit Siang (2005). \\"Police videoclip scandal – was national interests sacrificed for UMNO by-election interests?\\". Retrieved 19 December 2005. Later Abdullah stated that if the police had revealed the woman's race or nationality, they would have been accused of trying to cover up the scandal, and that nobody would have believed them. Kok told media, however, that many of her constituents appeared to also disbelieve that the woman was in fact a Malay, and asked her about it. At the end of 2005, two editors at the China Press, which had initially identified the woman as a Chinese national, resigned over the issue.Hong, Carolyn (5 January 2006). \\"Doubts linger over nude squat video\\" . Straits Times. ===Other organisations=== The Parliamentary Human Rights Caucus, led by Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Nazri Aziz, also condemned the abuse of the prisoner, with Nazri saying he was \\"disgusted\\" by the incident. Human rights non-governmental organisations (NGOs) expressed concern about the reported incidents of abuse but noted that such incidents were not uncommon. One spokesperson for Suaram said \\"One of the most common-place police abuses is to harass women by getting them to undress. This isn't something totally strange or alien that people can't associate with the Malaysian police.\\" Another said, \\"In the past those leaders have condoned these sorts of attitudes as the norm – naturally the rest of the population think it's OK.\\" The Royal Commission on the Police that released its report earlier in 2005 also noted incidents of ear squats in the nude were common police procedure, despite being a breach of regulations. The commission recommended a code of practice that would not permit these cases to be included as part of the Standing Orders of the Inspector-General of Police. Raja Petra Kamaruddin, a member of the Selangor Royal Family and a prominent member of the opposition, lambasted the government for only noticing such abuses now. He claimed he and his wife had both been stripped and hit by police personnel when they were detained, and called it \\"accepted practice in Malaysian lockups.\\" Raja Petra argued that the government was only bothering to take action because the economy, which is reliant on tourism, would be impacted by the reports of abuse. On 28 November a Malaysian woman, Norazimah Nor came to the Parliament lobby to notify the members that she and 8 other women were forced to strip and do 100 naked push- ups in the Kapar police lock-up on 5 November 2000. Media organisations sympathetic to Malaysian opposition parties as well as independent media like Malaysiakini cited her case as a reason to suspect the government's interest in the Chinese abuse cases was due more to tourist money instead of concern over human rights. Norazimah had been detained for attending an assembly organised by the opposition Barisan Alternatif. ===Independent commission=== On 2 December, it was announced that a five-member independent commission had been set up to investigate the incidents of alleged abuse. Former Chief Justice of Malaysia Tun Mohamed Dzaiddin Abdullah was named as the commission head; he had earlier served in the same capacity in the Royal Commission on the Police Force. The other members of the commission were Lim Ah Lek, Kamilia Ibrahim, former chairman of the Bar Council Kuthubul Zaman Bukhari and Hamzah Mohammad Rus, who would serve as the commission secretary. All of them had also served in the Royal Commission. Their goals were to determine if the woman in the clip was one of five Chinese nationals who had filed complaints about police abuse, probe the procedure of body search shown, determine if there was any impropriety in the manner the search was conducted, investigate the police Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and the regulations concerning body searches, and recommend amendments or alterations to these rules. Abdullah gave the commission 30 days to prepare its report. ==See also== * Baldgate ==References and notes== ===Other references=== * Abas, Azura (26 November 2005). \\"For closer co-operation\\".

It is 15 km west of Vanua Balavu. Covering an area of , it has a maximum elevation of 259 meters. The island features a coconut plantation and many streams, and is circled by great beaches and fringing reefs with a boat opening and a large lagoon on the northeastern side. Plantation buildings and a school remain. Kanacea is privately owned. Its main economic activity was centered on copra and sugarcane, and it retains a coconut plantation. ==Controversy== In 1991, when the island of Kanacea, which the paramount chief of Cakaudrove, the Tui Cakau, had originally sold to a European settler in 1868, was sold by an Australian company, Carpenters (Fiji) Ltd., to an American company, the government persuaded Carpenters to pay compensation to the island's original landowners, Kanacea people, who had been relocated to the island of Taveuni at the time of the original sale.\\"In search of the real Fiji\\" Fiji Daily Post 10 January 2007 However, to the outrage of both the chief of Kanacea and the Tui Cakau, a number of Kanacea commoners demanded that the island be returned to its original landowners because the original sale by the Tui Cakau had been invalid. In response to the populist attack of Kanacea people's consultant Francis Waqa Sokonibogi on the Tui Cakau for having sold his people's land, the government and chiefs of Cakaudrove pressured the chiefs and people of Kanacea to distance themselves from Sokonibogi. As reported in the Fiji Times, the Bauan chief Ratu William Toganivalu, who was minister for lands in the interim government, said that the Tui Cakau, Ratu Golea, had sold the island of Kanacea because Kanacea people had sided with Tongans in a war between the people of Cakaudrove and Tonga saying, “The Tui Cakau at that time owned all the land because he was the ‘Head Chief’ and for that reason he did not need the permission from anybody to sell the land\\" Ratu William reportedly said \\"Sale of Kanacea ls Legal: Minister\\" Fiji Times, 17 February 1991 The government rejected Waqa's demand, and the government, chiefs of Kanacea, and Carpenters agreed that out of the F$6, 000,000 for which the island was sold, Carpenters would pay the sum of F$1,000,000 as compensation to the people of Kanacea. ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Islands of Fiji Category:Lau Islands ","title":"Kanacea"},{"id":"3262274","text":"Celtic culture may refer to: *Celts *Ancient Celtic culture *Celtic revival *Celts (modern) *Gaelic culture The Celtic culture of the Celtic nations: *Culture of Ireland *Culture of Scotland *Culture of the Isle of Man *Culture of Wales *Culture of Cornwall *Culture of Brittany *Culture of Asturies *Culture of Galicia ==See also== * Celtic Europe * Celtic identity * Insular art * Celtic music Category:Indo-European culture ","title":"Celtic culture"},{"id":"3262278","text":"Lusitania was an ancient Roman province corresponding to most of modern Portugal.

It was developed by the French inventors Auguste and Louis Lumière in 1895, while simultaneously working on the Cinematograph. It was patented in February 1896. Basically a miniature version of the mutoscope for home use, the Kinora worked very much like a flip book in the shape of a Rolodex. It used conventional monochrome photographic prints fixed to strong, flexible cards attached to a circular core. A reel was revolved handle by turning a handle, making the pictures flip over against a static peg one by one. The moving pictures could be viewed through an eyepiece.Kinora at dlt.ncssm.edu, accessed 28 October 2011 Or reels contained printed versions of films by the Lumières, later also films by other companies. The Cinematograph proved very successful so the Lumières didn't bother about the Kinora, but passed the idea on to Gaumont who marketed the device and circa 100 different reels around 1900. The British rights to the Kinora were bought by The British Mutoscope & Biograph Co. in 1898, but the machine was not marketed in the UK until 1902. It became popular in the UK and over 12 different viewer models and over 600 reels produced. Biograph had constructed a studio in London in 1900 to film moving portraits of families and individuals. Flip books of 60 pictures in standard Mutoscope size were produced there as Bio-Gems, before a Kinora reel portrait service became available in 1903. In May 1907 Biograph chairman W.T. Smedley set up Kinora Limited in London.

The island is the tenth largest in Fiji, with a land area of nearly 60 square kilometers.Steadman (2006) It is fertile and well watered, and encircled by a 29-kilometer road. Its closest neighbors are Aiwa and Nayau. Separated by deep sea from the latter but only by shallow waters from the former, when sea levels were lower during glacial episodes Lakeba and Aiwa formed one large island. It has a population of around 2,100 in eight villages, the most important of which is the capital Tubou which lies in the island's south. Near Tubou is the village of Levuka; not to be confused with its namesake - Fiji's old capital - Levuka on Lakeba is home to a fishing tribe whose ancestors came from Bau Island. Another significant village is Nasaqalau, located in the northern part of Lakeba. The wattled honeyeaters on Lakeba belong to the large-wattled eastern subspecies Foulehaio carunculatus carunculatus, also found on Samoa, Tonga and Wallis and Futuna Sulphur-breasted myzomela (Myzomela jugularis) Collared lory (Phigys solitarius) from Lakeba == Geography == Situated at 18.20° South and 178.80° East, Lakeba has an irregular oval shape. About 9 kilometers long and 8 kilometers wide, it is circumscribed by a total shoreline of 32 kilometers. The island, which has a maximum altitude of 219 meters, has a core of andesitic volcanic rock of Miocene age, with raised coral rock around it. The limestone lies bare in places, forming karst and - particularly on the north and north-west coasts - cliffs up to 76 meters high; the overall area taken up by bare limestone is about 4% of Lakeba's total land surface. A reforestation programme has seen the planting of Lakeba's hills (formerly partially denuded by deforestation) with Caribbean pine (Pinus caribea) trees.Steadman (2006), Franklin et al. (2008) The climate of Lakeba is generally humid, with a wetter summer and a drier winter. The average annual precipitation is somewhat over 2,000 mm as measured at Tubou, but average monthly precipitation in the winter months - June, July and August - is only around 80 mm, and there can be large differences in rainfall between years.Franklin et al. (2008) The village of Nasaqalau is noted for a number of caves, the most famous being Oso Nabukete, also known as the Pregnant Women's Cave. According to legend, a woman attempting to hide her pregnancy will not be able to escape through the mouth of the cave. It is adjoined by Qara Bulu, once used as a prison in times of tribal war. A third cave, Koro ni Vono, was once used as a place of banishment for tuberculosis patients, who were left there to die. Other notable caves include the Tubou Cave, of interest to geologists, and Qara ni Puka where many remains of extinct birds have been found. Davallia solida var. fejeensis is endemic to Fiji and grows also on Lakeba == History and culture == Lakeba is known as a chiefly island, being the home island of the chiefly Vuanirewa clan, which is based in Tubou. The head of this clan takes the title of Tui Nayau, and is the Paramount Chief of the Lau Islands. The last Tui Nayau was Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara (1920–2004); he was the first Prime Minister of Fiji and second President of Fiji, and the most durable figure of Fijian politics for more than three decades. Ratu Mara is buried in the village of Tubou, as are Enele Ma'afu (1816–1881) - a Tongan-Fijian warlord who conquered much of Fiji in the 19th century - and Fiji's first modern statesman Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna (1888–1958). Lakeba lies on a historical faultline between Fiji and Tonga, and Tongan influence is seen in many aspects of Lakeban culture. Lakeban architecture features rounded houses rather than the square-ended ones elsewhere in Fiji. The Lakeban dialect of Fijian also shows Tongan influence. Tongan hymns are popular in polotu (an evening church service), and Tongan clothing styles are reflected in the mats tied around the waist on formal occasions. Tongan traditional dances called lakalaka are also popular. Archaeological excavations in the 1990s discovered a massive fortress, built around a thousand years ago. Large enough to house 2,500 people (more than the total population of the island), the fortress is believed to have been built as a bulwark against Tongan invaders. The inhabitants of Nasaqalau are famous for the ability of one of their clans to call sharks from the sea. This clan originated in the village of Wainikeli on the island of Taveuni. On Lakeba was born famous chief Delailoa, son of Kalouyalewa, who went on Lakeba. === Economy === Copra production is the most important economic activity on Lakeba. There is also a coconut mill four kilometers outside Tubou. Tourism is of lesser importance in Lakeba than in some other parts of Fiji. ==Ecology== Due to the extensive and long-lasting settlement, the original ecosystem on Lakeba has been strongly altered. Terrestrial mammals, not originally native, have been introduces as livestock or stowaways, and today the island has horses, pigs, cattle, dogs, cats, and Polynesian (Rattus exulans) as well as black rats (R. rattus). ===Birds=== Among land birds, bird species disappeared from Lakeba in prehistoric times, probably after the upland forests were largely cleared away; introduced rats as well as hunting probably also contributed to their demise. Others managed to adapt to the alteration of habitat by humans, though they are generally not as common as on Aiwa where there has been no significant deforestation. For the most part, the avifauna of Lakeba is more similar to that of Samoa and Tonga than to that of the main group of Fiji. Quite commonly seen are the white-rumped swiftlet (Collocalia spodiopygia), Polynesian starling, (Aplonis tabuensis, either the West Fijian subspecies vitiensis or the subspecies tabuensis from the southern Lau group and Tonga), Vanikoro flycatcher (Myiagra vanikorensis), and the slaty monarch (Mayrornis lessoni) which is endemic to Fiji. Two honeyeaters, the endemic orange-breasted myzomela (Myzomela jugularis) and the widespread eastern wattled honeyeater (Foulehaio carunculatus carunculatus), have adapted well to human settlement and are rather common in the coconut plantations. The collared lory (Phigys solitarius), endemic to Fiji in modern times, also frequents this habitat, but is a rather rare species on Lakeba. At least three species formerly found on Lakeba are now completely extinct: the Lakeba imperial pigeon (Ducula lakeba) might also have occurred on Viti Levu and perhaps on the Tongan islands of ʻEua, Foa and Lifuka. If so, it probably was generally widespread in western Polynesia, but until now it is only known with certainty from Lakeba and Aiwa. A hitherto undescribed Gallirallus rail also inhabited Lakeba and Aiwa in the past; as this bird was flightless it represents an endemic species. The consumed scrubfowl (Megapodius alimentum), a species rather widely distributed throughout Fiji and Tonga, also occurred on Lakeba and Aiwa in the past; as scrubfowl were widely transported across islands by settlers, this species might have been brought here by humans, but altogether this is not too likely. However, on Aiwa a single bone was found, probably referrable either to the Viti Levu scrubfowl (M. amissus) or the pile-builder megapode (M. molistructor); the latter species occurred on Tonga and New Caledonia, while the former, which lived on Viti Levu and perhaps Kadavu of the western group of Fiji, possibly survived to modern times. Considering that only one bone was found and that M. alimentum was numerous on Lakeba and presumably also Aiwa, it may well be that the second Megapodius species was indeed imported as food by Polynesians and never had a self- sustaining population; in that regard it may be noted that unlike M. alimentum, M. amissus was a weak flier or even flightless. Parrot bones found on Lakeba might be of the Oceanic eclectus parrot (Eclectus infectus); biogeography suggests that this species was formerly native to at least some islands in Fiji, as it occurred on Tonga to the east and Vanuatu to the west. In addition, there remains a batch of songbird bones from several species that have not been identified; these might be of birds not found on Lakeba anymore but it is not too likely that they contain any entirely extinct forms. Also found on Aiwa was a single bone of a Porzana rail. Apparently this was yet another distinct species, and if so it is likely to have occurred on Lakeba too. But until more material turns up and is studied, nothing can be said with certainty, particularly in respect of the fact that the white-browed crake (P. cinerea) and the spotless crake (P. tabuensis) formerly occurred on Lakeba. Finally, a single bone of the striated heron (Butorides striata) was found on Lakeba; the species does not occur there today, but unless more bones are found it is not sure that it had a self-sustaining population on this island rather than being merely an occasional visitor. Peale's imperial pigeon (Ducula latrans), the Southwest Pacific peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus nesiotes) and the Fiji shrikebill (Clytorhynchus vitiensis) breed on much smaller Aiwa but not on Lakeba; though no bones of these species have been found here to date, it is likely that they formerly occurred on Lakeba too. ===Plants=== The small tree Grewia crenata can be found in Lakeba's forests Miscanthus floridulus, a native grass of Lakeba, forms thickets in the talasiga Vigna marina, a native legume of Lakeba that grows abundantly near the sea The former upland forest was largely cleared after the initial settlement to make room for agriculture; only about of it remain. A total 40% of Lakeba's surface is used for cultivation of Caribbean pine (Pinus caribaea), the rare cycad (\\"sago palm\\") Cycas seemannii, coconut palms (Cocos nucifera) and other crops. The remaining vegetation of Lakeba is dominated by dicots; it can be classified as follows, progressing from the peak to the shore: * Upland forest on volcanic soil. Little remains today, mostly in ravines and on ridges. Contains such species as Alyxia stellata, Alphitonia zizyphoides, Barringtonia edulis, Dysoxylum richii, Ficus scabra, Grewia crenata, Micromelum minutum, Pittosporum arborescens, Vavaea amicorum, and Geissois ternata which is only found on volcanic soils. * talasiga grassland and scrub. This is a plant community that contains mainly herbaceous and small woody species; it grows where forest had been cleared away in the past. In locations that have suffered much erosion it persists; elsewhere it is gradually being replaced with forest again. Dominant plant species are Dicranopteris linearis, Hopseed (Dodonaea viscosa), Pandanus tectorius and Pteridium esculentum; grasses include Bothriochloa bladhii, Brachiaria subquadripara, Southern Sandbur (Cenchrus echinatus), Indian Goosegrass (Eleusine indica), Eragrostis scabriflora, Eriochloa procera, Imperata conferta, Miscanthus floridulus, Paspalum conjugatum, P. orbiculare, Pennisetum polystachion and Themeda quadrivalvis. Regenerating forest is initially dominated by Cyclophyllum barbatum, Geissois ternata, Geniostoma rupestre, Leucosyke corymbulosa, Maesa tabacifolia and Myristica gillespieana. * Upland forest on calcitic soil. This is essentially secondary forest in various stages of succession, but rich in Fijian endemics. Dominated by Alphitonia zizyphoides, Buchanania vitiensis, Dysoxylum richii, D. tenuiflorum, Maniltoa floribunda, Melicope cucullata and Pouteria grayana. * Wetlands vegetation. Most freshwater wetland on Lakeba is used for taro cultivation. Otherwise, dominant plants include Ludwigia octovalvis and Mikania micrantha. * Lowland swamp forest. Dominated by Inocarpus fagifer. * Coastal forest. Characterized by Diospyros elliptica, D. samoensis, Pouteria grayana, Syzygium richii and Xylosma simulans. * Mangrove forest. Mangroves are widespread on the eastern coast of Lakeba, comprising about 7% of the island's total area. Dominant plant species are black mangrove (Bruguiera gymnorhiza) landwards, and red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), spotted mangrove (R. stylosa) and their sterile hybrid R. × selala seawards. * Littoral forest. These trees are able to withstand seawater and most are even dispersed by the sea; they grow in a narrow strip along the beach. Dominant plants are sea poison tree (Barringtonia asiatica), ballnut (Calophyllum inophyllum), Hernandia nymphaeifolia, beach hibiscus (Hibiscus tiliaceus), Phaleria disperma and sea almond (Terminalia catappa). * Littoral scrub. The low-lying and mainly herbaceous beach vegetation. Dominated by oceanblue morning glory (Ipomoea indica), white-flowered beach morning glory (I. littoralis), beach morning glory (I. pes-caprae), Pandanus tectorius, Paspalum vaginatum, Scaevola taccada and Vigna marina. Plants found on Lakeba that are endemic to Fiji are Alangium vitiense, Buchanania vitiensis, Connarus pickeringii, Davallia solida var. fejeensis, Diospyros vitiensis var. longisepala, Dysoxylum tenuiflorum, Elatostema tenellum, Eragrostis scabriflora, Ficus fulvo-pilosa, Ficus masonii, Geissois ternata, Geniostoma uninervium, Glochidion seemannii, Homalium pallidum, Maniltoa floribunda, Melicope cucullata, Melochia vitiensis, Myristica gillespieana, Phaleria pubiflora, Polyalthia laddiana and Psychotria cf. pickeringii. Plants tentatively identified as the Fijian endemics Barringtonia seaturae, Citronella vitiensis, Cyathocalyx insularis and Elaeocarpus storckii grow on Lakeba, but whether it is really these species requires confirmation. None of the described endemic species occurs exclusively on this island, but there is an unidentified Syzygium similar to Syzygium gracilipes and another member of this genus that almost certainly is a hitherto unknown species. These might indeed be found on Lakeba only. Interesting non-endemic plants found on Lakeba are the endangered Aglaia saltatorum and the rare (though not endangered) Burckella richii. In 1999-2001 the first Fijian record of Macropiper timothianum outside the large northwestern islands was made on Lakeba, as well as the first records for Fiji of Suicide Tree (Cerbera odollam) and Garuga floribunda. Whether Canarium vanikoroense, otherwise known in Fiji only from the large islands, occurs on Lakeba remains to be verified. ==Footnotes== ==References== * (2008): The vegetation and flora of Lakeba, Nayau and Aiwa Islands, Central Lau Group, Fiji.

He was a cofounder of the Ahmadabad Education Society which initiated Ahmedabad University and the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad. He served as the chairman of historic and influential Anandji Kalyanji Trust that manages Shatrunjaya and several other Jain pilgrimage centers, for 50 years. ==Family== Kasturbhai belonged to the family of Nagarsheth (city chief) of Ahmedabad, recognized by the Mughals, Marathas and the English during different times. THE NAGARSHETH OF AHMEDABAD: THE HISTORY OF AN URBAN INSTITUTION IN A GUJARAT CITY, Dwijendra Tripathi and M. J. Mehta, Proceedings of the Indian History Congress, Vol. 39, Volume I (1978), pp. 481-496 (16 pages) He was the descendant of Shantidas Jhaveri, a royal jeweler of Akbar and an Oswal Jain from the Marwar region. Khushalchand (1680–1748), the grandson of Shantidas paid ransom to the Marathas to save Ahmedabad from plunder in 1725. Khushalchand's son Vakhatchand (1740–1814) was also a noted businessman. His grandfather Dalpatbhai Bhagubhai was also in cotton trading business in the 1870s. His father Lalbhai Dalpatbhai (1863–1912) established Saraspur cotton mill in 1896 addition to the traditional business of precious gems. It became a part of the swadeshi movement in India. ==Early life== Kasturbhai was born to Mohini and Lalbhai Dalpatbhai, a preeminent Jain family, in 1894 in Jhaveriwad, Ahmedabad, Gujarat. He studied at Municipal School Number Eight near Teen Darwaja, Ahmedabad up to fifth grade. He later joined Ranchhodlal Chhotalal Government High School. He matriculated in 1911 with second class. In 1912, when he was a 17-year-old studying in Gujarati College, his father died and being the second son, he was asked to discontinue his studies so as to help in the family business. His father Lalbhai had divided property among his brothers only in the recent past; as his and his sons' share, Lalbhai had received Raipur mills, a new establishment. He was married to Sharda Chimanlal Jhaveri in May 1915 and had two sons, Shrenik and Siddharth. == Business == He joined Raipur Mill as a chairman in 1912. The operations of the mill had not yet stabilized; hence, Kasturbhai had to take care of operations closely. He started off as a timekeeper in the mill, but fed up with the repetitive nature of the job, he started working with suppliers of the mill and traveled far and wide to understand the supplier market. The boom in demand during and post-World War I helped him in stabilizing the operations of the firm. He joined the board of directors of Raipur mill in 1918. Later he established Ashoka Mills in the 1920s with help of Dahyabhai Patel. He expanded business with help of the mentor and trusted general manager of all the textile mills Mr. Dahyabhai Motilal Patel who had the vision and insight to advise to invest in or acquire five mills between 1924 and 1938 including four belonging to relatives. These include establishment of Arvind Mills and Nutan Mills in 1931, Aruna Mills in 1928, Ahmedabad New Cotton Mills in 1938. Swadeshi movement by Mahatma Gandhi in the 1930s and starting of World War II in 1939 helped textile industry in India. He modernised all seven mills. They had 12% of India's total spinning capacity and 24% of Ahmedabad's total weaving capacity resulting in they were seventh largest cotton consumer in 1939 in India. In 1948, his business group was named in the list of business houses indulging in black-marketing. R. K. Shanmukham Chetty, the finance minister and a friend of Kasturbhai had to resign for reportedly suggesting that its name be dropped from the list. The Income Tax department followed its allegations with a spate of inquiries and after almost ten years, absolved the group of any wrongdoing. In 1952, his trusted advisor and general manage Dahyabhai Motilal Patel help strategise and start Atul Limited (literally, 'incomparable'), India's first modern dyestuff manufacturer, in collaboration with American Cyanamid Company. It was inaugurated by the first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. ==Politics== Kasturbhai Lalbhai wearing Khadi clothes He was elected in Central Legislative Assembly in December 1923. During his three-year term, he was involved in lobbying for Indian industries including repeal of excise duty on textiles. During the 1930s, he came close with Mahatma Gandhi and helped him in Swadeshi movement which boycotted foreign goods and promoted local industries. He was also indulged in negotiation of taxes with British for Indian textiles during economic depression of the 1930s. He held several important positions after independence of India, including Advisory Committee on Fundamental Rights, Minorities and the Administration of Tribal and Excluded Areas in 1947, chairmanship of the Economic Committee of the Ministry of Finance in 1948, chairmanship of Central Public Works Department Industry Committee in 1952, chairmanship of National Research Development Corporation, member of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, trustee of Gandhi Smarak Nidhi, member of Indian Investment Centre. He also became the trustee and chairman of Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Fund. He also served as a member of Minorities Sub- committee as a representative of Jainism. == Institution building == Kasturbhai was elected as the President of Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industries in 1934 and the President of Ahmedabad Textile Mill Owners Association in 1935. From 1937 to 1949, he served as the Director of Reserve Bank of India. He along with Amritlal Hargovinddas, Ganesh Mavlankar started the Ahmadabad Education Society (AES) in 1936, which later evolved into Ahmedabad University in 2009. Later this society started several educational institutes including MG Science College, L M College of Pharmacy. AES assisted the other educational institutions by donating the land to the institutes like Physical Research Laboratory, Indian Space Research Organisation, CEPT, Castrol AES Monitoring Institute, Blind Men's Association giving training to the Blind persons. Vikram Sarabhai Community Science Center, Gujarat Vishwa Kosh, and others. HL College of Commerce had the privilege to house Gujarat University in its building in the initial years. AES had also donated Rs 0.5 Million for the establishment of Gujarat University. AES also helped establish cultural center like Amdavad ni Gufa. He and Vikram Sarabhai established Ahmedabad Textile Industries Research Association (ATIRA) before independence under Ahmedabad Textile Mill owners Association for promoting research in field of textiles. AES also donated land for the establishment of the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA). Kasturbhai along with Vikram Sarabhai were instrumental in it. He was on the board of IIMA but declined to accept the position of its chairman. Now IIMA has Kasturbhai Lalbhai Management Development Centre and a Kasturbhai Lalbhai Chair in Entrepreneurship. To promote engineering and technology, he founded an engineering college in 1947 and named it after his father, Lalbhai Dalpatbhai College of Engineering. He also established the Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Institute of Indology in 1962. In 1949, he founded the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industries (GCCI). From 1955 to 1965, he was a chairman of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). He founded the Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Institute of Indology in 1962 which preserves many manuscripts, rare books, and microfilms. In 1972, Sankat Nivaran Society was founded by Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industries and Ahmedabad Textile Mills Owners' Association. He commissioned world-renowned architects such as Louis Kahn, Le Corbusier, B. V. Doshi and Charles Correa to design some of these institutes and bring modern architecture in Ahmedabad. == Later life == With time, Kasturbhai started handing over the operations of his businesses to his family in the 1960s. He devoted more time to public activities. He retired from business in January 1977. He died on 20 January 1980 in Ahmedabad. == Religious activities == He was a strict Jain. He became chairman of Anandji Kalyanji Trust in 1925 at the age of 30 years and served for 50 years.The dynamics of a tradition: Kasturbhai Lalbhai and his entrepreneurship, Dwijendra Tripathi, Manohar, 1981, p. 50 It has many Jain temples under its management.

His uncle Johann Karl Philipp von Cobenzl was the Habsburg plenipotentiary in the Austrian Netherlands and his cousin Count Ludwig von Cobenzl (1753–1809) served as Foreign Minister of the Habsburg Monarchy from 1801 to 1805. His father Guidobald von Cobenzl lived mostly in Gorizia, where he was a great supporter of culture and arts.https://www.slovenska-biografija.si/rodbina/sbi159952/#primorski- slovenski-biografski-leksikon Philipp von Cobenzl grew up in Gorizia and at Predjama Castle (Burg Lueg) near Postojna (Adelsberg).

Immediately afterwards, Cobenzl travelled to Berlin as a Habsburg envoy, but was not able to prevent the Prussian king Frederic the Great from entering the War of the Bavarian Succession. In 1779 he concluded the Peace of Teschen and assumed the office of an Austrian vice-chancellor, eventually succeeding State Chancellor Prince Wenzel Anton of Kaunitz-Rietberg in 1792. However, already in March 1793 upon discords regarding the Second Partition of Poland, he had to resign from office in favour of Baron Johann Amadeus Francis de Paula von Thugut. From 1801 Cobenzl worked as Habsburg ambassador in Paris. He retired in 1805, and then lived in his Döbling residence north of Vienna. He was a patron of the arts, acquainted with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and greatly contributed to the education and career of the Slovenian Neoclassicist painter Franz Caucig. In 1809, he informed Napoleon Bonaparte about the demographics of the newly established Illyrian Provinces. Upon his death, the Cobenzl noble dynasty became extinct.

It is dedicated to its founder, Saint Deiniol. The site of the present building of Bangor Cathedral has been in use as a place of Christian worship since the 6th century. The cathedral was built on a low-lying and inconspicuous site, possibly so as not to attract the attention of Viking raiders from the sea in ancient times. The Gothic style building on the hill is part of Bangor University. ==History== The site of Bangor Cathedral was originally occupied by St Deiniol's Monastery, established in the 6th century around 530 on land given by the king of Gwynedd, Maelgwn Gwynedd. Deiniol is said to have been consecrated as a bishop by Saint David, making him the first Bishop of Bangor. This monastery was sacked in 634 and again in 1073. Nothing of the original building survives. The Synod of Westminster in 1102 is recorded as taking measures to restore Bangor Cathedral, but the earliest part of the present building was built during the episcopate of Bishop David (1120–1139) with the assistance of the king of Gwynedd, Gruffudd ap Cynan, who donated money towards the project and was buried by the high altar on his death in 1137. This was a cruciform building in the Norman style, about 44 yards in length. Gruffudd's son, Owain Gwynedd, was also buried here, as was his brother Cadwaladr. Giraldus Cambrensis describes a service held here in 1188 when the Archbishop of Canterbury celebrated Mass. In 1211, the cathedral was destroyed by King John's army, on a raid into Gwynedd. In the 13th century the original apse was removed and the choir was extended to its present length. The church was badly damaged when King Edward I invaded Gwynedd in 1282, and in 1284 the dean and chapter were given £60 in compensation for the damage. There was extensive rebuilding in this period, under the first Bishop Anian, with the transepts and crossing rebuilt. The nave was rebuilt in the late 14th century. The cathedral was said to have been burnt to the ground in 1402 during the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr, but there is no contemporary evidence for this, though it may well have been damaged. There certainly was extensive reconstruction from the end of the 15th century, completed in 1532. There is a Latin inscription over the tower doorway recording that Bishop Skevington built the tower in 1532, though it was not complete when Skevington died in 1533. Some work was done during the 18th century and £2,000 was spent on repairs in 1824, followed by the altering and refitting of the interior in 1825 at a cost of a further £3,252. Rowland Meyrick, the second son of Meyric ap Llewelyn, was the first Bishop of Bangor following the Reformation and is buried under the cathedral. Meyric ap Llewelyn was High Sheriff and Captain of the Guard at the coronation of Henry VIII on 26 April 1509. ==Architecture== The building as seen today is the result of extensive work carried out under the supervision of George Gilbert Scott, starting in 1868. Scott's design originally called for a high central tower and spire, but this was never completed as cracks appeared which were thought to indicate subsidence of the foundations. The tower was therefore left as a low structure. In 1879 £11,000 was spent on the restoration of the nave, chapter house and central tower. Lord Penrhyn contributed £2,000. ==Features of interest== The cathedral contains the \\"Mostyn Christ\\", a figure of the Pensive Christ carved in oak and thought to date from the late 15th century, depicting Christ prior to the crucifixion, seated on a rock and wearing the crown of thorns. In the grounds of the cathedral, the \\"Biblical Garden\\" is planted with an example of every plant mentioned in the Bible. The cathedral also contains a number of pieces of woodwork created by Robert Thompson. ==Burials== *Rowland Meyrick, a Welsh Bishop of Bangor (1559–1566) *Nicholas Robinson (bishop) – on the south side of the high altar *Henry Rowlands (bishop) – in the choir, before the high altar *Edmund Griffith, a Welsh Bishop of Bangor (1634–1637) – buried in the choir *Robert Morgan (bishop), a Welsh Bishop of Bangor (1666–1673) – buried in the grave of Bishop Nicholas Robinson *Humphrey Lloyd (bishop), Bishop of Bangor (1674–1689) *Gruffydd ap Cynan,- high altar *Owain Gwynedd, King of Gwynedd ==List of Deans== The Dean is head of the cathedral chapter. There have been fifty-seven recorded Deans. Since January 2016, Kathy Jones has been Dean of Bangor. Previous deans include: ==Organ== Quire The first extant reference to an organ in the cathedral comes in a poem by Gruffudd Gryg, who witnessed the arrival of a new instrument sometime between 1350 and 1370, and records show all the parishioners contributed towards it. Under Bishop Rowlands (1598–1616) arrangements were made for the payment of a stipend to an organist. However, during the episcopate of the next bishop, Lewis Bayly, we hear of one Thomas Boulton playing the organ and complaining that his salary was not paid! During the Commonwealth (1649–60) the organ was either removed or destroyed in accordance with the Parliamentary Order \\"for the speedy demolition of all organs, images and all matters of superstitious monuments in all cathedrals...throughout the kingdom of England and the dominion of Wales.\\" When Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 a new organ was installed: it was paid from a legacy of £100 by Bishop William Roberts; and erected by his successor, Robert Morgan. On the organ case was a Latin verse in which the two bishops, who had provided the money and erected the organ, were compared to David and Solomon respectively. In 1779 the organ was replaced by a new instrument. It cost 360 guineas (£378) and was made by Samuel Green, the leading organ builder of his day. This was in constant use until it was replaced by the present organ which was built by one of the greatest master organ builders of the 19th century: William Hill, who also supplied most of its 4,210 pipes, and installed in 1873, with additions by the same company in 1897. The organ had a major rebuild in 1954 by John Compton, and since then has been used on a daily basis. Numerous students have benefited from study at this instrument and noted organists from all over the world have visited Bangor Cathedral especially to play the organ and give public concerts. Between 2006 and 2008, David Wells Organ Builders Ltd of Liverpool rebuilt the organ. The solo soundboard is now located in the crossing arch into the north transept and is the unenclosed choir organ. The choir soundboard in the organ chamber has become the solo soundboard and has been turned round to face through the transept arch. It has been raised high to allow space for toilet and kitchen facilities on the ground floor. A new vestry has been built on the first floor for servers. The new console is placed in the north transept. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. ===List of organists and directors of music=== *1644 Thomas Bolton *1689 (A Vicar Choral) ? *1691 Thomas Roberts *1705 ?

Betancourt and Costis Davaras, for Temple University. Archaeological materials in this seaport, sited above its harbor, to which it was connected by cliffside stairs, span the period from the end of the Neolithic in the 4th millennium to the Late Bronze Age, with the cultural high point being Early Minoan to Late Minoan IB. At that time the prosperous town of some 60 buildings was ranged round its open square (plateia), with a single large building that occupied one side. Like many contemporary Late Minoan IB sites, it was violently destroyed, 1550-1450 BC. — A standard current Minoan chronology A remnant of its population cleared spaces in the rubble and for a time continued to dwell in the ruined town. ===Minoan civilisation=== Minoan Crete: Pseira lies off the coast northwest of Gournia. A Minoan seal-stone from the site representing a ship is a reminder that the harbour was essential. The Minoan community supported itself by fishing and subsistence agriculture: They deeply tilled and terraced agricultural sites where they manured the thin limy soil with human waste from the settlement. They did not enclose their planting sites, as the island's much later Byzantine practice was, a sign that goats did not roam free in Minoan Pseira; neither were pigs kept. Dams collected seasonal run-off, for water was scarce on the island, though the Aegean region was less dry in the second millennium BCE than now. ===Minoan cemetery=== Consistent with the long period of occupation, burials in the necropolis west of the town are of five kinds: Neolithic rock shelter burials; cist graves built of vertical slabs with Cycladic parallels; small rock-built tombs; jar burials; and tombs imitating houses. Artifacts from the necropolis included clay vases, stone vessels, obsidian, bronze tools and jewelry. Burials broke off in Middle Minoan, before the town underwent its Late Minoan expansion. The Late Minoan I building that occupies the northern side of the plateia, cautiously identified as a \\"civic shrine\\", featured painted stucco bas-reliefs in its upper floor and retains a fresco fragment of two women in Minoan dress of complicated woven design who face one another. Excavations at Pseira have been clouded by successive development in prehistoric stages obfuscating respective earlier stages, in contrast with more clearly defined strata in Knossos, for example. ===House of the Rhyta=== Excavation at the House of the Rhyta disclosed evidence for some Minoan cult practice that add to our understanding of some Minoan rites, though the core meaning they evoked escapes us. In three different structures cult activity involved the use of rhyta, drinking vessels in several forms, all with a hole at the base, a bull-shaped vessel, triton shells, and chalices, and a large number of cups. \\"Cult practices involving large numbers of rhyta continued into successive periods in the Late Bronze Age, as is demonstrated by an interesting religious structure at Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra, Syria) with 15 rhyta, including Mycenaean and Minoan examples,\\" Betancourt observes. Chemical traces in a rhyton suggest barley, beer, and wine. All of these ritual vessels were stored in between their periodic seasonal use, when large groups would gather in upper-floor rooms that had lime-washed and painted stucco reliefs on the walls and a floor that was ritually whitewashed (in the building fronting the plateia) or paved with stone slabs (House of the Rhyta). In the House of the Rhyta, there was a kitchen space below, too substantial for the occupants of the building alone; it had a corner hearth, a mortar built into bedrock in the opposite corner, and grinding rocks. The drinking rites that were observed in the upper room were apparently accompanied by feasting.

Her route connects Metlakatla on Annette Island to Ketchikan. == Construction and characteristics == The state of Alaska issued contracts for a ferry dock at Metlakatla in 1973. The town was originally served by Alaska Marine Highway System ferry M/V Chilkat. The terminal was later modified for use by M/V LeConte and M/V Aurora instead. During the summer there were several stops a week, but in the winter, the town had one ferry visit per week. Metlakatla residents argued for daily service, so that people could commute to work in Ketchikan. The state of Alaska issued a request for proposals for the design of a Metlakatla ferry on May 30, 2000. The Alaska Legislature appropriated $3 million for a new ferry and $880,000 for a new ferry terminal for it to dock at as part of the state's 2001 budget. Lituya was designed by Coastwise Engineering of Juneau, Alaska in 2001. She was built by Conrad Shipyards in Morgan City, Louisiana, which won the contract in November 2002. She was christened In Morgan City on December 13, 2004 by Carolyn Leman, wife of Alaska Lieutenant Governor Loren Leman. Her contract price was $9.5 million. Lituya is long, with a beam of , and a full-load draft of . Her displacement is 647 long tons. Her gross tonnage calculated under international rules is 758, while her U.S. register tonnage is 97. Her hull is constructed of welded steel plates. For propulsion, Lituya has two Caterpillar 3508 B diesel engines rated at 1000 hp. These drive two three-bladed fixed- pitch propellers which are in diameter. Electrical power aboard is provided by a Caterpillar 3304 generator which is rated at 105 kW. Her 200 hp bow thruster is powered by a Caterpillar 3406 C engine which can also be used as a back-up electrical generator. She cruises at 11.5 knots, at which speed she burns 55 gallons of diesel fuel per hour. Lituya has an open vehicle deck with of lanes which can accommodate 15 standard-sized vehicles. The open vehicle deck saves money by reducing various regulatory requirements and allows for over-height vehicles, but users dislike having their cars covered in salt spray. She has a passenger capacity of 125. She is intended for day use only on her short route so there are no crew quarters or passenger staterooms. There is no food service aboard. She normally sails with a crew of 5. All Alaska Marine Highway ferries are named after Alaskan glaciers. Lituya is named for the Lituya Glacier near Lituya Bay. She received her name through an essay contest for Metlakatla grade-school children. Second-grader Josiah Milne won the contest for suggesting the name in 2003. == Operating history == Lituya began making two roundtrips per day between Metlakatla and Ketchikan in the spring of 2005. During the night of January 30, 2009, the ship came loose from its moorings in Metlakatla while unmanned. She drifted about a mile, running up on Scrub Island in Port Chester harbor. Winds at the time averaged with gusts to ; seas were . Two tugs and USCGC Anthony Petit were dispatched to assist in refloating Lituya. The hull was intact but for a small leak in a forward void which the ship's pumps easily handled. The port keel cooler appeared to be leaking coolant. About 2,000 gallons of diesel fuel were spilled, likely from a tank vent when the ship listed while aground. The ship was towed to Ketchikan for repairs. Metlakatla residents began working on a road to the north end of Annette Island as early as 1946 in order to reduce sailing times to Ketchikan. During the early 1990s they met with a number of state and federal authorities regarding the project. A critical connection was made with the Department of Defense which sought projects for its \\"Innovative Readiness Training Program\\". It saw the project as \\"Operation Alaskan Road\\", a real- world exercise for its engineers and mechanics that simulated the rough conditions of the Korean Peninsula. The state of Alaska was also interested in the project and commissioned a cost/benefit study of the road in 1995. This work resulted in a memorandum of agreement between multiple federal and state authorities and the Metlakatla Indian Community which was signed on May 29, 1997. Construction began during the summer of 1997 on the 14.5 mile Walden Point Road from Metlakatla in the south of Annette Island to Annette Bay in the north. The road took ten years to build and was dedicated in 2007. Over 12,000 military personnel worked on the road during its construction. Funding from the Department of Defense alone totaled $75 million. The state of Alaska built a new $10 million ferry terminal at the end of the Walden Point Road. In July 2013 Lituya began using the new terminal, cutting travel time to Ketchikan in half. In January 2017 fare collection policies were changed. Established fares were doubled from Ketchikan to Annette Bay while the trip back was free. This allowed tickets to be sold only in the more-developed Ketchikan terminal, saving time and effort. Lituya was diverted from her normal schedule in May and June 2020. The Inter-Island Ferry Authority's ship M/V Prince of Wales suffered a major propulsion system failure while her sister ship M/V Stikine was already in the shipyard for repairs. This left Prince of Wales Island without ferry service. Lituya made several runs on the Hollis - Ketchikan route before Stikine could be returned to service. In a similar manner, Inter-Island Ferry Authority ships have provided service to Annette Island when Lituya was under repair. Lituya has been well-used and relatively economical over the years. In 2006, for example, she embarked 28,302 passengers and 7,554 vehicles. From 2007 to 2009 the average annual cost of operating Lituya was $1,569,000. Like all ships in the Alaska Marine Highway System, she is subsidized by the state of Alaska. A 2020 study found that Lituya comes closest to breaking even, but still requires an annual subsidy of $370,000. In August 2020, Lituya was scheduled to complete two round-trips per day, five days per week. Each one-way sailing between Ketchikan and Annette Bay takes about 45 minutes. ==References== Category:Alaska Marine Highway System vessels Category:2004 ships ","title":"MV Lituya"},{"id":"3262479","text":"Mystic Chords of Memory is the debut album by American alternative rock band Mystic Chords of Memory, released on Rough Trade Records in 2004. ==Track listing== ==References== ==External links== * Category:Mystic Chords of Memory albums Category:Rough Trade Records albums Category:2004 debut albums ","title":"Mystic Chords of Memory (album)"},{"id":"3262482","text":"Imam Sayyid Abd Allah ibn Alawi al-Haddad (; ) (born in 1634 CE) was a Yemeni Islamic scholar. He lived his entire life in the town of Tarim in Yemen's Valley of Hadramawt and died there in 1720 CE (1132 Hijri). He was an adherent to the Ashari Sunni Creed of Faith (Aqeedah), while in Islamic jurisprudence (Fiqh), he was a Shafi'i. In spite of being a major source of reference among the Sunni Muslims (especially among Sufis), only recently have his books began to receive attention and publication in the English-speaking world. Their appeal lies in the concise way in which the essential pillars of Islamic belief, practice, and spirituality have been streamlined and explained efficiently enough for the modern reader. Examples of such works are The Book of Assistance, The Lives of Man, and Knowledge and Wisdom. ==Life== ===Early life=== Abd Allah (or Abdullah) was born on Sunday night, 5th Safar, 1044 AH (1634 CE) in al-Subayr, a village on the outskirts of Tarim in Hadramawt. His father was Alawi bin Muhammad al-Haddad, a pious man of taqwa, from the people of Allah. Imam al-Haddad's paternal grandmother, Salma, was also known to be a woman of gnosis and sainthood. His mother was Salma bint Aidrus bin Ahmad al- Habshi. His maternal great-grandfather, Ahmad al-Habshi, met Imam al-Haddad's father, prior to Imam al-Haddad's father knowing Imam al-Haddad's mother and he said to Imam al-Haddad's father \\"Your children are my children, and there is a blessing in them\\". As a Sayyid, his sanctity and direct experience of God are clearly reflected in his writings, which include several books, a collection of Sufi letters, and a volume of mystical poetry. His family lineage is as follows: Abdullah bin Alwi bin Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Alwi bin Ahmad bin Abu Bakar bin Ahmad bin Abu Bakar bin Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Ahmad bin Abdurrahman bin Alwi 'Ammil Faqih bin Muhammad Shohib Marbat bin Kholi Qasam bin Alwi bin Muhammad Shohib As-Shouma’ah bin Alwi Shohib Saml bin Ubaidillah Shohibul Aradh bin Ahmad al- Muhajir, which is traced back to Muhammad. The first person of Ba 'Alawi sada to acquire the surname al-Haddad (The Ironsmith) was Imam al-Haddad's ancestor, Sayyid Ahmad bin of Abu Bakr. The Sayyid, who lived in the ninth century of the Hijra, took to sitting at the ironsmith’s shop in Tarim much of the time, hence he was called Ahmad al-Haddad (Ahmad the Ironsmith). The Imam was tall and fair skinned. Smallpox caused him permanent blindness before the age of five. This does not seem to have affected his personality or scholarship, in memorizing the whole Qur'an or even his look, as no scars remained on his face. “In my childhood,” he testifies, “I was never treated like one who didn’t see, neither in walking nor in playing.” From a young age, he was trained as a religious scholar given to very intense worship and spiritual struggle as a child. He also chose the ascetic path, \\"In the beginning, I spent a long period subsisting on coarse food and wearing rough clothes.” Imam al-Haddad would perform recitation a quarter juz (portion) of the Quran practice alone in his youth, prior to the age of 17 in the desert canyons around Tarim. Sometimes he would do this with one of his friends. In Ramadan 1061 A.H (1650 C.E.) while he was still at the age of 17, the Imam entered khalwa (spiritual seclusion), in a zawiyah of the Masjid al-Wujayrah mosque in Tarim. He also married in this same year. He would spend his time in khalwa during the day and then leave to be with his wife at night, at the home of his wife’s family. At night, his servant would lead him to various mosques in Tarim where it is reported he would pray up to 700 Rakat per night. Among the nicknames of Imam al-Haddad was the axis of invitation and spiritual guidance (Al-Qutb At Dawati wal Irshaad). He was also known as the blacksmith of hearts (Haddad al-Quloob). A possible meaning for this would be that they would take a rusted or corroded piece of metal and transform it into a shiny well-formed piece of metal. ===Later life=== Imam al-Haddad lived during Islam’s \\"Period of Decline\\", in which its forces of might and beauty seem to have become exhausted. During his life, the British were already accustomed to trade in Yemen, and the Portuguese had captured the island of Socotra, 350 km off the coast. Muslim expansion had virtually come to a halt. Furthermore, his region of Hadramawt witnessed a simply ruinous period during his life. When Imam al-Haddad was twenty-five, Hadramawt was conquered by the Qasimi Zaydis of Upper Yemen. The Hadramis regained their freedom in 1715 CE; the Imam was eighty-one years of age. Imam al-Haddad died in his home in al-Hawi, Tarim on Monday night 7th or 8th Dhu al-Qi'dah, 1132 AH (1720 C.E.) and buried at Zanbal cemetery in Tarim. His grave is one of the main destinations many people visited when they do a religious tour to Hadhramaut. Imam al-Haddad was survived by six sons. His first son was Zainal Abidin, the second son was Hasan who died in Tarim in 1188 AH, the third one was Salim, the fourth one was Muhammad, where his descendants are in Tarim, the fifth one was Alwi died in Mecca in 1153 AH and his descendants live in Tarim, and the last one was Husin who died in Tarim Tahun, in 1136 AH while his descendants live in Gujarat. ==Education== Imam al-Haddad studied with many of the scholars of his time in Hadhramaut, one of them is his own father. Before he reached the age of 15, his father advised to memorize a book called al-Irshad, an extremely abridged work in Shafii fiqh, but later requested that he would prefer to study the book Bidayat al-Hidayah (Beginning of Guidance) instead of concentrating on jurisprudence. Amongst the foremost of his other teachers was al-Habib al-Qutb Umar bin Abdul-Rahman al-Attas. Imagm Abdul-Rahman al-Attas is known to be the teacher that allowed him to develop some of his spiritual opening as a student. He also studied under several other Ulama of Ba 'Alawi sada, such as al-Habib Agil bin Abdurrahman Al-Segaf, Al-Habib Al-’Allamah Abdurrahman bin Sheikh Aidid, Al-Habib Al-’Allamah Sahl bin Ahmad Bahsin Al- Hudayli Ba’alawi and the great scholar in Mecca, Al-Habib Muhammad bin Alwi Al-Seggaf, and several other Ulama. As a very young man when Imam al-Haddad would recite Sura Yaseen, he would start crying and be overcome with crying. It is believed that his spiritual opening was through Sura Yaseen. He studied Bidayat al-hidayah under the guidance of a scholar, al-Faqih ba-Jubayr. He also studied Ihya' 'ulum al-din (Revival of Religious Sciences) by Imam al- Ghazali under the scholar. Some of Imam al-Haddad ‘s students were his sons, Hasan and Husein al-Haddad, as well as al-Habib Ahmad bin Zayn al-Habshi. al- Habib Ahmad bin Zayn al-Habshi became Imam al-Haddad’s successor in leading the Sufism after his death. ==Works and teachings== Earning his livelihood from the plantations he owned, his life was devoted to teaching and writing. Imam al-Haddad began to teach shortly after he entered khalwa (seclusion). Among the books he taught was Awaarif al-Ma’arif which is a classical work in tasawwuf by Abu Hafs Umar al-Suhrawardi. He did this approximately for 11 years until 1072 A.H. (1661 C.E.). Even the Sultans of his day received letters of admonition and counsel from him. He spent most of his life in Hadramawt where he taught Islamic jurisprudence and classical Sufism according to the Ba 'Alawiyya Sufi order (tariqa). His works revolve around the attainment of certainty (yaqin), the degree of unshakeable faith in Allah and prophet Muhammad. They are void of investigative or dogmatic debates. Furthermore, he does not bring up legal rulings (ahkam fiqhiyya), which would necessitate that his readership be limited to the adherents of his school of law (Shafii). Thus, his works are very well suited, if not purposely designed, for mass readership. His writings are brief because he judged that coming generations would not have time to read large volumes. 'Yaqin' is attained by proper practice of the 'Sunna' in fulfilling obligatory worships and avoiding prohibitions along with sincerity and truthfulness to God. There should be no barriers between the outward forms, the inward essence, and practical applicability of the Islamic teachings. Thus, whoever has knowledge, according to Imam al-Haddad, must teach it to those who need it. He authors several books in the area of Sufism as well as books of dhikr such as the Ratib al- Haddad (, Known as the “Gadat” in the local dialect) and Wird al-Lateef (). He also authors books such as a ten volume series of his short treatises, his volume of poetry, a compilation of his sayings, Risaalat al-Mu\`awanah (The Book of Assistance), an-Nasaih al-Diniyyah wal-Wasaya al-Imaniyyah (Religious Counsels and Faith-based Advices) ==References== ==Sources== ==External links== *Video/Audio from Habib Ali and More *Prophetic Invocation By Imam AL Haddad *The Pure and Saintly Ancestry *Ratib al-Haddad; The Litany of al- Haddad *Sincere Religious Advices from An-Nasa-ih Din-niyyah *Love of the Holy Prophet from Ad-Da'wa-tut-qmmah *The Beginning of the Spiritual Path Risalatu Aadabi Suluk-il-Mourid; The Book of The Mourid *Imam al-Haddad Fons Vitae translation series *Online Halaqa teaching Imam al-Haddad books including: The Book of Assistance and Nasaih al-Diniyya *BaAlawi.com : Ratib Alhaddad In Arabic with Roman Transliteration and Translation in English and Malay (PDF Download Available) *BaAlawi.com : Qasaaids and Written Works Qasaaids (Poetry/Poems) accompanied by Audio Recitation, Written Works are available for download in PDF Format.

Created by Filmation, the film was conceived as a sequel to the 1883 Italian classic novel The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi, being set a year after Pinocchio became a real boy. It was also described by some as a \\"thinly- veiled\\" sequel to Disney's 1940 classic Pinocchio. Disney sued Filmation for copyright infringement, but Filmation won the lawsuit on the grounds that Collodi's work is in the public domain. The film received generally negative reviews from critics during its initial release and underperformed at the box office, costing $10 million but making $3.2 million in its entire run. However, in subsequent years, the film has retained a cult following. == Plot == A bumblebee named Lieutenant Grumblebee is woken from his sleep by the arrival of a large sinister looking ship. A man named Puppetino, a puppet master, remarks that this is the ideal spot for the carnival. Stakes and ropes fly from the ship and a circus tent forms. Grumblebee hastily leaves the area. A year after being made human by the Good Fairy, the dear Pinocchio celebrates his first birthday with Mister Geppetto. The Good Fairy appears and teaches Pinocchio that love is his most powerful gift. She brings to life one of Pinocchio's own carvings, a wooden glow worm, to act as Pinocchio's conscience. Pinocchio, surprised, accidentally names it Gee Willikers. After the party Pinocchio offers to deliver a jewel box to the mayor for Geppetto. En route he encounters Scalawag and Igor, who trick him into trading the box for the \\"Pharaoh's Ruby\\". The ruby turns out to be a fake and Geppetto is furious. Pinocchio runs away in shame, leaving Gee Willikers behind. Pinocchio looks for work at the carnival and is entranced by a blonde marionette named Twinkle. Puppetino recognises Pinocchio and uses Twinkle to lure him into joining the carnival. Puppetino starts playing an organ grinder, causing Pinocchio to dance uncontrollably and slowly transform back into a puppet. Puppetino attaches strings to Pinocchio's hands and feet, completing the transformation, and hangs the now lifeless Pinocchio alongside Twinkle. The Good Fairy appears and awakens Pinocchio, explaining that he lost his freedom because he took it for granted. She reminds him of the importance of choice before restoring him to human form. Pinocchio decides to retrieve the jewel box. Willikers objects, so Pinocchio sets him aside and travels alone. He finds Scalawag the Raccoon and Igor the Monkey, who inform him that the box is at the carnival, which has returned to the ship. The trio pursue the carnival ship by boat. Unbeknownst to Pinocchio, they plan to hand him over to Puppetino in return for a reward, but after Pinocchio saves them from a giant barracuda, they change their minds and begin to genuinely bond with Pinocchio. As they travel, the carnival ship arrives, capturing the boat. Willikers, carried to the river by Grumblebee, latches onto Pinocchio's pocket as they drift into the ship. Scalawag recognizes the ship as the Empire of the Night. A boatman offers Pinocchio a ride to the jewel box, leaving Scalawag and Igor behind. The boatman says the box is in the opposite, darker end of a cavern. Pinocchio prefers the brighter path, and they row to the \\"Neon Cabaret\\". A doorman says that Pinocchio can play inside if he signs a contract. He impulsively agrees, runs inside and finds a room full of partying children. Pinocchio drinks from a fountain of green liquid that causes him to hallucinate and black out. He awakens on a stage; a ringmaster tells him his fans are waiting and he begins dancing. Scalawag and Igor, who have followed Pinocchio, try to get his attention, but are drawn offstage while he is distracted by Twinkle. Pinocchio bows to thunderous applause. Puppetino appears and Pinocchio turns to find the boatman, who transforms into the doorman and then the ringmaster. He tells Pinocchio that he has reached the \\"Land Where Dreams Come True\\" and then morphs into a floating being with four arms called the Emperor of the Night. He demands Pinocchio sign a contract that will make him a puppet again, a choice that will weaken the Good Fairy to her death. Pinocchio refuses and is imprisoned with Scalawag and Igor. Scalawag laments that they have succumbed to their desires without considering the consequences. The Emperor reveals to Pinocchio that Geppetto has been shrunk to fit inside the jewel box. Pinocchio offers to sign the contract if the Emperor frees Geppetto and the others. Pinocchio signs away his freedom, transforming back into a living puppet. The Emperor betrays Pinocchio, telling him that the freedom of choice gives him his power. Pinocchio turns on the Emperor and a blue aura – the light of the Good Fairy – surrounds him. The Emperor shoots bolts of flame at Pinocchio, but the blue light protects him as the ship catches fire. Pinocchio escapes with his friends while the Emperor shoots Puppetino in the back with a bolt of magic for his instant cowardice while he runs for his life. Puppetino turns into a lifeless puppet, and burns to death immediately after. The evil Emperor promises to make Geppetto pay for Pinocchio's choices, but he runs and forms into a blue shining orb and plunges into the Emperor's flaming figure, destroying him and his ship. On the shore, Geppetto has returned to his original size. Scalawag and Igor find Pinocchio, who is once again a real boy. The Good Fairy appears, proudly telling Pinocchio that he no longer needs her. She presents the jewel box to Geppetto. She reveals the now human Twinkle awakening nearby before fading away to the sunrise, leaving the group to celebrate. == Cast == * Scott Grimes as Pinocchio * James Earl Jones as The Emperor of the Night * Don Knotts as Gee Willikers * Tom Bosley as Mister Geppetto * Rickie Lee Jones as The Fairy Godmother/The Good Fairy * Edward Asner as Scalawag the Raccoon * Frank Welker as Igor the Monkey * Lana Beeson as Twinkle * Linda Gary as Bee-atrice * Jonathan Harris as Lt.

Writing for the Chicago Tribune, Dave Kehr labelled it a \\"wooden effort\\" and concluded there was \\"little reason to bother with Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night given that the genuine article is readily available on videotape\\". Janet Maslin of the New York Times called it \\"Saturday morning animation at best\\" and also compared it unfavorably with Disney's version. Charles Solomon of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the script and direction lacked focus and felt the movie \\"illustrates just how badly the American animated feature has degenerated\\". Juan Carlos Coto praised the performances of Rickie Lee Jones and James Earl Jones, but felt the plot was mostly \\"Saturday-morning rehash\\" and also urged readers to watch the Disney movie instead. The Morning Call's reviewer was more favorable, opining that \\"it does dazzle and sparkle in all the right places\\", adding \\"there is much to recommend the new film\\". M. J. Simpson praised the \\"engaging story, likeable characters... genuine tension and horror, reasonable songs and... terrific animation\\" and gave it a B+ rating. Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night was described as a \\"thinly veiled sequel\\" to Disney's 1940 classic Pinocchio; one reviewer noted its many similarities to the original and imagined \\"legions of lawyers poring over every frame\\". Disney sued Filmation for copyright infringement, but lost after Filmation successfully argued that Carlo Collodi's characters were in the public domain.

Literally translated as \\"no water or rain\\", Wailagilala lies to the eastern sea border of the Fiji archipelago in the South Pacific, and is the gateway to Fiji for ships coming or going to Samoa through the Nanuku Passage. Its crystal-clear waters are attributed to its remote location and lack of terrestrial water run-off. The island has an abandoned cast iron lighthouse, long, built about 1909. It is believed to have been prefabricated in England and shipped in sections to the South Pacific. The island has been uninhabited since the lighthouse was converted to automatic operation. Dominated by its lighthouse, the sand island is surrounded by spectacular lagoon and coral reefs. The reef protecting the island has a deep, wide, fairly well marked pass that appears to have been blasted through it, allowing easy passage into the lagoon and the sandy anchorage just off the island. The island is composed of carbonate sands and gravel, and beach-rock. Alexander Agassiz bored a hole there late in the 19th century. It passed through of coarse sand with coral and shell fragments before reaching \\"yellow limestone\\", which continued to the end of the hole at . There are submerged terraces , and possibly below mean sea level, and marine notches and possibly and below MSL. The seabird nesting colony and marine ecosystem of the atoll contribute to its national significance as outlined in Fiji's Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan.

Located at 19.18° South and 179.75° East, Matuku covers an area of 57 square kilometers. It has a maximum elevation of 385 meters. Matuku is part of a group of islands known as Yasayasa Moala. There are altogether seven villages in Matuku namely Yaroi, Natokalau, Qalikarua, Levukaidaku, Makadru, Raviravi and Lomati. There are conflicting accounts on whether or not the island was conquered by the Tongans led by the Tongan Prince Enele Ma'afu. Oral history passed down through the native Matuku people states that the island was not conquered by Enele Ma'afu whilst historical records state other wise. Thomas Williams a missionary in the island group records in a journal entry that Matuku was conquered by Ma'afu in 1853 after a three month long siege at the principle village of Yaroi., The journal of Thomas Williams, missionary in Fiji, 1840-1853. Although journals of Thomas Williams say Matuku was also among the islands conquered by Ma'afu, customs and traditions in the island of Matuku and its people divert from that of other conquered islands in the Lau group. The 'tawala' or mats that are worn around the waist by Tongans during ceremonies are also worn by every island in the Lau group except Matuku. This is a symbolism of victory of the people of Matuku over the Tongan chief and his men. Matuku has produced a number of people who have contributed to the development and progress of Fiji and have held public office during their time. The late Reverend Setareki Tuilovoni hailed from Natokalau, to be the first local President of the Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma since it became an independent entity, and Reveremd Setareki Rika and his family who have either served as Church Ministers, Doctors or Teachers. Dr Macu Salato hailed from Qalikarua who became the Lord Mayor of Suva, Dr Peni Rika hailed from Makadru, along with numerous medical practitioners, teachers, and clergymen. The late Setareki Tuinaceva, who held office with the Fiji Rugby Union for a number of years, hailed from Lomati. Sir Timoci Tuivaga, who served as Fiji's first native-born Chief Justice from 1974 to 2002, was also from Matuku.

The name of zivania is derived from zivana () which means pomace in the Greek dialect of Cyprus. Zivania is colourless and alcoholic with a light aroma of raisins. Its alcohol content varies, with 45% by volume being the typical value. As defined by law, zivania shall not have more than 60% alcohol content. Zivania contains no sugars and has no acidity. ==History== It is unknown when zivania was first produced in Cyprus. Some believe that the method of producing zivania, which resembles that of producing tsipouro, was brought to Cyprus by monks of Mount Athos in the 15th century while others believe that zivania has been produced in Cyprus since the time the Republic of Venice ruled the island, around the end of the 15th century. Evidence of its continued production during Ottoman and British rule of the island comes from writers such as the British writer Samuel Baker who in 1879 reports: \\"...the refuse of skins and stalks is laid upon one side to ferment for the manufacture of raki, or spirit, by distillation...\\". According to the Cyprus law regarding the regulation and control of grape products of 1965 (52/1965) ( zivania is defined as \\"an alcoholic drink containing no more than 60% alcohol per volume which is produced exclusively from the first distillation of wine, grapes and pomace that went through fermentation or raisins or any other remains of the same\\" (). Since 1989, zivania has been protected under EU regulations as a name for grape marc produced in Cyprus.\\" The name 'grape marc' or 'grape marc spirit' may be replaced by the designation Zivania solely for the spirit drink produced in Cyprus.\\" ==Production== The production of zivania starts with the pressing of mature healthy grapes to produce must. The density of the grape must is then checked with a Baumé hydrometer to ensure it has a density value of less than 13° Baumé. This is necessary for the must to achieve complete and proper fermentation. The grape must, together with pomace, are then placed in large containers and let to ferment. Traditionally, the must-pomace mixture was placed in large clay containers (pithos, ). As soon as the fermentation process has completed (i.e. the fermented must is checked and confirmed to have a value of less or equal to 0° Baumé), the fermented must-pomace mixture is transferred to the main container of the still (kazani, ) for the distillation. The traditional zivania still is called lampikos (, ; see also alembic) in the Greek dialect of Cyprus. In some villages of Cyprus, a single lampikos was usually shared by all villagers. The traditional zivania stills are similar to those used for tsikoudia in Crete. Once the main container of the still is hermetically shut, fire is set under it. The fire is monitored and maintained in order to produce constant heat. The first zivania that comes from the still has the highest alcohol content, while the last taken out of the apparatus has a low alcohol content and it is called porakos (). The first zivania is typically discarded as it is not good for drinking because it contains harmful chemicals or is used for massaging sore body parts. Depending on the pre-distillation mixture, different qualities of zivania are produced: * Zivania produced using only wine for the distillation * Zivania produced using wine and pomace for the distillation * Zivania produced using pomace, water and weak zivania ==Storage and transportation== Zivania is usually stored in clean wooden or galvanised metal containers that can be sealed in order to contain evaporation. It can be transferred to glass bottles for short storage or consumption. ==Consumption and other usage== Cypriots consume zivania throughout the year. During the summer, zivania is served ice cold. Zivania is not usually consumed alone and it is typically served with dried nuts, loukoumi, shoushouko or small appetizers like Cypriot loukaniko, lountza and tsamarella. Before the introduction of beer and other alcoholic drinks in Cyprus, the main alcoholic drinks Cypriots consumed were wine and zivania. In some villages of Cyprus, cinnamon is added to zivania giving it a distinct red colour, aroma and flavour. When zivania is left to age, it gains stronger flavour and aroma. Aged zivania is highly valued and is kept for consumption during special occasions or as a welcoming treat for visitors. Zivania, in addition to its use as an alcoholic beverage, it is also used to treat wounds, for massaging sore body parts, as a remedy for colds and toothaches, and as a warming-up drink during the cold months of winter, especially in the villages of the Troodos mountains. ==Authenticity== To establish the authenticity of zivania, chemical studies were contacted to investigate which of the metals analyzed constitute diagnostic parameters that establish authenticity. The results of the studies establish that zivania is related to the unique geological and climatic conditions existing on the island of Cyprus.Authenticity of the Traditional Cypriot Spirit \\"Zivania\\" on the Basis of H NMR Spectroscopy Diagnostic Parameters and Statistical Analysis Authenticity of the traditional Cypriot spirit zivania ==Photos== Image:Zivania.jpgA bottle of Cypriot Zivania.

It has an area of , making it the ninth largest island of Fiji. The highest point on the island of Moala, at a maximum elevation of , is called Delaimoala which has rich vegetation and consists of dark thick forest. The population of around 3000 live in eight villages. The chiefly village of these is Naroi, whose population is over 500. Economic activities include coconut farming, cocoa production, fishing and yaqona (kava) production. Oral history of the Island depicted by the genealogical records which is funded by the British through Ratu Sukuna, whose mother is from Naocovonu. The genealogical records or Vola-ni-Kawa Bula kei Viti abbreviated as VKB, dictates that all Moalans are to be registered under two great sons of pre-Colonial Fiji, and these are: Kubuavanua (now claimant to the title Tui Moala) and Rovarovaivalu. This separates the Island into two sub-regions: Moala Levu (as the claimant want to call themselves) and Moala Lailai. Moala Levu includes the clan that called themselves Yavusa Ratu, and Turagalevu or Turaga Ulu), whose influence is mainly felt on the north-west of the island from Naroi to Vadra. Moala Lailai, whose village of influence once felt all over the islands from Manukui (post- Colonially called Vunuku) and Wainikelei (post-Colonially referred to as Keteira). These group of Moalans are on the south and eastern end of the Island from Vunuku, Cakova and to Nasoki. The eight village that occupies the Island is said to be for the children of Rokomautu whose sons include Rovarovaivalu, whose children in known as the \\"yavusa tinitini\\" (the clans of ten or ten clans), led by Naivalukuru. The village initially settled were Wainikelei, with later settlers being Yavusa Ratu from Verata and Yavusa Nacuritutu on their return from Tonga. The three clans settled in the bay in proximity of each other. The villages that occupy Moala first was Wainikelei (post-colonial Keteira); followed by Nasau or Korosau (Naroi); Manukui (Vunuku; Cakova and Nasoki); Keteicake (Turagalevu), and later Nuku, Vadra, and; Maloku. The latter villages were results of tokens of war between Manukui and Nasau. Post-Colonial Fiji resulted in the relocation of Nasau to Naroi today and the resettlement of Manukui to Vunuku, Cakova and Nasoki. Other settlers came in the form of Vadra, Nuku and Maloku from other parts of Fiji as a formalization of their effort in the last tribal war that occurred on the Island, that politicised the establishment through the effort to registration Fijians by Sukuna (Rt). Unfortunately the island of moala has been facing problems in their fishing industry, forcing them to import from the main land of Viti Levu, mostly tinned fish. Pollution of the sea has been a major factor that has driven marine life away from the island and worse killing them especially towards north of the island in Naroi. The Methodist Church is strong in Moala. Other Protestant beliefs exist in Moala today and these include the JW's; SDA's, as well as Catholicism or relative thereof. Since the island is populated by Indigenous population, which surprisingly was not by the well known Maafu movement as depicted by some. Josaia Donumaibulu one of the first laymen of Moalan stock to bring biblical message to the island, was rejected by his own kin in Nasau, hence he settled with his relative and kin in Wainikelei. [The church first missionary or laymen to reach the island was a Tongan, whose name is yet unknown, and house of worship before it was burned to the ground is located near, now Vunuku]. Donumaibulu served his last mission in Rewa where he died and was commemorated and named after the church (building) at Lomanikoro. Local folk stories, well known to all, despised by many, depict that \\"Rokomautu\\" (the sturdy one), however, remained on the island upon arrival on the Kaunitoni (dipping stick), on a maiden voyage° approved by his father, the \\"Ratu\\". In other folk stories, the Ratu left Totoya, and made his way to now known Verata, which upon his deathbed render the race on the \\"nukukatudrau\\" (hundred fathomed beach) of all his eldest sons' to appoint his successor. This resulted in treachery that shook the Fijian historical narrative and culture to its core. Other popular, now, legends have it that Kubunavanua came to Moala from Tonga, upon returning on the Kaunitera. Kaunitera is his way of taking over the Kaunitoni, by way of changing its name and made his voyage to Tonga. Thus the name, \\"Kubuavanua\\" or \\"Kabuavanua\\" (shadows of land). Note, legends have it that his return was not acceptable to his clan at Moala as he eloped the high princess (\\"tabusiga\\") of Tonga, this supposedly ensured a rescue party from Tonga which seemingly in the face of Maafu. Kubuavanua led the group that calls themselves the \\"Turagalevu\\" or \\"Big King\\". Folk history would have these two, Rokomautu and Kubuavanua, to be of the first landers or land people, with Rokomautu of the Tuiwai stock and Kuduavanua the Tura stock or the progeny of Degei and Lutunasosba respectively. Local legends has it that the Tuiwai Stock are akin to sailing whose natural skill in navigation is immediately experienced when at the helm. Legend has it that the two stock both arrived at Moala, the Tuiwai stock stayed behind while the Tura stock took helm to Tonga, taskin with them the Kaunitoni, and returning with a new name Kaunitera. The purpose of each name Tuiwai and Tura was akin to duties each have on every sea voyage: the Tuiwai stock took the helm, while the Tura stock is to change of the mast that must be transferred to either end of the canoe when necessitated to catch wind. Thus the two bow design of Fijian sailing canoe. Soon before Colonial era, ensured after the Manukui War, the Navucunimasi (now commonly referred to as Namoala), on their arrival saw that the island is already occupied and thus the name of the Island \\"Muala\\" (just get on)). The Nasau clan is believed to be from Verata (the winner of the nukukatudrau race), on the west of Wainikelei and/or Keteira today decided to solidify their claim to chiefdom by bestowing the Tui Nasau, after the Manukui war. Soon after the Colonials stepped into forcing the establishment of the Tui Moala, which the Tui Nasau agreed to appoint let the Turagaevu at the time and was instructed: \\"to represent/entertain Government at Naroi, whilst bringing all news and request to the Tui Nasau for deliberation to the \\"vanua\\" or other Villages\\". The bestowment of the Tui Nasau was only made possible by the Wainikelei stock, despite not being remotely related to the Manukui War. Legend has it that to complete the ritual, a basket of soil and a bunch of young coconuts will have to be presented as the symbol of land and people. Since neither in the warring faction have such status, the elders at Wainekeli was approached and agreed in the name of peace to partake in the bestowment ceremony. The Moalan stock are one of Fiji oldest in the group, whose respect and strength can be adorned by the linkage between the island and a few islands in the Fiji group, including Taveuni, Verata, Bau, Gau, Levuka, Cicia, Vatoa, Ono Kadavu and a few others. For instance the Tuicakau in denoted to be of Moalan stock, who legends have it to be bestowed as Tuicakau by villages upon seeing him on the reef. Lineage also ran from village to village in the Lomaitivi group, to the Takalai Gau. ==References== Category:Islands of Fiji Category:Lau Islands ","title":"Moala Island"},{"id":"3262568","text":"Elgood's Brewery in Wisbech Elgood's is a family-owned regional brewery in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, England, which was established in 1795. ==History== The North Brink Brewery, on the north bank of the River Nene in Wisbech, was established in 1795 and purchased six years later by William Watson and Abraham Usill. Both owners recognised the importance of acquiring public houses that would sell the produce of the brewery instead of brewing their own and eventually raised the number of tied houses to forty. Watson died in 1836, Phillips, Tibbitts and Phillips took over the brewery. The partnership failed and the business was put up for auction in 1853. Phillips continued until 1877 when the business was auctioned. In 1878, it came under the control of the Elgood family. In 1882 two pubs were advertised to be let In 1886 George Harrison, the junior partner to John Elgood was reported in financial difficulties. After it was bought by the Elgood family, the building was renovated in the Georgian style and most of it is still in use today. It was one of the first classic Georgian breweries outside London. Nigel and Anne Elgood's three daughters, Belinda Sutton, Jennifer Everall and Claire Simpson, are the fifth generation of the family to run the business. In the First World War, the brewery was fire-bombed by a Zeppelin, and the shell of the bomb can still be viewed in the brewery museum. In the Second World War, some of the metal vats and tuns were melted down, but the brewery retained its 17th- century Eagle Foundry (Wisbech) liquor vat. The brewery was listed as Grade II in 1983. In the brewery gardens there is a landscaped mound, on top of which stands Brewery House. This mound is the outside of the original cold store for the beer. In the First and Second World Wars the cellar doubled as an air-raid shelter. Today the cellar is unused, but the entrance is still visible from the current cold store.

When opened, the beer were said to taste like wet boots according to brewer and microbiologist, Dr Keith Thomas. Upon examining the beer under a microscope, he found a small percentage of the yeast was still alive. He spent months growing this yeast and brewed a porter using an 1850 recipe.“The Brew Site: Original Flag Porter” 29 August 2008 ==References== == External links == * Elgood & Sons Ltd Category:Wisbech Category:Companies based in Cambridgeshire Category:Breweries in England Category:British companies established in 1795 Category:Food and drink companies established in 1795 Category:1795 establishments in England ","title":"Elgood's Brewery"},{"id":"3262571","text":"Alfred John Barnes (17 July 188726 November 1974) was a British Labour Co- operative politician. Born in North Woolwich, he was the youngest child of William Barnes, a docker. Barnes lost a leg in a fairground accident at the age of 8. He was educated at the Northampton Institute and the Central School of Arts and Crafts. Barnes worked originally as an artist in gold and silver. He was an early member of the Independent Labour Party and was heavily involved in the co-operative movement. He was chairman of the London Co- operative Society for nine years until 1923 and was a founder of the Co- operative Party. He became the Party's chairman in 1924 and served until 1945. He was also a director and President of the National Cooperative Publishing Society. In November 1922, Barnes was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for East Ham South. In 1925, he was appointed a Labour Whip and served as a whip in Government, as Junior Lord of the Treasury. However, he was forced to resign in October 1930 - although his position as a director of the National Cooperative Publishing Society was unpaid, parliamentary rules dictated that a minister cannot be a director of a public company (although they could be of a private company): Barnes chose to remain on the co-op board rather than as a whip. Like many Labour MPs, he lost his seat in the 1931 general election but regained it in 1935. In 1945, Barnes was made a Privy Counsellor and Minister of War Transport, later Minister of Transport, serving until the fall of the Labour government in 1951. He stood down as a Member of Parliament at the 1955 general election. ==References== ==External links== * *The Times Guides to the House of Commons, Times Newspapers Ltd, 1945, 1950, 1951 *(2003) The Times Guides to the House of Commons, 1929, 1931, 1935, Politico's Publishing (reprint). * Category:1887 births Category:1974 deaths Category:Labour Co- operative MPs for English constituencies Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Ministers in the Attlee governments, 1945–1951 Category:Participants in the Norway Debate Category:People from North Woolwich Category:Secretaries of State for Transport (UK) Category:UK MPs 1922–1923 Category:UK MPs 1923–1924 Category:UK MPs 1924–1929 Category:UK MPs 1929–1931 Category:UK MPs 1935–1945 Category:UK MPs 1945–1950 Category:UK MPs 1950–1951 Category:UK MPs 1951–1955 ","title":"Alfred Barnes (Labour politician)"},{"id":"3262572","text":"Morandi is a Romanian eurodance music group composed of Randi (Andrei Ropcea) and Marius Moga. Morandi became a dance legend over a decade ago and was listened in over 20 countries, performed all around Eastern Europe and received numerous awards. They had 8 #1 singles (local and/or International airplay charts); Reverse, their debut album, was sold in over 2 million copies; 2 nominations at the MTV Europe Music Awards for Best Romanian Act (in 2005 and 2006) and the trophy in 2008; Their hit, Angels, was the most downloaded digital song of that time in Russia & Ukraine (more than 2 million downloads) and peaked at #16 of the official French music chart. ==Musical career== Andrei Ropcea (Randi) in 2011 Marius Moga in 2011 Morandi’s music was always under the sign of the effervescent eastern European creativity, exploring the different facets of love through their epic dance music and their videos. Starting with Kalinka, in 2018, Morandi came with a fresh, new sound. The song continues Morandi’s musical evolution, maintaining their notorious deep-melancholic top-lines, but shifting the production to a groovy electronic disco. The song was a massive TV/Radio & streaming platform success. Poland, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Russia, Croatia, Hungary, Israel, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Austria, Cyprus, Ecuador, Estonia, Moldova, Sri Lanka and The United Arab Emirates are the countries where Kalinka became one of the most listened to songs. What followed was a power collab with famous Dutch DJ, Burak Yeter, for a remix of “Kalinka” and an urban version of the song with US based rapper, Swanny Ivy. == Discography == ===Studio albums=== * Reverse (2005) * Mindfields (2006) * N3XT (2007) == Singles == The single \\"Angels\\" sold 1.45 million copies in Russia and went 7x platinum as ring-back tone and gold as realtone.https://web.archive.org/web/20110724033908/http://2m-online.ru/news/detail.php?ID=5655http://www.2m-online.ru/news/detail.php?ID=5653 The single \\"Save Me\\" went 2x platinum with 400,000 copies soldhttp://2m-online.ru/news/detail.php?ID=5658 { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of singles, with selected chart positions - !scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Year !scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:18em;\\" Title !scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"9\\" Peak chart positions !scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Album - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font- size:90%;\\"ROM For peak positions in Romania: *For top 10 peak positions on the \\"Romanian Top 100\\": *For peak positions on the \\"Airplay 100\\": Note: Click one podcast to hear the chart of that week. ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font- size:90%;\\"RUS ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\"SVK ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\"BUL ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\"CZR ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\"POL ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\"HUN ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\"FRA lescharts.com - Discographie Morandi ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font- size:90%;\\"US Digital - align=\\"left\\" rowspan=22004 align=\\"left\\"\\"Love Me\\" align=\\"center\\"3 align=\\"center\\"212 align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"1 align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Reverse - align=\\"left\\"\\"Beijo (Uh-La-La)\\" align=\\"center\\"1 align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"54 align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— - align=\\"left\\" rowspan=32006 align=\\"left\\"\\"Falling Asleep\\" align=\\"center\\"1 align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Mindfields - align=\\"left\\"\\"A La Lujeba\\" align=\\"center\\"1 align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— - align=\\"left\\"\\"Oh La La\\" (English version of \\"Beijo\\") align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"—  - align=\\"left\\" rowspan=22007 align=\\"left\\"\\"Afrika\\" align=\\"center\\"2 align=\\"center\\"105 align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\"— align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"3\\" N3XT - align=\\"left\\"\\"Angels (Love Is the Answer)\\" align=\\"center\\"1 align=\\"center\\"1 align=\\"center\\"1 align=\\"center\\"1 align=\\"center\\"1 align=\\"center\\"1Nielsen Music Control - Polish Airplay Chart.

His father was Stephen Eric Sebag Montefiore (1926–2014) and his mother was Phyllis April Sebag-Montefiore, née Jaffé, (1927–2019). His brother is Hugh Sebag-Montefiore, and his great-great- uncle, is Sir Moses Montefiore. His mother, Phyllis April Jaffé, comes from the Lithuanian branch of the Jaffe family. Her parents fled the Russian Empire at the beginning of the 20th century. They bought tickets for New York City, but were cheated, being instead dropped off at Cork, Ireland. Due to the Limerick boycott in 1904 Montefiore's maternal grandfather Henry Jaffé left the country and moved to Newcastle upon Tyne, England. The Montefiore family are descended from a line of wealthy Sephardi Jews who were diplomats and bankers all over Europe and who originated from Morocco and Italy. After the Alhambra Decree was issued against the Jews in Spain of 1492, some of Montefiore's ancestors stayed in the country whilst remaining secretly Jewish. During the reign of Philip II of Spain, one of them became governor of a province of Mexico, where he and his family were denounced by a political rival and tortured by the Inquisition. Two teenaged girls were burned alive in Mexico City while a son escaped to Italy and changed his name to Montefiore. Montefiore was educated at Ludgrove School and Harrow School where he was editor of the school newspaper, The Harrovian; he interviewed Margaret Thatcher for The Harrovian in the autumn of 1983. He won an Exhibition to read history at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge where he received his Doctorate of Philosophy (PhD). ==Career== Montefiore worked as a banker, a foreign affairs journalist, and a war correspondent covering the conflicts during the fall of the Soviet Union. Montefiore's book Catherine the Great & Potemkin was shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize, the Duff Cooper Prize, and the Marsh Biography Award. Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar won History Book of the Year at the 2004 British Book Awards.Galaxy British Book Awards: History Book of the Year 2004 Young Stalin won the LA Times Book Prize for Best Biography, the Costa Book Award, the Bruno Kreisky Award for Political Literature, Le Grand Prix de la Biographie Politique and was shortlisted for the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. Jerusalem: The Biography was a number one non-fiction Sunday Times bestseller and a global bestseller and won The Jewish Book of the Year Award from the Jewish Book Council. His latest history book is The Romanovs, 1613–1918. Montefiore's debut novel King's Parade was published in 1991. The Spectator called the book \\"embarrassing\\" and \\"extremely silly\\". Montefiore is also the author of the novels One Night in Winter and Sashenka. One Night in Winter won the Political Novel of the Year Prize and was longlisted for the Orwell Prize. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and a Visiting Professor of Humanities at the University of Buckingham. ==Personal life== Montefiore lives in London with his wife, the novelist Santa Montefiore, and their two children. ==Films and TV drama series== Several of Montefiore's books are now being developed as either films or TV drama series.

Also in early 2017, the film studio Lionsgate Films announced it had bought Montefiore's Jerusalem: the Biography to make it into a long running multi episodic TV drama series which will be 'character-driven, action-filled account of war, betrayal, faith, fanaticism, slaughter, persecution and co-existence in the universal holy city through the ages.'Hollywood Reporter, 5 March 2017.

Olga Grushin in the New York Times observed that the book is 'Spellbinding ... This monumental work is an essential addition to the library of anyone interested in Russian history'.New York Times, 16 May 2016. Stephen Kotkin in the Wall Street Journal praised the book and noted that 'No author writes better than Montefiore whose perceptiveness and portraiture here are frequently sublime ... a marvellous read and the last third from fin de siecle insanity to revolutionary cataclysm is dazzling ...'.Wall Street Journal, 20 May 2016. The historian Antony Beevor noted that the book provided 'Epic history on the grandest scale'.Financial Times, 15 January 2016. For The Observer John Kampfner described Montefiore's book as 'Riveting ... the research is meticulous and the style is captivating'.The Observer, 25 January 2016. ==Fiction reviews== Montefiore has written a Moscow Trilogy of fictional thrillers, set in Russia. These have received positive reviews. Sashenka (2008) was described by the Washington Post as 'Spellbinding. Sashenka is a historical whodunit with the epic sweep of a Hollywood movie.

The Wall Street Journal praised 'This superb novel. Sashenka is unforgettable. Inspiring. Montefiore proves a matchless storyteller, his prose harrowing and precise.'Wall Street Journal, 5 December 2008.

She attended Market Harborough Upper School (now Robert Smyth School), then Lincoln Christ's Hospital School, both comprehensive schools. She studied English at Clare College, Cambridge, graduating with a lower second class degree (2:2). == Career == ===Journalism=== Pearson began her career with the Financial Times, where she was a sub-editor, before moving to The Independent and then The Independent on Sunday in 1992. There she was assistant to Blake Morrison before becoming a TV critic, winning the award for Critic of the Year at the British Press Awards in 1993. Pearson was a columnist with London's Evening Standard and The Daily Telegraph, then took over from Lynda Lee-Potter at the Daily Mail. Pearson ended her column for the Daily Mail in April 2010, when it was said that she was to join The Daily Telegraph. In September 2010, Pearson resumed her role as a columnist with The Daily Telegraph. As of 2015, Pearson was a columnist and chief interviewer of The Daily Telegraph. Pearson has presented Channel 4's and BBC Radio 4's The Copysnatchers, and participated as a panellist on Late Review, the predecessor of Newsnight Review. ===Books=== Pearson's first novel, I Don't Know How She Does It (2002), is a \\"chick lit\\" examination of the pressures of modern motherhood. The book was a bestseller in the UK and the US, selling four million copies, and was made into a film. Pearson was sued by Miramax for non- delivery of a second novel, I Think I Love You, for which she received a US$700,000 advance in 2003. Delivery was due in 2005: it was published in 2010. The novel was about a teenager's passion for David Cassidy in the 1970s and the man writing the so-called replies from David Cassidy to the teenage fans, who meet up 20 years later after marriage, divorce, and children. Her newspaper, The Telegraph, praised the novel for its warmth and sincerity; The Guardian declared it an \\"unrealistic and sappy romance\\". A sequel to I Don't Know How She Does It was published in September 2017. The novel, How Hard Can It Be, continues the story of the protagonist Kate Reddy, now approaching 50 and struggling with bias against older women in the workplace. The book attracted considerable publicity but failed to become a bestseller. == Controversies == Pearson was listed in Spiked in 2007 as one of many journalists who had been duped by the anti-MMR campaign. This anti-MMR campaign has contributed to the significant rise in measles cases and complications including death that arise from the disease in the UK and elsewhere. In May 2007, when Madeleine McCann went missing, Pearson said \\"This kind of thing doesn't usually happen to people like us.\\" In May 2008, Pearson upset Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, by suggesting her daughter Princess Beatrice was overweight. On the TV programme, This Morning, the Duchess criticised the absent columnist. Pearson denied claims that she had failed to respond to multiple phone calls from the Duchess. Less than an hour after the first of the 22 March 2016 Belgian bombings, Pearson suggested that the attacks were a justification for the Brexit cause in the then-upcoming referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union, writing on Twitter that \\"Brussels, de facto capital of the EU, is also the jihadist capital of Europe. And the Remainers dare to say we're safer in the EU!\\". The tweet was widely criticised as \\"ill-considered\\" and \\"shameless\\". Following the May 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, Pearson called for the introduction of internment. In September 2019, Pearson falsely accused a man with a seriously ill child of wearing a microphone when confronting Prime Minister Boris Johnson, due to the man's allegiance to the opposition Labour Party. Despite being presented with evidence that this was untrue, Pearson did not issue an apology and defended her accusation. In September 2019 Pearson suggested that Angela Rayner was unsuitable to be Shadow Education Secretary because Rayner didn't get a GCSE grade above D upon leaving school in 1996. In December 2019, Pearson falsely claimed that a photo of a child lying on the floor of a hospital was staged and that she had been given “detailed explanation” that the photo was staged. She also said that the photo was “100% faked”. The trust that runs Leeds General Infirmary issued a statement which apologised to the family that only chairs were available in the treatment room the boy was in and no beds. The hospital’s chief medical officer also apologised. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, which killed over 40,000 people in the UK, Pearson wrote \\"My son has COVID-19. Good.\\", advocating for a herd immunity strategy in which those at lower risk of death from the virus, such as the young, would deliberately be allowed to be infected in order to maximise resistance to the disease in the population. Previously, during the early stages of the pandemic, she had taken the opposite approach, and criticised young people as \\"Generation Me\\" while urging them to practice social distancing, and wondering whether they would \\"start whingeing how “stressy” it all is when the authorities try to curtail their freedom to even a minor degree\\" - the very restrictions on freedom she herself would go on to strongly oppose. In October 2020, Pearson falsely asserted that children are not harmed by COVID-19, and expressed support for anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, writing \\"If [UK Health Secretary Matt] Hancock ever dares to try and vaccinate children... he'll have a revolution on his hands.\\" Pearson followed this with the statement \\"Lockdown does NOT save lives.

It occupies an area of 28 km², making it the smallest of the Yasayasa Moala Group. Its maximum elevation is above sea level. The main economic activity is coconut farming. Totoya falls under the provincial administration of the Lau group. ==Geography== The horseshoe-shaped island is well protected by a high reef. There are a number of boat passages through the surrounding reef. These passages lead into the deep bay that is surrounded by the island. Its surfing is world-renowned, but the difficulty in reaching the island keeps most away. The island has a well-placed jetty, 4 primary schools, not including Vanuavatu, which has its own, a Post office/shop, and radio- telephone stations at Ketei and Dravuwalu. It is accessible technologically by satellite phone provided by Telecom Fiji, but not mobile cellular phones. The island has 4 villages with Tovu, the capital and seat of the Turaga na Roko Sau whose household site is known as \\"Mataiilakeba\\". Ketei is the seat of Tui Ketei, traditionally known as Ramalo, the King maker. The \\"Turaga Ramalo\\" has the ancient and prestigious role of installing Totoya's High chief, a role that has become obsolete because of rivalry. The third village, Dravuwalu, is the seat of Tui Dravuwalu, traditionally known as Nakorowaiwai and Udu, the fourth village, is the seat of Tui Udu, traditionally known as Muaicokalau. The island of Vanuavatu, although closer to the islands of Lakeba and Nayau than the island of Totoya, is listed as the fifth village within the District and is the seat of Tui Vanua. Vanuavatu has historically and traditionally been the personal possession of the Turaga Na Roko Sau, the High Chief of Totoya and the Yasayasa Moala Group as a whole. Further to this in colonial times when the colonial government administratively subdivided the Provinces into districts, with a colonial appointed chief or 'Buli' as leader the island had to fall into a colonially administered district under Totoya. Traditionally the High Chief of Totoya district, Roko Sau has dominion over Vanuavatu island and its people. However, Vanuavatu is the seat of Tui Vanua who answers directly to the Roko Sau. Also present within Vanuavatu is the title of Matakitotoya a representative post which further links the Roko Sau to his people and land of Vanuavatu and avoids any alienation from it. The chiefly village of Tovu (Dawaleka) was shifted from its former site at the opposite side of the island (Navuli) in the 1800s through traditional request from Ramalo and other island chiefs to ease their undertaking of traditional obligations to the Roko Sau, the island's Head Chief. The island is very rich in marine resources and one could have a field day out at sea. One famous delicacy is Lairo or land crabs, which are plentiful all year round. Giant sea clam, a variety of seaweeds and just about any variety of fish can be caught by angling, spear fishing, net fishing, underwater diving, or by traditional means. Compared to its bigger subgroup neighbours of Moala and Matuku, the soil on Totoya is not very fertile, and is good for only small-scale subsistence farming. Cassava, sweet potato, and yams grow well on the island whereas dalo does not grow well and is only grown in waterlogged, well irrigated areas in small quantities for domestic consumption. The island has its fair share of wildlife, too, which includes bats, birds, and reptiles, including snakes, along with the introduced domestic animal species, dogs and cats brought in from the urban centres. ==History and Culture== An important part of Totoya is the sacred passage \\"Daveta Tabu\\". Tradition dictates that if one wants to pass through this passage, one has to follow traditional protocol by observing utter complete silence and most importantly to be seated in the traditional manner (seated cross-legged with feet resting beneath the knees for gentlemen and for ladies, legs bent at knees resting on the side). The head is to be bowed with all mannerisms applicable in a traditional funeral. Legend has it that this is done in tribute for an infant child of a Roka Sau born to a Tongan princess, buried at sea in the passage. The protocol was instigated by the child's father. Legend also has it that ignorance or failing to fully and correctly observe the taboo would instigate furious reaction from the sea; as was proven in the past. Many seafarers in the modern day, even the most experienced captains and skippers, would opt to forgo entering by the passage even with the Turaga Roko Sau (the only one with the ancient traditional authority to use the passage without any life-threatening implications) on board the vessel, as was evident in a recent trip on board the Lady Sandy in the year 2011. One episode that shows the link between Lakeba and Totoya was the arrival of Christianity. The Turaga Tui Nayau at that time sent his wife and herald to Dawaleka, the Koro makawa of Tovu. At Dawaleka, the Bete or High Priest was performing his ritual whereupon he envisioned a canoe coming in through the boat passage at Yaro; he proclaimed, \\"I will stop here as the one coming in white is shining and much stronger than me\\". He disrobed and came down to shore with the villagers to greet the group from Lakeba. ==Effects of Climate Change== This volcanic island, like many other islands, atolls and islets around the world, is subject to the changing face of nature through the years. In the village of Dravuwalu, one of four villages located along the fringes of the remnant caldera, tombstones lie exposed along the beach, evidence of the receding beach line, as the area used to be away from the shoreline.Totoya fights climate change for food security – Fiji Times Online The second principal village on the island, Ketei, is also a testament to the effects of climate change. Heavy rain after seasonal droughts would bring heavy flooding with the river running through the village, bursting its banks, plunging through homes. Rows of coconut trees lining coastlines and village shorelines have disappeared because of heavy swells brought about by adverse weather through the years. Food security is also a concern on the island with receding coastal lines; former plantations sites are now not plantable with villages having to look further inland for fertile soil. ==Prominent Totoya people== The Paramount Chief of Totoya is known as the Goneturaga na Roko Sau. This title is currently held by Roko Josefa Cinavilakeba, who is also the community and government relations coordinator for the NGO Pacific Blue Foundation. Other prominent residents of Totoya include: * Malele, Enele, who was the former Fiji rugby rep and captain. * Captain Saumi, Nacanieli, who was an Air Pacific pilot. * Savou, Josateki, was a former Fiji sevens player and coach. * Savou, Salesi and Savou, Joiji (brothers, a physician and dentist respectively) from Ketei village. * Savou, Trevor, a former Manawatu and New Zealand Rugby Sevens player. * Peni Gavidi, former civil servant and now a consultant with his own company, PGavidi Planning and Environment Consultants * Sekope Raikoro, local musician and now Gospel singer * Takayawa, Nacanieli, winner of the Manchester's Commonwealth Games gold medal in judo.

His career was at its peak in the 1950s and 1960s. Ferzetti's first leading role was in the film Lo Zappatore (1950). He portrayed Puccini twice in the films Puccini (1953) and Casa Ricordi (1954). He made his international breakthrough in Michelangelo Antonioni's controversial L'Avventura (1960) as a restless playboy. After a series of romantic performances, he acquired a reputation in Italy as an elegant, debonair, and somewhat aristocratic looking leading man. Ferzetti starred as Lot in John Huston's biblical epic, The Bible: In the Beginning... (1966), and played railroad baron Morton in Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). Perhaps his best known role, internationally, was in the James Bond movie On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) as Marc Ange Draco, although his voice was dubbed by British actor David de Keyser. He was perhaps best known to non-mainstream audiences for his role as the psychiatrist, Hans, in Liliana Cavani's The Night Porter (1974). In the 1970s, he appeared in a significant number of crime films, often as an inspector. He appeared in Julia and Julia, opposite Laurence Olivier in Inchon (1982), and the cult film, First Action Hero. Later in his career, he played the role of Nono in the TV series Une famille formidable, while also appearing in Luca Guadagnino's 2009 film I Am Love. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Ferzetti was born as Pasquale Ferzetti in Rome, Italy on 17 March 1925. He studied at the Accademia d'Arte Drammatica in Rome, but was expelled. ===Career=== ====1940s==== Ferzetti made his screen debut in Via delle Cinque Lune (1942) under the directorship of Luigi Chiarini, featuring actors such as Luisella Beghi, Olga Solbelli, Andrea Checchi, and Gildo Bocci. Uncredited for his next role in Bengasi, he was credited for Flavio Calzavara's La contessa Castiglione (also from 1942). He then took a break from film acting, instead making a succession of theatrical appearances until a small role in Lost Happiness (Felicità perduta, 1946) and Riccardo Freda's Les Misérables (uncredited, 1948). After a small role as a pilot in Flying Squadron (Rondini in volo, 1949) and a role in Sicilian Uprising (Vespro siciliano, also from 1949), a historic film set in 1282 during the War of the Sicilian Vespers, he appeared alongside Elli Parvo, Piero Lulli, Charles Vanel, and Marcello Mastroianni in Luigi Capuano's Vertigine d'amore and Fabiola (both from 1949) as Claudio. The antiquity drama, set in Rome, was warmly received. ====1950s==== Ferzetti opposite Gina Lollobrigida in The Wayward Wife (La Provinciale, 1953) Ferzetti had a supporting role in Flavio Calzavara's Sigillo rosso alongside Gino Cervi and Carla Del Poggio, but his first leading role came in Lo Zappatore (both from 1950), a film which focused on the life of peasants and farm workers during the interwar and great depression period. Roles now came in abundance for Ferzetti, from the crime comedy Welcome, Reverend! (Benvenuto, reverendo!, 1950) alongside Aldo Fabrizi, Massimo Girotti, and Lianella Carell, to Luis Trenker's film Barrier to the North (1950), to Guido Brignone's The Naked and the Wicked (', 1951) and Inganno (1952), to Curzio Malaparte's drama, The Forbidden Christ (Il Cristo proibito, 1951), to Antonio Pietrangeli's Empty Eyes (Il sole negli occhi, 1953). He starred in the successful biopic of composer Puccini under Carmine Gallone, Puccini (also 1953), and reprised the role in House of Ricordi (Casa Ricordi, 1954), also featuring Roland Alexandre as Gioacchino Rossini. Ferzetti starred in Mario Soldati's The Wayward Wife (La Provinciale, 1953), a Cannes Film Festival nominee for best film, which saw him play the role of a professor who falls in love with a glamorous star (Gina Lollobrigida). This comedy drama involves the tale of a Romanian countess who forces \\"Gemma\\" to become a prostitute. For his performance, Ferzetti received an award from the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists, and further cemented his status as a leading actor in Italy by appearing alongside Lollobrigida. Ferzetti appeared in Marcello Pagliero's comedy drama based on the play by Luigi Pirandello, Vestire gli ignudi (1954), playing the character of Ludovico Nota alongside Pierre Brasseur, Manlio Busoni, and Paolo Ferrara, and in Camilla (also 1954), under the directorship of Luciano Emmer. Ferzetti starred in Michelangelo Antonioni's The Girlfriends (Le Amiche, 1955), as a downbeat, struggling artist named Lorenzo, with Eleonora Rossi Drago, Franco Fabrizi, and Valentina Cortese in the other leading roles. The film, shot on location in Turin, was adapted from Cesare Pavese's novella Tra donne sole (1949). Around the same time, he starred in Un po' di cielo (also from 1955), directed by Giorgio Moser, and Donatella (1956) opposite Elsa Martinelli, under director Mario Monicelli. The film was screened at the 6th Berlin International Film Festival. Ferzetti appeared in the crime film, Parola di ladro (1957), for directors Nanni Loy and Gianni Puccini, opposite Abbe Lane, Nadia Gray, and Andrea Checchi. He later appeared in Antonio Pietrangeli's Souvenir d'Italie, a romantic comedy which saw him feature alongside June Laverick, Isabelle Corey, and Ingeborg Schöner. Ferzetti appeared in Ballerina e Buon Dio (1958), directed by Antonio Leonviola, followed by Racconti d'estate, under the directorship of Gianni Franciolini, based on a story by Alberto Moravia. Ferzetti was cast in this romantic comedy, set in the Tigullio Gulf, alongside Alberto Sordi, Michèle Morgan, Marcello Mastroianni, Sylva Koscina, Dorian Gray, Franca Marzi, Franco Fabrizi, and Jorge Mistral. In 1959, Ferzetti starred alongside Andrée Debar and Isa Miranda as Bernard Turquet de Mayenne in the French historical comedy, Le secret du Chevalier d'Éon. Directed by Jacqueline Audry, the film is set in Burgundy in 1728. He later appeared in Carlo Ludovico Bragaglia's Hannibal, alongside Victor Mature, Rita Gam, Milly Vitale, and Rik Battaglia. The film is set during the Roman Republic; Ferzetti played Fabius Maximus. ====1960s==== Ferzetti alongside Lea Massari in L'avventura (1960) Ferzetti starred in Gianni Puccini's Il carro armato dell'8 settembre (1960), followed by Florestano Vancini's La lunga notte del '43 (both 1960). The latter film was set during the Allied invasion of Italy in 1943 during the Second World War, and saw Ferzetti feature alongside Belinda Lee and Enrico Maria Salerno. It was a considerable success at the Venice Film Festival and was nominated for a Goldon Lion Award. He made his international breakthrough as an oversexed, restless playboy, Sandro, in Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura (also 1960). Starring alongside Lea Massari and Monica Vitti romantically, his role was well received. Liz-Anne Bawden in The Oxford Companion to Film said, \\"The acting is excellent. Gabriele Ferzetti repeats and develops his role from Le Amiche of the inadequate male/artist\\". Ferzetti entered one of the busiest periods of his career, featuring in seven films released during 1962. Among these were Il giorno più corto, directed by Sergio Corbucci, in Giuseppe Bennati's Congo vivo alongside Jean Seberg, in Jean Negulesco's American picture, Jessica, opposite Maurice Chevalier, Angie Dickinson, and Noël-Noël, and in Le Crime ne paie pas (US: Crime Does Not Pay) under director Gérard Oury. Among a large ensemble cast, Ferzetti had a role in Jean Delannoy's Imperial Venus (1963), and played the character of Leonardi in Charles Frend and Bruno Vailati's war drama, Torpedo Bay (also 1963), alongside Lilli Palmer, James Mason, and Alberto Lupo. In Luis Lucia's musical comedy, Crucero de verano (1964), he appeared alongside Carmen Sevilla, Marisa Merlini, and José Alfayate and in Lo scippo (1965), alongside Paolo Ferrari, and played the role of Vic Dermatt in Jacques Deray's French crime drama, Par un beau matin d'été (Crime on a Summer Morning, also 1965), alongside Jean- Paul Belmondo, Sophie Daumier, and Geraldine Chaplin. He also had a role in Marcel Carné's Trois chambres à Manhattan (Three Rooms in Manhattan, 1965), a film which incidentally featured a young Robert De Niro in an uncredited role. Ferzetti began to work on American projects. He starred as Lot in John Huston's biblical epic, The Bible: In the Beginning... (1966), based on the Book of Genesis. He also made his television debut with his appearance in two episodes of the American spy series, I Spy. Ferzetti starred in A ciascuno il suo (We Still Kill the Old Way, 1967) under director Elio Petri, and the TV series '. Ferzetti featured in a total of eight films released in 1968, including Marcello Fondato's I protagonisti, Salvatore Samperi's Grazie zia, José María Forqué's Un diablo bajo la almohada, Roberto Faenza's Escalation, Alberto De Martino's Roma come Chicago, and Sergio Leone's western epic, Once Upon a Time in the West, in which he played Morton, the railroad baron, opposite acclaimed actors Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson. Ferzetti as Marc- Ange Draco in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) In 1969, Ferzetti starred in Giuliano Montaldo's crime film, Gli intoccabili. The film was entered into the 1969 Cannes Film Festival. He next starred in Un bellissimo novembre, directed by Mauro Bolognini. The film, based on a novel by Ercole Patti, united Ferzetti and Gina Lollobrigida once again in the leading roles. Ferzetti's most important performance in 1969, and arguably the role he is most associated with, internationally, was his role as distinguished organized crime boss Marc-Ange Draco in the 1969 James Bond feature On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Directed by Peter Hunt, Ferzetti plays the father of Tracy di Vicenzo (Diana Rigg), who promises James Bond (George Lazenby) a handsome dowry for marrying her; they fall in love and marry anyway. Hunt had spotted Ferzetti in an Italian film, which he and Harry Saltzman were supposed to be reviewing another actor in, and both were immediately drawn to Ferzetti and persuaded the producers to test Ferzetti. However, despite speaking good English, his lines were dubbed by British actor David de Keyser, due to Ferzetti's strong Italian accent. In the end of the film, his character Draco's resources are vital in aiding Bond to destroy Ernst Stavro Blofeld's base at Piz Gloria. His final release of 1969 was L'amica, directed by Alberto Lattuada. ====1970s==== In 1970, Ferzetti starred in the political thriller, The Confession, opposite Yves Montand and Simone Signoret, under director Costa-Gavras. The film, based on the book by Lise London, explores the mental tortures facing the vice-minister of the Foreign Affairs of Czechoslovakia when he is imprisoned. The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award. Ferzetti starred as an inspector in the crime picture, Cannabis, directed by Pierre Koralnik. The film involves the American mafia and a group of French drug lords. He also had an uncredited role in Terence Young's American picture, Cold Sweat. In 1971, Ferzetti featured in Salvatore Samperi's Million Dollar Eel, a comedy film about an heiress who fakes her own kidnapping and hides in the river Po's delta, in order to obtain money from her parents. In 1972, Ferzetti starred opposite Robert Blake, Catherine Spaak, and Ernest Borgnine in Franco Prosperi's boxing drama, Un uomo dalla pelle dura. A series of appearances in crime films followed, including Alta tension, Trois milliards sans ascenseur (1972), and Bisturi la mafia bianca (1973), directed by Luigi Zampa. Ferzetti played Wilhelm Keitel (pictured) in Hitler: The Last Ten Days In 1973, Ferzetti appeared in the TV movie, Divorce His, Divorce Hers, under Waris Hussein, and Hitler: The Last Ten Days, a British-Italian produced picture directed by Ennio De Concini. Ferzetti played the role of Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel opposite Alec Guinness (Adolf Hitler), Simon Ward, Adolfo Celi, and Diane Cilento. The following year of 1974, he again appeared in a World War II picture, this time the controversial arthouse classic about the Holocaust, The Night Porter, working under director Liliana Cavani. He starred alongside Dirk Bogarde and Charlotte Rampling and played Hans, a psychiatrist, one of his most notable roles. The film depicts the political continuity between wartime Nazism and post-war Europe, and the psychological continuity of characters locked into compulsive repetition of the past. Given the film's dark and disturbing themes, and a somewhat ambiguous moral clarification at the end, The Night Porter has tended to divide audiences and was accused of mere sensationalism. Film critic Roger Ebert said, \\"as nasty as it is lubricious, a despicable attempt to titillate us by exploiting memories of persecution and suffering.\\" Ferzetti continued to appear in crime films, including ...a tutte le auto della polizia (1975), directed by Mario Caiano, the German detective thriller Der Richter und sein Henker (1975), directed by Maximilian Schell, Eriprando Visconti's La Orca (1976), and Fernando Di Leo's Gli amici di Nick Hezard, a film about a Swiss heist. He also appeared in French director Roger Pigaut's picture, Le guêpier, opposite Claude Brasseur and Marthe Keller, and had a small role in Vincente Minnelli's fantasy, A Matter of Time in 1976, which featured a prominent cast, which included Ingrid Bergman and Liza Minnelli. In 1977, he starred in Eriprando Visconti's Oedipus Orca, and Lucio Fulci's The Psychic, about a clairvoyant woman (Jennifer O'Neill), who after having a vision, removes a section of the wall in the home of her husband (Ferzetti) and finds a skeleton behind it. In 1978, Ferzetti appeared in French director Claude d'Anna's picture, CIA contro KGB, alongside Bruno Cremer, Donald Pleasence, , Hélène Lehman, Dennis Hopper, and Joseph Cotten. He also appeared in another French picture, the romantic drama Mon premier amour, directed by Elie Chouraqui. In 1979, Ferzetti starred in Porci con la P 38, directed by Gianfranco Pagani, Gli anni struggenti, directed by Vittorio Sindoni, Incontro con gli umanoidi, directed by Anthony Richmond and Tonino Ricci, and also had an uncredited role in Terence Young's Bloodline. He also appeared in the TV series I vecchi e i giovani. ====1980s–2015==== Ferzetti played a Turkish brigadier in another of Young's pictures, the historical war film, Inchon (1981), with Laurence Olivier as General Douglas MacArthur. He appeared in Vatican Conspiracy (Morte in Vaticano, 1982) directed by Marcello Aliprandi, and starred alongside Franco Nero in the crime comedy, Grog (also 1982), directed by Francesco Laudadio, about two convicts who escape from prison and takes the family of a doctor as hostages. In the mid-1980s, as he came closer to retirement age, Ferzetti's career in film began to decline, mainly appearing in low-budget TV movies and mini series, including an uncredited role in The Scarlet and the Black (1983) under Jerry London, and the mini-series Quo Vadis? (1985), La voglia di vincere (1987), and Around the World in 80 Days (1989). His only other films of the period were Julia and Julia (1987), directed by Peter Del Monte, in which he starred alongside Kathleen Turner, Gabriel Byrne, and Sting, and Computron 22, directed by Giuliano Carnimeo (1988). In the 1990s, Ferzetti only appeared in minor or brief roles in TV movies, such as Voyage of Terror: The Achille Lauro Affair (1990), Black as the Heart (1991), Die Ringe des Saturn (1992), Natale con papà (1994) and mini-series such as Private Crimes (1995), in which he played Dr. Braschi. He did however appear in the film First Action Hero (1994), but his only major role of the 1990s was as the Duke of Venice in Othello (1995), directed by Oliver Parker. He also appeared in Renzo Martinelli's Porzûs and Alfredo Angeli's television series Con rabbia e con amore (both from 1997). In the 2000s, Ferzetti appeared in Lost Love (Perduto amor, 2003), directed by Franco Battiato, in ' (2005), directed by Claudio Fragasso and in Io sono l'amore (2009), directed by Luca Guadagnino. His best known role, after 1996, is as Nono in the French series Une famille formidable, in which he appeared in 11 episodes, between 1996 and 2007. He portrayed Enrico in Edoardo Leo's comedy picture, 18 Years Later (Diciotto anni dopo, 2010), which featured Marco Bonini in the lead role. Ferzetti died on 2 December 2015, aged 90. ==Filmography== ===Cinema=== * Street of the Five Moons (directed by Luigi Chiarini) (1942) * Bengasi (directed by Augusto Genina) (1942) (uncredited) * The Countess of Castiglione (directed by Flavio Calzavara) (1942) * Felicità perduta (1946) * Les Misérables (directed by Riccardo Freda) (1948) as Tholomyes, un cliente di Fantina (uncredited) * Vertigine d'amore (directed by Luigi Capuano) (1949) * Fabiola (directed by Alessandro Blasetti) (1949) as Claudius * William Tell (directed by Giorgio Pàstina) (1949) as Corrado Hant * Sicilian Uprising (directed by Giorgio Pàstina) (1949) * Flying Squadron (directed by Luigi Capuano) (1949) as Ufficiale D'aviazione * Benvenuto, reverendo!

Before the new Scottish Parliament building at Holyrood was completed in 2004 the Scottish Parliament met in the General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland.

This includes dictating what ink pantones should be used in the coloring, and what typefaces. Governments may have corporate designs as well. On June 2, 1999, the German federal cabinet introduced a corporate design for the flag of Germany. The term 'corporate design' does not refer to a specific design profession. Corporations do have special design needs based on their behaviors. They communicate their mission, objectives, needs, and product information -- with users, clients, or members; with suppliers, distributors, service providers; with the surrounding community and the media; with financial institutions and other corporations, and with the state. They create, acquire, modify, organize and distribute large amounts of information and raw data, as well as goods and services. (Sometimes the goods or services are themselves information. For example, The Yellow Pages, or The New York Times.) A designer whose client is a corporation will include the logo and other elements of the corporate brand as a way to standardize and unify all communication between company and audience, whether in print or online. Scenarios that includes human-computer interactions take place through software and hardware user interfaces that are also branded and designed with the corporate culture in mind. (Examples of user scenarios: update the Web site, transfer funds, document procedures, control security, operate machinery, plan projects, conduct virtual meetings, check inventory, fill an order, or ship a product.) These interactions are increasingly taking place through Web sites, through mobile devices and at dedicated terminals, and may include sound, video, animation and user feedback mechanisms. A savvy designer will create designs that can be adapted to all of these applications. ==See also== *Corporate identity *Visual brand language ==References== Category:Communication design Category:Graphic design ","title":"Corporate design"},{"id":"3262648","text":"Voltaj (, meaning voltage in Romanian) is a Romanian pop rock group. ==History== Voltaj was formed in 1982, in Bucharest, by Horațiu Rad on bass, Nikki Dinescu (Krypton) on drums, Gabi Nacu (Krypton) on guitar, Cristi Minculescu (Iris) on vocals and Adrian Ilie (Iris) on guitar.\\"Voltaj Biography\\". catmusic.ro.

The creators were Guido De Maria, as director and writer, and Franco Bonvicini (\\"Bonvi\\"), as co-writer and artist. The first run comprised 11 stories, later reissued, as print comic strips for Il Corriere dei Ragazzi, and then in numerous other magazines and books. In 1977 the character was revamped for the follow-on TV series SuperGulp!, with 17 further episodes. The Nick Carter episodes number some 80, including those created for TV and later adapted for comic-strip magazines. Several stories were drawn by Silver (Guido Silvestri) and Clod (Claudio Onesti). ==Characters== * Nick Carter, whose name is inspired to that of the homonymous pulp-novel detective, is a short, old- fashioned detective, usually called by other authorities or by private parties, to solve intricate cases. These are normally occasions to satirize famous movies, comics characters or real-world celebrities. Parodies of horror and science fiction themes sometimes appear. The stories are generally set in the United States of the 1910s and '20s, but Carter and his colleagues take part in several missions in World War I's front lines or in the Russian Revolution, as well. * Patsy is Carter's tall, sturdy and clumsy assistant, whose main abilities involve fists and weapons. Each stories usually ends with Patsy commenting: \\"And the last one repairs the damage\\" or \\"The last one closes.\\" * Ten is a Japanese detective who expresses himself only in rhyme, citing ironic versions of Japanese philosophy. * O'Callaghan is a N.Y. City police official whose inability to solve a challenging case usually requires consulting Carter. * Stanislao Moulinsky is a recurring villain Moulinsky is an alleged \\"master criminal\\" using astute disguises: the most incredible ones include three people a time, a television, an airship and a fog. He is, however, invariably unmasked by Carter in the last panel of each story, with the signature exchange: (Nick Carter:) \\"No! This is not ___, but Stanislao Moulinsky in one of his best disguises!\\" (Stanislao Moulinsky, taking off his mask and with a strong Russian accent:) \\"Well yes, damned Carter, you have won again!\\" ==Parodies== Nick Carter stories feature a great number of parodies of famous themes and characters of literature, film, TV and history. An incomplete list includes: * Marlon Brando, satirized two times: as the mafioso Babbino (\\"Little Daddy\\"), after the main character of The Godfather film; and as Merlon, a trade union leader in a story inspired to the film On the Waterfront. Note that in Italian \\"Merlon\\" is something such as \\"Big blackbird\\", where \\"blackbird\\" is colloquial for foolish. * Mandrake the Magician, featured as the Great Mephisto, a criminal hypnotizer. * Adventure comics character Corto Maltese, as himself. He maintains, in pure Hugo Pratt's style: \\"I don't live for vile money. I live for adventure.\\" * Al Capone, as crime boss \\"Al Testone\\", whom Carter has similarly charged with a lesser offence (in this case a traffic violation). * King Kong, as a giant gorilla of the \\"Barzum Circus\\", who falls in love with Patsy. * Lenin, as himself, in the prison wagon carrying him back to Russia. * Adolf Hitler, whose face is that of an unnamed, fanatic character attempting to bring panic in New York City with a series of terroristic acts. * Jack London, portrayed with Bonvi's likeness. * Orson Welles, as \\"Borson Willis\\", facing a false invasion from Mars. * Italian politician Giulio Andreotti, as the \\"prime minister\\", in a late story of 1993. * Nicky Carter king of the drawers ==References== ==External links== * www.nickcarter.it (In Italian) Category:1972 comics debuts Carter, Nick Category:Italian comic strips Category:Italian comics titles Carter, Nick Carter, Nick Category:Detective comics Category:Italian children's animated television series Category:Male characters in animation Category:Animated human characters Category:Crime comics Category:Humor comics Category:Comics based on television series Category:Comics based on fiction Category:Comics based on novels Category:Nick Carter (literary character) ","title":"Nick Carter (comic strip)"},{"id":"3262728","text":"Argel can refer to: * Solenostemma argel, a plant * Spanish and Portuguese name of Algiers, or in English texts translated from Spanish or Portuguese *Argel, a village in Moldovița Commune, Suceava County, Romania *Argel (river), a tributary of the Moldovița in Suceava County, Romania *Argel, Armenia *Argel Fucks (born 1974), a Brazilian football (soccer) player, played for Brazil ","title":"Argel"},{"id":"3262732","text":"Europe and Africa The World Map at Lake Klejtrup () is a miniature world map built of stones and grass in Klejtrup Sø near the village of Klejtrup, Viborg Municipality, Denmark. In 1943, Søren Poulsen, a local farmer, was working on the drainage of the surrounding meadows when he found a stone shaped like the Jutland peninsula. This inspired him to create a small world of his own. During the winter months, with the use of primitive tools, he placed big stones carefully on the ice. When spring arrived, the stones could easily be tilted into place, and in this way the World Map took shape. Some of the stones used weighted more than 2 tonnes. Poulsen created the World Map between 1944 and 1969. It measures 45 by 90 metres (49 by 98 yards), covering an area of over 4000 square meters (1 acre). One 111-kilometre (69 mi) degree of latitude corresponds to 27 centimetres (11 inches) on the map. On Poulsen's map, Antarctica is not present and the Northern Hemisphere is marked in two places, ensuring a better impression of the correct distances between the countries to avoid the difficulties of spreading out our planet's globular shape. Red poles mark the equator, and each country is represented by miniature flags, which are updated yearly. State borders in the United States of America are marked with yellow bricks; Poulsen lived 20 years in America. The map is the epicenter of a park, which has, among other attractions, a picnic area, a coffee shop and a playground. The World Map is an important attraction in the area, and attracts about 40,000 visitors per year, most of them Danish. ==Gallery== Verdenskortet ved Klejtrup Sø 002.jpgDenmark Viborg Kommune - Klejtrup - Verdenskortet 07 ies.jpgThe Americas Viborg Kommune - Klejtrup - Verdenskortet 08 ies.jpgInsulindia, Australia and New Zealand Viborg Kommune - Klejtrup - Verdenskortet 09 ies.jpgAsia and the Middle East Viborg Kommune - Klejtrup - Verdenskortet 11 ies.jpgItaly ==See also== * Great Polish Map of Scotland * Relief map of Guatemala ==References== ==External links== *Website Category:Geography of Denmark Category:Scale modeling Category:World maps ","title":"World Map at Lake Klejtrup"},{"id":"3262735","text":"Pakistan competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, United States.

It was released in October 1987 by their own record company, Reception Records. After self- releasing five singles on Reception Records label, the band turned to recording their first album, continuing their collaboration with producer Chris Allison, who had produced their previous single, \\"My Favourite Dress\\". David Gedge's songwriting chronicles relationships breaking up or never taking off. A digression is CD bonus track \\"All About Eve\\", which is about apartheid, a subject Gedge came into contact with during his childhood in South Africa. The band sought and received permission to name the album after Northern Irish football legend George Best. Best agreed to appear on promotional shots with the band. The original Reception Records compact disc release added two bonus tracks from the B-side of single \\"Anyone Can Make a Mistake\\". All later CD re- releases of George Best, starting with the 1997 re-release by Canadian reissue label Pearls from the Past, added all tracks of 1988 singles \\"Nobody's Twisting Your Arm\\" and \\"Why Are You Being So Reasonable Now?\\", including a cover of The Beatles' \\"Getting Better\\". By the time of the latter single's release, drummer Shaun Charman had been fired and replaced by Simon Smith. In 2007, the band played a 20th anniversary tour of George Best, performing the album in its entirety. Following this, during the recording sessions for their 2008 album El Rey, the band made a live-in-the-studio recording of George Best with Steve Albini. The recording, mixed by Andrew Scheps, was released in September 2017 as George Best 30. The 30th anniversary tour of George Best in 2017 was accompanied by the release of a documentary about the album, titled The Wedding Present: Something Left Behind. NME ranked it at number 489 in its 2014 list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. ==Track listing== All tracks written by David Gedge except as noted. ===Original release=== ====Vinyl==== Side A # \\"Everyone Thinks He Looks Daft\\" # \\"What Did Your Last Servant Die Of?\\" # \\"Don't Be So Hard\\" # \\"A Million Miles\\" # \\"All This and More\\" # \\"My Favourite Dress\\" (album version) Side B # \\"Shatner\\" # \\"Something and Nothing\\" # \\"It's What You Want That Matters\\" # \\"Give My Love to Kevin\\" # \\"Anyone Can Make a Mistake\\" # \\"You Can't Moan Can You?\\" ====CD==== # \\"Everyone Thinks He Looks Daft\\" – 4:10 # \\"What Did Your Last Servant Die Of?\\" – 2:43 # \\"Don't Be So Hard\\" – 2:43 # \\"A Million Miles\\" – 3:33 # \\"All This and More\\" – 2:23 # \\"Getting Nowhere Fast\\" (Alan, Evans, Oldroyd, Swift) – 1:44 # \\"My Favourite Dress\\" (album version) – 4:14 # \\"Shatner\\" – 2:07 # \\"Something and Nothing\\" – 3:50 # \\"It's What You Want That Matters\\" – 3:26 # \\"Give My Love to Kevin\\" – 2:46 # \\"Anyone Can Make a Mistake\\" – 3:18 # \\"You Can't Moan Can You?\\" – 3:20 # \\"All About Eve\\" – 2:13 ===George Best +9 CD re-release=== # \\"Everyone Thinks He Looks Daft\\" # \\"What Did Your Last Servant Die Of?\\" # \\"Don't Be So Hard\\" # \\"A Million Miles\\" # \\"All This and More\\" # \\"Getting Nowhere Fast\\" (Alan, Evans, Oldroyd, Swift) # \\"My Favourite Dress\\" (album version) # \\"Shatner\\" # \\"Something and Nothing\\" # \\"It's What You Want That Matters\\" # \\"Give My Love to Kevin\\" # \\"Anyone Can Make a Mistake\\" # \\"You Can't Moan, Can You?\\" # \\"All About Eve\\" # \\"Nobody's Twisting Your Arm\\" # \\"Nothing Comes Easy\\" # \\"Don't Laugh\\" # \\"I'm Not Always So Stupid\\" # \\"Why Are You Being So Reasonable Now?\\" # \\"Not from Where I'm Standing\\" # \\"Give My Love to Kevin\\" (acoustic version) # \\"Getting Better\\" (Lennon, McCartney) # \\"Pourquoi Es-Tu Devenue Si Raisonnable?\\" Has also been released as a 4x10\\" vinyl-box. ==Personnel== ;The Wedding Present * David Gedge – vocals, guitar * Peter Solowka – guitar * Keith Gregory – bass guitar * Shaun Charman – drums (1-18) * Simon Smith – drums (19-23) ;Additional musician * Amelia Fletcher – backing vocals ;Technical staff * Chris Allison – producer * Steve Lyon – engineer, mixer * The Wedding Present – mixers ==References== Category:The Wedding Present albums Category:1987 debut albums Category:George Best ","title":"George Best (album)"},{"id":"3262761","text":"The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to archaeology: Archaeology - study of human cultures through the recovery, documentation, and analysis of material remains and environmental data, including architecture, artifacts, biofacts, human remains, and landscapes. == What type of thing is archeology?

He is widely admired in the opera world for his voice, the versatility of his repertoire, and his acting—leading many to regard him as one of the best lyric baritones of the late 20th century. In October 2011, he was appointed Chancellor of Durham University, succeeding Bill Bryson. ==Early years== Born to Florence and Thomas Allen in the mining village of Seaham Harbour, County Durham in 1944, Sir Thomas Allen studied at Ryhope Grammar School from 1955 to 1964, becoming captain of his house and later head boy while also doing well in sports, such as in athletics, rugby and especially golf. It was during his time at school that his singing voice was first observed by the then Physics master, Denis Weatherley, himself a well-known baritone in the county and especially renowned for Northumberland songs. Weatherley would then go on to be Allen's first tutor, training the young baritone during lunch breaks. Allen's initial ambition was to be a doctor but this was later abandoned when he won a place at the Royal College of Music in 1964, where he studied with Hervey Alan for four years, specialising in oratorio and Lieder until 1968. In his final term he made his operatic stage debut as the baritone lead in the Royal College of Music Opera School production of Arthur Benjamin's opera Prima Donna. He also won the prestigious Queen's Prize while studying at the college which allowed him to study under James Lockhart, who noticed his talents. Under Lockhart, Allen then shifted his attention from Lieder and oratorio to opera and in 1969, he made his debut as D'Obigny in Verdi's La traviata with the Welsh National Opera (WNO). His early roles with the WNO also included Mozart's Almaviva, Guglielmo and Papageno, Rossini's Figaro, Falke in Die Fledermaus, Billy Budd, Posa, Eugene Onegin and Germont. In 1971, he made his Covent Garden debut as Donald in Billy Budd and he joined the company the following year. His solo Glyndebourne Festival debut was as Papageno in 1973. On 7 August 1974, during his BBC Proms performance, Allen collapsed at the end of his second solo, tried to recover for his third but collapsed again and was taken from the stage (he was replaced by Patrick McCarthy). He returned as Figaro in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro (1974), Guglielmo (1975) and Don Giovanni (1977) and it was during this time that he was hailed by one music critic as the finest English baritone since Sir Charles Santley.Loppert, Max Opera Magazine, July 1978 He made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1981 as Papageno. He left Covent Garden to become a freelance singer in 1979 although he still remains a guest artist with the company. He sang the title role in the British stage premiere of Busoni's Doktor Faust for the English National Opera in 1986 (a performance which was also commended in the 1986 Laurence Olivier Awards when the production won the award for Outstanding Achievement in Opera), while his debut at the Salzburg Festival was as Ulisse in Monteverdi's Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria in 1985. His Chicago debut was Rossini's Figaro in The Barber of Seville in 1989.Sadie, Stanley (ed.), The New Grove Dictionary of Opera. Vol. One A – D, Macmillan Press Ltd., 1992 ==Present work== More recently, Allen has performed Eisenstein in Die Fledermaus, Don Alfonso, Ulisse and Don Giovanni at the Bayerische Staatsoper, Don Giovanni at La Scala, Yeletsky (in The Queen of Spades), Sharpless (in Madama Butterfly), and the title role in Sweeney Todd at the Royal Opera House, Eisenstein at the Glyndebourne Festival, Don Alfonso at the Salzburg Easter and Summer Festivals, Forester (The Cunning Little Vixen) at the San Francisco Opera and Beckmesser (in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg) at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Allen also appears in recital in the United Kingdom, throughout Europe, in Australia and America, with his recital repertoire no less extensive than his operatic one; ranging from German Lieder, French songs by Duparc, and English song cycles by Ralph Vaughan Williams to musical numbers by Rodgers and Hammerstein, Jerome Kern and Cole Porter. He has also recorded oratorio and choral works such as Brahms' Ein deutsches Requiem, Handel's Saul, and Orff's Carmina Burana. The greatest part of his repertoire has been extensively recorded with such distinguished conductors as Sir Georg Solti, James Levine, Sir Neville Marriner, Sir Bernard Haitink, Sir Simon Rattle, Wolfgang Sawallisch and Riccardo Muti. In 1989, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). In 1999, he was knighted. Both awards were for his services to opera. In 1998 he was named a member of the Royal Opera's Opera Advisory Board, the first time a singer had been given such an appointment.Shirley Apthorp, \\"Changing his tune\\", The Weekend Australian, 29–30 August 1998, \\"Review\\", p. 19 Allen's first book, Foreign Parts – A Singer's Journal was published in 1993. In November 2002, he directed for the first time in Britten's Albert Herring at the Royal College of Music. Other directorial credits include Mozart's Così fan tutte and Don Giovanni (for Samling, of which he is the patron)About Us , Samling charity at the Sage Music Centre in Gateshead. In 2006, he made his American directorial debut with a production of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro for Arizona Opera. In 2007, he directed a new production of The Barber of Seville for Scottish Opera. He has directed a new production of The Marriage of Figaro for the company which premiered in Glasgow in October 2010. He also performed as the Narrator/Dr. Pangloss in the 2005 concert of Leonard Bernstein's Candide at Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York City. Allen has now performed at Covent Garden for over 35 years, recently having played in total 50 roles with the company, with Faninal from Richard Strauss' Der Rosenkavalier marking his 50th role in December 2009. The 25th anniversary of his debut at the Metropolitan Opera was celebrated in 2006. Allen has also been revealed as being the model and inspiration in developing the now famous character of Billy Elliot in the play of the same name by Lee Hall. In September 2008, he performed under the direction of Woody Allen in Puccini's Gianni Schicchi for the Los Angeles Opera as well as at the Spoleto Festival in June 2009. The year 2009 marked the 40th anniversary of his professional debut at the WNO in 1969, also marking the four decades he has been in the opera world. During the same year, he took part in the annual BBC Proms, singing songs from numerous MGM musicals such as Gigi, Kismet and On the Town at the Royal Albert Hall, London. In the 2009/10 opera season, he appeared in operas in America, Germany and the United Kingdom; as Faninal in Der Rosenkavalier, Don Alfonso in Così fan tutte, Prosdocimo in Il turco in Italia and Gianni Schicchi at Covent Garden. On 11 October 2011 Allen was appointed Chancellor of Durham University by the University's Convocation, to serve from 1 January 2012 in succession to Bill Bryson. His first concert with the university took place in Durham Cathedral on 1 June 2013, appearing alongside over 100 student performers. On 27 January 2012, Allen marked his 40th anniversary at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, singing the rôle of Don Alfonso in Così fan tutte. In 2015, he sang the rôle of Baron Zeta in the Metropolitan Opera's production of Franz Lehár's operetta The Merry Widow, which he reprised at the Met in 2017.\\"Major Miscast: Renée Fleming Makes a Sour Merry Widow at the Met\\" by James Jorden, The New York Observer, 7 January 2015 ==Personal life== He is a supporter of Sunderland A.F.C..

She attended a boarding school, Stamford High School, as a child, and went on to train at the Central School of Speech and Drama. Cohu said that, despite her family's strong military background, her parents were entirely supportive of her desire to be an actress. Cohu lives in Kensal Green in Brent, London. ==Personal life== Cohu was married to the actor Corey Johnson, but later divorced.\\"I still pine for my lost love:interview Lucy Cohu : The Secret House of Death\\", The Mirror, 15 March 1996 ==Television and film work== Before she made a living from acting she used to perform for children's parties. She has been quoted as saying that had she not found success as an actress she would have gone into children's nursing. Cohu's first acting job after graduating from drama school was at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester, in a production of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. She made her television debut in an episode of Casualty. She went on to work extensively in television, including playing the role Major Jessica Bailey in the popular ITV show Soldier Soldier followed by many parts in British television. In 2005 she portrayed Princess Margaret in the semi-fictional version of her life, The Queen's Sister, for Channel 4, for which she was nominated for Emmy and BAFTA awards. She was widely praised for the role; for example, Variety disliked the \\"somewhat tawdry biopic\\", but said that \\"Cohu makes it all worth watching\\". Cohu herself said she played Margaret like a proper woman with an insatiable and tremendous energy for life: previous images in her mind had been of a bloated and sick courtier confined to a wheelchair. She hoped the production hadn't offended anyone as she really liked the Queen. Cohu has also appeared in Cape Wrath, Ballet Shoes, as Theo Danes,All-star cast dance onto BBC One in Ballet Shoes BBC Press Office. 2007-08-11, and Torchwood: Children of Earth, as Alice Carter, the daughter of Captain Jack Harkness. Cohu has also appeared in several films, including Gosford Park and Becoming Jane. She plays Madame Maigret in the ITV television series Maigret starring Rowan Atkinson. ==Theatre work== After an eight-year hiatus from the stage, Cohu starred in a revival of Speaking in Tongues at the Duke of York's Theatre, opposite John Simm, Ian Hart and Kerry Fox. Cohu received positive reviews for this performance. In February 2010 she began a five-week run in a production of An Enemy of the People at the Crucible Theatre, starring alongside Sir Antony Sher as Katrina Stockmann, and later appeared in Arthur Miller's Broken Glass at the Tricycle Theatre. ==Awards== In November 2008 Cohu won an international Emmy award for Best Actress for her role in the true-life drama Forgiven. ==Filmography== ===Television=== { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 100%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#B0C4DE\\" align=\\"center\\" !

The Australian Bicentenary was marked with much ceremony across Australia. The bicentenary of Australia was celebrated in 1988. It marked 200 years since the arrival of the First Fleet of British convict ships at Sydney in 1788. ==History== The Australian Bicentennial Authority Official Logo The bicentennial year marked Captain Arthur Phillip's arrival with the 11 ships of the First Fleet in Sydney Harbour in 1788, and the founding of the city of Sydney and the colony of New South Wales. 1988 is considered the official bicentenary year of the founding of Australia. Skyneedle at World Expo 88, as part of the celebrations for the 1988 Bicentenary ==Celebrations== The Australian Bicentenary was marked by pomp and ceremony across Australia to mark the anniversary of the arrival of the First Fleet of British ships at Sydney in 1788. The Australian Bicentennial Authority (ABA), pursuant to the Australian Bicentennial Authority Act 1980, was set up to plan, fund and coordinate projects that emphasized the nation's cultural heritage. State Councils were also created to ensure cooperation between the federal and state governments. The result was a national programme of events and celebrations to commemorate the Bicentenary, including: * Australia Live, a television special on New Year's Night * the arrival of the First Fleet Re-enactment Voyage in Sydney Harbour on Australia Day * World Expo 88 in Brisbane, the largest event of these celebrations * Australian Bicentennial Exhibition, toured throughout Australia * all Australian schoolchildren were presented with a Bicentennial \\"Heritage Medallion\\" * the issue by the NSW Department of Motor Transport (from late 1987 to the end of 1988) of over 160,000 commemorative Bicentennial number plates which were sold at a premium * the painting of A class locomotive A66 by regional Victorian train operator V/Line in a unique green and gold livery featuring the official ABA Bicentennial Logo and the wording 1788 Australian Bicentennary 1988 * Aus Steam '88, a railway display of steam locomotives at Spencer Street Station * the Australian Bicentennial Airshow held at RAAF Richmond * the 1988 Women's Cricket World Cup, held in Perth, Sydney, and Melbourne, which was branded as the Bicentennial World Cup * the 1988 Youth Cricket World Cup, held in Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide, which was branded as the McDonald's Bicentennial Youth World Cup * Trans-Australia hot air balloon Race, Perth to Sydney March 30, 1988 * the Bicentennial Classic, held at Royal Melbourne Golf Club * the issuing of \\"expo dollars\\" (a form of local currency) by various Australian states in several denominations The opening ceremony of the 16th World Scout Jamboree, which took place at midnight on 31 December 1987, was the first official event of Australia's Bicentenary. ==Heritage trails== In collaboration with state governments, the Commonwealth/State Bicentennial Commemorative Program was established with the development of Heritage Trails in each state. ==Other events== On Australia Day, Sydney Harbour hosted a re-enactment of the arrival of the First Fleet. The Hawke Government refused to fund the First Fleet re-enactment, because it believed this might offend Indigenous Australians.Barnett & Goward; John Howard Prime Minister; Viking; 1997; Ch 12 Radio 2GB in Sydney stepped in and held a fund raising appeal to keep the re-enactment on track. The government instead funded a rival display of Tall Ships which sailed up Australia's east coast and entered Sydney Harbour on the day, and it was felt that this was more acceptable to the Indigenous community. Australia's floral emblem was officially declared to be the Golden Wattle Acacia pycnantha. The Gazettal was signed by the Governor General, Sir Ninian Stephen, on 19 August 1988. A ceremony was held on 1 September 1988 at the Australian National Botanic Gardens. The Minister for Home Affairs, Robert Ray, made the formal announcement and the Prime Minister's wife, Mrs Hazel Hawke, planted a Golden Wattle. Queen Elizabeth II opened the new Parliament House on 9 May 1988 was also marked by the completion of many unique development projects such as the Bicentennial National Trail and on 9 May of that year, Queen Elizabeth II opened the New Parliament House in Canberra. As well as this, the modern Darling Harbour precinct was completed and opened, as was the modern Sydney Football Stadium. It was also marked by the creation of one of Australia's most significant art works, the Aboriginal Memorial, which commemorated those Indigenous Australians who died as a result of European settlement. Other events included the Bicentennial Beacons, a series of bonfires lit around Australia. A celebration featuring motor cycle riders from around Australia was also held in Canberra during the year. Not all events went well with the disastrous Round Australia Yacht Race claiming several lives and being the subject of legal action. A new musical Manning Clark's History of Australia, directed by John Bell, that was loosely based on the life of historian Manning Clark opened in January at Princess Theatre (Melbourne) to coincide with the Bicentenary, but facing poor reviews and concomitant lack of attendance, closed before the end of February. Significant improvements to Australian roads were made through the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program.National Library of Australia Catalogue ==Protests== The event triggered debate on Australian national identity, Aboriginal rights, historical interpretation and multiculturalism. The event was widely viewed as controversial. Planning for the event raised issues of national identity and historical interpretation. Some wanted to remember the colonisation as an invasion while others wanted it to focus on historical re-enactments. The Uniting Church in Australia wanted people to boycott the event unless Aboriginal rights were recognised. The official slogan was \\"Living Together\\" which emphasised the theme of multi-culturism. Former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser intervened to change the motto to \\"The Australian Achievement\\" in order to be more celebratory. Bob Hawke later restored the original motto. The response from the right wing in the country was loud. The Institute of Public Affairs suggested that tradition had been sacrificed to appease a minority. The historian Geoffrey Blainey claimed the Bicentenary was attempting to re- write the British out of the history of Australia. The protest was planned immediately after the 1982 Commonwealth Games protests. On 26 January 1988, more than 40,000 people, including Indigenous Australians from across the country, staged the largest march in Sydney since the early 1970s Vietnam Moratorium demonstrations. The protesters marched through Sydney chanting for land rights. The march ended at Hyde Park where several prominent Aboriginal leaders and activists spoke, among them Gary Foley.Indigenous Protest, 1988 Australian Bicentenary Museum Victoria Demonstrations were also held in other cities and towns including Canberra. This was part of a wider Bicentennial Boycott movement which started in the leadup to the Bicentennial. When it was revealed during the year that attendances at Bicentennial events were below expectations, claims were made that it was due to the public boycotting the events and the Bicentennial in general. ==See also== * Bicentenary of James Cook in Australia ==References== ==External links== * State Library of NSW - First Fleet Re-enactment Company records, 1978-1990: Presented by Trish and Wally Franklin * State Library of NSW - First Fleet Re-enactment Voyage 1987-1988 * Floral Emblems of Australia Category:1988 in Australia Category:History of Australia since 1945 Category:Bicentennial anniversaries Category:Australian historical anniversaries ","title":"Australian Bicentenary"},{"id":"3262848","text":"Nigeria competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, United States. ==Medalists== === Silver=== * Peter Konyegwachie — Boxing, Men's Featherweight (- 57 kg) === Bronze=== * Innocent Egbunike, Rotimi Peters, Moses Ugbusien, and Sunday Uti — Athletics, Men's 4 × 400 m Relay ==Results by event== ===Athletics=== Men's 400 metres * Sunday Uti :* Heat -- 45.74 :* Quarterfinals -- 45.01 :* Semifinals -- 44.83 :* Final -- 44.93 (→ 6th place) * Innocent Egbunike :* Heat -- 46.63 :* Quarterfinals -- 45.26 :* Semifinals -- 45.16 :* Final -- 45.35 (→ 7th place) Men's 400 m Hurdles * Henry Amike Men's 4 × 100 m Relay *Isiaq Adeyanju *Eseme Ikpoto *Samson Oyeledun *Chidi Imoh *Lawrence Adegbeingbe Men's 4 × 400 m Relay *Sunday Uti *Hope Ezeigbo *Felix Imadiyi *Dele Udo Men's Long Jump * Yusuf Alli :* Qualification -- 7.82m :* Final -- 7.78m (→ 9th place) * Jubobaraye Kio :* Qualification -- 7.76m :* Final -- 7.57m (→ 12th place) Men's Triple Jump * Ajayi Agbebaku :* Final -- 16.67m (→ 7th place) * Joseph Taiwo * Paul Emordi Women's Marathon *Ifeoma Mbanugo :* Final -- did not finish (→ no ranking) Women's 100m Hurdles * Maria Usifo Women's 400m Hurdles * Maria Usifo :* Heat -- 57.58 :* Semifinal -- 58.55 (→ did not advance) ===Boxing=== Men's Bantamweight (- 54 kg) *Joe Orewa :* First Round -- Bye :* Second Round -- Defeated Wanchai Pongsri (Thailand), knock-out in second round :* Third Round -- Lost to Héctor López (Mexico), 1-4 Men's Featherweight (- 57 kg) *Peter Konyegwachie :* First Round -- Bye :* Second Round -- Defeated Ali Faki (Malawi), 5-0 :* Third Round -- Defeated Rafael Zuñiga (Colombia), 4-1 :* Quarterfinals -- Defeated Charles Lubulwa (Uganda), 5-0 :* Semi finals -- Defeated Türgüt Aykaç (Turkey), 5-0 :* Final -- Lost to Meldrick Taylor (United States), 0-5 Men's Lightweight (- 60 kg) *Christopher Ossai Men's Light-Welterweight (- 63.5 kg) *Charles Nwokolo Men's Welterweight (- 67 kg) *Roland Omoruyi Men's Middleweight (- 75 kg) *Jerry Okorodudu ===Weightlifting=== Men's Featherweight *Lawrence Iquaibom Men's Lightweight *Patrick Bassey Men's Middle-Heavyweight *Emmanuel Oshomah Men's Heavyweight I *Oliver Orok Men's Super-Heavyweight *Batholomew Oluoma *Ironbar Bassey ===Wrestling=== Men's Welterweight Freestyle *Seidu Olawale Men's Middleweight Freestyle *Kally Agogo Men's Light-Heavyweight Freestyle *Macauley Appah ==See also== * Nigeria at the 1982 Commonwealth Games * Nigeria at the 1986 Commonwealth Games ==References== *Official Olympic Reports *International Olympic Committee results database *sports-reference Category:Nations at the 1984 Summer Olympics 1984 Olympic Games ","title":"Nigeria at the 1984 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"3262849","text":"The Southern Front (Polish Front Południowy) was one of two fronts of the Polish Army created during the Invasion of Poland of 1939 against the allied forces of Nazi Germany and Soviet Union. It was established on September 12 out of the Polish Armies Karpaty and Kraków, as well as several military units created behind the front-lines. Its commander was Gen. Kazimierz Sosnkowski, who was ordered by the Commander in Chief Edward Rydz-Śmigły to organize the Polish defence in the area of Lesser Poland and Volhynia and to prepare a last stand for the Polish defence in the so-called Romanian Bridgehead. Created too late to be able to change the fate of the war, the front was never established as a single entity and the entry of the Soviet Union on the side of Nazi Germany to the war against Poland made the plans for the front's creation obsolete. Situation of the Polish Southern Front near the Lwow region, September 17 1939 On September 13, 1939, Gen. Kazimierz Sosnkowski came by plane to the location of Karpaty Army, renamed into Malopolska Army, which had already been encircled by the Wehrmacht. Since German units had established several bridgeheads along eastern bank of the San river, Sosnkowski decided to break through enemy lines in order to reach Lwow. The general had no idea that on September 12, the Germans had destroyed 24th Infantry Division near Bircza, and 3rd Mountain Brigade near Sambor. In the north, German forces pushed 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade to Jaworow, while 1st Mountain Division attacked Lwow (see Battle of Lwow (1939)). On September 14 Przemysl fell to the Wehrmacht, and Sosnkowski's forces retreated to Sadowa Wisznia, where they concentrated and marched to Lwow. On September 15 and 16, Poles managed to repel German attacks in the forests of Jaworow, destroying among others, SS Germania Regiment. On September 17, Sosnkowski was ordered to march to the Romanian Bridgehead, but was unable to achieve this, due to German encirclement of his army. In the area of Grodek Jagiellonski, remains of what was Polish Southern Front were destroyed by the Wehrmacht. Several soldiers managed to escape to Hungary, but the front as such ceased to exist. == See also == * Polish army order of battle in 1939 * Polish contribution to World War II * Polish Northern Front (1939) == Bibliography == * Tadeusz Jurga: U kresu II Rzeczypospolitej, Książka i Wiedza 1985, * Tadeusz Jurga: Wojsko Polskie : krótki informator historyczny o Wojsku Polskim w latach II wojny światowej. 7, Regularne jednostki Wojska Polskiego w 1939 : organizacja, działania bojowe, uzbrojenie, metryki związków operacyjnych, dywizji i brygad.

A random deviate or simply deviate is the difference of random variate with respect to the distribution central location (e.g., mean), often divided by the standard deviation of the distribution.\\"Deviate: the value of a random variable measured from some standard point of location, usually the mean. It is often understood that the value is expressed in standard measure, i.e., as a proportion of the parent standard deviation.\\" Y. Dodge (Ed.) The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms, Random variates are used when simulating processes driven by random influences (stochastic processes). In modern applications, such simulations would derive random variates corresponding to any given probability distribution from computer procedures designed to create random variates corresponding to a uniform distribution, where these procedures would actually provide values chosen from a uniform distribution of pseudorandom numbers. Procedures to generate random variates corresponding to a given distribution are known as procedures for random variate generation or pseudo-random number sampling. In probability theory, a random variable is a measurable function from a probability space to a measurable space of values that the variable can take on. In that context, those values are also known as random variates or random deviates, and this represents a wider meaning than just that associated with pseudorandom numbers. ==Definition== DevroyeLuc Devroye (1986). Non-Uniform Random Variate Generation. New York: Springer- Verlag, pp. 1–2. () defines a random variate generation algorithm (for real numbers) as follows: :Assume that :# Computers can manipulate real numbers. :# Computers have access to a source of random variates that are uniformly distributed on the closed interval [0,1]. :Then a random variate generation algorithm is any program that halts almost surely and exits with a real number x. This x is called a random variate. (Both assumptions are violated in most real computers. Computers necessarily lack the ability to manipulate real numbers, typically using floating point representations instead. Most computers lack a source of true randomness (like certain hardware random number generators), and instead use pseudorandom number sequences.) The distinction between random variable and random variate is subtle and is not always made in the literature. It is useful when one wants to distinguish between a random variable itself with an associated probability distribution on the one hand, and random draws from that probability distribution on the other, in particular when those draws are ultimately derived by floating-point arithmetic from a pseudo-random sequence. ==Practical aspects== For the generation of uniform random variates, see Random number generation.

M. S. Namboodiripad The Vimochana Samaram (1958–59) (Liberation Struggle in English) was an anticommunist backlash against the first elected state- government in Kerala, India, led by E. M. S. Namboodiripad of the Communist Party of India. Organised opposition to the state government was spearheaded by the Catholic Church in Kerala, the Nair Service Society and the Indian Union Muslim League; although termed a \\"liberation struggle\\", the campaign was largely peaceful by taking the form of statewide meetings and public demonstrations. In June 1959, Kerala was rocked by mass protests calling for the resignation of the communist ministry. The Indian government finally bowed to pressure and dismissed Namboodiripad on 31 July 1959. ==Background== On 1 November 1956, the state of Kerala was formed by the States Reorganisation Act merging the Malabar district, Travancore-Cochin and the taluk of Kasargod, South Kanara. In 1957, elections for the new Kerala Legislative Assembly were held, and a Communist-led government came to power, under E. M. S. Namboodiripad.. It initiated some land reformsConundrum of Kerala's struggling economy by Soutik Biswas BBC News, Kerala and educational reforms by introducing new bills in the state assembly. However, some clauses in the new bills became controversial as those clauses offended several influential interest groups, such as the Catholic Church of Kerala, Muslim League and NSS. A revolt was against the Communist government's educational policies . In 1957, a communist government was elected in Kerala for the first time under the leadership of Shri. E. M. S. Namboodiripad. Subsequently, a revolt propagated against the government. At Angamaly, the prime centre of Christians,, the intensity of fury was broke into open violence. On 13 June, Saturday, 1959 police mindlessly opened fire on an innocent mob. The innocent mob was fired upon without provocation, yet police killed 7 people in cold blood. But, the version of Communist government was different, saying that the police was forced to open fire on what they claim was a violent mob, who allegedly attempted to attack the police station. The police firing and killing of 7 people instigated a mass movement against the EMS Government. ===The controversial legislation=== ====Education bill==== The immediate cause of the outbreak of the Liberation Struggle was the introduction of the Education Bill by the minister of education Joseph Mundassery. The bill had revolutionary content that could have affected the administration of educational institutions, which were financially aided by the government. Many of these institutions, at that time, were under the control of various Christian congregations and a few under the Nair Service Society (NSS). The Education Bill claimed to regulate appointments and working conditions of the teachers in the government-aided schools. The remuneration of the teachers were to be paid directly from the government treasury.The appointments in aided institutions would be made by the management from the list of candidates which were prepared by the Public Service Commission, so as to eradicate corruption. It also mandated to takeover any government-aided educational institution, if they fail to meet the conditions set by the newly promulgated bill. ====Agrarian relations bill==== With the introduction of agrarian relations bill, the government sought to confer ownership rights on tenant cultivators, to grant permanent ownership of land for the agricultural labourers, who reside in their premises at the mercy of landlords, and to attain an equal distribution of land by putting a ceiling on the individual land holdings so as to distribute the surplus land among the landless. With the introduction of the bill, government tried to address the social imbalance that prevailed in the state. In those days, the agricultural labourers, called as kudikidappukar, were considered as slaves. Though they were allowed to stay in a piece of land allotted by the landlord, they were denied any payments for their labour and permanent rights in the land. However, many radical proposals of this bill raised panic among the landowning communities of Kerala, especially Nairs and Syrian Christians. ==Interest groups== #Political parties: Besides the socio-religious organizations, all the major opposition parties including Indian National Congress, Praja Socialist Party (PSP), Muslim League, Revolutionary Socialist Party, and Kerala Socialist Party rallied together demanding the dismissal of the EMS ministry. They formed a joint steering committee with R. Sankar as the president and P. T. Chacko, Pullolil, Kumbalathu Sanku Pillai, Mathai Manjooran, Fr. Joseph Vadakkan, B. Wellington, N. Sreekantan Nair, C. H. Muhammed Koya, and Bafaqi Thangal among its members. #Syrian Christians: A significant proportion of the schools in Kerala were owned by Syrian Christian churches. They found many reformist policies of government as infringements over their rights and so used newspapers and other publications, such as Deepika and Malayala Manorama, to propagate panicking messages against the controversial policies. Christians used their political influence in the central government to derail the educational reforms. The Education Bill was referred to the Supreme court by the President of India and on 17 May 1958 the Supreme Court reported that some clauses of the bill infringed the constitutional rights of minorities. However, the government got presidential assent on 19 February 1959 after it had revised the bill. The disagreement widened, and the Church representatives sought the help of the NSS to fight the government. Following the Angamaly police firing (13 June 1959) in which seven of its members were killed, the Catholic Church and other Syrian Christian Churches actively participated in the struggle and mobilised massive support. #Nair Service Society: NSS, a community welfare organization of Nairs, was a major opponent of land reform policies of the government, which they considered as radical and ill-disposed towards the Nair community of Kerala. In December 1958, NSS joined up with the Catholic Church to form an anticommunist front. The government retracted partially on sensing the trouble that could be created by the alliance of NSS and the Syrian Christians, and it indicated its readiness to make concessions. However, the founder ans leader of thw NSS, Mannathu Padmanabhan, declared that \\"the aim is not limited to the redressal of specific issues but extended to the removal of the Communist Party\\". He called on all the field units of thw NSS to organiae the people and on the educational institutions to close them. #Central Intelligence Agency (CIA): Communists allege that the CIA was behind the liberation struggle. The role of the CIA in the struggle is depicted in the work of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the American ambassador to India (1973–75) in his 1978 book: \\"A Dangerous Place\\". His statements are corroborated by Howard Schaffer, the biographer of Ellsworth Bunker, the American ambassador to India (1956–61), who is quoted confirming American and his involvement in funding the agitation against EMS's communist government to prevent \\"additional Keralas\\". ==Agitations and reprisals== Rallies and demonstrations against the government took place throughout the state. The protests were spearheaded by the Indian National Congress, the then ruling party of Government of India (Union Government) and were later supported by various religious and communal groups. The communists strongly believed that the Central Intelligence Agency discreetly supported these protests, financially and otherwise. The death of a pregnant fisher woman, named Flory, a Christian woman in the police firing aggravated the situation. One notable feature of the movement was the participation of school and college students supporting the movement; the Kerala Students Union, the student wing of the Indian National Congress also played a role. ==Result== The immediate effect of the Vimochana Samaram was the dismissal of the Kerala State government under EMS on 31 July 1959 and imposition of president's rule in the state, under Article 356 of the constitution of India, from 31 July 1959 to 22 February 1960. In the 1960s, elections to the Kerala State Legislative assembly, the United Front, led by the Indian National Congress, won with a majority. A ministry under Pattom A. Thanu Pillai, of the Praja Socialist Party, took office. ==Legacy== The Communist Party of India projects the Liberation Struggle as a conspiracy. Some of the key points of criticism were that it was an anti-democratic, CIA funded, communal movement aimed to shatter the first democratically elected communist ministry. It has further accused the Indian National Congress of publicly joining hands with anti-democratic splinters and communal forces to promote the downfall of a democratically elected government. == External links == * A red dawn that set too soon == References == Category:Political history of Kerala Category:History of Kerala (1947–present) Category:Anti-communism in India Category:Social history of Kerala ","title":"Vimochana Samaram"},{"id":"3262865","text":"Brenda Gilhooly (born 1964 in Epsom, Surrey) is an English comedian.

Interiors were often furnished with a large mirror behind a marble counter with goose-neck soda spouts, plus spinning stools, round marble-topped tables, and wireframe sweetheart chairs. ==History== Drugstore fountain The counter-service soda fountain was introduced in 1903, and around that same time, drugstores began to attract noontime customers by adding sandwiches and light lunches. The beverage menu at a soda shop usually included ice cream sodas , chocolate malts, fountain colas, and milkshakes. A 1915 issue of Soda Fountain magazine stated: \\"The soda fountain of today is an ally of temperance... Ice cream soda is a greater medium for the cause of temperance than all the sermons ever preached on that subject.\\" ==In popular culture== During the 1930s and 1940s, the jukeboxes in such establishments made them popular gathering spots for teenagers, as noted in the 1940s song \\"Jukebox Saturday Night\\" (tune by Paul McGrane and lyrics by Al Stillman): :Moppin' up soda pop rickies :To our hearts' delight, :Dancing to a swingeroo quickie, :Jukebox Saturday night... Pop Tate's Chocklit Shoppe is a fictional soda shop created by Bob Montana as a setting for the characters in his Archie comic books and comic strips. Tate's soda fountain was based on real-life locations frequented by teenagers in Haverhill, Massachusetts, during the 1930s—Crown Confectionery and the Chocolate Shop on Merrimack Street and the Tuscarora on Winter Street. The character of Pop Tate was inspired by the Greek immigrant owners of these Haverhill soda shops. In the years 1936 to 1939, when Montana went to high school in Haverhill, he would join his friends at the Chocolate Shop counter and make sketches on napkins. A decade prior to Archie, the Sugar Shop was a hangout for the teenagers in Carl Ed's comic strip Harold Teen. Soda shops are often used as settings in films and TV shows. In The Twilight Zone's \\"Walking Distance\\" episode, a soda shop serves as a framing device and is a link to the past for Martin Sloan (Gig Young). The popular TV show Happy Days took place in two main sets: the protagonist's home and a soda shop. They appear in the movies Harold Teen (1934), Orson Welles' The Stranger (1946), Has Anybody Seen My Gal? (1952), Pleasantville (1998) and others. The gang from Scooby-Doo are often seen frequenting a malt shop. A malt shop also plays a key point in Blast from the Past, reflecting changes in the surface world while the main characters are underground unaware of what has happened. The protagonist of the young adult science fiction novel Have Spacesuit Will Travel by Robert A. Heinlein works in a drug-store, soda fountain. In the Scooby-Doo cartoons, the Malt Shop is the favourite hangout spot for the Mystery Inc gang, they often go there when they're going over their plans to solve the mystery and when they have finished the mystery, while Scooby and Shaggy typically indulge their eating habits. ==See also== * Milk bar ==References== ==External links== *1920s-1930s soda fountain recipes *History of Detroit ice cream parlors *Zaharako's Confectionery (Columbus, Indiana) Category:Restaurants by type Category:Fast-food restaurants ","title":"Soda shop"},{"id":"3262872","text":"Greece competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, United States. 63 competitors, 59 men and 4 women, took part in 49 events in 11 sports.

In spite of that, it is customary to call Argentine lawyers 'doctors,' although the vast majority of them do not hold a Juris Doctor degree. The reason lies in that the career was originally called 'Doctorate in Laws' (Doctorado en Leyes), which was an undergraduate degree. There were no graduate studies available in the country at the time of its creation, and they would be instituted only in 1949. After the university reform of 1918 the career was renamed 'Attorney'. It is 5–6 years long, some universities also offering sub-degrees called 'University Bachelor in Law,' commonly taking 3–4 years to complete and closer to an associate degree. === Australia === To practice in Australia, one needs to graduate with a Bachelor of Laws (LLB), Juris Doctor (JD), or Diploma-in-Law issued by the Legal Profession Admission Board, followed by an internship for 12 months or an extra course in practical legal training (PLT) depending on the jurisdiction and university, and be admitted as a lawyer of one of a state's Supreme Court. === Belgium === In Belgium, the admission to the Belgian Bar is permitted after 5-year law degree. === Brazil === In Brazil, the legal education begins between 1827/28 in Olinda/PE and São Paulo/SP where the first schools of law were established by the new Empire using the Coimbra Faculty of Law as an educational model. The current legal education consists of a 5-year-long course after which the scholar is granted a bachelor's degree.portal.mec.gov.br/cne/arquivos/pdf/rces09_04.pdf The practice of law is conditioned upon admission to the bar of a particular state or other territorial jurisdiction (Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil - OAB ). Before practicing as public attorneys, public prosecutors or magistrates (judges), candidates must successfully pass an entrance examination and complete a constitutionally-mandated three years of legal experience. Second degree courts and higher must have at least one-fifth of their judges be members of a lawyers' association, and also from federal/state/labour prosecutors (ministério público) regarding the court jurisdiction. Electoral and military courts do not have this requirement. After achieving the bachelor's degree in law, it is possible to specialize (lato sensu) or to follow an academic law path (stricto sensu), or both. The stricto sensu postgraduate program consists of a master's degree, which is usually a two-year degree, followed by a doctorate degree, which can take up to another four years. === Canada === The oldest civil law faculty in Canada offering law degrees was established in 1848 at McGill University in Montreal, and the oldest common law faculty in Canada offering law degrees was established in 1883 at Dalhousie University in Halifax.

There is an intermediate bachelor's degree (oikeusnotaari), but the target is the master's degree in law (oikeustieteen maisteri; until 2005 oikeustieteen kandidaatti). Once university education is complete, the title of varatuomari (VT) is obtained with a one-year externship in a district court. This is the basic qualification to practice law as a judge. With further experience, the candidate may be admitted to the Finnish Bar Association and licensed with the legally protected title asianajaja, similar to barrister. ===France=== In France, the legal education is a three tier system. The student may study for a LLB (licence de droit), then a LLM (master de droit) and, for those interested in Law theory, a PhD in Law (doctorat de droit). Many French universities offers Law courses in department labelled as Research and Education Units (unité de formation et de recherche) and/or Faculties of Law or Law Schools. A LLM-level is a prerequisite for some legal professions, but is combined with vocational education, such as the école nationale de la magistrature for judges and the Certificat d'aptitude aux fonctions d'avocat for advocates. ===Indonesia=== Law Degree in Indonesia consists of three tier systems. The first tier is the Degree of which carries the title of Sarjana Hukum/S.H. (Bachelor of Law). This can be obtained in 4–7 years after they enter Law School straight from Senior High School. The second tier varies depending on the legal specialties taken after the first tier. The general title for this tier is Magister Hukum / M.H. (Master in Law). Although it is also common to see other title for secondary tier such as Magister Kenotariatan / M.Kn. (Master in Notary) for Notarial professionals line of work. The second tier can be obtained normally in 1-2 year. The third tier in Indonesian Law Degree is Doctor / DR. (Doctor in Law). To work in legal professions of choice in Indonesia, a Bachelor Law Degree (S.H.) is obligatory. Graduates can pursue their career as Legal in-house counsel, Judge profession (requires admission and further training at Supreme Court Educational Center), Public Prosecutor (requires admission and further training at Public Prosecutor Educational and Training Center), other legal- related work and Advocate. To become an Advocate, Law Graduate should attend an Advocate Special Course (1–2 months) and pass the Bar exam. The title Advocate can be obtained after a graduate passes the Bar exam and fulfill several obligation and requirements created by the Indonesian Advocates Association (PERADI), and is a prerequisite for practicing trial law in Indonesia. ===India=== West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences, in Kolkata is one of the autonomous law schools in India In India, legal education has been traditionally offered as a three-year graduate degree. However, the structure has been changed since 1987. Law degrees in India are granted and conferred in terms of the Advocates Act, 1961, which is a law passed by the Parliament both on the aspect of legal education and also regulation of conduct of legal profession. Under the act, the Bar Council of India is the supreme regulatory body to regulate the legal profession in India and also to ensure the compliance of the laws and maintenance of professional standards by the legal profession in the country. To this regard, the Bar Council of India prescribes the minimum curriculum required to be taught in order for an institution to be eligible for the grant of a law degree. The Bar Council also carries on a periodic supervision of the institutions conferring the degree and evaluates their teaching methodology and curriculum and having determined that the institution meets the required standards, recognizes the institution and the degree conferred by it. Traditionally the degrees that were conferred carried the title of LL.B. (Bachelor of Laws) or B.L. (Bachelor of Law). The eligibility requirement for these degrees was that the applicant already have a Bachelor's degree in any subject from a recognized institution. Thereafter the LL.B. / B.L. course was for three years, upon the successful completion of which the applicant was granted either degree. However, upon the suggestion by the Law Commission of India and also given the prevailing cry for reform, the Bar Council of India instituted upon an experiment in terms of establishing specialized law universities solely devoted to legal education and thus to raise the academic standards of legal profession in India. This decision was taken somewhere in 1985 and thereafter the first law University in India was set up in Bangalore which was named as the National Law School of India University (popularly 'NLS'). These law universities were meant to offer a multi-disciplinary and integrated approach to legal education. It was therefore for the first time that a law degree other than LL.B. or B.L. was granted in India. NLS offered a five-year law course, upon the successful completion of which an integrated degree with the title of \\"B.A., LL.B. (Honours)\\" would be granted. Thereafter, other law universities were set up, all offering five-year integrated law degrees with different nomenclature. The next in line was National Law Institute University set up in Bhopal in 1997. It was followed by NALSAR university of law in 1998. The Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University in Delhi offered a five-year integrated law degree course of LL.B (Honours) from 1998 and subsequently from 2007 started to award the B.A., LL.B / B.B.A.LL.B (Honours). The Mysore University School of Justice set up by the University of Mysore in Mysore offered a five-year integrated law degree course of B.A., LL.B (Honours) from 2007. The course for three years LL.B. is also regularized in University of Delhi as an option for post graduation after the completion of graduation degree. The National Law University, Jodhpur offered for the first time in 2001 the integrated law degree of \\"B.B.A, LL.B. (Honours)\\" which was preceded by the West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences offering the \\"B.Sc., LL.B. (Honours)\\" degree. Gujarat National Law University established in Gandhinagar also offers LL.B. However, despite these specialized law universities, the traditional three-year degree continues to be offered in India by other institutions and are equally recognized as eligible qualifications for practicing law in India. Another essential difference that remains is that while the eligibility qualification for the three year law degree is that the applicant must already be a holder of a bachelor's degree, for being eligible for the five years integrated law degree, the applicant must have successfully completed Class XII from a recognized Boards of Education in India. Both the holders of the three-year degree and of the five-year integrated degree are eligible for enrollment with the Bar Council of India upon the fulfillment of eligibility conditions and upon enrollment, may appear before any court in India.Major Legal Systems in the World Today: An Introduction to the Comparative Study of Law, by René David, John E. C. Brierley, Contributor René David, John E. C. Brierley, Edition: 2, (Published by Simon and Schuster, 1978), ===Malaysia=== ===Hong Kong=== In Hong Kong, which generally follows the English common law system, an undergraduate L.L.B. is common, followed by a one or two year Postgraduate Certificate in Laws before one can begin a training contract (solicitors) or a pupillage (barristers). === Iran === In Iran, the legal education has been influenced both by civil law and Islamic Shari'ah law. Like many countries, after high school, one can enter the law school. The first law degree is Bachelor of Science. It takes about four years to get B.S. The first graduate program in law is B.S. It takes about two to three years to earn an Master of Science. The Master of Science is a mix of course work in a specific field of law and a dissertation. The Ph.D. in law is the highest law degree offered by some law schools. It takes about 5–7 years depending on the school as well as the students. === Italy === In Italy, the route for obtaining a legal education to qualify as a practicing lawyer is via a 5-year Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree. Law school is usually entered to at the undergraduate level in a university. === Japan === See Legal education#Japan. === Philippines === Law degree programs are considered graduate programs in the Philippines. As such, admission to law schools requires the completion of a bachelor's degree, with a sufficient number of credits or units in certain subject areas. Graduation from a Philippine law school constitutes the primary eligibility requirement for the Philippine Bar Examination, the national licensure examination for practicing lawyers in the country. The bar examination is administered by the Supreme Court of the Philippines during the month of September every year. As of 2011 the bar examinations were held during November. The University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law was the first secular faculty, and hence the oldest law school in the Philippines. === Singapore === In Singapore, the primary route for obtaining a legal education to qualify as a practicing lawyer is via a 4-year Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree from either the NUS Faculty of Law, or the SMU School of Law. The SUSS School of Law is aimed primarily at producing law graduates focused on family law and criminal law, as there is a pressing need for lawyers practicing in these areas. Additionally, the SMU School of Law offers the 3-year Juris Doctor degree for aspiring candidates who have already completed a prior undergraduate course of study and who have been award a bachelor's degree in another field. The SMU J.D. is recognised for qualification to the Singapore Bar. There are several private law schools in Singapore that are run by private education providers and which also award the Bachelor of Laws degree. These private law schools are neither recognised nor supported by the government and their graduates are, in the vast majority of cases, ineligible for qualification to the Singapore Bar. ===Serbia=== In Serbia, prospective students are required to pass an admission test for enrollment in a law school. The legal education is a three tier system – 4-year bachelor's degree studies, 1-year Master of Law and 5-year doctoral studies. The Belgrade Law School is the most distinguished and largest by capacity in Serbia. Courses are offered in Serbian and English. === South Korea === On July 3, 2007, the Korean National Assembly passed legislation introducing 'Law School', closely modeled on the American post-graduate system.Assembly okays shift to law schools from state bar exam , The Hankyoreh, Retrieved on July 4, 2007 Moreover, naturally, since March 2, 2009, 25 (both public and private) 3-year professional Law Schools that officially approved by Korean Government, has been opened to teach future Korean lawyers.Korean Law School List Announced , Korean Law Blog, January 31, 2008 The first bar test to the lawschool graduates was scheduled in 2012. ===Sri Lanka=== In Sri Lanka to practice law, one must be admitted and enrolled as an Attorney-at-Law of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. This is achieved by passing law exams at the Sri Lanka Law College, which are administered by the Council of Legal Education and spending a period of six months under a practicing attorney of at least 8 years standing. To undertake law exams students must gain admission to the Sri Lanka Law College and study law or directly undertake exams after gaining a LL.B. from a local or foreign university. ===Sweden=== In Sweden, the route for obtaining a legal education to qualify as a practicing lawyer is via a 4-and-a-half-year Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree (270 ECTS). ===Taiwan=== In Taiwan, law is primarily studied as an undergraduate program resulting in a Bachelor of Law (B.L.).Chang-fa Lo, Driving an Ox Cart to Catch Up With the Space Shuttle: The Need For and Prospects of Legal Education Reform in Taiwan, 24 Wis. Int'l L.J. 41 (2006). Students receive academic rather than practical training. Practical training is arranged after the individual passes the lawyer, judge, or prosecutor exams. A degree in law (bachelor, master or doctor) is a pre-requisite for Taiwan's bar examination. According to Ministry of Examination figures, the pass rate for the 2011 exam was 10.6%. Since the bar exam is conducted in Chinese, a native level of language fluency is expected. A non-citizen may take the Attorney Qualification Examination. According to Articles 5 and 20 of the Regulations on Attorney Qualification Examination (Bar Exam), non-citizens are allowed to participate in the bar examination with a degree in law earned in Taiwan. Non-citizens are not allowed to sit in the prosecutor or judge examinations unless they are naturalized citizens of Taiwan. Once a non- citizen is approved to practice law in Taiwan, he or she must abide by all statutes related to the legal practice, Codes of Legal Ethics, and the Articles of Incorporation of the Bar Association to which they are members. ===United States=== Founded in 1817, Harvard Law School is the oldest continuously operating law school in the United States. In the United States, law school is a postgraduate program usually lasting three years and resulting in the conferral upon graduates of the Juris Doctor (J.D.) law degree. Some schools in Louisiana concurrently award a Graduate Diploma in Civil Law (D.C.L.). To gain admission to a law school that is accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA), applicants must usually take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), and have an undergraduate (bachelor's) degree in any major. Currently, there are 203 ABA-approved law schools that grant the JD degree. There currently are eight law schools that are unaccredited by any state bar or the ABA but registered by the State Bar of California, 21 law schools accredited solely by the State Bar of California, 2 law schools accredited solely by statute in Alabama and 1 law school accredited solely by the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education. Non-ABA approved law schools have much lower bar passage rates than ABA-approved law schools, and do not submit or disclose employment outcome data to the ABA. In 1869, Washington University School of Law became the first chartered law school in America to admit women. According to a study by labor economists Michael Simkovic and Frank McIntyre, a law degree increases the present value of lifetime earnings in the U.S. by $1,000,000 compared to a bachelor's degree. According to the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national average salary for lawyers in 2012 was above $130,000, albeit in a bimodal distribution. Salaries vary by geography, with higher average salaries in big cities—especially New York, Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Los Angeles—and lower salaries in rural areas. An unpublished table produced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that unemployment rates among experienced lawyers are lower than those for most high-income occupations. BLS data also suggests that lawyer employment has grown slightly faster than other occupations, with lawyers comprising a growing share of the work force over the last decade. However, not all recent law graduates work as lawyers. According to Simkovic and McIntyre's study of U.S. Census Bureau data, around 40 percent of U.S. residents with law degrees do not practice law. Law graduates are disproportionately represented in leadership positions in business and government. The National Association for Legal Career Professionals produces an annual report summarizing the employment of recent graduates of U.S. law schools at a single point in time, 9 months of graduation. Employment at that point is typically around 90 percent, although from 2009 to 2011, the numbers have been lower, at around 86 to 88 percent. Approximately 2 percent of graduates were employed in non-professional jobs. Approximately 75 to 85 percent work in jobs classified by NALP as \\"JD required\\" or \\"JD preferred\\", and another 5 percent work in other professional jobs. However, a law degree increases earnings, even including those who do not practice law. ==Postgraduate and professional study== Some schools offer a Master of Laws (LL.M.) program as a way of specializing in a particular area of law. A further possible degree is the academic doctoral degree in law of Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D.) (in the U.S. or Canada)., or the Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) in Canada or the UK, or the Ph.D. in Law from European or Australasian universities. In addition to attending law school, many jurisdictions require law school graduates to pass a state or provincial bar examination before they may practice law. The Multistate Bar Examination is part of the bar examination in almost all United States jurisdictions. Generally, the standardized, common law subject matter of the MBE is combined with state-specific essay questions to produce a comprehensive bar examination. In other common law countries the bar exam is often replaced by a period of work with a law firm known as articles of clerkship. == Alternative legal education systems == ===UK and Europe=== While law schools in the U.S. and Canada are typically post-graduate institutions with considerable autonomy, legal education in other countries is provided within the mainstream educational system from university level and/or in non-degree conferring vocational training institutions. In countries such as the United Kingdom and most of continental Europe, academic legal education is provided within the mainstream university system starting at the undergraduate level, and the legal departments of universities are simply departments like any other rather than separate \\"law schools\\". In these countries, the term \\"law school\\" may be used, but it does not have the same definition as it does in North America. The same is true for private Law Schools, e.g. in Germany two private law schools have been established, Bucerius Law School in Hamburg and EBS Law School in Wiesbaden which are termed law schools but follow the usual German path of legal education. There are also sometimes legal colleges that provide vocational training as a post-academic stage of legal education. One example is the University of Law in the United Kingdom, which provides certain professional qualifications lawyers in England and Wales must obtain before they may practice as solicitors or barristers. ===Australia=== In Australia, law schools such as the Melbourne Law School, the Adelaide Law School, and the Sydney Law School have emphasised a combination of the British and American systems. However, other universities such as the University of New South Wales, the Australian National University and Monash University are known for their practical work.For a discussion on the practical training in Australian law schools see Margaret Castles and Anne Hewitt 'Can a law school help develop skilled legal professionals' (2011) ALTERNATIVE LAW JOURNAL; 36 (2) 2011: 90–95. == List of law schools == == See also == * Faculty of law * Law School Admissions Test * Legal clinic * Madrasa * Paralegal == References == ==Further reading== * Duncan Kennedy: Legal Education and the Reproduction of Hierarchy, New Edition, New York Univ Press, 2004, * Category:Types of university or college Category:Legal education ","title":"Law school"},{"id":"3262888","text":"Naviti island Naviti (pronounced ) is a volcanic island in the Yasawa Group, in the Western Division of Fiji.

The island has been planted greatly with coconut palm trees. Naviti has a humid, tropical climate and remains a target for tropical cyclones, the last one being Cyclone Winston in February 2016. The first known European to visit Naviti was William Bligh in 1789, before experiencing mutiny on his ship, . There are several villages based on Naviti Island, including Soso, Kese, Gunu, Somosomo, Marou, Muaira, Malevu, and Nasoqo. Soso is a chiefly village, which is home to the current chief or \\"ratu\\". Each village is interconnected by several trails. Naviti Island is also home to the Yasawa High School, the only high school in the Yasawa Islands, although there are kindergartens and primary schools in most villages. The main economic activity is centred on resort hotels, and several of them are found around the island. Naviti Island is also a popular base for voluntourism.

Büchi showed in 1962 that ω-regular languages are precisely the ones definable in a particular monadic second-order logic called S1S. == Formal definition == An ω-language L is ω-regular if it has the form * Aω where A is a nonempty regular language not containing the empty string * AB, the concatenation of a regular language A and an ω-regular language B (Note that BA is not well-defined) * A ∪ B where A and B are ω-regular languages (this rule can only be applied finitely many times) The elements of Aω are obtained by concatenating words from A infinitely many times. Note that if A is regular, Aω is not necessarily ω-regular, since A could be {ε}, the set containing only the empty string, in which case Aω=A, which is not an ω-language and therefore not an ω-regular language. == Equivalence to Büchi automaton== Theorem: An ω-language is recognized by a Büchi automaton if and only if it is an ω-regular language. Proof: Every ω-regular language is recognized by a nondeterministic Büchi automaton; the translation is constructive. Using the closure properties of Büchi automata and structural induction over the definition of ω-regular language, it can be easily shown that a Büchi automaton can be constructed for any given ω-regular language. Conversely, for a given Büchi automaton A = (Q, Σ, Δ, I, F), we construct an ω-regular language and then we will show that this language is recognized by A. For an ω-word w = a1a2... let w(i,j) be the finite segment ai+1...aj-1aj of w. For every q, q' ∈ Q, we define a regular language Lq,q' that is accepted by the finite automaton (Q, Σ, Δ, q, {q'}). :Lemma: We claim that Büchi automaton A recognizes language ⋃q∈I,q'∈F Lq,q' (Lq',q' - {ε} )ω. :Proof: Let's suppose word w ∈ L(A) and q0,q1,q2,... is an accepting run of A on w. Therefore, q0 is in I and there must be a state q' in F such that q' occurs infinitely often in the accepting run. Let's pick the increasing infinite sequence of indexes i0,i1,i2... such that, for all k≥0, qik is q'. Therefore, w(0,i0)∈Lq0,q' and, for all k≥0, w(ik,ik+1)∈Lq',q' . Therefore, w ∈ Lq0,q' (Lq',q' )ω. :Now, suppose w ∈ Lq,q' (Lq',q' - {ε} )ω for some q∈I and q'∈F. Therefore, there is an infinite and strictly increasing sequence i0,i1,i2... such that w(0,i0) ∈ Lq,q' and, for all k≥0,w(ik,ik+1)∈Lq',q' . By definition of Lq,q', there is a finite run of A from q to q' on word w(0,i0). For all k≥0, there is a finite run of A from q' to q' on word w(ik,ik+1). By this construction, there is a run of A, which starts from q and in which q' occurs infinitely often. Hence, w ∈ L(A). == Bibliography == * W.

Several of his co-stars and stuntmen hired by the film studios began working together regularly. This engendered a familiarity of one another's skills and abilities and it made sense for them to become a working team. Some of the members had received training at the Peking Opera schools, similar to Chan. By 1983, and the release of the film Project A, the stunt team had become an official organisation of 6 members. The organisation meant that the stuntmen not only received insurance coverage, but also a monthly salary and higher pay. By the time of Police Story 2 in 1988, the team had expanded to around 20 members. This incarnation of the team was disbanded in 1990 and thereafter, individual members were contracted and used on a film- by-film basis rather than all members remaining on the payroll. This allowed for some new faces, and the return of former members. The formation of Chan's team influenced others in the business to follow suit, particularly his former co-stars and \\"brothers\\" Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao (their stunt teams known as \\"Hung Ga Ban\\" and \\"Yuen Ga Ban\\" respectively). Other actors who formed their own stunt teams include Lau Kar-leung, Philip Ko, Stanley Tong and Bruce Law. Chan's stunt team worked in collaboration with Sammo Hung's team on films including Thunderbolt and Around the World in 80 Days. A small number of films that Chan produced but did not appear in, or was not involved in at all, have utilised his stunt team. These include The Gold Hunters (1981), Rouge (1988), The Inspector Wears Skirts 2 (1989), Stage Door Johnny (1990) and Angry Ranger (1991). ==Members (past & present)== These are former and current members of Chan's stunt team.

The Aircraft Apprentice scheme trained young men in the mechanical trades for aircraft maintenance, the graduates of which were the best trained technicians in the RAF and would usually progress to Senior NCO ranks. However, ninety one ex-apprentices went on to achieve Air Rank. Many more became commissioned officers, including Sir Frank Whittle \\"father of the jet engine\\", who completed his apprenticeship at RAF Cranwell, before the move to RAF Halton. Graduates of the Aircraft Apprentice scheme at RAF Halton are known as Old Haltonians. ==History== As well as the three-year apprentice scheme No.1 S of TT also carried out training of Craft Apprentices on a newly developed two-year long apprenticeship, from 1964, commencing with 201 entry. Sgt Craft Apprentice Glenn Morton of 203 entry was the first craft apprentice to receive a direct entry commission after graduating from Halton. The immediate past senior serving member of the RAF Halton Apprentices Association (Old Haltonians) is Air Vice-Marshal Paul Colley OBE, who joined the RAF as an apprentice of 127th entry. The oldest living member of the association is awarded the honorary title \\"King Brat\\" as a mark of respect. Inside the New Workshops of No.1 SofTT at RAF Halton during the 1970s The Patron of the \\"Old Haltonians\\" Association is Air Chief Marshal Mike Armitage (56th entry, Aircraft Apprentices) and the Vice-Patrons are Air Marshal Cliff Spink (104th entry, Aircraft Apprentices) and Air Marshal Sir Graham Miller (RAF officer) (210th entry, Craft Apprentices). The RAF Aircraft Apprentice Scheme was initiated by Lord Trenchard at the No.1 School of Technical Training, RAF Halton in 1922. Initially started in 1920 at Halton camp, the site was not ready to accept apprentices until 1922 so the first four entries were trained at 'RAF Cranwell'. Between 1922 and 1993, when the scheme ended with 155th Entry, over 40,000 young men known, more or less affectionately as Halton 'Brats' (or Trenchard's Brats) had graduated. Richie Waylens (155th) is officially the last apprentice to graduate from the apprentice scheme at Cosford in 1993. In July 1952, No.1 S of TT received royal recognition when Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II presented the School with a colour. The colour was received on behalf of the school by the 63rd Entry of aircraft apprentices; the colour party being Sergeant Aircraft Apprentice (S/A/A) F.M. Hines, and identical twins S/A/A's Clive and Richard Grant. The Colour is unique among those awarded to United Kingdom forces in that it is paraded by non-commissioned personnel. This is a tradition inaugurated by the Queen when she presented the original Colour in 1952. From 1993 to the present No.1 S of TT has been based at the Defence College of Aeronautical Engineering, Cosford. ==Commandants== *Air Cdre F R Scarlett 8 December 1919 to 27 February 1924 *Air Cdre C L Lambe 28 February 1924 to 31 March 1928 *Air Cdre I M Bonham- Carter 1 April 1928 to 30 September 1931 *AVM N D K MacEwen 1 October 1931 to 26 December 1934 *Air Cdre J T Babington 27 December 1934 to 9 July 1936 *Air Cdre G R M Reid *Air Cdre G B Dacre *AVM O Swann *Air Cdre G B Dacre *Air Cdre H G White *Air Cdre J F Titmas *Air Cdre N Carter *Air Cdre J G Elton *Air Cdre J G W Weston *Air Cdre G N E Tindal-Carill-Worsley *Air Cdre E D McK Nelson *Air Cdre T N Coslett *Air Cdre B Robinson *Air Cdre D M Strong *Air Cdre A C Deere *Air Cdre H P Connelly *Air Cdre R H G Weighill *Air Cdre B Hamilton *Air Cdre M P Stanton *Gp Capt J P Downes *Gp Capt O J Truelove *Gp Capt Michael J Evans (70th entry of apprentices) - past Chairman of the Old Haltonians Association *Gp Capt S P Rarsons *Gp Capt R H Kyle *Gp Capt S M Williamson-Noble *Gp Capt Ian R Blunt (84th entry of apprentices) - past Chairman of the Old Haltonians Association (b. 1940; d. 20 November 2010) *Gp Capt Rodney Brumpton (retired as Air Commodore) (106th entry of apprentices) - past Chairman of the Old Haltonians Association *Gp Capt Geoffrey O Burton (100th entry of apprentices) - past Chairman of the Old Haltonians Association ==References== ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== *Royal Air Force Halton Apprentices Association (Old Haltonians) *Old Haltonians social networking site Technical Training 1 Category:Air force technical training units and formations ","title":"No. 1 School of Technical Training RAF"},{"id":"3262903","text":"Yr Atal Genhedlaeth is the debut solo album by Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys.

She married the artist Alan Wright in June 1912 at Burghfield Common Parish Church in Berkshire, and they lived in the cottage she had purchased two years earlier. Though they collaborated on many projects, Anne was considered the driving force. Her husband had had a successful career as an illustrator until working on a book for the vilified homosexual Baron Corvo in 1898. That book caused a scandal that ruined Wright's reputation.

The name \\"Inchmahome\\" comes from the Gaelic Innis MoCholmaig, meaning Island of St Colmaig. The priory was founded in 1238 by the Earl of Menteith, Walter Comyn, for a small community of the Augustinian order (the Black Canons). The Comyn family were one of the most powerful in Scotland at the time, and had an imposing country house on Inch Talla, one of the other islands on the Lake of Menteith. There is some evidence that there was a church on the island before the priory was established. The priory has a long history of receiving many notable guests. King Robert the Bruce visited three times: in 1306, 1308 and 1310. His visits were likely politically motivated, as the first prior had sworn allegiance to Edward I, the English king. In 1358 the future King Robert II also stayed at the priory. In 1547 the priory served as a refuge for Queen Mary, aged four, hidden here for a few weeks following the disastrous defeat of the Scots army at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh during the Rough Wooing. The decline of the monastic orders in the 16th century was hastened by the fact that the heads of abbeys and priories became appointees of the local landowner, who often did not share the religious goals of the monks or ordained priests. In 1547, the office passed to John, Lord Erskine, who later became head of Cambuskenneth and Dryburgh abbeys. The Scottish Reformation meant that there were no new priests being ordained, and religious land and buildings gradually passed into secular hands, leading to the priory's inevitable decline. In 1606 the land and property passed to the Erskine family, and later to the Marquess of Montrose; the 6th Duke of Montrose passed it into the care of the State in 1926. The author, socialist and nationalist politician Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham and his wife Gabriela Cunninghame Graham are buried in the ruined chancel of the priory, where there is also a stone commemorating his nephew, and heir, Admiral A.E.M.B. Cunninghame Graham. Although most of the buildings are now ruins, much of the original 13th- century structure remains, and it is now in the care of Historic Environment Scotland, who maintain and preserve it as a scheduled ancient monument. The priory can be visited by boat, operated by Historic Scotland from the nearby pier at Port of Menteith, from March to September. ==Burials== *Walter Bailloch *Mary I, Countess of Menteith ==See also== *Prior of Inchmahome, for a list of priors and commendators * Scheduled monuments in Stirling ==References== ==External links== *Ancient Scotland * * * Port of Menteith Village Hall Category:Augustinian monasteries in Scotland Category:1238 establishments in Scotland Category:Lake of Menteith Category:Churches in Stirling (council area) Category:Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes Category:Christian monasteries established in the 13th century Category:Religious museums in Scotland Category:Historic house museums in Stirling (council area) Category:Scheduled Ancient Monuments in Stirling Category:Trossachs Category:Former Christian monasteries in Scotland ","title":"Inchmahome Priory"},{"id":"3263001","text":"Sir Misha Black (16 October 1910 – 11 October 1977) was a British architect and designer.

The album was rediscovered by record enthusiasts and reissued numerous times beginning in 1998, growing in popularity with the rise of the New Weird America movement and the Internet. In 2014, she released a second album titled The Soul of All Natural Things. ==Biography== Perhacs was born Linda Arnold in 1943 in Mill Valley, California.\\"United States Public Records, 1970-2009,\\" database, FamilySearch (23 May 2014), Linda Jeanne Perhacs, United States; a third party aggregator of publicly available information. In the late 1960s, Perhacs relocated to Topanga Canyon, and was working as a dental hygienist in Beverly Hills, California under a former professor she had met while a student at the University of Southern California. In her spare time, she wrote songs. One of her dental clients, Oscar-winning film composer Leonard Rosenman, was impressed by one of her demos and brought her into a studio during 1969–1970, producing her first album, Parallelograms. When the album failed to make an impression, she returned to her dental career. Michael Piper of folk label the Wild Places, who had first reissued the album in 1998 sourced from the LP, located and contacted Perhacs in 2000, leading to expanded reissues of Parallelograms on CD and vinyl in 2003, sourced from tapes in Perhacs' personal collection. It was reissued again by Sunbeam Records in 2008, by both Mexican Summer and Sundazed Records in 2010, and by Anthology Recordings in 2014. Following her rediscovery and the reissues, Perhacs returned to recording, and recorded her second album in 2012 and 2013 with producers Chris Price and Fernando Perdomo and collaborators including Julia Holter and Ramona Gonzalez of Nite Jewel. The Soul of All Natural Things was released on March 4, 2014 by Asthmatic Kitty Records. Her songs have been prominently sampled, including \\"Chimacum Rain\\" (by Prefuse 73 for the track \\"Rain Edit (Interlude)\\" from the 2005 album Surrounded by Silence, and by Jadakiss for his song \\"Rain\\", released on his 2015 \\"Top 5 Dead or Alive\\" album) and \\"Hey, Who Really Cares\\" (by UK rap artist Lowkey in his song \\"Who Really Cares\\", from his 2009 compilation album Uncensored). In 2007, her song \\"If You Were My Man\\" was featured on the soundtrack for the film Daft Punk's Electroma. Perhacs has made several guest appearances on other recordings. She sang backing vocals on \\"Freely\\" from Devendra Banhart's Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon (2007), and sang on and cowrote the song \\"You Wash My Soul\\" on Mark Pritchard's album Under the Sun (2016). In March 2016, Perhacs released a new single, \\"The Dancer\\", as a preview for her third album. In May 2016, her song \\"River of God\\" (from The Soul of All Natural Things) was selected by Land's End for use in a commercial for their Lands' End Canvas line.

It was named after the introductory piece of classical music the band used before coming on stage during the Clutching at Straws tour 1987–1988, the overture to Rossini's opera La gazza ladra, which translates as \\"The Thieving Magpie\\". The album was released shortly after singer Fish's departure from the band (and before Steve Hogarth's arrival) and was intended to document the \\"Fish years\\". It complements the band's first live album Real to Reel insofar as there are no overlaps. The Thieving Magpie is not a continuous live recording, but a compilation of tracks recorded at different times and places, with audible gaps between them and different moods on the individual tracks. However, the double vinyl version does include the first side of the UK number one concept album Misplaced Childhood (1985). The CD and cassette version includes the full album, as well as the track \\"Freaks\\" – originally the b-side to \\"Lavender\\", it was used as the lead single for The Thieving Magpie peaking at no. 18 in the UK. The album was produced by Christopher \\"Privet\\" Hedge, who had been Marillion's sound engineer from early on in their career. ==Cover art== The cover was designed by regular Marillion contributor Mark Wilkinson, who went on to work for Fish. The front part contains photorealistic airbrushed renderings of the band members. The back cover features characters found on the covers of the previous albums, i.e. \\"The Jester\\" (Script for a Jester's Tear), \\"The Boy\\" (Misplaced Childhood), and \\"Torch\\" (Clutching at Straws). The inside of the vinyl gatefold sleeve consists of a rather blurred photograph of the band on stage, circa 1986. ==Release history== Originally, the album was released on double vinyl and the above-mentioned extended double CD/cassette set. In 2005, EMI Japan released a \\"vinyl replica\\" edition, i.e. a CD in a miniaturised version of the original vinyl packaging. The track listing, however, is the same as on the original 2CD version.

The earliest known use of the term to describe this occupation occurred in 1833. The advent of through brakes, brakes on every wagon which could be controlled by the driver, made this role redundant, although the name lives on in the United States where brakemen carry out a variety of functions both on the track and within trains. == By country == === USA === During the early days of railroading, one of the most deadly jobs in America was that of brakeman, who worked from the top of moving trains in all weather In the United States, the brakeman was a member of a railroad train's crew responsible for assisting with braking a train when the conductor wanted the train to slow down or stop. A brakeman's duties also included ensuring that the couplings between cars were properly set, lining switches, and signaling to the train operators while performing switching operations. The brakemen rode in the caboose, the last car in the train, which was built specially to allow a crew member to apply the brakes of the caboose quickly and easily, which would help to slow the train. In rare cases, such as descending a long, steep grade, brakemen might be assigned to several cars and be required to operate the brakes from atop the train while the train was moving. By the start of the 20th century, some local U.S. labor laws noted that enough brakemen would be staffed on every train such that a brakeman would be responsible for no more than two cars. Brakemen were also required to watch the train when it was underway to look for signs of hot boxes (a dangerous overheating of axle bearings) or other damage to rolling stock, as well as for people trying to ride the train for free and cargo shifting or falling off. A brakeman's job was historically very dangerous with numerous reports of brakemen falling from trains, colliding with lineside structures or being run over or crushed by rolling stock. As rail transport technology has improved, a brakeman's duties have been reduced and altered to match the updated technology, and the brakeman's job has become much safer than it was in the early days of railroading. Individually operated car brakes were replaced by remotely-operated air brakes, eliminating the need for the brakeman to walk atop a moving train to set the brakes. Link and pin couplings were replaced with automatic couplings, and hand signals are now supplemented by two-way radio communication. As of 2012, 24,380 \\"railroad brake, signal, and switch operators\\" jobs were staffed in the U.S., with 93% of them employed in the rail transport industry with much of the remainder employed by supporting companies. By 2018, the total number had dropped to 14,270, with the highest employment rates in Texas, Illinois, Georgia, Missouri, and New York. === UK === In the UK, the brakeman was more often referred to as the guard, originally tasked with stopping the train if a coupler broke. As rail lines extended, the guard would apply brakes on downhill gradients. With longer trains, the job included notifying the driver (by waving a lamp) that the back of the train had started moving along with the rest of the train, or stopped with the rest of the train. As trains were sometimes required to run in reverse, the guard was further tasked with ensuring the tail lamp shone white instead of red in these cases. In 1968, with the prevalence of diesel and electric trains, the legal requirement for brake vans was eliminated, and guard positions went into decline. === Germany === Brakeman's cab (left) on a Prussian compartment coach In Germany, the brakemen occupied brakeman's cabins on several or even all wagons in a train and would operate the wagon brakes when signaled by the engine driver. It was a dangerous and uncomfortable role, especially in winter when it was not uncommon for brakemen to freeze to death in the unheated cabins. The function was abolished in the 1920s with the introduction of air brakes, which could be controlled by the engine driver. == Duties today == Freight and yard crews consisting of conductor, engineer, and brakeman usually employ the brakeman in throwing hand-operated track switches to line up for switching moves and assisting in cuts and hitches as cars are dropped off and picked up. A brakeman is sometimes seen as an assistant to the conductor in a train's operations. In passenger service, the brakeman (called trainman or assistant conductor) collects revenue, may operate door \\"through switches\\" for specific platforming needs, makes announcements, and operates trainline door open and close controls when required to assist the conductor. A passenger service trainman is often required to qualify as a conductor after 1 to 2 years experience. The rear end trainman signals to the conductor when all the train's doors are safely closed, then boards and closes his/her door. ===Scenic railways=== Scenic railways, particularly in the form of side friction roller coasters, require a brakeman to ride with the train around the track to slow it down at certain points on the layout, particularly bends; as the trains are not mechanically held onto the track. The brakeman is responsible for slowing the train down when necessary and stopping it in the station at the end of the ride. There are only a few examples of such rides now left in existence; the Scenic Railway at Luna Park, Melbourne, Australia, and the Roller Coaster at Great Yarmouth Pleasure Beach, UK, are two of the largest examples. == See also == * Jimmie Rodgers, also known as the \\"Singing Brakeman\\" == References == Category:Railway occupations pt:Guarda-freio ","title":"Brakeman"},{"id":"3263057","text":"Tok Tok Tok in 2012 Tok Tok Tok was a German acoustic soul band, active between 1998 and 2013. ==History== Before founding Tok Tok Tok in 1998, Tokunbo Akinro (lyrics) and Morten Klein (composition and arrangement), the creative and organizing heart of the band, worked together in various other projects.

CRS Report for Congress 97-936, 2001 Updated 2012 version: Halchin LE. (2012). Congressional Oversight. Congress exercises this power largely through its congressional committee system. Oversight also occurs in a wide variety of congressional activities and contexts. These include authorization, appropriations, investigative, and legislative hearings by standing committees; which is specialized investigations by select committees; and reviews and studies by congressional support agencies and staff. Congress’s oversight authority derives from its “implied” powers in the Constitution, public laws, and House and Senate rules. It is an integral part of the American system of checks and balances. ==Report on the Organization of Congress== Oversight is an implied rather than an enumerated power under the U.S. Constitution.Final Report of the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress - Congressional Oversight The government's charter does not explicitly grant Congress the authority to conduct inquiries or investigations of the executive, to have access to records or materials held by the executive, or to issue subpoenas for documents or testimony from the executive. There was little discussion of the power to oversee, review, or investigate executive activity at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 or later in The Federalist Papers, which argued in favor of ratification of the Constitution. The lack of debate was because oversight and its attendant authority were seen as an inherent power of representative assemblies which enacted public law. Oversight also derives from the many and varied express powers of the Congress in the Constitution. It is implied in the legislature's authority, among other powers and duties, to appropriate funds, enact laws, raise and support armies, provide for a Navy, declare war, and impeach and remove from office the President, Vice President, and other civil officers. Congress could not reasonably or responsibly exercise these powers without knowing what the executive was doing; how programs were being administered, by whom, and at what cost; and whether officials were obeying the law and complying with legislative intent. The Supreme Court of the United States has confirmed the oversight powers of Congress, subject to constitutional safeguards for civil liberties, on several occasions. In 1927, for instance, the Court found that in investigating the administration of the Justice Department, Congress had the authority to consider a subject \\"on which legislation could be had or would be materially aided by the information which the investigation was calculated to elicit\\". ==Congressional control of agencies== If Congress believes that an agency has drifted from its original mandate, Congress can respond in a number of ways. Congress can pass a law to overrule agency decisions, or to narrow the agency's jurisdiction. Congress can use its appropriations power to restrict the agency's funding. Congress can also narrow the agency's regulatory authority. For example, in the 1980s Congress narrowed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's regulatory discretion using detailed substantive criteria to limit EPA rulemaking.Congress, The Supreme Court, and the quiet revolution in administrative law. 1988 Duke Law Journal 819. ==Principles== Underlying the legislature's ability to oversee the executive are democratic principles as well as practical purposes. John Stuart Mill, the British Utilitarian philosopher, insisted that oversight was the key feature of a meaningful representative body: “The proper office of a representative assembly is to watch and control the government”.John Stuart Mill, Considerations on Representative Government (London: Parker, Son, and Bourn, 1861), p. 104. As a young scholar, Woodrow Wilson equated oversight with lawmaking, which was usually seen as the supreme function of a legislature. He wrote, “Quite as important as legislation is vigilant oversight of administration”.Woodrow Wilson, Congressional Government (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1885), p. 297. The philosophical underpinning for oversight is the Constitution’s system of checks and balances among the legislature, executive, and judiciary. James Madison, known as the “Father of the Constitution”, described the system in Federalist No. 51 as establishing “subordinate distributions of power, where the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner that each may be a check on the other”. ==Purposes== Oversight, as an outgrowth of this principle, ideally serves a number of overlapping objectives and purposes: *improve the efficiency, economy, and effectiveness of governmental operations *evaluate programs and performance *detect and prevent poor administration, waste, abuse, arbitrary and capricious behavior, or illegal and unconstitutional conduct *protect civil liberties and constitutional rights *inform the general public and ensure that executive policies reflect the public interest *gather information to develop new legislative proposals or to amend existing statutes *ensure administrative compliance with legislative intent *prevent executive encroachment on legislative authority and prerogatives In sum, oversight is a way for Congress to check on, and check, the executive directors ==Powers and prerogatives== ===U.S. Constitution=== Although the U.S. Constitution grants no formal, express authority to oversee or investigate the executive or program administration, oversight is implied in Congress’s array of enumerated powers.Article I, Sec. 8 and Article II, Secs. 2 and 4. The legislature is authorized to appropriate funds; raise and support armies; provide for and maintain a navy; declare war; provide for organizing and calling forth the Militia; regulate interstate and foreign commerce; establish post offices and post roads; advise and consent on treaties and presidential nominations (Senate); and impeach (House) and try (Senate) the President, Vice President, and civil officers for treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. Reinforcing these powers is Congress’s broad authority “to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof”. The authority to oversee derives from these constitutional powers. Congress could not carry them out reasonably or responsibly without knowing what the executive is doing; how programs are being administered, by whom, and at what cost; and whether officials are obeying the law and complying with legislative intent. The Supreme Court has legitimated Congress’s investigative power, subject to constitutional safeguards for civil liberties. In 1927, the Court found that, in investigating the administration of the Department of Justice, Congress was considering a subject “on which legislation could be had or would be materially aided by the information which the investigation was calculated to elicit”.McGrain v. Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135, 177 (1927); see also Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178, 187 (1957), and Barenblatt v. United States, 360 U.S. 109, 111 (1959). ===Statutes=== The “necessary and proper” clause of the Constitution also allows Congress to enact laws that mandate oversight by its committees, grant relevant authority to itself and its support agencies, and impose specific obligations on the executive to report to or consult with Congress, and even seek its approval for specific actions. Broad oversight mandates exist for the legislature in several significant statutes. *The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 (P.L. 79-601), for the first time, explicitly called for “legislative oversight” in public law. It directed House and Senate standing committees “to exercise continuous watchfulness” over programs and agencies under their jurisdiction; authorized professional staff for them; and enhanced the powers of the Comptroller General, the head of Congress’s investigative and audit arm, the Government Accountability Office (GAO). *The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 (P.L. 91-510) authorized each standing committee to “review and study, on a continuing basis, the application, administration and execution” of laws under its jurisdiction; increased the professional staff of committees; expanded the assistance provided by the Congressional Research Service; and strengthened the program evaluation responsibilities of GAO. *The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-344) allowed committees to conduct program evaluation themselves or contract out for it; strengthened GAO’s role in acquiring fiscal, budgetary, and program-related information; and upgraded GAO’s review capabilities. Besides these general powers, numerous statutes direct the executive to furnish information to or consult with Congress. For example, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-62) requires agencies to consult with Congress on their strategic plans and report annually on performance plans, goals, and results. In fact, more than 2,000 reports are submitted each year to Congress by federal departments, agencies, commissions, bureaus, and offices. Inspectors General (IGs), for instance, report their findings about waste, fraud, and abuse, and their recommendations for corrective action, periodically to the agency head and Congress. The IGs are also instructed to issue special reports concerning particularly serious problems immediately to the agency head, who transmits them unaltered to Congress within seven days. The Reports Consolidation Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-531), moreover, instructs the IGs to identify and describe their agencies’ most serious management and performance challenges and briefly assess progress in addressing them. This new requirement is to be part of a larger effort by individual agencies to consolidate their numerous reports on financial and performance management matters into a single annual report. The aim is to enhance coordination and efficiency within the agencies; improve the quality of relevant information; and provide it in a more meaningful and useful format for Congress, the President, and the public. In addition, Congress creates commissions and establishes task forces to study and make recommendations for select policy areas that can also involve examination of executive operations and organizations. There is a long history behind executive reports to Congress. Indeed, one of the first laws of the First Congress—the 1789 Act to establish the Treasury Department (1 Stat. 66)—called upon the Secretary and the Treasurer to report directly to Congress on public expenditures and all accounts. The Secretary was also required “to make report, and give information to either branch of the legislature...respecting all matters referred to him by the Senate or House of Representatives, or which shall appertain to his office.” Separate from such reporting obligations, public employees may provide information to Congress on their own. In the early part of the 20th century, Congress enacted legislation to overturn a “gag” rule, issued by the President, that prohibited employees from communicating directly with Congress (5 U.S.C. 7211 (1994)). Other “whistleblower” statutes, which have been extended specifically to cover personnel in the intelligence community (P.L. 105-272), guarantee the right of government employees to petition or furnish information to Congress or a Member. House and Senate Rules Chamber rules also reinforce the oversight function. House and Senate rules, for instance, provide for “special oversight” or “comprehensive policy oversight”, respectively, for specified committees over matters that relate to their authorizing jurisdiction. In addition, House rules direct each standing committee to require its subcommittees to conduct oversight or to establish an oversight subcommittee for this purpose. House rules also call for each committee to submit an oversight agenda, listing its prospective oversight topics for the ensuing Congress, to the House Committee on Government Reform, which compiles and prints the agendas. The House Government Reform Committee and the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which have oversight jurisdiction over virtually the entire federal government, furthermore, are authorized to review and study the operation of government activities to determine their economy and efficiency and to submit recommendations based on GAO reports. In addition, House rules require that the findings and recommendations from the Government Reform Committee be considered by authorizing panels, if presented to them in a timely fashion. ==Activities and avenues== Oversight occurs through a wide variety of congressional activities and avenues. Some of the most publicized are the comparatively rare investigations by select committees into major scandals or into executive branch operations gone awry. Cases in point are temporary select committee inquiries into: China’s acquisition of U.S. nuclear weapons information, in 1999; the Iran-Contra affair, in 1987; intelligence agency abuses, in 1975–1976, and the Watergate scandal in 1973–1974. The precedent for this kind of oversight goes back two centuries: in 1792, a special House committee investigated the defeat of an Army force by confederated Indian tribes. By comparison to these select panel investigations, other congressional inquiries in recent Congresses—into the Whitewater controversy, access to Federal Bureau of Investigation files, White House Travel Office firings, and campaign financing—have relied upon standing committees. The impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton in 1998 in the House and in 1999 in the Senate also generated considerable oversight. The oversight not only encompassed the President and the White House staff, but also extended to the office of independent counsel, specifically its authority, jurisdiction, and expenditures. Although such highly visible endeavors are significant, they usually reflect only a small portion of Congress’s total oversight effort. More routine and regular review, monitoring, and supervision occur in other congressional activities and contexts. Especially important are appropriations hearings on agency budgets as well as authorization hearings for existing programs. Separately, examinations of executive operations and the implementation of programs—by congressional staff, support agencies, and specially created commissions and task forces—provide additional oversight. Another avenue of oversight is a resolution of inquiry, which is a simple resolution making a direct request or demand of the President or the head of an executive department to furnish the House of Representatives with specific factual information in the Administration’s possession. ==Congressional Oversight Training== The CRS and the Project On Government Oversight, an independent nonprofit watchdog, train Congressional staff how to conduct effective oversight. ==See also== * Government Accountability Office (GAO) - assists Congressional oversight by monitoring the executive branch and reporting to Congress. * Congressional oversight hearings ==References== * Much of the content in this article was excerpted from CRS Report for Congress 97-936, 2001. ==External links== * CRS Congressional Oversight Manual (PDF) * CRS Report for Congress 97-936, 2001 (PDF) **Updated January 3, 2006 * Final Report of the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress, 1993 **Congressional Oversight * The General Principles of Congressional Oversight, House Committee on Rules * Project On Government Oversight Congressional Oversight Training Series Oversight ","title":"Congressional oversight"},{"id":"3263070","text":"Speak Love is a 1983 studio album by the American jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald, accompanied by the jazz guitarist Joe Pass.

He is a descendant of the Noongar people of Western Australia. == Biography == Scott was born in Perth in 1957 and is the eldest of four siblings with a white mother and an Aboriginal father. Scott has written five novels and a children's book, and has had poetry and short stories published in a range of anthologies. He began writing shortly after becoming a secondary school teacher of English. His teaching experience included working in urban, rural Australia and in Portugal. He spent some time teaching at an Aboriginal community in the north of Western Australia, where he started to research his family's history. His first novel, True Country, was published in 1993 with an edition published in a French translation in 2005. His second novel, Benang, won the Western Australian Premier's Book Awards 1999, the Miles Franklin Award 2000, and the Kate Challis RAKA Award 2001. Both novels were influenced by his research and seemed to be semi- autobiographical. The themes of these novels have been said to \\"explore the problem of self-identity faced by light-skinned Aboriginal people and examine the government's assimilationist policies during the first decades of the twentieth century\\". Scott was the first indigenous writer to win the Miles Franklin Award for Benang, which has since been published in translation in France and the Netherlands. His book, Kayang and Me, was written in collaboration with Noongar elder Hazel Brown, his aunt, and was published in May 2005. The work is a monumental oral-based history of the author's family, the south coast Noongar people of Western Australia. His 2010 novel That Deadman Dance (Picador) explores the lively fascination felt between Noongar, British colonists and American whalers in the early years of the 19th century. On 21 June 2011, it was announced that Scott had won the 2011 Miles Franklin Award for this novel. Scott also won the 2011 Victorian Premier's Prize for the same novel. Scott was appointed Professor of Writing in the School of Media, Culture and Creative Arts of Curtin University in December, 2011. He is a member of The Centre for Culture and Technology (CCAT), leading its Indigenous Culture and Digital Technologies research program. Scott lives in Coolbellup, a southern suburb of Fremantle, Western Australia, with his wife and two children. ==Awards== * 1999 – Western Australian Premier's Book Awards, Fiction Award for Benang: From the Heart * 2000 – (joint winner) Miles Franklin Literary Award for Benang: From the Heart * 2001 – The Kate Challis RAKA Award for Creative Prose for Benang: From the Heart * 2011 – Commonwealth Writers' Prize, Best Book south-east Asia and the Pacific, for That Deadman Dance * 2011 – Miles Franklin Literary Award for That Deadman Dance * 2011 – ALS Gold Medal for That Deadman Dance * 2011 – Western Australian Premier's Book Awards, Fiction Award and Premier's Prize for That Deadman Dance * 2018 – Queensland Literary Awards, University of Queensland Fiction Book Award for Taboo * 2019 – Prize for Indigenous Writing, Victorian Premier's Literary Awards, for Taboo *2019 – shortlisted for 2019 Adelaide Festival Awards for Literature, Fiction, for Taboo *2020 – inducted into Western Australian Writers Hall of Fame ==Bibliography== ===Novels=== * True Country (Fremantle Arts Centre Press, 1993) * Benang: From the Heart (Fremantle Arts Centre Press, 1999) * Lost (Southern Forest Arts, 2006) * That Deadman Dance (Picador, 2010) * Taboo (Picador Australia, 2017) ===Short stories=== * \\"An Intimate Act\\" in Summer Shorts by Peter Holland (Fremantle Press, 1993) * \\"Registering Romance\\" in Summer Shorts 3 : Stories – Poems – Articles – Images by Bill Warnock, et al., (Fremantle Press, 1995) * \\"Into the Light (after Hans Heysen's painting of the same name)\\" in Those Who Remain Will Always Remember : An Anthology of Aboriginal Writing by Anne Brewster, et al., (Fremantle Press, 2000) * \\"Damaged but Persistent\\" in Siglo no.12 Summer (2000) * \\"Capture\\", in Southerly (pp. 24–33), vol.62 no.2 (2002) * Escapeó Éll Ćhapo === Children's picture book === * The Dredgersaurus (Sandcastle demoliter Books, 2001) ===Non-fiction=== * Kayang and Me with Hazel Brown (Fremantle Arts Press, 2005) == Notes == == External links == * Biography of Kim Scott and the review of his Benang book * another review of the Benang book * Australian Government – The Arts (Retrieved (31 March 2008) * Lisa Slater 'Kim Scott's Benang: An Ethics of Uncertainty' JASAL 4 (2005) Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Indigenous Australian writers Category:Miles Franklin Award winners Category:ALS Gold Medal winners Category:Writers from Perth, Western Australia Category:20th-century Australian novelists Category:21st-century Australian novelists Category:Curtin University faculty Category:Noongar people Category:Australian male novelists ","title":"Kim Scott"},{"id":"3263095","text":"Ahmad Khani, also spelled Ahmad-i Khani (; 1650, Hakkari – 1707, Doğubayazıt), was a Kurdish writer, poet, astronomer and philosopher.

It is a name of Hindu / Indian origin, and is commonly used for females. It also means long tuft, or lock of hair, left on top or on the back of the shaven head of a male Hindu. Though traditionally all Hindus were required to wear a śikhā, today it is seen mainly among Brahmins and temple priests. In West Bengal it is called Tiki. ==Procedure== Traditionally, Hindu men shave off all their hair as a child in a samskāra or ritual known as the chudakarama. A lock of hair is left at the crown (sahasrara).Daily Life In Ancient India, Jeannine Auboyer, , P. 164-5 Unlike most other eastern cultures (including ancient Egypt) where a coming- of-age ceremony removed childhood locks of hair similar to the śikhā (e.g. a forelock or pigtails in China, a topknot in Thailand, a sidelock in Egypt etc.) in India this prepubescent hairstyle is left to grow throughout the man's life, though usually only the most orthodox religious men will continue this hairstyle. The śikhā is tied back or knotted to perform religious rites. Only funerals and death anniversaries are performed with the śikhā untied or with dishevelled hair. Dishevelled hair is considered inauspicious, and represents times of great sorrow or calamity. In Hindu scripture, Draupadi took an oath in the assembly of the Kurus after she was molested by Dushasana that she would remain with dishevelled hair until the enemies were properly revenged. Similarly, Chanakya is said to have taken an oath to leave his śikhā untied until he humbles the Nanda kings who insulted him. ==Tamil Nadu and Kerala== The Tamil word for śikhā is kudumiConverting women: gender and Protestant Christianity in colonial South India, Eliza F. Kent, Page 227 and traditionally it is represented in two styles. The most common kudumi (called Pin Kudumi) is identical to the śikhā, with a knotted lock of hair on the crown of the head and the rest of the hair shaved off. Mun-Kudumi is a style where the hair is grown long in the front and knotted to the forehead. This hairstyle was popular among some Brahmin groups of South India, such as the Chozhiya, Dikshitar, and the Namboothiris of Kerala. The prominent communities in Kerala including the Nairs and temple servants (Ambalavasi), though not Brahmins, also sported this style. The technique used to tie the hair into a Kudumi is as follows: The lengthy hair can be tied with the help of left thumb and index fingers. You roll up the lock of hair over the left thumb and index fingers put together by your right hand till you reach the tail end. Then hold the tail end of hair by the left thumb and index fingers and pull out the fingers with the tail end of the hair. You get the knot. After some little practice you will get a tight and neat knot. ==Maharashtra== The Marathi word for śikhā is shendi. ==Hinduism== The śikhā reportedly signifies one-pointed (ekanta) focus on a spiritual goal, and devotion to God. It is also an indication of cleanliness, as well as personal sacrifice to God. According to Smriti Shastras, it is mandatory for all Hindus to keep śikhāBhāgavata Purāṇa 6.8.8 and the first three twice-born or dvija castes (brahmins, kshatriyas and vaishyas) to wear yajnopavita (sacred thread), also called janeu, punool, or paita.Bhāgavata Purāṇa 6.19.7 It has been said that the śikhā allows God to pull one to heaven, or at least from this material world of maya (illusion). In his autobiography, Mohandas K. Gandhi writes about his encounter with an orthodox Hindu: The śikhā was one of the few symbols of Hindus that transcended caste, language or regional barriers. Although there were variations of the style of sikha amongst communities, it was obligatory for all males. ==Similar hairstyles== Hindus have a common belief that the śikhā \\"allows God to easily pull one to his abode\\". While the śikhā has been known to exist in India for from as far back as Chanakya, some scholars have argued that this be an Islamic, or at least an Arabian superstition, as the following passages may illustrate: Sir Thomas Herbert, 1st Baronet (1606–1682) described a similar hairstyle worn by Persians in his book Travels in Persia: In \\"Passages of Eastern Travel\\", Harper's Magazine, 1856, p. 197, an American traveller wrote: Riffian (Berber) men of Morocco had the custom of shaving the head but leaving a single lock of hair on either the crown, left, or right side of the head, so that the angel Azrael is able \\"...to pull them up to heaven on the Last Day.\\"El Maghreg: 1200 Miles' Ride Through Morocco, Hugh Edward Millington Stutfield High-born Chamorri men of the indigenous Chamorro people of the Mariana Islands also wore a hairstyle similar to the śikhā.Ancient Chamorro society, Lawrence J. Cunningham, (see statues of Chief Gadao or Chief Quipuha in Chief Quipuha Park, Paseo de Susana peninsula, Agana, Guam.) Later, particularly on the island of Guam, this śikhā-like top- knot hairstyle became somewhat of a political statement for young men:Shifting images of identity in the Pacific, Toon van Meijl, Jelle Miedema, Another śikhā-like hairstyle existed in eastern Europe. Sviatoslav I of Kiev reportedly wore a scalplock, similar to the śikhā, to signify his 'noble birth'.Ian Heath \\"The Vikings (Elite 3)\\", Osprey Publishing 1985; , p.60David Nicolle \\"Armies of Medieval Russia 750–1250 (Men-at-Arms 333)\\" Osprey Publishing 1999; , p.44 The oseledets, or khokhol hairstyle of the Ukrainian Cossacks, or Zaporozhians, was quite similar to the śikhā,Vernadsky 276–277. although it may sometimes have been situated not at the crown, but towards the front of the head. Indeed, another Ukrainian word for this particular hairstyle is чуприна, chupryna meaning 'forelock'.Ukrainian minstrels: and the blind shall sing, Natalie O. Kononenko, page 308 According to legend, Zaporozhians would grow their scalplocks to provide \\"...a handle by which the enemy could carry a Cossack's head, should he succeed in severing it.\\" A stone head discovered at the Neolithic site of Nevalı Çori in Anatolia features what some have interpreted as an early example of a śikhā, perhaps the mark of a priest or shaman. The scalplock of many Native American tribes (particularly of the eastern woodlands, such as the Huron) is very similar in appearance to the śikhā,A Pictorial History of The American Indian, Oliver La Farge, although like the Cossack oseledets, a much different meaning was applied to this hairstyle compared to the Hindu śikhā. The śikhā may also be referred to as 'choti', 'kudumi' or 'chuda'. It should not be confused with the rattail (haircut) nor the mullet hairstyle, both popularized in the 1980s in the West. In Hinduism though, the Sikha has been worn by the temple priests of Jagannath Puri and Tirumala Balaji temples for 2000 years and therefore predate Islam. It is more believable that this belief of the sikha was taken from India along the silk road by Mohammedan followers. Muslims now do not wear a sikha but a Mohammedan beard instead. ==Gallery== Image:Chaitanya_sankirtan.jpgSri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu performing a 'kirtan', a devotional song, in the streets of Nabadwip, Bengal.

Electronic CRM concerns all forms of managing relationships with customers through the use of information technology (IT). eCRM processes include data collection, data aggregation, and customer interaction. Compared to traditional CRM, the integrated information for eCRM intraorganizational collaboration can be more efficient to communicate with customers.Reponen, Tapio(2003) Information Technology-Enabled Global Customer Service, p288 ==From RM to CRM== The concept of relationship marketing (RM) was established by marketing professor Leonard Berry in 1983. He considered it to consist of attracting, maintaining and enhancing customer relationships within organizations. In the years that followed, companies were engaging more and more in a meaningful dialogue with individual customers. In doing so, new organizational forms as well as technologies were used, eventually resulting in what we know as customer relationship management. The main difference between CRM and e-CRM is that the first does not acknowledge the use of technology, where the latter uses information technology (IT) in implementing RM strategies.L. Ryals and A. Payne, \\"Customer relationship management in financial services: towards information-enabled relationship marketing,\\" Journal of Strategic Marketing vol. 9 no. 1 (2001): 3-27. ==The essence of CRM== The exact meaning of CRM is still subject of heavy discussions.T. Coltman, \\"Why build a customer relationship management capability?\\" Journal of Strategic Information Systems 16 (2007): 302. However, the overall goal can be seen as effectively managing differentiated relationships with all customers and communicating with them on an individual basis.C-H Park and Y-G Kim, \\"A framework for dynamic CRM: linking marketing with information strategy.\\" Business Process Management Journal vol. 9 no. 5 (2003): 652-671. Underlying thought is that companies realize that they can supercharge profits by acknowledging that different groups of customers vary widely in their behavior, desires, and responsiveness to marketing.Valerie A. Zeithaml et al. \\"The Customer Pyramid: creating and serving profitable customers,\\" California Management Review vol. 43 no. 4. (2001): 118. Loyal customers can not only give operational companies sustained revenue but also advertise for new marketers. To reinforce the reliance of customers and create additional customer sources, firms utilize CRM to maintain the relationship as the general two categories B2B (business-to-business) and B2C (business-to- customer or business-to-consumer). Because of the needs and behaviors are different between B2B and B2C, the implementation of CRM should come from respective viewpoints.Clarke III, Irvine and Theresa B. Flaherty (eds) (2005), Advances in Electronic Marketing, p.336. ==Differences from CRM == Major differences between CRM and eCRM:Chandra, Satish, & Ted J.

ECRM is being adopted by companies because it increases customer loyalty and customer retention by improving customer satisfaction, one of the objectives of eCRM. E-loyalty results in long-term profits for online retailers because they incur less costs of recruiting new customers, plus they have an increase in customer retention. Together with the creation of sales force automation (SFA), where electronic methods were used to gather data and analyze customer information, the trend of the upcoming Internet can be seen as the foundation of what we know as eCRM today. (Nenad Jukic et al., 2003) As we implement eCRM process, there are three steps life cycle:Shin, Namchul, (2005), Strategies for Generating E-Business Returns on Investment, p. 354. # Data collection: About customers preference information for actively (answer knowledge) and passively (surfing record) ways via website, email, questionnaire. # Data aggregation: Filter and analysis for firm's specific needs to fulfill their customers. # Customer interaction: According to customer's need, company provide the proper feedback to them. eCRM can be defined as activities to manage customer relationships by using the Internet, web browsers or other electronic touch points. The challenge hereby is to offer communication and information on the right topic, in the right amount, and at the right time that fits the customer's specific needs.Nenad Jukic et al., \\"Implementing Polyinstantiation as a Strategy for Electronic Commerce Customer Relationship Management,\\" International Journal of Electronic Commerce vol. 7 no. 2 (2002-3): 10. === Strategy components === When enterprises integrate their customer information, there are three eCRM strategy components:\\"Reponen, Tapio(2003) Information Technology-Enabled Global Customer Service, p288\\" # Operational: Because of sharing information, the processes in business should make customer's need as first and seamlessly implement. This avoids multiple times to bother customers and redundant process. # Analytical: Analysis helps company maintain a long-term relationship with customers. # Collaborative: Due to improved communication technology, different departments in company implement (intraorganizational) or work with business partners (interorganizational) more efficiently by sharing information. (Nenad Jukic et al., 2003) === Implementing and integrating === ====Non-electronic solution==== Several CRM software packages exist that can help companies in deploying CRM activities. Besides choosing one of these packages, companies can also choose to design and build their own solutions. In order to implement CRM in an effective way, one needs to consider the following factors: * Create a customer-focused culture in the organization. * Adopt customer-based managers to assess satisfaction. * Develop an end-to-end process to serve customers. * Recommend questions to be asked to help a customer solve a problem. * Track all aspects of selling to customers, as well as prospects.Turban et al., Information Technology for Management: Transforming Organizations in the Digital Economy, 6th ed. ( John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2008), 335. Furthermore, CRM solutions are more effective once they are being implemented in other information systems used by the company. Examples are transaction processing system (TPS) to process data real-time, which can then be sent to the sales and finance departments in order to recalculate inventory and financial position quick and accurately. Once this information is transferred back to the CRM software and services it could prevent customers from placing an order in the belief that an item is in stock while it is not. ====Cloud solution==== Today, more and more enterprise CRM systems move to cloud computing solution, \\"up from 8 percent of the CRM market in 2005 to 20 percent of the market in 2008, according to Gartner\\".Bennett, Tricia (2010, Jan 12). Cloud CRM: Ready, Steady, Roll It Out.

In cloud based CRM system, transaction can be recorded via CRM database immediately.Raynore, Hasan: A Layperson’s Guide to CRM and Cloud Computing. Some enterprise CRM in cloud systems are web-based customers don't need to install an additional interface and the activities with businesses can be updated real-time. People may communicate on mobile devices to get the efficient services. Furthermore, customer/case experience and the interaction feedbacks are another way of CRM collaboration and integration information in corporate organization to improve businesses’ services. There are multifarious cloud CRM services for enterprise to use and here are some hints to the your right CRMsystem:Martin, James A. (2010, Apr 13). Put Cloud CRM to Work. Retrieved from https://www.pcworld.com/article/193463-2/put_cloud_crm_to_work.html #Assess your company's needs: some of enterprise CRM systems are featured #Take advantage of free trials: comparison and familiarization each of the optional. #Do the math: estimate the customer strategy for company budget. #Consider mobile options: some system like Salesforce.com can be combined with other mobile device application. #Ask about security: consider whether the cloud CRM solution provides as much protection as your own system. #Make sure the sales team is on board: as the frontline of enterprise, the launched CRM system should be the help for sales. #Know your exit strategy: understand the exit mechanism to keep flexibility. === vCRM === Channels through which companies can communicate with its customers, are growing by the day, and as a result, their time and attention has turned into a major challenge.Sinisalo, 773. One of the reasons eCRM is so popular nowadays is that digital channels can create unique and positive experiences – not just transactions – for customers.Y. Wind et al. Convergence Marketing: Strategies for Reading the New Hybrid Consumer (Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, 2002). An extreme, but ever growing in popularity, example of the creation of experiences in order to establish customer service is the use of Virtual Worlds, such as Second Life. Through this so-called vCRM, companies are able to create synergies between virtual and physical channels and reaching a very wide consumer base. However, given the newness of the technology, most companies are still struggling to identify effective entries in Virtual Worlds.Lakshmi Goel and Elham Mousavidin, \\"vCRM: Virtual Customer Relationship Management,\\" Database for Advances in Information Systems vol. 38 no. 4 (2007): 56-58. Its highly interactive character, which allows companies to respond directly to any customer's requests or problems, is another feature of eCRM that helps companies establish and sustain long-term customer relationships.Russel S. Winer, \\"A Framework for Customer Relationship Management,\\" California Management Review vol. 43 no. 4 (2001): 89. Furthermore, Information Technology has helped companies to even further differentiate between customers and address a personal message or service. Some examples of tools used in eCRM: * Personalized Web Pages where customers are recognized and their preferences are shown. * Customized products or services. CRM programs should be directed towards customer value that competitors cannot match.Coltman, 302. However, in a world where almost every company is connected to the Internet, eCRM has become a requirement for survival, not just a competitive advantage.Turban et al., Information Technology for Management: Transforming Organizations in the Digital Economy, 6th ed. ( John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2008), 332. ==Different levels== In defining the scope of eCRM, three different levels can be distinguished: * Foundational services: This includes the minimum necessary services such as web site effectiveness and responsiveness as well as order fulfillment. * Customer-centered services: These services include order tracking, product configuration and customization as well as security/trust. * Value-added services: These are extra services such as online auctions and online training and education.Turban et al., Information Technology for Management: Transforming Organizations in the Digital Economy, 6th ed. (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2008), 332. Self-services are becoming increasingly important in CRM activities. The rise of the Internet and eCRM has boosted the options for self-service activities. A critical success factor is the integration of such activities into traditional channels. An example was Ford's plan to sell cars directly to customers via its Web Site, which provoked an outcry among its dealers network.Harald Salomann et al., \\"Self- Services in Customer Relationships: Balancing High-Tech and High-Touch Today and Tomorrow,\\" e-Service Journal (2006): 66-74. CRM activities are mainly of two different types. Reactive service is where the customer has a problem and contacts the company. Proactive service is where the manager has decided not to wait for the customer to contact the firm, but to be aggressive and contact the customer himself in order to establish a dialogue and solve problems.Winer, 99. ;Steps to eCRM Success Many factors play a part in ensuring that the implementation any level of eCRM is successful. One obvious way it could be measured is by the ability for the system to add value to the existing business. There are four suggested implementation steps that affect the viability of a project like this: # Developing customer-centric strategies # Redesigning workflow management systems # Re-engineering work processes # Supporting with the right technologiesShin, Namchul. Strategies for Generating E-Business Returns on Investment. IGI Global. © 2005. Books24x7. ==Mobile CRM== One subset of Electronic CRM is Mobile CRM (mCRM). This is defined as \\"services that aim at nurturing customer relationships, acquiring or maintaining customers, support marketing, sales or services processes, and use wireless networks as the medium of delivery to the customers.Camponovo et al., \\"Mobile customer relationship management: an explorative investigation of the Italian consumer market,\\" Proceedings of 4th International Conference on Mobile Business 11-13 july, Sydney (2005). However, since communications is the central aspect of customer relations activities, many opt for the following definition of mCRM: \\"communication, either one-way or interactive, which is related to sales, marketing and customer service activities conducted through mobile medium for the purpose of building and maintaining customer relationships between a company and its customer(s).Sinisalo, 774. eCRM allows customers to access company services from more and more places, since the Internet access points are increasing by the day. mCRM however, takes this one step further and allows customers or managers to access the systems for instance from a mobile phone or PDA with internet access, resulting in high flexibility. Since mCRM is not able to provide a complete range of customer relationship activities it should be integrated in the complete CRM system.Geysken et al., \\"The market valuation of internet channel addition,\\" Journal of Marketing vol. 66 (2002): 102-119. There are three main reasons that mobile CRM is becoming so popular. The first is that the devices consumer use are improving in multiple ways that allow for this advancement. Displays are larger and clearer and access times on networks are improving overall. Secondly, the users are also becoming more sophisticated. The technology to them is nothing new so it is easy to adapt. Lastly, the software being developed for these applications has become worthwhile and useful to end users.Dickie, Jim (2009 Jul).CRM in the Palm of Your Hand. Retrieved from: http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Columns-Departments/Reality-Check/CRM- in-the-Palm-of-Your-Hand-55099.aspx There are four basic steps that a company should follow to implement a mobile CRM system. By following these and also keeping the IT department, the end users and management in agreement, the outcome can be beneficial for all. Step 1 – Needs analysis phase: This is the point to take your times and understand all the technical needs and desires for each of the users and stakeholders. It also has to be kept in mind that the mobile CRM system must be able to grow and change with the business. Step 2 – Mobile design phase: This is the next critical phase that will show all the technical concerns that need to be addressed. A few main things to consider are screen size, device storage and security. Step 3 – Mobile application testing phase: This step is mostly to ensure that the users and stakeholders all approve of the new system. Step 4 – Rollout phase: This is when the new system is implemented but also when training on the final product is done with all users. ;Advantages of mobile CRM: # The mobile channel creates a more personal direct connection with customers. # It is continuously active and allows necessary individuals to take action quickly using the information. # Typically it is an opt-in only channel which allows for high and quality responsiveness. # Overall it supports loyalty between the customer and company, which improves and strengthens relationships.http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Web- Exclusives/Viewpoints/CRM-Customer-Relationship-Mobile---60572.aspx ==Failures== Designing, creating and implementing IT projects has always been risky. Not only because of the amount of money that is involved, but also because of the high chances of failure. However, a positive trend can be seen, indicating that CRM failures dropped from a failure rate of 80% in 1998, to about 40% in 2003.greycells.com Some of the major issues relating to CRM failure are the following: * Difficulty in measuring and valuing intangible benefits. * Failure to identify and focus on specific business problems. * Lack of active senior management sponsorship. * Poor user acceptance. * Trying to automate a poorly defined process.Turban et al., Information Technology for Management: Transforming Organizations in the Digital Economy, 6th ed. ( John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2008), 334. Failure rates in CRM from 2001-2009:http://www.zdnet.com/blog/projectfailures/crm-failure- rates-2001-2009/4967 * 2001- 50% failure rate according to the Gartner group * 2002- 70% failure rate according to Butler group * 2003- 69.3% according to Selling Power, CSO Forum * 2004- 18% according to AMR Research group * 2005- 31% according to AMR Research * 2006- 29% according to AMR Research * 2007- 56% according to Economist Intelligence Unit * 2009- 47% according to Forrester Research Differing measurement criteria and methods of the research groups make it difficult to compare these rates. Most of these rates were based on customer response pertaining to questions on the success of CRM implementations. ==Privacy== The effective and efficient employment of CRM activities cannot go without the remarks of safety and privacy. CRM systems depend on databases in which all kinds of customer data is stored. In general, the following rule applies: the more data, the better the service companies can deliver to individual customers. Some known examples of these problems are conducting credit-card transaction online of the phenomenon known as 'cookies' used on the Internet in order to track someone's information and behavior.Winer, 101. The design and the quality of the website are two very important aspects that influence the level of trust customers experience and their willingness or reluctance to conduct a transaction or leave personal information.Yujong Hwang and Dan J. Kim, \\"Customer self-service systems: The effect of perceived Web quality with service contents on enjoyment, anxiety, and e-trust,\\" Decision Support Systems 43 (2007): 746-748. Privacy policies can be ineffective in relaying to customers how much of their information is being used. In a recent study by The University of Pennsylvania and University of California, it was revealed that over half the respondents have an incorrect understanding of how their information is being used. They believe that, if a company has a privacy policy, they will not share the customer's information with third party companies without the customer's express consent. Therefore, if marketers want to use consumer information for advertising purposes, they must clearly illustrate the ways in which they will use the customer's information and present the benefits of this in order to acquire the customer's consent.Morais, Shanti A.

To accommodate the southward extension, the station was resited on 6 April 1868. This station was renamed Llanrwst and Trefriw in April 1884, reverting to its original name Llanrwst during the British Railways era, on 6 May 1974. The grade-II station buildings are largely intact, though mostly disused, and there is a working signal box north of the station at which trains must stop to exchange tokens. The extensive station yard is now used for light industry. The platforms heights here are low and wooden boarding steps were provided on both platforms for many years - Easy Access ramps have now been fitted to improve accessibility on each side.

Later on, the POW camp was converted into an army mountaineering and PT school until 1947–48, and a portion of it also remained the offices of the Royal Indian Army Service Corps (RIASC). It was this site, which was later chosen for the new post-independence Pakistan Military Academy, which is located in the eastern side of the valley. ==See also== * Death of Osama bin Laden ==References== Category:Union councils of Abbottabad District Category:Populated places in Abbottabad District Category:Populated places established in 1957 fr:Kakul ","title":"Kakol, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa"},{"id":"3263158","text":"350 St Kilda Road 350 St Kilda Road, currently known as St. James Apartments, is a 120 m high apartment building on St Kilda Road in Melbourne, Australia.

Thandiani is located in the northeast of Abbottabad District and is about from Abbottabad in the foothills of the Himalayas. To the east beyond the Kunhar River lies the snow-covered Pir Panjal mountain range of Kashmir. Visible to the north and northeast are the mountains of Kohistan and Kaghan. To the northwest are the snowy ranges of Swat and Chitral. The hills of Thandiani are about above sea level. Most of the people residing here belong to the Sadaat (Syed), Awan, Mughals, Qureshi, Abbasi, Jadoon Gujjar, and Karlal tribes. The nearest villages are Bandi Sarara Mara Rehmat Khan, Inderseri, Birnagalli, Chattri, Chamaili, Sialkot, Pattan, Okharela, Dheri, Darer and Kukmang. ==History== Thandiani was originally granted as a lease to some members of the Battye familySee 'Early Leases in the Hazara' in Major Wace's Full and Permanent Settlement Report of the Hazara District 1868-1874, Annex 1. pub. 1874, pp.379-380 in British India, who were Christian missionaries and also found in civil and military service, and who produced scions such as Wigram Battye and Quintin Battye.Of the Corps of Guides (British India)For a history of the members of this unique family, see Evelyn Desiree Battye, The Fighting Ten, London: British Association for Cemeteries in South Asia publications, 1984. It is also worth noting here that one of the Battye brothers, who died in a military campaign in the Black Mountain (Kala Dhaka) area in 1888, Major Leigh Richmond Battye, is buried in the Old Christian Cemetery, Abbottabad The Battyes subsequently gifted the location to the church authorities, where a sanatorium and various other facilities were set up during the British rule, mostly for the convenience of missionaries, Anglican church personnel and officers stationed at the neighbouring cantonment of Abbottabad. It also contained some private European houses, a camping ground, a small bazaar, and the small seasonal church of St. Xavier in the Wilderness which were occupied only during the summer months.Under the overall jurisdiction and management of St. Luke's Church, AbbottabadThandiani - Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 23, p. 304 ==Tourism== Thandiani in winter Thandiani is characterized by excellent weather and lush greenery in the summer months, and snow-covered vistas and hills in the winter. Many tourists from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and all over Pakistan visit here, especially in the summer season. Being at a high altitude, with attractive scenery and several hiking trails into the forests and other nearby locations, it is a very attractive prospect. A beautiful trek leads to Thandiani from Abbottabad that passes through Dagri naka.http://www.khyberpakhtunkhwa.gov.pk/Attraction/Galyat.php == Forests and Wildlife == The mountains around Thandiani are quite thickly forested compared to most other hill stations in the locality, which have suffered some degree of deforestation over time. The local wildlife includes leopards, monkeys, several kinds of pheasants and the increasingly rare flying squirrel and pine marten, to name only a few. == 2005 earthquake == The area and its surrounding villages were damaged by the 2005 Kashmir earthquake.

However, it was not completed until the 2000s.\\"Metric usage and metrication in other countries\\" . Colorado State University. Since the 1970s, metric units were introduced into the curriculum of the primary and secondary school systems. The Common Entrance and CXC examinations syllabus use metric units. The Ministry of Education also supports a policy of procuring metric-only textbooks for use in the school system. The informal sector involving vocational, adult literacy and retraining facilities were also being transformed. Large producers of staple foods such as flour, rice, salt, sugar, chicken and other meats, supply products in metric units. A main objective of the Bureau of Standards, a targeted area of work of its Metrication Department, is to have outlets supplying everyday breakbulk items trade in metric units. While not yet a majority, large and medium-sized wholesale and retail outlets, such as supermarkets and fabric stores, have converted islandwide, particularly in the capital Kingston and adjoining urban centres. On 10 June 2015, the Jamaican government passed the Road Traffic Bill 2014, which formally repealed and replaced the Road Traffic Act and Regulations 1938. The act included updates to Jamaica's traffic laws along with the use of the metric system within regulatory descriptions. On 18 September 2015, the Jamaican government amended the Weights and Measure Act to include considerable fines to business owners who do not use the metric system. ==See also== *Metrication == References == Category:Science and technology in Jamaica Jamaica ","title":"Metrication in Jamaica"},{"id":"3263173","text":"Sex report films (German: Report-Filme) were pseudo-documentaries that had sexual life as their subject matter. Effectively sexploitation films, the genre was particularly popular in the early 1970s Europe. ==Background== Mostly a German (or Germanophone) phenomenon, these films followed the wake of the Kinsey and Masters and Johnson type reports as well as maintaining elements from the German-speaking educational films (Aufklärungsfilme) tradition. Producers Erwin C. Dietrich (particularly in the late 1960s) and Wolf C. Hartwig were active in the genre: the latter produced the Schulmädchen-Report films, which may be considered a subgenre on their own. ==After Schulmädchen-Report== The success of the Schulmädchen-Report: Was Eltern nicht für möglich halten in 1970 triggered a range of new films that had titles ending with the word -Report per norm, which ostensibly focused on certain populations and gradually lost their pseudo-documentary tone. Hausfrauen-Report (1971), Ehemänner-Report (1971), Lehrmädchen-Report (1972), Krankenschwestern-Report (1972), Teenager-Report (1973) were among the most distinguished specimens of the genre, where Ernst Hofbauer was exalted as a pioneering director. ==References== * * Category:Sexploitation films Category:German-language films Category:Film genres ","title":"Sex report film"},{"id":"3263176","text":"Diameter Credit-Control Application, is a networking protocol for Diameter application used to implement real-time credit-control for a variety of end user services. It is an IETF standard first defined in RFC 4006, and updated in RFC 8506. == Purpose == The purpose of the diameter credit control application is to provide a framework for real-time charging, primarily meant for the communication between gateways/control-points and the back-end account/balance systems (typically an Online Charging System). The application specifies methods for: * Quota management (Reserve, Reauthorize, Abandon) * Simple Debit/Credit * Balance checks * Price inquiries The diameter credit control application does not specify which type units are bought/used and which items are charged. This is left to the service context that has to be specified separately, as is some of the semantics. Examples of units used/bought: * Time * Upload/Download bytes * SMS (Text Messages) Examples of items charged: * Money * Points * Units (e.g. if the balance is kept in the same units as what is being used) Diameter credit control also specifies how to handle the fairly complex issue of multiple unit types used/charged against a single user balance. For instance, a user may pay for both online time and download bytes but has only a single account balance. ===Session-based charging=== A session-based credit control process uses several interrogations which may include first, intermediate and last interrogation. During interrogation money is reserved from the user account. Session-based charging is typically used for scenarios where the charged units are continuously consumed, e.g. charging for bytes upload/download. ===Event-based charging=== An event-based credit control process uses events as charging mechanism. Event-based charging is typically used when units are not continuously consumed, e.g. a user sending an MMS. == Command Codes == In order to support Credit Control via Diameter, there are two Diameter messages, the CCR (Credit Control Request) and the CCA (Credit Control Answer). Command Code for CCR/CCA is 272, as defined in RFC 4006 For quota management the client sends CCR to the server requesting units and reporting consumption. The server grants units and charges the user. For simple debit/credit the client sends a CCR asking the server to credit/debit the user's account. For price inquiries the client ask the server what the price for a unit is, and the server responds with the price. == Message flows == The message flows are in general driven by the control-point asking for units and the server granting them. The message may also be generated by other diameter applications, such as NASREQ (RFC4005) for sessions that are time/usage-limited. The following diagram shows a simplified message flow for a session using quota grants. right The client starts by requesting 10 units from the server. The server verifies that the user/subscriber has enough balance for it. In this example the server grants the client all the units it requested. if the subscriber had insufficient balance it could have granted less units or rejected it completely. When or before the subscriber session has used the granted units the client sends an update to the server telling it how many units have been used and how many it would like granted this time. The client is allowed to request units before the previous grant is completely used, in order to avoid suspending the subscriber session while talking to the server. In this example the client sends the request when 7 units of the 10 previously granted units have been used; and ask for 10 more units, which the server grants. The server can use the used-units count for debiting the subscriber balance (granting units does not indicate that they will be used. The Used-Units AVP contains the actual usage). It is also possible for the server to tell the client how long the grant is valid, in which case the client is expected to send an update when the grant timer expires. There can be many update messages during a session. Finally, the subscriber has ended the session, and the client sends a termination message to the server containing the last Used-Units. The server can use the termination message to clear any related reservations made in the back-end balance management system. If the subscriber did not terminate the session himself but instead depleted his balance then the server would have responded earlier with reject to an update message, possibly telling the client/control-point to redirect traffic (this normally only makes sense for HTTP/WAP traffic). === AVP matrix === ==== AVPs for new command codes ==== The new Command codes, CCA and CCR, may require some AVPs as indicated below.

The student-run group sings an eclectic mix of songs, focusing on covers of modern rock and pop hits. Since its foundation in 2000, Out of the Blue has had success both nationally and internationally. The group frequently performs at both private and public functions in Oxford and the surrounding area, has toured the UK, Ireland, the United States, and Scandinavia, and has received critical acclaim for their performances at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The group has won numerous competitions of their category of music and, to date, has produced 13 studio albums, three live albums and one compilation album. They came to international attention among pop music fans when they were the subject of a tweet by the noted musician Shakira, who complimented them for the cover they did of one of her songs in support of a charity which they support. ==History== Out of the Blue was founded by a postgraduate student at the University of Oxford, Derek Smith, in 2000. Derek had previously been a member of The Harvard Callbacks whilst studying as an undergraduate at Harvard University. After distributing posters to many of Oxford University's colleges advertising auditions, Out of the Blue was formed and became Oxford's first all-male a cappella group. The original eight-strong group (two members were added in the spring) debuted at G&D;′s ice cream cafe on Oxford’s Little Clarendon Street; this has become the traditional venue for the group's maiden concert each academic year. In their first year they performed a series of local gigs, collaborating with fellow Oxford-based group The Oxford Belles, which climaxed with an end-of-year garden concert in New College cloisters to an audience of over two hundred: a highlight of the year for the nascent group. The most notable events in the group's second year was their private performance for Bill Clinton and the release of their first album, Out of the Blue. In March 2001 Out of the Blue embarked on its first overseas tour in Canada and the US, and that summer performed at numerous Oxbridge college balls including Trinity College in Cambridge. ==Members== Out of the Blue is an official Oxford University society and its membership consists mainly of Oxford University undergraduates, although it does accept members from outside the university (mainly from Oxford Brookes). The group places no restriction on the subject or college: members study a range of subjects and belong to a range of Oxford colleges. As some members graduate from their studies each year, they retire from the group and an open audition is called for replacements, so there are no permanent members. The current group of 2019-20 features: * Rory Naylor (President) * Daniel Heathcote (Musical Director) * James Farnsworth (Musical Director) * Harry Hastilow (Business Manager) * Sam Harper * Ben Igielman * Jonty McConnaughie * Justin Peng * Ben Morris * Rhys Surtees * Richard Tong * Nick Wong * Darren Yang ==Regular concerts== Out of the Blue achieved two long-held initial goals by 2004. Firstly, in 2003, a performance at one of Oxford's largest venues, The Oxford Playhouse, and secondly, in 2004 its first visit to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The group gave a total of eleven performances at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe at C Venues's C-1 auditorium on Chambers Street, the first to only nine audience members. In the following years, following their success at The Oxford Playhouse, the group upgraded to the 1800-seat New Theatre in Oxford for their end-of-year performance. This concert has become an annual event for the group, usually in May/June of each year. Out of the Blue also currently perform at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe every year. Out of the Blue earned Fringe Sell-Out Awards for their month-long runs at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe from 2006 to 2009, and in 2010 the group opted to expand into the more impressive George Square Theatre (C Plaza) where they performed to over 8000 audience members over the course of their twenty-five show run. In 2011 the group worked with Pleasance Theatre, thereby achieving their fifth sell-out run. In 2012, the group moved to Assembly George Square Theatre and performed there again in 2013. In 2014 the group completed another sell-out run at the Fringe, where they performed twenty-five shows at Assembly George Square Theatre. ==Further afield== Having toured the East Coast of America in 2003, the group visited the West Coast in 2004 and have continued to alternate their annual American tours between the two seaboards. During their 2005 tour of the East Coast of America, the group gave a guest performance at the finals of the ICCA South Regional Finals, held at the College of William & Mary in Virginia. The following year they competed themselves at the ICCA Finals at the Lincoln Center in New York, finishing second and so becoming the first group outside of the US to be placed in the top three. Out of the Blue have since returned twice more to the ICCA Finals, once in 2008 and again in 2009. On the latter occasion the group was once more awarded second place and also the award for Outstanding Arrangement for Edmund Thomson Jones's Cold Water by Damien Rice. ==Other work== Out of the Blue has produced eleven studio albums, been crowned The Voice Festival UK University Champions of A Cappella twice, has competed at the finals of the ICCAs on three occasions, and come second in that competition twice. The group regularly perform in Oxford and have traveled extensively around the UK, performing at schools, weddings, parties and other public or private occasions. ===Selected performances=== Out of the Blue has performed at many events, some notable ones are given here: Out of the Blue at Childish Things 5 * Sing Up Lads!, The Sage Gateshead (31 January 2010) * London A Cappella Festival, Kings Place, hosted by the Swingle Singers (15 January 2010) * Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum,OOTB at the Nassau Coliseum at Facebook home of the NHL’s New York Islanders for their match versus Boston Bruins (2 April 2009) * Gleneagles Hotel, Scotland (unknown) * Whistler Ski Resort, British Columbia, Canada (March 2002) * The London Rhodes Event, National Portrait Gallery (2 July 2003) * Performance for THT/Lighthouse and Ralph Lauren, Christie's auction house, London (18 February 2002) * Command performance for Bill Clinton, New College, Oxford (28 October 2001) * 2017 Black and White Ball ===Television appearances=== Out of the Blue has appeared on television on a number of occasions, including: * Pitch Battle, BBC One (24 June 2017) * Cuckoo, BBC Three (24 December 2014) * Pressure Pad, BBC One (10 September 2014) * Sunday Brunch, Channel 4 (22 December 2013) * The One Show, BBC One (14 November 2013) * MTV Sports' Good Morning Sri Lanka, Broadcast on 4 July 2013 * Britain's Got Talent, ITV (30 April 2011) * The Culture Show, Series 4, Episode 9, BBC Two performing \\"Poker Face\\" by Lady Gaga (originally broadcast at 7pm on 19 August 2010) * The Slammer, Series 1, Episode 8, CBBC performing \\"Dreaming of You\\" by The Coral (originally broadcast at 4:55pm on 10 November 2006) * Central News, ITV (May 2006)On stage at the New Theatre, Oxford * South Today, BBC One (May 2006) ===Radio appearances=== Out of the Blue often appear on local radio stations in the Oxford area.

The group won the inaugural Western European regional competition in 2006, with Cambridge University's Fitz Barbershop in second and Oxford University's in the Pink in third. Out of the Blue also picked up the award for Outstanding Soloist for Marc Vastenavondt's performance of Queen's Fat Bottomed Girls and the award for Outstanding Vocal Percussion for Johannes Terwitte's performance in Franz Ferdinand's Matinée. Having won the Western European round, Out of the Blue was invited to compete in the ICCAs Finals in the Alice Tully Hall at the Lincoln Center, New York, on 29 April 2006. The group was awarded second place behind Brigham Young University’s Vocal Point. This was the first time that a group from outside the USA had achieved a place in the top three of the ICCA Finals. Out of the Blue was awarded second place in the Western European semifinal of the ICCAs in 2007 behind The Oxford Gargoyles, and was given the award for Outstanding Choreography. In 2008, the Western European region of the ICCAs expanded to include two quarterfinals, one held at the University of Oxford and the other at the University of St Andrews. Out of the Blue won both the Oxford quarterfinals and the semifinal, held at St Paul’s School, London, progressing to ICCAs Finals at New York’s Lincoln Center for the second time in three years. Out of the Blue’s then- President, Calum Melville, also won the award for Outstanding Choreography. Out of the Blue perform Lady Gaga's \\"Poker Face\\" at VFUK 2010 ===The Voice Festival UK (VF-UK)=== Out of the Blue have competed in the University competition of The Voice Festival UK, five times, making the final on each occasion, and being crowned winners twice, in 2009 and 2014, being the only group thus far to do so. In 2009 the UK's first nationwide A Cappella festival, The Voice Festival UK, was established. In the first year of the VF- UK competition, Out of the Blue progressed from the Oxford round to defeat a cappella groups from St Andrews and Cambridge at the final in London. The group was, once again, invited to compete in the ICCA Finals in New York, coming second and winning the award for Outstanding Arrangement for Edmund Thomson Jones's Cold Water by Damien Rice. In 2010 Out of the Blue won the award for Outstanding Musicality at the Oxford round of VF-UK and progressed to the final, where they picked up the Outstanding Song Award for Lady Gaga's \\"Poker Face\\". In 2011 the group progressed to their third successive VF-UK final and picked up an award for Outstanding Musicality. In 2012 the group made it through to the final once again and picked up a highly commended award along the way for Laurie Cottam's solo in Got to Get you into My Life/Isn’t She Lovely. In the Final they won the award for Outstanding Performance. The group returned to the competition in 2014, which, for the first time, included a video entry first round. The group progressed to the semi-finals in London, where they picked up an award for Outstanding Musicality for their performance of \\"The Sound of Silence\\" and were one of five university groups who progressed to the Final. In the Final they won the award for Outstanding Performance and Bobby Goulder (MD) picked up the award for Outstanding Arrangement for the entire set. The group were crowned winners of the competition and became the first university group to win the award for a second time. ===Britain's Got Talent=== The group participated in series five of Britain's Got Talent. They performed a mash-up version of \\"Poker Face\\" and \\"SexyBack\\" for their first round audition, first broadcast on ITV on 30 April 2011. They made it through to the live semi-finals where they performed a mash-up of \\"Jump (For My Love)\\" by The Pointer Sisters and \\"Flashdance... What a Feeling\\" by Irene Cara. When the results of the semi-final were announced, and it was revealed that Steven Hall had beaten Out of the Blue to the last place in the top 3, the live audience booed the announcement and judges alike expressed outrage and confusion at the result. Jessie J also expressed her support for the group, and her disappointment that they didn't progress in the competition. Hundreds of Twitter users also voiced their disapproval. ===Pitch Battle=== The group took part in BBC's Pitch Battle, appearing in the second episode. They were knocked out by ScotSoul in their first battle, after judges Chaka Khan and Kelis both favoured their opponents, with only Gareth Malone voting in their favour. Fellow Oxford group The Oxford Alternotives were also eliminated after the first round, and Out of the Blue's opponent ScotSoul ultimately advanced to the final, finishing in third place. ==Charity== Out of the Blue has performed in aid of various charities since its inception in 2000, such as Oxfam's Afghanaid Program (performance at Oxford Town Hall on 19 November 2001), Terrence Higgins Trust (performance at Christie's auction house on 18 February 2002). ===Helen & Douglas House=== In recent years, the group has visited Oxford-based charity, Helen & Douglas House, as well as donating some of its end-of-year profits. Helen & Douglas House is a hospice that provides respite care for children and young adults with life-limiting conditions, and support for their families. From 2005 to 2014, Helen & Douglas House hosted an annual fundraiser, Childish Things, held in the New Theatre, Oxford. The ten iterations of Childish Things raised a total of nearly £600,000. Out of the Blue performed regularly at the event from 2007, alongside comedians such as Bill Bailey, Jimmy Carr, Rowan Atkinson, and Rob Brydon.

Shakira spotted the video and tweeted it to her 26.2 million Twitter followers on 23 July 2014; as of 28 July, the song had been retweeted 1,200 times and made a favorite 1,800 times. Shakira's tweet included the message: \\"Hey @ootboxford, we LOVE your a capella Shak medley! ¡Nos encanta este medley que han hecho @ootboxford\\" On the same day, Shakira posted the video on her Facebook page in English and Spanish, which attracted 87,928 likes and was shared nearly 10,000 times. On Facebook, the world-famous singer wrote: \\"The Oxford choir - Out of the Blue is awesome! And the fact that they are doing this for charity makes it all the more special...so well done!! Shak\\". As of 30 August, the video had received more than 4 million views and downloads of the charity single had raised over £10,000 for Helen & Douglas House. The media were quick to pick up on the story and the group found themselves featured in newspapers and magazines and on television and radio stations around the world. \\"We love [Shakira’s] songs, and we thought they would appeal to everyone\\", Out of the Blue’s president Joshua Barr told The Guardian. \\"As is probably evident from the video, we are not afraid to make ourselves look silly. A group of guys shaking their hips and wiggling their bums to Shakira is not what most people expect to see, which I think is why it's so popular…. \\"We couldn’t believe we were tweeted by Shakira. On the Facebook post she signed it off personally so we knew she had actually watched the video, which is amazing. We’ve recorded the song for charity and all the proceeds go to the hospice Helen and Douglas House, so the most exposure it gets, the better\\". ===\\"Rather Be\\" (charity single)=== On 22 August 2014, Out of the Blue released another charity single - \\"Rather Be\\" by Clean Bandit to raise money for Global Dream, a non-profit initiative that aims to promote literacy in India through a new technique for rapid learning, based on the principle that anyone who can read can teach anyone else to read. == Discography == === Studio albums === * Spectra (2019) * Bloom (2018) * Cut Loose (2017) * Get Down (2016) * Rambling Men (2015) * Soul Sisters (2014) * Blueprints (2013) * Music Up!

New Zealand started metrication in 1969 with the establishment of the Metric Advisory Board (MAB) and completed metrication on 14 December 1976.Consumer Affairs, November 2006 accessed 28 August 2013 Until the 1970s, New Zealand traditionally used the imperial system for measurement, which it had inherited from the United Kingdom. ==Strategy toward metrication== The New Zealand metric symbol was introduced in March 1971. To give metrication a human face, a baby girl whose parents agreed to co-operate was nicknamed Miss Metric.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat;=19771005&id;=4MgwAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=dAIEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6924,4465370 News and pictures of her progress were intermingled with press releases about the progress of metrication. By the end of 1972 the temperature scale, road signs, and measures used in the sale of such items as wool and milk had been metricated. Only a few letters voiced outright opposition to the changeover. ==Exceptions== Although New Zealand completed metrication in the 1970s, a 1992 study of university students found that at that time there was a continued use of imperial units for birth weight and human height alongside metric units.\\"Human use of metric measures of length\\" . Dignan, J. R. E., & O'Shea, R. P. (1995). New Zealand Journal of Psychology, 24, 21–25. On the 30th anniversary of the introduction of the metric system in December 2006, the New Zealand Consumer Affairs Minister, Judith Tizard, commented that \\"Now 30 years on the metric system is part of our daily lives\\" but noted some continuing use of imperial measurements in some birth announcements of baby weights and also with people's heights. Screen sizes for devices such as televisions, monitors and phones, and wheel rim sizes for vehicles, are stated in inches, as is the convention in the rest of the world. The aviation industry is one of the last major users of the old imperial system: altitude and airport elevation is measured in feet. All other aspects (fuel quantity, aircraft weight, runway length, etc.) use metric. ==References== ==External links== * Weights and Measures Act 1987 * Metrication in New Zealand New Zealand Category:Science and technology in New Zealand ","title":"Metrication in New Zealand"},{"id":"3263202","text":"Historic counties may refer to: *Historic counties of England, subdivisions of England established for administration by the Normans *Historic counties of Ireland, areas in Ireland separate from the county corporates that existed in some of the larger towns and cities *Historic counties of Scotland, the principal local government divisions of Scotland until 1975 *Historic counties of Wales, ancient sub-divisions of Wales *Counties of Trinidad and Tobago *Counties of Moldova *Former counties of Romania ","title":"Historic counties"},{"id":"3263204","text":"Edward Everett Mayer (September 8, 1935 - January 30, 2009) was an American motor racing entrepreneur who was successful in several categories of racing, including Formula One and IndyCars. ==Life and career== Mayer was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania. While studying law at Cornell, he became involved in the Rev-Em Formula Junior team whose drivers included his brother Timmy and Peter Revson. After graduating in 1962 Mayer followed his brother and Revson to Europe and joined Bruce McLaren who was setting up his Formula One team. Despite the death of his brother in 1964, Mayer continued to be involved in motor sport and assumed control of the McLaren team after Bruce McLaren was killed in 1970. For much of the 1970s McLaren enjoyed considerable success, with both Emerson Fittipaldi and James Hunt taking the drivers title. In addition to Formula One, McLaren also competed in USAC, CART, and CanAm racing under Mayer's management. The McLaren team won the Indianapolis 500 twice; a McLaren chassis entered by Roger Penske also won the 500. Towards the end of the decade the team's Formula 1 results began to decline and title sponsor Marlboro engineered a merger with the Project 4 team run by Ron Dennis. Mayer remained as joint managing-director until 1982, when he sold his shares and left the team he had helped to create. Mayer continued to work in motor sport, firstly in CART racing, running the Texaco Star team under the Mayer Motor Racing banner, and then in 1986 returning to Formula One as manager of Haas Lola, a new team he co-founded with Carl Haas and running 1980 World Champion, Alan Jones alongside of former Ferrari and Renault driver Patrick Tambay. While the results were poor, the team showed great potential with the car generally regarded as one of the best in the F1 paddock but was let down by the under powered Ford TEC turbo engine, until the acquisition of sponsor Beatrice forced the team's withdrawal. Following a year's retirement, Mayer then returned to CART racing, joining the Penske team, as Vice-Chairman of Penske's motorsports operations, presiding over the teams' success in the 1990s. He moved to a consultancy role with Penske, which he continued until 2007. Mayer lived in England. He and wife Sarah (Sally) Bryant (divorced in 1993) had two children, Tim Mayer (named after Teddy's brother), who is also in motorsports, and Anne. Both live in the United States. Mayer died on January 30, 2009, of complications following his decade-long struggle with Parkinson's disease. == References == Category:Formula One people Category:Formula One team owners Category:IndyCar Series people Category:Cornell Law School alumni Category:1935 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Scranton, Pennsylvania Category:Deaths from Parkinson's disease Category:American motorsport people Category:McLaren people ","title":"Teddy Mayer"},{"id":"3263213","text":"Dolgarrog railway station is an unstaffed halt, and a request stop, on the Conwy Valley Line from Llandudno Junction to Blaenau Ffestiniog. The station is located on the east bank of the River Conwy just across the A470 road from Plas Maenan, which was the home of Henry Jack, the Managing Director of the Aluminium Corporation from 1916 to 1927, together with its associated enterprises including the Ffestiniog Railway and the Welsh Highland Railway. Plas Maenan is now a small country house hotel and restaurant with views across the valley. ==History== The station was built by the LNWR in 1916 to provide sidings and an interchange facility with a short standard gauge industrial line, built by the Aluminium Corporation to serve Dolgarrog village and the aluminium works that are about a mile from the station on the west bank of the river. The aluminium works closed in 2007, and is now the site of Surf Snowdonia, an inland surfing lagoon. The industrial line crossed the river by a substantial girder bridge (still used as a footbridge, which is the only way to reach the station from the village of Dolgarrog). It was initially equipped with two locomotives, ten 12 ton wagons, and two passenger carriages. Morning and evening passenger services were free and operated from 1917 to 1932. Goods traffic, which was heavy during the war, continued but declined in the 1950s. The line closed in 1960 and was lifted in 1964. Plas Maenan Hotel The station was closed on 2 November 1964 but was reopened on 14 June 1965. ==Facilities== The station is unmanned and has a single platform, with basic amenities only (waiting shelter and timetable poster board). It also has a digital CIS display like other stations on the branch. Access to the platform is via a foot crossing and path from the A470 road.Dolgarrog station facilities National Rail Enquiries ==Usage== The station became the least used station in Wales for the period 2017–18, mainly due to Sugar Loaf station increasing its usage by more than sevenfold from the previous year. The previous low usage for Sugar Loaf, 228 passengers for 2016–17, seems to have made it popular. It saw over 1,800 passengers for 2017–18, whilst Dolgarrog saw a fall of almost 40% passenger usage to 612. ==Services== Transport for Wales operates five southbound and six northbound trains that call on request Mon-Sat (approximately every three hours), with three trains each way on Sundays between May and early September. Following serious flood damage to the line in multiple locations in March 2019, services from this station were suspended for four months and replaced by buses whilst major infrastructure repairs were carried out.Flood damaged Conwy Valley line could be closed for months itv.com news article 25 March 2019; Retrieved 26 March 2019 Dolgarrog was one of two stations severely damaged by the floodwaters. The damaged platform was removed and the line reopened to traffic on 18 July 2019, but with Dolgarrog station remaining closed. On 22 November 2019 the line closed again for three weeks for a new platform to be built at Dolgarrog and rock bolts to be installed in Ffestiniog Tunnel, reopening on 15 December. Further damage to the line occurred in February 2020, this time by Storm Ciara. As of June 2020, the line is still closed, with reopening currently scheduled for 28 September. ==References== ==Further reading== * * ==External links== *Conwy Valley Railway *Dolgarrog Railway Society Category:Llanddoged and Maenan Category:Railway stations in Conwy County Borough Category:Railway request stops in Great Britain Category:Former London and North Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1916 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1964 Category:Reopened railway stations in Great Britain Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1965 Category:Railway stations served by Transport for Wales Rail ","title":"Dolgarrog railway station"},{"id":"3263218","text":"South Africa played its first Test match in cricket in 1889 against England at Port Elizabeth, becoming the third Test nation after England and Australia. This is a list of the men and women who have been the official South African captains in cricket. South Africa was a founder member of the International Cricket Council in 1909. However, the South African team did not play official Test cricket from 1970 to 1991, having been suspended from membership by the ICC as a result of controversy over apartheid (most particularly the reaction to the Basil d'Oliveira affair). There were a number of rebel tours to South Africa in the intervening period, but none of the matches are recognised as official Test matches and they are not included here. South Africa rejoined the ICC, and resumed playing official Test cricket, in 1991. ==Men's cricket== ===Test match captains=== This is a list of cricketers who have captained the South African cricket team for at least one Test match. Where a player has a dagger (†) next to a Test match series in which he captained at least one Test, that denotes that player deputised for the appointed captain or were appointed by the home authority for a minor proportion in a series.

Hartwig and Wolfgang Hartwig, was a German film producer working in exploitation genres. ==Career== After acting as a film distributor, Hartwig's first film as a producer was the then controversial documentary Bis fünf nach zwölf – Adolf Hitler und das 3. Reich (1953). Seeing the value of notorious publicity, Hartwig began producing a series of exploitation films called \\"Sittenfilme\\" or \\"vice films\\" for his film production company Rapid Film. His first 15 films from 1957 to 1962 were economically based on original screenplays and did not use a major distributor.pp. 208-216 Bergfelder, Tim International Adventures: German popular Cinema and European Co-Productions in the 1960s Berghahn Books 2005 Hartwig began the next phase of his career in 1962 with The Hot Port of Hong Kong. Hartwig not only found it cheaper to film in Near Eastern and Oriental locations but his films received international co-production funding from other European nations. His films were released by two major German film companies Gloria Film and Constantin Film, who were attracted by Hartwig's subjects of adventure, Eurospy films and works by popular German authors such as a film based on the adventures of the pre-World War II pulp fiction hero Rolf Torring that was reprinted in paperback after the war, and Westerns based on the works of Friedrich Gerstäcker. In the late 1960s Hartwig moved to sex films such as the Schulmädchen-Report film series that initiated the Sex report film genre. In 1977 Hartwig decided to film a large budget World War II film shot in Yugoslavia from the German point of view and engaged Sam Peckinpah to direct Cross of Iron.Fulwood, Neil The Films of Sam Peckinpah Pavilion Books, 12 Nov 2014 The film lead to a sequel Breakthrough (1979) directed by Andrew V. MacLaglen. His last film was Palace directed by Édouard Molinaro. During the 1960s he was married to the actress Dorothee Parker who appeared in several of his films. ==Selected filmography== ===Producer=== * Bis fünf nach zwölf – Adolf Hitler und das 3.

He is best known for the Jimmy Coates series of books. ==Early life and education== Craig was born and grew up in the Finchley neighborhood of London. His mother is a poet and his two sisters are also writers. He studied philosophy at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he wrote and composed music for the Cambridge Footlights. ==Career== In 2002, he provided the score for the musical theatre production Told You So: A Musical Hijacking of Aesop's Fables (book and lyrics by John Finnemore). His first children's book, Jimmy Coates: Killer, was published in 2005. He described the plot as being about \\"a boy on the run from the secret service, battling Britain’s dictatorship, while resisting his own genetic programming that gives him the instincts and abilities of an assassin\\". He followed it with six more Jimmy Coates books, and as of 2017, the series had sold over 250,000 copies and been translated into twelve languages. He regularly performs school visits to encourage reading and promote his books. In 2015, he told The Bookseller that schools were becoming more reluctant to pay authors for visits, but he maintained that authors should never do them for free. He said that author visits show children that the world of books is \\"full of life, passion and thrills...My aim with every school event I do is to make my visit the single most memorable event in the school life of every student in the room\\". In 2010, Craig released an album of songs which he wrote and performed himself: The Songman & Me, Vol. 1. ==Personal life== Craig is Jewish. He met anthropologist and television presenter Mary-Ann Ochota when they attended Cambridge University together; they began dating in 2000 and eventually married.

It was released in 2006. A PlayStation 2 port was released on September 14, 2006. A downloadable version was made available on the PlayStation Store for PlayStation 3 on May 20, 2015. It is also featured in Metal Slug Anthology for the Wii, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. ==Plot== One month after the events of Metal Slug 3, the threatening presence of General Morden looms over the world once again. Marco Rossi and Tarma Roving of the Peregrine Falcon unit reunites with Eri Kasamoto and Fio Germi of SPARROWS as the quartet is ordered to investigate Morden's latest plan, being joined by two new allies named Ralf Jones and Clark Still of the Ikari Warriors. Together, they proceed into the mountains where Morden's Rebel Army has established an outpost. After destroying their latest war machine in a long hillside battle, the six soldiers confront Morden and discover that he has rebuilt his alliance with the Martians. However, it is soon revealed that the Martians themselves are being invaded and eaten by a new dangerous race of aliens called Invaders and they have turned to Morden for help. As the Invaders invade Earth's cities, the soldiers fight them off and chase them into the desert, where the Invader Queen has established a nest. With help from the Rebels, they rescue the captured Martians and succeed in destroying the Invader Queen. ==Gameplay== Metal Slug 6 returns to the Rebel-Martian alliance featured in Metal Slugs 2, X, and 3, but on a much broader scale. Rather than repeating the previous games' events of the Martians breaking the alliance and the Rebels assisting the player in turn, the player now teams up with the Rebels and Martians to combat an even greater threat. There are now two modes of play the player can choose from right at the beginning: Easy and Hard. Easy mode lowers the difficulty of the game and changes the player's default weapon to the Heavy Machine Gun; however, the game ends just before the final mission. As with previous installments, Metal Slug 6 adds a number of new Slugs as well as a new weapon, the Zantetsu Sword, which allows the player's melee weapon to emit lethal energy waves that can neutralize enemy firepower. Each character now has unique abilities: Marco's basic gun does more damage, Eri can throw bombs in multiple directions, Ralf can perform the Vulcan Punch and take two hits himself before dying, and so on. Some characters also have special attack techniques that are activated through certain button combinations. Characters can now throw away one gun power-up's worth of ammunition, to give to the other player or simply discard altogether. A secondary melee attack is also available. Conversely, the sliding technique from Metal Slug 5 has been removed, and players except Fio and Ralf only receive half as much ammo for special guns. Metal Slug 6 introduces a new play mechanic dubbed the 'Weapon Stock System'. Two gun power-ups can now be carried at the same time. Players can switch between the two weapons, or simply put them both away in favor of the default weapon. When obtaining a new weapon power-up, it will automatically occupy the inactive slot, or, if both are holstered, replace the less recent weapon of the two. The score is multiplied by powers of 2. The faster the speed at which enemies are killed, the higher the power, as a meter at the bottom of the screen shows. When it says \\"Max\\" enemies and destructible objects will drop coins for an extra high score. ==Reception== ==External links== *Metal Slug 6 at the official Japanese website of SNK Playmore * Category:2006 video games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Arcade games Category:Metal Slug Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:SNK Playmore games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games scored by Manabu Namiki Category:Crossover video games ","title":"Metal Slug 6"},{"id":"3263280","text":"The AES11 standard published by the Audio Engineering Society provides a systematic approach to the synchronization of digital audio signals.http://www.aes.org/publications/standards/search.cfm?docID=18 AES11 recommends using an AES3 signal to distribute audio clocks within a facility. In this application, the connection is referred to as a Digital Audio Reference Signal (DARS). Further recommendations are made concerning the accuracy of sample clocks as embodied in the interface signal and the use of this format as a convenient synchronization reference where signals must be rendered co-timed for digital processing. Synchronism is defined, and limits are given which take account of relevant timing uncertainties encountered in an audio studio. ==Related developments== AES11 Annex D (in the November 2005 or later printing or version) shows an example method to provide isochronous timing relationships for distributed AES3 structures over asynchronous networks such as AES47 where reference signals may be locked to common timing sources such as GPS. In addition, the Audio Engineering Society has now published a related standard called AES53, that specifies how the timing markers already specified in AES47 may be used to associate an absolute time- stamp with individual audio samples. This may be closely associated with AES11 and used to provide a way of aligning streams from disparate sources, including synchronizing audio to video in networked structures. The media profile defined in annex A of AES67 provides a means of using AES11 synchronization via the Precision Time Protocol. ==References== Category:Audio engineering Category:Sound Category:Broadcast engineering Category:Audio Engineering Society standards ","title":"AES11"},{"id":"3263282","text":"Brighton Secondary College is a year 7 to 12 co-educational public secondary school, located in the City of Bayside, Brighton East, Victoria, Australia. The college was established in 1955, where until 1988, it was known as Brighton High School. More than 1200 pupils are enrolled at the school. ==Grounds and facilities== The college provides a gymnasium, library, canteen, school hall as well as drama and music facilities. The school has an Arts and Materials Section, a Science Wing, VCE and Study Centre. The main part of the school consists of the North and Central wings. The North corridor houses the bulk of general school classrooms, but are used particularly for year 7s. The Central Corridor houses a computer laboratory, staff rooms, and storage and building services like the heater boilers. A portion of the Central corridor was destroyed during a fire in April 2000, previously extending to where the Discovery Centre now stands. It is expected the Northern and Central corridors are to be demolished during 2016 due to their apparent age, and to make room for a new building, which will connect to the East wing. The new East Corridor (completed in 2014) consists of two floors. The bottom floor holds the Science and Art departments and classrooms, where as the upper floor contains General VCE classrooms and numerous study centres. The most northern part of the East wing (completed in 2009) consists of the senior school offices and an I.T assistance department. To the south of the library are located the portable classrooms 'P1' to 'P8', yet the area has now been complemented with a temporary hall for lockers. To the east of which, is the Discovery Centre which is used predominantly by year 9s. The furthest south classrooms, S7/S8, have been untouched since 2013, due to the newer arts department in the E wing being used. For a few occasions, they have been used for playing table tennis, but were previously the only art classrooms in the school. These room along with most of the other S classrooms, the N corridor, and the C corridor are areas of dire need for either complete demolition or replacement. Attached to the western end of the N-wing is the Hall, on the upper level. On the lower level are the rooms for drama, band, music instruction and practice. Adjacent and to the south is the canteen area, toilet blocks, and the main entrance to the gym. To the west are the rooms for Visual Communication & Design and Media, but mainly used for general senior subjects – dubbed the West Wing. The area formerly housed Vocational Curriculum and Learning (VCAL) students, the house/block better known as Gumnut Cottage which featured in the television series 'Summer Heights High' before being demolished in late 2007. The completion of the Discovery Centre was a massive undertaking, but was successful due to donations from students, former students as well as grants from the government. The Eastern Wing, and certain sections of the school grounds are in urgent need of upgrading. The new and modern VCE Centre was opened in 2009. This centre extends now into the new Science, Arts and Technology 'da Vinci Centre' which was opened in 2014. There are also basketball courts on the East wing of the school, next to the hockey pitch. On these courts, ankles are taken daily and many buckets are scored. This area is also a high density area for NBA scouts. The P block, which is situated in the centre of the school grounds is well known for its dire condition. From broken doors, smashed windows, to dysfunctional air conditioning units, this building is crying out for financial support. ==Staff== ===Headmasters=== *1955 – 1957 C.O. Holland *1958 – 1964 G.M.

Brighton Secondary College has a sister school in Japan – Tokoname Kita. Every second year the schools alternate in visiting each other with a large group of students and a few teachers who stay at the sister school. Housing is provided by the families at each of the two schools. ===Student Representative Council=== The student body is represented by a Student Representative Council (SRC) where four students are drawn from each year level, gender balanced at teachers' discretion and voted by peers. The SRC serve to represent their year level and the general school body in the upper hierarchy (School Council/Principal/Teachers) in school. They run casual clothes days, special events and fund-raising for the student community or social justice issues. ==SEAL Program== Brighton Secondary College offers a Select Entry Accelerated Learning program. The college is an approved Department of Education \\"Select Entry Acceleration Provider\\" to the Bayside Network. The first set started in 1999, whilst later years have the option of finishing school one year early. SEAL's who decide not to leave a year earlier have the opportunity to do a 3rd year of VCE, therefore allowing them to try/do more electives. When vacancies open up due to SEAL students leaving BSC (quite often to Melbourne High School/ MacRobertson Girls High School) the school puts these spare positions up for grabs; a small percentage of the mainstream students (other school's students can also apply) are chosen, based on grades to sit an entrance test; consisting of Maths, English and Science. The students who score the highest are then accepted into the program. Year 7 SEAL start with an altered curriculum to normal Year 7 studies. It integrates an amount of work usually intended for Year 8. Year 9 SEAL are identified as Year 10s, so as Year 10 SEAL identified as Year 11 etc. ==Houses== Brighton SC has student houses, each is named in honour of a ship captain. Each house is headed by a teacher, A House Captain, House Vice Captain, Junior House Captain and a Junior House Vice Captain. For Chorals a 'Cultural' captain is nominated to head each house as a conductor for the Chorals competition. Students are split into four houses, also represented by a colour: * Lonsdale (yellow) * Murray (red) * Phillip (green) * and Grant (purple) Throughout the year there are key events such as: *Chorals – House choir event *Swimming – House swimming competition *Athletics – House athletics competition *Cross Country Other competitions more at a school level that students participate in include Tournament of Minds, and Debating ==Chorals== Chorals is one of the first key college events in the year. In its 50th year in 2011, Grant house were declared the winners. Chorals is a house singing competition where each house forms their own choir from any number of students. Through a period of half a term, each house practises their repertoire of songs. On the main evening houses present these songs. Each house is required to sing a 'set song.' All houses sing this song, and the house then elects to sing two other songs decided by their Cultural Captain. The house that wins is decided by an adjudicator, usually from a professional background outside the school. The other part of the evening are soloist performances. Each house chooses a representative for the house soloist competition. Over the past few years, the main theme for soloists are songs from 'musicals.' They are judged not only on their singing ability, but also the portrayal of their character. As well as the House Chorals Award, and Soloist Award, there is an award for the Best House Conductor, or \\"The Golden Hands Award\\". As well as the house, and solo singing, staff are invited to perform a piece. In the past, further performances were done by the 'Special Choir' – which in the past involved a smaller choir, performing a set of songs based on a particular theme, often highlighting the spread of talent in the college. In more recent years, the concert band and piano solos have been arranged. ==Music== The college offers instrumental music lessons. Brighton SC is also home to local youth bands. The school has a concert band and a stage band. The concert band usually plays on chorals and presentation evening. Both bands usually contain a variety of instruments forming woodwind, brass and rhythm sections. The Kool Skool's program allows students from Brighton SC to fully develop their music talents. They are offered a recording studio, and a chance to professionally publish their music with Kool Skool's annually. ==Television== In 2006/2007 (filming concluded on 2 February 2007) Brighton Secondary College became the set for Chris Lilley's new show Summer Heights High which premiered on the ABC on Wednesday 5 September 2007. Students starred as extras in the show. On Monday 24 April 2006, XYZ Studios filmed a music video at Brighton Secondary College. The song \\"Hold On\\" by hip hop artist Phrase was a collaboration between Universal Music and XYZ Studios. ==Incidents== In 2014 a former staff member was convicted after stealing around $40,000 from the school. The employee had used a corporate credit card and stolen funds from the school's canteen to support a drug addiction. ===Antisemitic bullying=== A former student of Brighton Secondary College revealed that after joining the college in 2013, he began to face verbal antisemitic bullying. The student stated bullying became physical during the second year. \\"I notified the school 10 times within two weeks regarding the many instances of antisemitic name-calling and physical abuse, including hitting and punching. But still, no action was taken\\"; the student stated. During third year in the college; he was shoved into toilets, and threatened with a knife to remain silent and not fight back. These complains were not investigated by the college authorities. In a joint letter to Daniel Andrews, Premier of Victoria, MPs David Southwick and James Newbury demanded to ensure investigation; and stated: More incidents of antisemitic bullyingsurfaced in July-August 2020. ==See also== * List of schools in Victoria * List of high schools in Victoria ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Rock Eisteddfod Challenge participants Category:Educational institutions established in 1955 Category:Public high schools in Melbourne Category:1955 establishments in Australia ","title":"Brighton Secondary College"},{"id":"3263283","text":"Appley Bridge is a small, affluent village crossing the borders of Greater Manchester and West Lancashire, England. It is located off Junction 27 of the M6 motorway and is nestled in the Douglas Valley alongside the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. ==Toponymy== Appley comes from Apple lea (on the River Douglas), from (boscus de \\"Woodland\\") Appelae, Appeleie, or Appeleye, found in 13th-century Chartulary of Cockersand Abbey; also \\"Appley Moor\\"; within the township of Wrightington in the ancient parish of Eccleston.Eilert Eckwall, The Place-Names of Lancashire, (1922, Manchester University Press: reprinted 1972 by EP Publishing, Wakefield) p. 130. ==Community== Once a busy industrial village with a paint and linoleum works, several quarries, and clay pits for the Wigan brick company, today the village still has several factories including a weighbridge manufacturer and a caravan factory. Today it is not as busy, its main purpose being providing housing for the many commuters who work along the M6 corridor. Appley Bridge railway station Appley Bridge has two churches, (Methodist and Church of England), and is in the Deanery of Chorley, Diocese of Blackburn. Most of the children residing on appley bridge attend all saints primary school, Shevington Vale primary school and shevington high school. Appley Bridge railway station, opened in 1855 by the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway, is situated on the Southport to Manchester line. The village contains a few convenience shops, a football field, multiple children's playing areas,several country pubs and a post office. Appley Bridge converges into the village of Shevington Valehttps://www.bbc.co.uk/history/domesday/dblock/GB-352000-408000/page/6 which is within the Greater Manchester border. In Shevington Vale (which is distinct from nearby Shevington), there is a range of amenities including a SPAR convenience store, a Chinese takeaway, a hairdressing salon and a pharmacy. There is also a small children's play area and football pitch opposite Shevington Vale Primary School. The Golden Days garden centre is just outside the main village on Back Lane, near the M6 Motorway junction. A waste paper recycling yard is also present on Appley Lane North offering free disposal of cardboard and paper as well as other services. ==Recreation== There are many open spaces in Appley Bridge where the local population play football, cricket and rugby etc. The organised football team is called Appley Bridge F.C. and plays matches on the football pitch on Appley Lane South facing the old local pub called the Bridge Inn, near the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. Appley Bridge F.C. which is a Football Association Charter club has many junior teams from the under age 8 up to the under age 16. This is complemented by senior teams and a successful over-35s team. The Senior team enjoys good support and the junior teams have at various age groups been very successful over the past seasons. 19th Wigan Boys' Brigade and 1st Appley Bridge Girls' Brigade meet regularly at Vale Methodist Church Hall. Appley Bridge Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1907. The club had disappeared by the early 1950s.\\"Appley Bridge Golf Club\\", \\"Golf's Missing Links\\". ==Skull House== In between Appley Lane North and Miles Lane is a road called Skull House Lane. The lane takes its name from a cottage known as Skull House, which is located about halfway down Appley Lane North, and the cottage in turn takes its name from a discoloured human skull on the living room mantelpiece of the house. Some inhabitants of Appley Bridge claim that throughout the history of the house, many residents have tried to get rid of the skull, and all have experienced disastrous results after doing so. Recent tests indicate that the skull is female. ==Appley Bridge meteorite== At around 8.45pm on Tuesday evening of 13 October 1914, the inhabitants of Appley Bridge (indeed Lancashire and Cheshire too) were treated to a sudden and spectacular illumination of the night sky, caused by a meteorite that was found in a farmer's field in the village the following day. Found just 18 inches below the surface of the field, with the appearance of burnt iron, the small rock weighed almost 33 lb (15 kg). An article in the \\"Scientific News\\" (No. 2588, 30 October 1914) stated, \\"a small fragment which had been detached from the larger mass was put on view in a shop-window at Appley Bridge.\\" In September 2014 a book about the meteorite, by local author Russell Parry, was published ( ). ==Millbank flood 1987== Floodwater in the street; the water has not yet reached its highest level Syd Hill comes to the rescue with a small personally owned motor launch - the top of a car is visible on the drive, giving a clear indication of water depth After the flood - the waterline is clearly visible on the side of the house On 22 August 1987, parts of Appley Bridge were affected by severe flooding - worst affected was the Millbank estate, off Mill Lane. During heavy rain, the entrance to the culvert that carries Calico Brook beneath the estate became blocked by debris (leaves, branches etc.) and overtopped into the estate, causing extensive flooding to most of the properties. Most residents spent the next few months - up to December '87 - in caravans parked on their front gardens, whilst repairs were carried out. The properties required extensive repair: re-plastering, new woodwork (doors, window frames etc.), with only the higher houses at the entrance to the estate being unaffected. Here are quotes from a West Lancs District Council (WLDC) information item and a press release, dated 11 September 1987: > \\"When severe flooding occurred in several parts of the district on Saturday > 22nd August 1987 - Parbold and parts of Skelmersdale were badly affected, > whilst the Millbank estate in Appley Bridge was flooded out, with several > houses being filled by water to first floor level and almost all of the > remainder having water in their ground floor, varying from about two feet to > five or six feet in depth. An amateur meteorologist with a weather station > at Hilldale recorded the fall of of rain during the 48 hours beginning at > 8.00am on Saturday, 22nd August: over two thirds of that rainfall - about > 2.6 inches - being in a four hour period on Saturday afternoon...\\" \\"...From > preliminary information, it would appear that the storm frequency was in the > order of 1 in 75 year occurrence and this led to widespread flooding > throughout the region...\\" From information item presented to a meeting of the WLDC Technical Services Committee: > \\"...The most severe flooding incident was at Millbank Estate, Appley Bridge, > where a 60\\" diameter piped culvert running through the estate could not cope > with the sudden flow of surface water in the Calico brook. The brook > overflowed the culvert and flooded the estate, which lies in a hollow, to a > depth of about 8 feet (2.4 m). at the lower end, approximately 40 houses > being involved. The Fire Brigade were called to give assistance and they and > the Police helped to evacuate the residents. The North West Water Authority > Rivers Division also provided assistance with workmen and pumping equipment > to pump the water away. The estate was not cleared of water until about > Saturday midnight...\\" Soon after the flood the council undertook simple remedial works to reduce the risk of further flooding. They were considered to be temporary works, with a permanent capital solution to follow. The works that were carried out consisted of the building of a restriction to flow, as part of a bridge across the stream in the local woods (known as \\"the slacks\\"), they also cut a \\"notch\\" into the quarry side wall. In the event of heavy rain, the stream will back-up against the restriction in the bridge and overflow through the notch into the nearby quarry. A wider spaced grill was also placed at the entrance to the culvert allowing small items, such as leaves, to pass through the culvert without blocking it. In March 2012, twenty-four years after the flooding, work was finally started to replace the 1988 \\"temporary\\" works with a permanent project called the \\"Calico Brook Flood Risk Management Scheme\\". This scheme of work has been completed, and consists of a concrete structure linked into an emergency overflow pipe. Normally, water passes through the structure and continues on to the brooks normal course, but in times of high discharge, the brook spills over into the emergency pipeline, which channels the water through a low-friction pipe directly to the River Douglas lower down the valley. ==Notable people== *Darren Almond, artist *Eva Pope, actress *Theodore Major, artist *Andy Fisher, Footballer ==See also== *Listed buildings in Wrightington ==References== ==External links== *West Lancashire Council *Photographs of the Leeds Liverpool Canal at Appley Bridge towpathtreks.co.uk 2006 *All Saints CofE Church - Appley Bridge *Shevington Parish Council *Wigan Borough Council *Wrightington Parish Council Category:Villages in Lancashire Category:Geography of the Borough of West Lancashire ","title":"Appley Bridge"},{"id":"3263284","text":"Hon. James Duperon Bâby (August 25, 1763 – February 19, 1833) was a judge and political figure in Upper Canada. ==Biography== He was born Jacques Bâby, the son of Jacques Bâby dit Duperon, to a prosperous family in Detroit in 1763. His last name is pronounced \\"Baw-bee\\" and has been anglicized in different lines (e.g. Baubie, Bauby). He was educated in Upper Canada (i.e., what is now the province of Ontario), where his uncle, François Bâby, lived. In 1792, he was appointed to the Executive Council and Legislative Council of Upper Canada and became lieutenant for Kent County. In 1793, he was appointed judge in the Western District. After the Jay Treaty in 1795, the Bâby family left the Detroit area and moved to Sandwich (now Windsor). (Today his house is owned by the Ontario Heritage Trust and is used for government offices.) Over the years, the family acquired large amounts of land in the western region of Upper Canada. Bâby was put in charge of the 1st Kent militia. During the War of 1812, Sandwich was seized by the Americans, and Bâby was later taken prisoner at the Battle of the Thames. During the American occupation, his property suffered extensive damage. In 1815, he was appointed Inspector General and moved to York (now Toronto), where he was a politician, judge, wealthy landowner, and part of the ruling clique known as the Family Compact. In 1816, he purchased land on the east bank of the Humber, formerly the site of the Seneca Teiaiagon village, land known today as \\"Bâby Point.\\" In 1823, he represented Upper Canada in resolving a dispute with Lower Canada over the sharing of customs revenues. A Roman Catholic, he helped establish the first Catholic church at York, St. Paul's.

It is usually a highly-foaming mixture of surfactants with low skin irritation, and is primarily used for hand washing of glasses, plates, cutlery, and cooking utensils in a sink or bowl. In addition to its primary use, dishwashing liquid also has various informal applications, such as for creating bubbles, clothes washing and cleaning oil-affected birds. ==History== Washing soda (sodium carbonate) is used for dishwashing, and may be used in areas with hard water. It was used for dishwashing before detergents were invented in Germany during World War I. Liquid detergent used for dishwashing was first manufactured in the middle of the 20th century. Dishwashing detergent producers started production in the United States in the 1930–1940s. Teepol, the first such in Europe, commenced production in 1942. In 2005, dishwashing detergent retail sales totaled nearly USD $10 billion worldwide. ==Types== Dishwashing detergents for dishwashers are manufactured and marketed variously as cartridges, gel, liquids, pacs, powder, and tablets. Any dishwashing liquid may contain bleach, enzymes, or rinsing aids. Some dishwashing detergents may be homemade, using ingredients such as borax, essential oil, eucalyptus oil and grated bar soap, among others. Dishwashing detergents can be formulated to work under different circumstances. In some cases suitably formulated they can be used with cold water or sea water, although they will not generally work as well as those intended for, and used with, hot water. ===Common ingredients=== The main ingredient is water; the main active ingredients are detergents. Detergents are used, rather than soaps, because they do not react with any minerals in the water to form soap scum. There are other thickening and stabilizing agents. Other ingredients may include surfactants, hydrotrope, salts, preservatives, fragrances, and dyes. Surfactants remove grease and stuck food particles. They may also provide foam. Some dishwashing products contain phosphates. Phosphate makes dishes cleaner but can also cause harmful algal bloom as the wastewater goes back to the natural environment. Because of this, it is banned as a component in many places. In 2010, the United States FDA raised health concerns over triclosan, an antibacterial substance used in some dish liquids. Elsewhere, triclosan has been found to create problems at wastewater treatment plants, whereby it can \\"sabotage some sludge-processing microbes and promote drug resistance in others.\\" The United States FDA has found that triclosan provides no health benefits over soap and water. As of 2014, at least one state within the United States has banned triclosan in dishwashing liquids. Many dishwashing liquids contain perfume which can cause irritant or allergic contact dermatitis. ==Brands== Euromonitor International research on dishwashing trends in eighty countries identified producers and brands with the largest 2013 retail value shares. Five multinational companies (Procter and Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, Henkel, Reckitt Benckiser, Unilever, Clean O Fast and HITRO PLUS, collectively held the greatest retail value shares in sixty-five of those countries. Summaries below show percentages of retail value shares and leading brand names in each country, according to Euromonitor International's 2013 reports. Procter and Gamble held the highest retail value share percentages in twenty countries: with Fairy brand, United Kingdom, Estonia, Saudi Arabia (56%), United Arab Emirates (34%), Latvia (35%), Lithuania (32%), Finland (23%), Serbia (38%), Bosnia-Herzegovina (30%), Georgia (26%) and Uzbekistan (26%); Sweden (39%) with brand Yes, the Swedish Fairy brand; Greece (40%) with Fairy and Ava brands; with Fairy and Mif brands, Kazakhstan (28%) and Russia (29%); and Ukraine (41%) with Fairy and Gala brands; Canada (39%) with Cascade and Dawn brands; United States (52%) with Cascade brand; Mexico (44%) with Salvo and Dawn brands; Philippines (54%) with Joy brand.

The summary of dishwashing in Kenya noted most consumers there use alternatives like laundry detergent powder or soap instead of dishwashing liquids, but listed Haco as the leading dishwashing liquid, from Haco Tiger Brands Ltd. ==Primary uses== Dishwashing liquid is used primarily for removing food from used dishes and tableware. Heavy soil (large food particles) is generally scraped from the dishes before using. Detergent formula can vary based on use (hand or automatic). ===Hand dishwashing=== Dishwashing liquid mixed with water on the left side of a sink Hand dishwashing is generally performed in the absence of a dishwashing machine, when large \\"hard-to-clean\\" items are present, or through preference. Some dishwashing liquids can harm household silver, fine glassware, anything with gold leaf, disposable plastics, and any objects made of brass, bronze, cast iron, pewter, tin, or wood, especially when combined with hot water and the action of a dishwasher. When dishwashing liquid is used on such objects it is intended that they be washed by hand. Hand dishwashing detergents utilize surfactants to play the primary role in cleaning. The reduced surface tension of dishwashing water, and increasing solubility of modern surfactant mixtures, allows the water to run off the dishes in a dish rack very quickly. However, most people also rinse the dishes with pure water to make sure to get rid of any soap residue that could affect the taste of the food. Dishwashing liquid can be a skin irritant and cause hand eczema. Those with \\"sensitive skin\\" are advised amongst other things to persuade someone else to do the washing up. ===Automatic dishwashing=== Automatic dishwashing involves the use of a dishwashing machine or other apparatus. It is generally chosen through convenience, sanitation, or personal preference. The cleaning is less reliant on the detergent's surfactants but more reliant on machine's hot water as well as the detergent's builders, bleach, and enzymes. Automatic dishwashing detergents' surfactants generally have less foam to avoid disrupting the machine. ==Informal uses== Reader's Digest notes its use as an ant killer, weed killer, to help spread water-borne fertilizer, and to wash human hair. Good Housekeeping says it can be used mixed with vinegar to attract and drown fruit flies. Dishwashing detergent has been used to clean mirrors as well as windows. * Pling, an open source general purpose cleaner for glazed, plastic, chrome and inox bathroom and kitchen surfaces, published by Twibright Labs, uses dishwashing liquid as one of active ingredients. * Dishwashing liquid can be mixed with water and additional ingredients such as glycerin and sugar to produce a bubble-blowing solution. * Dishwashing liquid may be used for cleaning delicate clothing fabrics such as hosiery and lingerie. * Dishwashing liquid is frequently recommended in a dilute solution to make decals and vinyl graphics easier to position when applying. * In industry, dishwashing liquid is also used to inspect pressurized equipment for leaks, such as propane fittings. It is used to inspect pneumatic tires for flats, as well as for quality assurance during the installation process, and as a mounting bead lubricant. * Dishwashing liquid has uses as an ingredient in making homemade garden pest deterrents. Oregon State University's Cooperative Extension Service notes the use of dishwashing liquid to get rid of spidermites. Dish soap has also been used to deter aphids. In some instances, the dish soap may be toxic to plant leaves and cause them to \\"burn\\". Use of soap or dish detergent to help spread pesticide on plants is noted by University of Georgia extension service, but not recommended. * A solution of dishwashing liquid and water may be used to remove coffee, tea, olive oil, soda and fruit juice stains from fabrics. One dishwashing liquid brand has been used to remove stains from white or lightly-colored cloth napkins. An oiled Gannet being washed * Dishwashing liquid has been used to treat birds affected by oil spills. After the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, the International Bird Rescue Research Center received hundreds of cases of dishwashing liquid that were used for this purpose. More dishwashing liquid was donated during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to the International Bird Rescue Research Center and the Marine Mammal Center. ==See also== * Cleaning agent ** List of cleaning agents ** List of cleaning products * Soap * Green cleaning * Washing ==References== ==Further reading== * * * Category:Cleaning products Category:Dishwashing ","title":"Dishwashing liquid"},{"id":"3263288","text":"Prunus species are used as food plants by the caterpillars of a number of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths).

After numerous league and cup successes over the years, Village gained promotion into the Welsh Football League at the end of the 1998–99 season after finishing second in the Premier Division of the Carmarthenshire League, and successfully beating Neath League team Cwmamman United in the Welsh League promotion play-off. In their first season of Welsh League football, the club secured promotion by finishing third in Welsh League Division Three. In the Welsh Cup Village defeated Pontyclun and Ely Rangers before being knocked out by Inter Cardiff. In the 2000–01 season, Village finished eighth in their first season. The following season Village became Division Two Champions and were promoted to Welsh League Division One. In the 2002–03 season Village were finished 16th and were relegated.

In 2009 a 75 seater stand was installed as well as the rebuilding of the covered standing area that had been damaged previously by a storm. During the summer of 2010 the floodlights system was completed. In the summer of 2012, the main pitch was ripped up completely to install the new drainage system. Over the years, the main pitch has had many problems with the drainage, so the decision was made to upgrade the drainage facility to help solve the problem. The work was finally completed at the end of September 2012. The summer of 2014 saw further development of the ground with a wooden perimeter fence being erected to fully enclose the main pitch area. ==Club honours== *West Wales Senior Cup : Runners-up (2006/07) *Welsh League Division 2 : Champions (2001/02), *Welsh League Reserve Cup : Runners-up (2001/02) *Welsh League Reserve Division West : Winners (2007/08) *Welsh League Reserve Division West : Runners-up (2005/06) *Carmarthenshire League Premier Division : Runners-up (1989/90), (1997/98), (1998/99) *Carmarthenshire League Division 1 : Champions (1988/89) / Runners- up (1977/78) *Carmarthenshire League Division 2 : Champions (2001/02), (2004/05) *Carmarthenshire League Division 3 : Runners-up (1999/00) *Carmarthenshire League Reserve Division 1 : Champions (2005/06) *Carmarthenshire League Reserve Division 2 : Champions (1990/91), (1998/99) *Carmarthenshire League Reserve Division 3 : Champions (1989/90), (1996/97) *Carmarthenshire League Senior Cup : Winners (1989/90), (1994/95), (1995/96), (1996/97) / Runners-up (1990/91), (1992/93) *Carmarthenshire League TG Davies Premier Cup : Runners-up (1998/99) *Carmarthenshire League Challenge Cup : Winners (1988/89) *Carmarthenshire League Darch Reserve Cup : Winners (1993/94), (1999/00), (2000/01) / Runners-up (1981/82), (1990/91), (1991/92), (1996/97), (1997/98), (2008/09) *Krisyln Summer Cup : Winners (1978/79), (1990/91), (1992/93), (1994/95), (1997/98), (1998/99), (1999/00) / Runners-up (1979/80), (1989/90), (1991/92), (2010/11), (2013/14), (2014/15) *Swansea League Investiture Cup : Runners-up (1968/69) *Swansea League Gwalia Cup : Runners-up (1938/39) *West Wales Youth Cup : Winners (2003/04) *West Wales Youth League Cup : Winners (2014/15) *West Wales Youth League Division A : Winners (2016/17) *West Wales Youth League Division B : Winners (2014/15) *West Wales Youth League Championship Playoffs : Winners (2014/15), Winners (2016/17) ==Current players== ===Welsh League Second Division (1st Team)=== ===Welsh League Reserve Division West (2nd Team)=== ===Swansea League Third Division (3rd Team)=== ===Welsh League Youth Division (U19s)=== ===West Wales Youth League Division B (U18s)=== ==Backroom staff== ===Club Officials=== * Chairman: Robert Lloyd * Football vice-chairman: Alan Rushby * Football Secretary: Nick Elias * Asst Football Secretary: Clive Greenfield * Vice- Chairman: Phil James * general secretary: Clive Williams * Treasurer: Brian Matthews * Head Groundsman: Eddie Donne ===Club Management=== * 1st Team Manager: David D'Auria * 1st Team Assistant Manager: Ashley Richards * 1st Team Coach: Kevin Murphy * 1st Team Player/Coach: Dayle Selvage * 2nd Team Manager: Kevin Lewis * 2nd Team Assistant Manager: Nicky Romanello * 2nd Team Coach: John Ireland * 3rd Team Manager:Nigel Lewis * 3rd Team Asstistant Manager:Owen Williams * Under 19s Manager: John Ireland * Under 19s Assistant Manager: Shaun Cartwright * Under 19s Coach: Dean Lewis * Under 18s Manager: Stuart Davies * Under 18s Assistant Manager: Phil Llewellyn * Under 18s Coach: Vacant ==Teams== The club run 5 senior teams in: *Welsh League Division Two (First Team) *Welsh League Reserve Division West (Second Team) *Swansea Senior League Division Three (Third Team) *Welsh League Youth Division West (U19s) *West Wales Youth League Division B (U18s) The club also run a number of Junior sides, including: *Under-6s & Under-7s (Friendly Mini Football) *Under-8s to Under-11s (Swansea Junior League Mini Football) *Under-12s to Under-14s (Swansea Junior League) *Under-15s & Under-16s (Carmarthenshire Junior Football League) *Under-12 Girls (West Wales Women & Girls League) *Under-14 Girls (West Wales Women & Girls League) ==External links== * Map of Stafford Common, home of Garden Village Football Club * Garden Village AFC Official Website * Football Association of Wales * Welsh Football League * West Wales FA * Swansea Senior Football League * West Wales Youth League == References == Category:Football clubs in Swansea Category:Association football clubs established in 1922 Category:1922 establishments in Wales Category:Welsh Football League clubs Category:Swansea Senior League clubs Category:Ardal Leagues clubs ","title":"Garden Village A.F.C."},{"id":"3263328","text":"Parliamentary assembly may refer to: *National Parliament, a type of state legislative assembly body *Assembly of national parliaments, an inter- parliamentary institution of state national legislatures *International parliament, a supranational legislative body of intergovernmental organization *The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe sv:Parlamentarikerförsamling ","title":"Parliamentary assembly"},{"id":"3263330","text":"J wave labelled as Osborn wave. 81-year-old male with BP 80/62 and temperature 31.9 C (89.5 F).

He founded a faculty of vegetable physiology and a laboratory at the Petrovskoye Academy. ==Biography== Timiryazev was born to Arkady Semyenovich Timiryazev, a Russian statesman, and Adelaida Bode, an English woman of French origin, who later received Russian citizenship. He had at least three brothers: Nikolai (1835–1906), a military officer, Dimitri (1837–1903), a specialists in statistics, and Vasily (c. 1840–1912), a writer. Timiryazev was first educated by private teachers at home. In 1861 he entered the Saint Petersburg University and graduated with honors from the faculty of physics and mathematics in 1866. Two years later he published his first article, on a device for studying breakdown of carbon dioxide, and was sent abroad, where he studied under Wilhelm Hofmeister, Robert Bunsen, Gustav Kirchhoff, Marcellin Berthelot, Hermann von Helmholtz, Jean-Baptiste Boussingault and Claude Bernard. Upon returning to Russia in 1871 he defended a PhD on spectral analysis of chlorophyll and was appointed as professor of Petrov's Academy of Agriculture, until its closure in 1892. Since 1877 he also lectured at the Moscow State University. His research work was devoted to photosynthesis-related phenomena. He also pioneered the use of greenhouses for agricultural research in Russia, which he initiated in early 1870s. He was a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences (since 1890), Royal Society (1911) and Botanical Society of Scotland (1911), and an honorary professor of the Saint Petersburg University, Kharkov University, University of Glasgow (1901), University of Cambridge (1909) and University of Geneva (1909). ==Darwinism== Timiryazev was a major proponent of the evolution theory of Charles Darwin in Russia.

However, he was highly critical of the term \\"struggle for existence\\" which he rejected. He believed that it was an unfortunate metaphor with negative social implications and stated that Darwinism could be taught without using the word \\"struggle\\".Düwell, Marcus; Rehmann-Sutter, Christoph; Mieth, Dietmar.

In Vinnytsia there is the Regional Universal Scientific Library named after Kliment Timiryazev. The Timiryazev State Museum of Biology in Moscow is also named after him. At the beginning of the Tverskoy Boulevard in Moscow there is a statue of Timiryazev which was unveiled on 4 November 1923, sculpted by Sergey Merkurov and laid out by the architect Osipov. Timiryazev is depicted in the gown of Cambridge University where he was awarded an honorary doctorate. The granite pedestal bears the inscription of 'the curve of plant physiology' which Timiryazev elucidated. In October 1941 the statue was overturned by a Fascist bomb, but after a few hours it was back in its place. Its lower half still bears the marks caused by bomb splinters. ==Selected publications== * The Life Of The Plant (1958 English edition) ==References== ==External links== * With Darwin at Down Category:1843 births Category:1920 deaths Category:Corresponding Members of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences Category:Foreign Members of the Royal Society Category:Researchers of photosynthesis Category:Russian inventors Category:Russian botanists ","title":"Kliment Timiryazev"},{"id":"3263418","text":"Oblación is a 1994 album by Venezuelan musician Alberto Naranjo. ==Personnel== * Alberto Naranjo – arrangements, direction, drums, percussion * Víctor Mestas – acoustic piano * Gustavo Carucí – electric bass * Julio Flores – soprano, alto and baritone saxophones * Rodolfo Reyes – alto and tenor saxophones, flute * Oscar Mendoza – trombone * Alexander Livinalli – percussion * Vladimir Quintero – percussion ==Special guests== * Rafael Velásquez (trumpet on 4, 6, 8) * José Ortiz (piano on 6) * Huguette Contramaestre (lead vocalist on 6, 7, 12) * Fusión IV: Ilba Rojas, Adriana Portales, Kodiak Agüero and José Mena (vocal group on 12) ==Track listing== { cellpadding=\\"1\\" width=\\"500px\\" style=\\"font-size: 85%; border: 1px solid gray;\\" - align=\\"center\\" style=\\"font- size: larger;\\" - style=\\"background:lightblue;\\"  #  Song  Solo(s)  Time -  1  La Novena  Reyes, Mestas, Naranjo  4:20 -  2  Oblación  Flores (bar)  4:46 -  3  La Canción de Livi  Mendoza, Carucí, Livinalli  8:30 -  4  Un Calipso para Isidora  Mestas  4:59 -  5 Keechimbah  Flores (alt), Reyes (ten)  5:12 -  6  Desesperanza/Sueños  Contramaestre, Velásquez, Ortiz, Naranjo  8:35 -  7  Mood Indigo  Contramaestre, Mestas  5:50 -  8  Blues and the Abstract Truth  Flores (alt), Velásquez, Reyes (ten), Mestas  4:48 -  9  Al Sur del Lago  Reyes (ten)  6:05 -  10  The Freak  Flores (alt), Mestas  7:52 -  11  Rancho Central  Flores (alt/bar)  4:23 -  12  María   5:00 -   a]-Fughetta  Fusión IV (a cappella)   -   b]-Traditional chant  Contramaestre; Livinalli, Quintero  Total time  71:17 - } *All songs composed and arranged by Alberto Naranjo, except: **Desesperanza, composed by María Luisa Escobar and arranged by Naranjo ** Mood Indigo, composed by Duke Ellington, Irving Mills and Barney Bigard and arranged by Naranjo; Johnny Hodges' original solo orchestrated by Naranjo ** Blues and the Abstract Truth, composed and arranged by Oliver Nelson and orchestrated by Naranjo ** María (a), composed by Leonardo Silva Beauregard and orchestrated by Naranjo ==Other credits== * Recorded and mixed by Agustín [Augie] Verde at Estudios Intersonido in Caracas, Venezuela * Date of recording: August 1994 * Musical producer: Alberto Naranjo * Executive producers: Roberto Obeso and Federico Pacanins * Graphic design/Illustrations: Luisa F.

Critically acclaimed and considered a landmark film of the Romanian New Wave, it is described as a \\"comedy about corruption and greed and how to get a free meal in fancy restaurants\\". Caranfil, the director, has a cameo appearance as a karaoke singer, singing Frank Sinatra's \\"My Way\\". ==Plot== Ovidiu Gorea is a jaded, mid-40s, high-school teacher and novice writer, still living with his parents. He has just published a collection of short stories called 'Nobody Dies For Free', that the bookstores reject because no one buys it. The high school principal asks him to deal with a problem-student, Robert. Ovidiu has Robert call one of his parents for talks, but the boy sends his sister, Diana, a gorgeous teenager, instead. Ovidiu is smitten. He convinces Diana to go on a date with him, but what he thinks will be a quiet evening over coffee turns into a bar-hopping binge that leaves him nearly broke. One night, he meets a shabby-looking drunk beggar who offers to recite poems in exchange for vodka. The two start talking and Ovidiu learns that the guy makes two or three times more money than him in a month out of this. He asks for an explanation and the beggar refers him to the Filantropica Foundation. Located in a desolate basement, the Filantropica Foundation is actually the lair of Bucharest's beggars' leader, Pavel Puiuţ. A former convict, he realized that begging leads nowhere \\"unless there is a touching story behind the hand that begs\\", so he created an organized network of beggars, each with an invented, tear-jerking, background story that yields millions. Puiuţ listens to Ovidiu's story and thinks he is perfect for his new \\"project\\". He pairs Ovidiu with Miruna, his secretary, and sends them to high-profile restaurants, where, in collusion with a waiter, they pose as a couple of poor teachers celebrating their wedding anniversary who find, at the end of their dinner, that they don't have enough money to cover the check; Ovidiu is responsible with making a scene that would strike a chord with one of the rich people present, who would pick up their check out of pity; later, out in the back, Ovidiu, Miruna and the waiter would split the money. After several such performances, Ovidiu makes enough money to impress the material Diana. He rents a roadster, takes her to lakeshore clubs, his sole purpose being sleeping with her. The reluctant Puiuţ even gives him access to the foundation's \\"show-house\\" (a day- rental house meant to impress third parties), but a poorly timed customer call gives Ovidiu's cover away and an angry Diana leaves him. Meanwhile, Miruna falls for her partner in crime and is angry that he keeps \\"bitching\\" about that \\"bimbo\\", instead of going for a \\"real woman\\". She manages to get him into her bed and Ovidiu is surprised to find out she is a former prostitute. The scam goes terribly wrong when Ovidiu and Miruna go to a karaoke bar, where their scene has no effect and the waiter, who is not in on it, takes Ovidiu to the back and beats him. Puiuţ then unveils the grand purpose of his \\"project\\": he sets the unsuspecting Ovidiu to appear with Miruna \\"in character\\" on a popular TV night show and tell the karaoke bar beating story; he then calls, pretends of being revolted and announces that his foundation has opened an account for people who want to offer money for the \\"poor teachers\\". Meanwhile, in school, Ovidiu is visited by two thugs who ask him about Robert, who owes $3,000 to \\"a person\\" and who only has two days to make good. Ovidiu withdraws the amount from the foundation's account, calls Diana and gives her the money for her brother. She pretends being impressed and teases Ovidiu by telling him to visit her later that night. Naturally, she deceives him once more, by leaving the city in the afternoon. To top it off, Ovidiu finds Robert in a park, turned into a beggar, who tells him that \\"Diana\\" was not his sister, just some \\"chick\\". Now $3,000 short, Ovidiu goes home to find the media and Puiuţ claiming he has just won the big prize in the lottery. It is again one of Puiuţ's scams, who reminds Ovidiu he \\"has him\\" because of the $3,000. Ovidiu accepts his fate and Miruna as his wife. The movie has an ominous ending, with Puiuţ finding Robert in the street, convincing him to join his operation and then breaking the fourth wall: \\"Do you feel pity for this piece of trash? Hah! Got your money!\\". ==Cast== * Mircea Diaconu as Ovidiu Gorea * Gheorghe Dinică as Pavel Puiuţ * Mara Nicolescu as Miruna Popescu * Viorica Vodă as Diana Dobrovicescu * Marius Florea Vizante as Bulache * Florin Zamfirescu as Poet of Gara de Nord (North Railway Station in Bucharest) * Constantin Drăgănescu as Mr. Gorea * Monica Ghiuţă as Mrs. Gorea * Florin Călinescu as Himself * Ovidiu Niculescu as Waiter * Valentin Popescu as Recuperator #1 * Liviu Timus as Recuperator #2 ==Reception== Philanthropy, along with the likes of The Death of Mr. Lazarescu (2005), has been cited as a landmark film of the Romanian New Wave.

Invented by famous British rubber engineer Alex Moulton, and first used on the 1962 BMC project ADO16 under designer Alec Issigonis (of Mini fame), later to be launched as the Morris 1100. == Description == The system replaces the separate springs and dampers of a conventional suspension system with integrated, space efficient, fluid filled displacer units which are interconnected between the front and rear wheels on each side of the vehicle. Each displacer unit contains a rubber spring, and damping is achieved by the displaced fluid passing through rubber valves. The displaced fluid passes to the displacer of the paired wheel, thus providing a dynamic interaction between front and rear wheels. When a front wheel encounters a bump fluid is transferred to the corresponding rear displacer then lowers the rear wheel, hence lifting the rear, minimising pitch associated with the bump.Moulton, Alex. (1962). “Hydrolastic Springing”. Automobile Engineer. September 1962 Naturally the reverse occurs when it is a rear wheel that encounters a bump. This effect is particularly good on small cars as their shorter wheelbases are more affected by pitching. However, the key improvement over conventional suspension is that the front/rear interconnection allows the vehicle to be stiffer in roll than in pitch. Hence it is possible to design a compliant suspension - giving a comfortable ride - without suffering a penalty in terms of excessive roll when cornering. In roll, there is no transference of fluid from the displacers, and hence its internal pressure rises. The only \\"give\\" in the suspension occurs because of the inherent flexibility of the rubber springs. These are naturally stiff. In pitch, as described above, fluid is displaced front to rear, and hence the pressure in the system stays effectively the same, and thus the suspension is much more compliant. The design of the displacer units, and the way in which they are mounted means that as the suspension is compressed, the (roughly spherical) displacer deforms, and hence presents a larger area to the mounting plates. The pressure in the system is thus acting over a larger area, and hence applying additional force. This gives the suspension a sharply rising rate even in pitch, so that there is a strong tendency to return to equilibrium. Without this rising rate there would be no effective pitch resistance at all. Cars with Hydrolastic suspension do, however, have a marked tendency to squat under acceleration, and to dive under braking (and for the rear end to sag under heavy loads). This requires clever design of the suspension components to minimise these forces, and to maximise the rising rate characteristic. == Influences == Jon Pressnell suggests in his book that the hydropneumatic suspension of the Citroën DS motivated Issigonis and Moulton, who were at the time of the launch of the DS working on a rubber and fluid suspension system themselves. Pressnell also suggests that the complexity of the Citroën system encouraged Moulton to develop a much simpler system. In a magazine interview for 'CAR' magazine in the late 1980s, Dr Moulton stated that he and Issigonis had also studied the Citroën 2CV in the 1950s, which featured fore/aft interconnected steel springs. They particularly wished to address the comical lack of roll stiffness of that car with the system that they were designing. ==Hydragas== Hydragas is a type of automotive suspension system used in many cars produced by British Leyland and its successor companies. Invented by British automotive engineer Alex Moulton, Hydragas is an evolution of the previous Hydrolastic system. Manufactured under licence by BTR AVS under the Dunlop brand at the historic Holbrook lane site. It was first introduced in 1973 in the Austin Allegro and was later fitted to the 1975 Princess and its successor, the 1982 Austin Ambassador. Both systems attempt to address the ride-handling compromise of car suspension by interconnecting the suspension of the front and rear of the car in some way. Hydragas attempted to perform the same function and advantages as the hydropneumatic system developed by Citroën, but without its attendant complexity. The heart of the system is the displacer units, which are pressurised spheres containing nitrogen gas. These replace the conventional steel springs of a regular suspension design. The means for pressurising the gas in the displacers is done by pre-pressurising a hydraulic fluid, and then connecting the displacer to its neighbour on the other axle. This is unlike the Citroën system, which uses hydraulic fluid continuously pressurised by an engine-driven pump and regulated by a central pressure vessel. Despite early problems (the Allegro version of Hydragas was found seriously wanting), it was gradually developed into an effective and efficient alternative to steel springs on later BL/Rover Group models such as the Austin Metro and MGF. The Metro originally featured independent Hydragas units, with no fore/aft interconnection (the pipework was deleted on cost grounds, against the advice of Moulton). While the Metro was praised for its handling, and offered a significant improvement in ride quality over the Mini, it was criticised for its tendency to pitch and bounce on uneven roads - precisely the characteristics the interconnection was intended to remove. The revised Rover Metro had its suspension interconnected and went on to receive plaudits for the quality of its ride. The Austin Maxi was the only in production car to feature both systems. The Maxi featured 1100 designed Hydrolastic units with the regulator valve fitted with the interconnection pipe. However, in 1978 production of Hydrolastic bottles at Dunlop came to an end and BL modified the Princess Hydragas bottles to fit. This involved fitting a new front subframe design, with a larger diameter horizontal chamber in the subframe. MGF was the last vehicle platform to use this design. The Hydragas system was dropped in favour of conventional suspension by Rover when BTR AVS sought to increase the price of the units substantially. After servicing the spares market for some years a buyer was found and the production line was sold. == Cars == Cars using the Hydrolastic suspension system: * ADO16 Morris / Austin / Wolseley / MG 1100 / 1300, Riley Kestrel / 1300 & Vanden Plas Princess 1100 / 1300 * ADO16 Innocenti IM3 / IM3S / I4 / I5 (IT) * ADO16 Austin Apache / Victoria (ZA/ES) * ADO16 Morris 1500 / Nomad (AU/NZ) * ADO15 Austin / Morris Mini & Wolseley Hornet / Riley Elf (from 1964 to 1971) * ADO17 Austin / Morris 1800 / 2200 & Wolseley 18/85 / Six * ADO17 Austin / Morris Kimberley / Tasman (AU/NZ) * ADO14 Austin Maxi (until March 1978) * ADO61 Austin 3-Litre * Huffaker Indianapolis cars 1964-1969 \\"MG Liquid Suspension Special\\" Cars using the Hydragas suspension system: * ADO67 Austin Allegro & Vanden Plas 1500 / 1750 * ADO71 Austin / Morris / Wolseley 18-22, Princess & Austin Ambassador * ADO14 Austin Maxi (from March 1978 onwards) * ADO88 / LC8 Austin / MG Metro (not interconnected front to rear) & Rover Metro / 100 * MGF == Bicycles == In 1962 Alex Moulton founded the Moulton Bicycle company to build his innovative design for small wheel bicycles. To ensure a safe and comfortable ride whilst using small wheels with high-pressure tyres Moulton fitted his bicycles with rubber suspension units similar to those used on the original Mini. Later 'New Series' Moulton bicycles are fitted with rear suspensions systems marketed as 'Hydrolastic'. These are, in essence, miniaturised versions of the displacers used on Hydrolastic-equipped cars being a rubber cone spring with an internal fluid chamber to provide damping. == External links == *The Hydragas Register - a website helping owners of hydragas and hydrolastic cars to find a garage or individual who can carry out a pump up service in their area. == Notes == Category:Shock absorbers Category:Automotive suspension technologies Category:Automotive technology tradenames ","title":"Hydrolastic"},{"id":"3263524","text":"The Florin was the currency of the British colonies and protectorates of East Africa between 1920 and 1921.

Requiring a portion of agricultural production to be devoted to export crops, it is referred to by Indonesian historians as Tanam Paksa (\\"Enforced Planting\\"). ==Background== Despite increasing returns from the Dutch system of land tax, Dutch finances had been severely affected by the cost of the Java War and Padri Wars. The Belgian Revolution in 1830 and the resulting costs of keeping the Dutch army at a war footing until 1839 brought the Netherlands to the brink of bankruptcy. In 1830, a new governor general, Johannes van den Bosch, was appointed to increase the exploitation of the Dutch East Indies' resources. The Cultivation System was implemented only on land controlled directly by the colonial government, thus exempting the Vorstenlanden [princely states] and the particuliere landerijen [private domains]. ==Implementation== Sorting tobacco leaves in Java during colonial period, in/before 1939. Collecting natural rubbers in plantation in Java. Rubber tree was introduced by the Dutch from South America. The cultivation system was primarily implemented in Java, the center of the colonial state. Instead of land taxes, 20% of village land had to be devoted to government crops for export or, alternatively, peasants had to work in government-owned plantations for 60 days of the year. To allow the enforcement of these policies, Javanese villagers were more formally linked to their villages and were sometimes prevented from traveling freely around the island without permission. As a result of this policy, much of Java became a Dutch plantation. Some remarks while in theory only 20% of land were used as export crop plantation or peasants have to work for 66 days, in practice they used more portions of lands (same sources claim nearly reach 100%) until native populations had little to plant food crops which result famine in many areas and, sometimes, peasants still had to work more than 66 days. To handle and process the cash crops, the Dutch set up a network of local middlemen who profited greatly and so had a vested interest in the system: compradores somewhat like the cottier system in Ireland. It was financed partly by bonds sold to the Dutch themselves and partly by introducing a new copper coinage at about a 2:1 ratio to the old, thereby gaining a massive seigneurage from the depreciation at the expense of the local economy. From Some Notes on Java and its Administration by the Dutch, by Henry Scott Boys, 1892: > 'An ingenious device for increasing the Government profit was devised by > General Van-der Bosch at the same time as he initiated the culture system. > An enormous amount of copper coinage was manufactured in Holland, the > intrinsic value being rather less than half the nominal value. This coinage > was made a legal tender, and the cultivator was paid for his produce in this > copper coin. Thus, as Mr. Money in his work Java; or, How to Manage a > Colony, naively remarks:- \\"The loans, raised in Holland to start the system, > produced an effect in Java equal to double their amount.\\"'From Section 5 of > Some Notes on Java and its Administration by the Dutch , by Henry Scott > Boys, Late Bengal Civil Service, Allahabad, Pioneer Press, 1892 ==Effects== The policy brought the Dutch and their Indonesian allies enormous wealth through export growth, averaging around 14%. It brought the Netherlands back from the brink of bankruptcy and made the Dutch East Indies self- sufficient and profitable extremely quickly. As early as 1831, the policy allowed the Dutch East Indies budget to be balanced, and the surplus revenue was used to pay off debts left over from the defunct VOC régime.1 The cultivation system is linked, however, to famines and epidemics in the 1840s, firstly in Cirebon and then Central Java, as cash crops such as indigo and sugar had to be grown instead of rice. Political pressures in the Netherlands resulting partly from the problems and partly from rent seeking independent merchants who preferred free trade or local preference (see the Henry Scott Boys work cited above) eventually led to the system's abolition (c. 1870) and replacement with free-market Liberal Period in which private enterprise was encouraged. The cultivation system's impact on the standard of living for Javanese people has in recent years been a subject of disagreement. Robert Elson has argued that the cultivation system directly contributed to the impoverishment of Javanese peasants but indirectly improved their standard of living. ==See also== * Dutch East Indies * Max Havelaar ==References== * * ==Further reading== * Category:Dutch East Indies Category:Economic history of Indonesia ","title":"Cultivation System"},{"id":"3263540","text":"Skytturnar is the soundtrack to the Icelandic film directed by Friðrik Þór Friðriksson in 1987.

The name \\"East Auckland\\" is not an official placename, but is in popular use by New Zealanders. It is also used in the names of some organisations and companies. Coverage and connotations of the name are not precisely defined and vary somewhat with the user. The East Auckland area includes some south-eastern suburbs within the boundaries of the old Manukau City and Auckland City, typified by Howick, and including Panmure, Pakuranga, Half Moon Bay, Mount Wellington, Botany Downs and Dannemora. ==Extents== Broadly speaking, East Auckland is the urban area stretching from the Auckland City suburb of Mount Wellington moving south-east past Pakuranga, southwards through to Greenmount, just north of East Tamaki, and also including the more rural Manukau City townships such as Whitford, Beachlands, Maraetai, Brookby, Clevedon, Highland Park, and Bucklands Beach. East Auckland does not include the more southern suburbs such as Ardmore, Flat Bush, Alfriston and Papakura. Panmure forms the boundary and south of Panmure, Ellerslie and Greenlane is considered Auckland City, which have long been known as Auckland's \\"Eastern Suburbs\\" – although this term commonly refers to the more affluent suburbs north of Meadowbank and Glendowie. What was known as the Howick-Pakuranga area greatly expanded from the 1990s, as many new residential subdivisions were developed, and it is this expanded area that is known as East Auckland. The northern boundary is now in the Mt Wellington area to the north of Pakuranga – where the more central Eastern Suburbs end – and essentially incorporates East Tamaki to the south-west. Some of the suburbs, such as Dannemora, contain predominantly new housing. The area also contains the widely-recognized shopping area and mall Botany Town Centre. == References == Category:Geography of Auckland ","title":"East Auckland"},{"id":"3263563","text":"The Clerks of Christ Church are a religious music group from Christ Church, Oxford. It was founded in 2001 in response to a popular demand for a group providing flexible programming for a variety of occasions. Its intention was to perform a total spectrum of vocal music; Sacred music from all eras (particularly Renaissance), and secular music from mediaeval rounds, through to madrigals, folk song arrangements, romantic part songs, spirituals, comic songs and close harmony arrangements of pop songs and the American songbook. The Clerks of Christ Church serves as a welcome opportunity to explore alternative and often neglected areas of the choral repertoire. All members of the group are (or have at some time been) members of Christ Church Cathedral Choir, but have performed with other consorts including The Sixteen, Tenebrae, Huelgas Ensemble, European Voices, The Clerks Group, Cardinall's Musick and The Gabrielli Consort. The Clerks of Christ Church have performed in venues as far apart as Christ Church, Oxford, and Christchurch, New Zealand (where they toured in 2002, 2003 and 2004); as various as Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons (Raymond Blanc's restaurant and hotel) and Dorchester and Douai Abbeys; as well as performing for the memorial service of Lord Jenkins, the Chancellor of the University of Oxford, and in the presence of The Rt. Hon. Tony Blair M.P. In July 2004 The Clerks of Christ Church made their film debut in Sir Richard Eyre's Stage Beauty, starring Billy Crudup and Claire Danes. The group's debut disc, In Pace, was released in 2004. The Clerks of Christ Church have now signed exclusively for SOMM Records. A Garland of the Elizabethan is their first disc since signing, and will be followed by a disc celebrating the quincentenary of Thomas Tallis' birth, the music being Tallis' contribution to the 1575 publication Cantiones Sacrae. ==External links== *The Clerks of Christ Church official website Category:English choirs Category:Musical groups established in 2001 Category:2001 establishments in England ","title":"The Clerks of Christ Church"},{"id":"3263573","text":"Kostomuksha (; ; ) is a town in the northwest of the Republic of Karelia, Russia, located from the border with Finland, on the shore of Lake Kontoki. Population: ==Geography== The nearest large cities in Russia are St. Petersburg and Petrozavodsk, which are connected to Kostomuksha by rail. The nearest towns in Finland are Kuhmo and Kajaani. ==History== It was established in 1977 as an urban-type settlement and populated by people from various regions of the Northwestern Soviet Union. It was mostly built by Finnish building companies, according to an agreement between the Soviet and Finnish governments. Town status was granted to it in 1983. The town was later expanded by Soviet building companies but maintaining plenty of green areas. ==Administrative and municipal status== Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with six rural localities, incorporated as the town of republic significance of Kostomuksha—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Law #871-ZRK As a municipal division, the town of republic significance of Kostomuksha is incorporated as Kostomukshsky Urban Okrug.Law #824-ZRK ==Economy== The iron ore refinery (JSC Karelsky Okatysh mine) operates the Kostomuksha mine and employs approximately five thousand people and associated mining has left a huge hole near the factory. Wiring harness (\\"AEK\\" LLC) and electronics (\\"Electrokos\\" LLC) factories are part of Finnish company PKC Group Oyj. Other important industries include timber and furniture making. A wood processing complex being developed by Swedwood (an industrial group within IKEA) will include a sawmill, chip-board and furniture factory. There is also a railway station, an airport (with no regular flights), and a federal road. ==Nature== There is a large national park near the town with a reindeer population and a beaver population of Canadian origin, which were introduced in Finland and have migrated over into Russian territory. Part of the national park extends into Finnish territory. Tourism and recreational activities within the national park are subject to authorization. Learn more at http://kost-zap.ru. ==Culture and recreation== Every summer there is a chamber music festival to which musicians, orchestras and theater groups come from Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other parts of Russia. In summer, the town enjoys more than two months of uninterrupted sunlight and many inhabitants spend time at their dachas, typically situated on the banks of one of the many lakes in the vicinity, which also attract anglers due to their large fish populations. As in Finland, saunas are very popular. In winter, skiing and biathlon are popular.

The forms are present because they use the present tense of the auxiliary verb have, and perfect because they use that auxiliary in combination with the past participle of the main verb. (Other perfect constructions also exist, such as the past perfect: \\"I had eaten.\\") Analogous forms are found in some other languages, and they may also be described as present perfect; they often have other names such as the German Perfekt, the French passé composé and the Italian passato prossimo. They may also have different ranges of usage: in all three of the languages just mentioned, the forms in question serve as a general past tense, at least for completed actions. In English, completed actions in many contexts are referred to using the simple past verb form rather than the present perfect. English also has a present perfect continuous (or present perfect progressive) form, which combines present tense with both perfect aspect and continuous (progressive) aspect: \\"I have been eating\\". The action is not necessarily complete; and the same is true of certain uses of the basic present perfect when the verb expresses a state or a habitual action: \\"I have lived here for five years.\\" ==Auxiliaries== In modern English, the auxiliary verb used to form the present perfect is always to have. A typical present perfect clause thus consists of the subject, the auxiliary have/has, and the past participle (third form) of main verb. Examples: *I have done so much in my life. *You have gone to school. *He has already arrived in America. *He has had child after child... (The Mask of Anarchy, Percy Shelley) *Lovely tales that we have heard or read... (Endymion, John Keats) Early Modern English used both to have and to be as perfect auxiliaries. The usage differs in that to have expressed emphasis in the process of the action that was completed, whereas to be put the emphasis in the final state after the action is completed. Examples of the second can be found in older texts: *Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you. (The Tragedy of Coriolanus, Shakespeare) *Vext the dim sea: I am become a name... (Ulysses, Tennyson) *I am become Time, destroyer of worlds. (Bhagavad Gita) *Pillars are fallen at thy feet... (Marius amid the Ruins of Carthage, Lydia Maria Child) *I am come in sorrow. (Lord Jim, Conrad) *I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not (John 5:43, The Bible) In many other European languages, the equivalent of to have (e.g. German haben, French avoir, Italian avere) is used to form the present perfect (or their equivalent of the present perfect) for most or all verbs. However, the equivalent of to be (e.g. German sein, French être, Italian essere) serves as the auxiliary for other verbs in some languages, such as German, Dutch, Danish (but not Swedish or Norwegian), French, and Italian (but not Spanish or Portuguese). Generally, the verbs that take to be as an auxiliary are intransitive verbs denoting motion or change of state (e.g. to arrive, to go, to fall). For more details, see Perfect construction with auxiliaries. ==English== The present perfect in English is used chiefly for completed past actions or events when it is understood that it is the present result of the events that is focused upon, rather than the moment of completion. No particular past time frame is specified for the action/event. When a past time frame (a point of time in the past, or period of time which ended in the past) is specified for the event, explicitly or implicitly, the simple past is used rather than the present perfect. The tense may be said to be a sort of mixture of present and past. It always implies a strong connection with the present and is used chiefly in conversations, letters, newspapers and TV and radio reports. It can also be used for ongoing or habitual situations continuing up to the present time (generally not completed, but the present time may be the moment of completion). That usage describes for how long or since when something has been the case, normally based on time expressions with \\"for\\" or \\"since\\" (such as for two years, since 1995). Then, the present perfect continuous form is often used, if a continuing action is being described. For examples, see as well as the sections of that article relating to the simple past, present perfect continuous, and other perfect forms. ==German== Modern German has lost its perfect aspect in the present tense. The present perfect form implies the perfective aspect and colloquially usually replaces the simple past (except in the verb sein \\"to be\\"), but the simple past still is frequently used in non- colloquial and/or narrative registers. The present perfect form is often called in German the \\"conversational past\\" while the simple past is often called the \\"narrative past\\". In Standard German, the sein-vs-haben distinction includes the intransitive-+-motion idea for sein (\\"to be\\") usage but is independent of the reflexive-voice difference when forming the Perfekt. *Ich habe gegessen (I have eaten) *Du bist gekommen (You have come, literally you are come.) *Sie sind gefallen (They have fallen, literally they are fallen.) *Sie ist geschwommen (She has swum, literally, she is swum.) *Du hast dich beeilt (You have hurried, literally You have yourself hurried) ==French== French has no present perfect aspect. However, it has a grammatical form that is constructed in the same way as is the present perfect in English, Spanish, and Portuguese by using a conjugated form of (usually) avoir \\"to have\\" plus a past participle. The term passé composé (literally \\"compound past\\") is the standard name for this form, which has perfective aspect rather than perfect aspect. The French simple past form, which also conveys perfective aspect, is analogous to the German simple past in that it has been largely displaced by the compound past and relegated to narrative usage. In standard French, a verb that is used reflexively takes être (\\"to be\\") rather than avoir (\\"to have\\") as auxiliary in compound past tenses (passé composé, plus-que-parfait, passé antérieur, futur antérieur). In addition, a small set of about 20 non- reflexive verbs also use être as auxiliary (some students memorize these using the acrostic mnemonic \\"DR & MRS VAN DER TRAMP\\"). *J'ai mangé (I have eaten) *Tu es venu(e) (You have come, literally you are come.) *Nous sommes arrivé(e)s (We have arrived, literally we are arrived.) *Vous vous êtes levé(e)(s) (You have got up, reflexive verb, literally you have raised yourself/selves) ==Spanish== The Spanish present perfect form conveys a true perfect aspect. Standard Spanish is like modern English in that haber is always the auxiliary regardless of the reflexive voice and regardless of the verb in question: I have eaten (Yo he comido) They have gone (Ellos han ido) He has played (Él ha jugado) Spanish differs from French, German, and English in that its have word, haber, serves only as auxiliary in the modern language; it does not denote possession, which is handled by the verb tener. In some forms of Spanish, such as the Rio Platense Spanish spoken in Argentina and Uruguay, the present perfect is rarely used: the simple past replaces it. In Castilian Spanish, however, the present perfect is normal when talking about events that occur \\"today\\". For example, to refer to \\"this morning\\", one would say, Me he levantado tarde y no me ha dado tiempo de desayunar (I woke up late and did not have time to eat breakfast) rather than Me levanté tarde y no me dio tiempo de desayunar. With no context, listeners from Spain would assume that the latter occurred yesterday or a long time ago. For the same reason, speakers of Castilian Spanish use the present perfect to talk about the immediate past (events having occurred only a few moments ago), such as ¿Qué has dicho? No te he podido oír rather than ¿Qué dijiste? No te pude oír. (What did you say? I couldn't hear you.) ==Portuguese== The Portuguese present perfect form conveys a true perfect aspect. Modern Portuguese differs from Spanish in that the auxiliary used is normally ter (Spanish tener) rather than haver (Spanish haber). Furthermore, the meaning of the present perfect is different from that in Spanish in that it implies an iterative aspect.Comrie, Bernard, Tense, Cambridge Univ. Press, 1985. Eu tenho comido translates \\"I have been eating\\" rather than \\"I have eaten\\". (However, other tenses are still as in Spanish: eu tinha comido means \\"I had eaten\\" in modern Portuguese, like Spanish yo había comido.) The perfect aspect may be indicated lexically by using the simple past form of the verb, preceded by \\"já\\" (already): Eu já comi (Lit: \\"I already ate\\") connotes \\"I have already eaten\\". E.g.: Ele já foi, como sabem, duas vezes candidato ao Prémio Sakharov, que é atribuído anualmente por este Parlamento. He has, as you know, already been nominated twice for the Sakharov Prize, which this Parliament awards each year. ==Etymology== The word \\"perfect\\" in the name comes from a Latin root referring to completion, rather than to perfection in the sense of \\"having no flaws\\". (In fact this \\"flawless\\" sense of perfect evolved by extension from the former sense, because something being created is finished when it no longer has any flaws.) Perfect tenses are named thus because they refer to actions that are finished with respect to the present (or some other time under consideration); for example, \\"I have eaten all the bread\\" refers to an action which is, as of now, completed. However, as seen above, not all uses of present perfect constructions involve an idea of completion. In the grammar of languages such as Latin and Ancient Greek, the form most closely corresponding to the English \\"present perfect\\" is known simply as the perfect.

The next year, Ape Escape 2 was developed by Sony and published in Japan in 2002 and in Europe and North America in 2003. In 2003, SCEI confirmed to be working on a multiplayer party game and the sequel to Piposaru 2001. There was also confirmation that the original Ape Escape was to be ported to the PlayStation Portable. Ape Escape: Pumped & Primed was released in Japan through Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. and the US through Ubisoft in 2004. Ape Escape: On the Loose was then released globally as one of the launch games for the PlayStation Portable. In 2005, Ape Academy (also known as Ape Escape Academy) was released for the PlayStation Portable. Eye Toy: Monkey Mania was a party game inspired by Mario Party which was only released in Europe and Japan. In mid-2005, Ape Escape 3 was released to positive critical reception. After the release of Ape Escape 3, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe showed interest in publishing Ape Academy 2 and Ape Escape: Million Monkeys; however, Sony Computer Entertainment America showed more interest in developing its own game. Ape Academy 2 was released in 2006 for the PlayStation Portable to mixed success and sold very well in Japan, entering the \\"Best of\\" category, but failed to perform well in Europe, due to Sony focusing on Million Monkeys. Million Monkeys was released in Japan in July 2006, making it the last official PlayStation 2 game in the series. The game was planned to be released in the United Kingdom in late 2006, but the game was postponed and later canceled. Its impact in Japan led to the inclusion of this incarnation of Spike in PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale in 2012. In late 2006, PipoRacer was released in Japan for PlayStation Portable. In 2008, Japan Studio and h.a.n.d. developed Ape Escape: SaruSaru Big Mission. It was never released outside Japan. In 2006, Sony placed an advertisement in a Famitsu magazine with interest in hiring staff for an upcoming game. It contains a picture with four monkeys, with the first holding up Ape Escape, the second holding up Ape Escape 2, the third holding up Ape Escape 3 and the fourth holding a cover with \\"?\\".

Ape Quest was released in 2008 to the US PSN store, and was the first game to be developed by Sony Computer Entertainment America. It was published by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe in May 2008 and was released in March 2009 in Japan. It was the first game in the series to be a PSN-only game, excluding Asia, where it received a physical release. In 2009, a game titled Ape Escape was announced along with the PlayStation Move. Critics speculated that it was the fourth entry in the series, after Sony's 2006 advertisement. In Q3 2010, PlayStation Move: Ape Escape was officially announced under the party genre, and with a different name for every region. It was released in Japan in December 2010, Asia in January 2011, and the UK and Europe in mid-2012. In the US, the game was only made available on the PSN store. After the release of PlayStation Move: Ape Escape, no games were announced in 2012, making it the first year since 2002 that no Ape Escape game had been released and the first year that no game had been announced within each region. ==Games== ===Main series=== * Ape Escape (PlayStation) - May 1999 * Ape Escape 2 (PlayStation 2) - July 2002 * Ape Escape: On the Loose (PlayStation Portable) - March 2005 * Ape Escape 3 (PlayStation 2) - July 2005 ===Spin-offs=== * Ape Escape 2001 (PS2) (Japan only) - July 2001 * Ape Escape Million Monkeys (PS2) (Japan only) - July 2006 * Ape Escape Racing (PSP) (Japan only) - December 2006 * Ape Escape SaruSaru Big Mission (PSP) (Japan only) - July 2007 * Ape Quest (PSP) (released in North America & Europe exclusively on the PlayStation Store and a UMD in Japan only) - January 2008 ===Party games=== * Ape Escape: Pumped & Primed (PS2) (Japan & North America only) - July 2004 * EyeToy: Monkey Mania (PS2) (Japan & Europe only) - August 2004 * Ape Escape Academy (PSP) - December 2004 * Ape Academy 2 (PSP) (Japan & Europe only) - December 2005 * PlayStation Move Ape Escape (PlayStation 3) - December 2010 ===Guest appearances=== * Monster Rancher 4 * Everybody's Golf 4 * Ratchet & Clank * Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater * LittleBigPlanet * PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale (Spike is a playable character, in his \\"Million Monkey\\" version) * Super Bomberman R: Shiny Edition ==Story== === Main series === A white- haired monkey named Specter obtains a helmet known as the Peak Point Helmet (Pipo Helmet for short), which boosts his intelligence. After equipping an army of monkeys with Pipo Helmets, and using an enhanced helmet for himself, Specter sends his monkey army to take over the world, and Space. The protagonists, equipped with various gadgets, must capture the monkeys and restore order to the world.Ape Escape, Ape Escape 2, Ape Escape 3 Game Booklets ===Alternate series=== The alternate series, developed by SCEI, is the alternate main series. Specter and the Monkeys take over the world, or try to sabotage players in \\"Pumped and Primed\\". In both games, Specter does not end up being the main villain and there are usually darker forces behind Specter that you will have to defeat. The villains change from game to game. It is up to the game's protagonists, equipped with various gadgets, to capture or defeat monkeys/characters, to save the day.Ape Escape: Pumped and Primed, Ape Escape: Million Monkeys Game Booklets ==Gameplay== The Ape Escape series is notable for its radical departure from the tried-and-true control method in many other games. It was the first PlayStation game to require the use of a DualShock or Dual Analog controller; the left stick moves the character while the right operates whatever gadget the player has in his/her possession. Again, unlike many games which use Image:PlayStationX.svg to jump, both the R1 and R2 buttons are used, while the 'shape' buttons are used to cycle through the available items in the inventory. In the PSP spin-offs, a more conventional control scheme must be used, due to the lack of a right analog stick. The main objective through the majority of the games is to use your available array of gadgets to locate and capture monkeys. When a monkey has been found, he needs to be caught with the Time Net gadget. On the first playthrough, players will have a set number of monkeys to catch before progressing towards the next level. Once each level has been completed, they can be reentered with the gadgets necessary to catch the remaining monkeys. ===Minigames=== In the main series, there are three unlockable minigames that can be played at the hub. These can be accessed by clearing the necessary number of stages and/or having the necessary amount of coins. In Ape Escape and Ape Escape: On the Loose, you had to collect a certain amount of Specter Tokens to unlock a minigame. In Ape Escape 2, you could obtain these three minigames by betting ten coins in the Gotcha Box, but here the stage-clearing was much more vital, yet it did not mean it would be based on your percentage on your record. In Ape Escape 3, because coins were far more abundant than Ape Escape 2 and the fact that you could hold coins past 999, the prices went up for the mini-games as well. Another thing is that this time it was based on your percentage, so clearing stages, beating time attacks, or purchasing things from the shops would get you faster to making the mini games become available to purchase. The minigame Mesal Gear Solid seems fuller and more of a game of its own rather than just a simple unlockable. This game has a plot and more traditional gameplay of the AE series, and could be the start of more fuller minigames based on a series already established, like Metal Gear Solid. In Ape Quest, the player randomly encounters mini-games in a very similar fashion to classic JRPG random enemy encounters. ==Other media== ===Television=== * Ape Escape (Japanese TV series): a 2002 series of computer- generated anime shorts for Tokyo TV * Ape Escape (American TV series): a 2009 series of animated shorts created by American studio Frederator Studios for Nicktoons * Saru Get You -On Air-: a 2006 Japanese anime television series based on the franchise ===Manga=== * CoroCoro comics, monthly manga magazine == See also == == Notes == ==References== ==External links== * Official Japanese site Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment franchises Category:Video game franchises Category:Video game franchises introduced in 1999 ","title":"Ape Escape"},{"id":"3263601","text":"Mjóifjörður is a village of 11 people in East Iceland, sitting on a fjord of the same name (meaning Narrow Fjord).

Throughout her early youth, she was educated at home by a governess, under the Parents' National Educational Union System. She then attended St Mary's School in Wantage, Berkshire, and Trinity College, Dublin, graduating with a Master of Arts degree. After graduating in 1964, she worked as an editorial trainee with The Lady magazine. Continuing with her passion for writing, in 1965, she was appointed Executive Editor for a weekly monograph called The Masters. Following this, she conceived, edited and produced another weekly magazine, Discovering Antiques, for which she formed her own production company, Harriet Bridgeman Ltd. The many books written, edited, and co-authored by her include The Encyclopaedia of Victoriana and The British Eccentric. In 1966, she married Robin Bridgeman, the third Viscount of that name, producing a family of four sons, including Luke Bridgeman, heir apparent to the patrilineal title. ==Bridgeman Library== During her time as an editor and author, Bridgeman discovered the need for easier access to illustrations of works of art. There was no central and convenient way to obtain colour transparencies or black-and-white prints other than by going from museum to museum. The concept of the Bridgeman Art Library emerged in 1972 and developed to allow users to access thousands of images at the same time providing extra income for the museums, collections, artists and institutions which it represents. The library now has offices in Germany, France, Italy, England, and the United States and Lady Bridgeman continues to travel internationally in order to support the development of collections and the access to arts generally. In addition to running the Library, Bridgeman was a founder member of BAPLA British Association of Picture Libraries and Agencies and has chaired their executive committee with special responsibility for copyright. She compiled their first publication on the standardisation of terms in use in the picture industry. She also represents The Artists' Collecting Society CIC on the British Copyright Council (BCC), was a Trustee of the British Sporting Art Trust and the Imperial College Healthcare Charity, and is a member of the Intellectual Property Advisory Committee (IPAC) and a Director of the International Catalogue Raisonné Association (ICRA). She also sits on the council of the Artists' General Benevolence Institution. ==Awards== CBE ribbon In 1997, Bridgeman was awarded the European Women of Achievement Award in the Arts. The award was given in recognition of the Bridgeman Art Library’s promotion of European culture and the European scope of its clients, collections and research. In 2005, she was voted the International Business Woman of the Year by the judges of the International Business Awards. She has been given funding for three research projects within the arts by the European Union. In 2006, she founded a Community Interest Company, the Artists' Collecting Society to collect Artists’ Resale Right (Droit de Suite) on behalf of UK-based artists which includes, amongst its many members, Frank Auerbach and the estates of Lucian Freud, Barbara Hepworth, and Howard Hodgkin. Lady Bridgeman was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2014 New Year Honours for her \\"services to art\\". ==References== * ==External links== * Q&A; with Harriet Bridgeman Art of England, July 2012 (copy at bridgemanimages.com) * Catherine Gaffney: Picture perfect: a profile of Lady Harriet Bridgeman.

He is perhaps most famous outside Italy for his roles in four Spaghetti Western films: Ramón Rojo and El Indio in Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars (1964) and For a Few Dollars More (1965), El Chuncho Munoz in Damiano Damiani's A Bullet for the General (1966) and Professor Brad Fletcher in Sergio Sollima's Face to Face (1967). In Italy and much of Europe, he was notable for his roles in high-profile social dramas depicting the political and social stirrings of Italian and European society in the 1960s and 1970s, including four films directed by Elio Petri – We Still Kill the Old Way (1967), Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion (1970), The Working Class Goes to Heaven (1971) and Todo modo (1976). He is also recognized for his performances in Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Cercle Rouge (1970), Giuliano Montaldo's Sacco & Vanzetti (1971) and Francesco Rosi's Christ Stopped at Eboli (1979). == Early life == Volonté was born in Milan but grew up in Turin. His father Mario was a fascist officer from Saronno (province of Varese), who in 1944 was in command of the Brigata Nera of Chivasso, near Turin. His mother, Carolina Bianchi, belonged to a wealthy Milanese industrial family and his younger brother Claudio was an actor as well. He went to Rome to train for an acting career at the Accademia Nazionale di Arte Drammatica Silvio D'Amico, which he left in 1957. He had a brief career in television and acting in Shakespeare and Goldoni plays on the stage, before establishing his film career. == Career == Volonté made his debut in 1960 in Sotto dieci bandiere, directed by Duilio Coletti. Just four years later, he played \\"Ramón Rojo\\" in A Fistful of Dollars (1964), and \\"El Indio\\" in For a Few Dollars More (1965), both for cash reasons as he did not consider either role serious. Both films were directed by the then-unknown Sergio Leone, and Volonté's roles in them would bring him his greatest recognition from American audiences. He played Carlo Levi in Christ Stopped at Eboli (1979), which was based on Levi's autobiographical account of his years in internal-exile in Aliano, south Italy, in the 1930s. Volonté played the memorable role of the Bandito-turned-guerrilla, El Chuncho, in A Bullet for the General (1966). Volonté's performances as memorable but neurotic characters, or as a gifted leader of brigands or revolutionaries, together with the unexpected, worldwide success of the films, gave him international fame. Volonté had already played comedies, including A cavallo della tigre (1961), by Luigi Comencini, and confirmed his versatility in L'armata Brancaleone (1966). However, he found his main dimension in dramatic roles for Banditi a Milano (1968), by Carlo Lizzani, Sbatti il mostro in prima pagina (1972) by Marco Bellocchio, La Classe operaia va in paradiso (1972) by his friend Elio Petri and Il sospetto (1975) by Francesco Maselli. Homage to Gian Maria Volonté (seen in his role as Carlo Levi in Christ Stopped at Eboli) by Reginald Gray In 1968, Volonté won a Silver Ribbon as best actor for A ciascuno il suo, also directed by Elio Petri. Volonté received the same award for two other performances: Petri's Indagine su un cittadino al di sopra di ogni sospetto (1971, winner of an Academy Award as best foreign film), considered by many to be his finest; and in The Abyss (1989). In 1983 he won the award for Best Actor at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival for La Mort de Mario Ricci. Four years later, at the 37th Berlin International Film Festival, he won the Silver Bear for Best Actor for Il caso Moro. 1988 Cannes Film Festival Official Selection, remarkable play as a Renaissance physician in The Abyss by André Delvaux from Marguerite Yourcenar's famous novel. In 1990, Volonté was named Best European Actor for Porte aperte. In 1991, at the Venice Film Festival, he won a Golden Lion for his career as a whole. Volonté played numerous roles outside Italy. == Personal life == Volonté was a strong political activist and known for his pro-Communist leanings. In 1981, he helped Oreste Scalzone to flee from capture in Italy to Denmark. He was the partner of Italian actress Carla Gravina for almost 10 years after they met when they played Romeo and Juliet in a theatre production in 1960. The two had a daughter Giovanna, born in the early 1960s. Actress Angelica Ippolito was his companion from 1977 until his death in 1994. == Death == Volonté died from a heart attackhttps://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/07/obituaries/gian-maria- volonte-dies-at-61-a-prize-winning-italian-actor.html at the age of 61 in 1994 at Florina, Greece, during the filming of Ulysses' Gaze, directed by Theo Angelopoulos. Actor Erland Josephson replaced him in the role.

Because the term \\"feudalism\\" is slightly ambiguous, \\"refeudalization\\" is ambiguous, too. In the modern era, the term \\"refeudalization\\" is used for policies that give special privileges to organized groups such as NGOs. == Refeudalization in 17th-century European historiography == The process of refeudalization is also used in seventeenth- century European historiography. The term was made famous by Italian Marxist historians Ruggiero Romano and Rosario Villari, to illuminate the social conditions behind the Neapolitan Revolt of 1647. The concept was influenced by Gramsci's ideas, the historigraphical debates during the 1950s and 1960s that centered on Eric Hobsbawm's seventeenth century \\"General Crisis\\" as well as 1960s Italian politics. Villari used it quite specifically in reference to the increasing pressure in the six decades preceding the revolt of 1647, in which the peasantry and the lower-middle classes revolted against the feudal aristocracy and international financiers. The process was triggered by the royal state's need for money. The Spanish crown ennobled the bourgeoisie of rich merchants and financiers, who infiltrated and reinforced the noble order. Fernand Braudel found the “clearest case of refeudalization” in Spanish Naples. The monarchy had raised capital by selling feudal titles, which in the long term increased the fiscal burden that the seigneurial regime imposed on the rural poor, since the nobles were exempted from paying taxes to the viceroyal regime. Refeudalization in a more general sense has been used to explain Italy's failed transition to modern capitalism. Though Italy had pioneered the commercial revolution, feudal barons neglected business opportunities to innovate and further rationalize the processes of production. == Refeudalization in Jürgen Habermas's theory of the public sphere == Jürgen Habermas’s theory of the public sphere is based on his research into the bourgeois class of the eighteenth century in Great Britain, France and Germany; his key work on the theme is The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere (1962). Habermas saw space that had been gained for the public around the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries returning to private hands, a process which he called 'the refeudalization [Refeudalisierung] of the public spehere': 'Habermas discussed the pincer-like movement in which late modern consumer capitalism attempts to turn us into unthinking mass consumers on one hand, while political actors, interest groups, and the state try to turn us into unthinking mass citizens on the other'.Jamie Warner, 'The New Refeudalization of the Public Sphere', in The Routledge Companion to Advertising and Promotional Culture, edited by Matthew P. McAllister and Emily West (New York: Routledge, 2013), pp. 285-97 (p. 285). === Habermas's idea of the public sphere === For Habermas, the 'public sphere' is 'a space in which all citizens can critically, substantively, and rationally debate public policy' (though this does not necessarily exist in any single physical space: it can also be constituted, for example, by newspapers). In its ideal form, the public sphere is \\"made up of private people gathered together as a public and articulating the needs of society with the state\\". The public sphere is the source of public opinion needed to \\"legitimate authority in functioning democracy\\". Habermas made a distinction between lifeworld and system. The public sphere is part of the lifeworld and it is the immediate setting of the individual social actor, and Habermas opposed any analysis which uncoupled the interdependence of the lifeworld.Habermas, Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit, Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1962 (1990), p 292. (\\"The Structural Change of The Public Sphere\\"), translation Walter Kastorp (expressly for Wikipedia) Habermas's analysis is based on an oral bias; he believed that the public sphere can be most effectively constituted and maintained through dialogue, acts of speech, debate and discussion. In his further reflections, Habermas claims that public debate can be animated by “opinion-forming associations” which are voluntary associations, social organizations such as from churches, sports clubs, groups of concerned citizens, grassroots movements, trade unions – to counter or refashion the messages of authority. George Cummins, a popular theorist during this period (circa 1970) also shared similar thoughts. Habermas and Cummins often deliberated and engaged in this critical debate at the local German pub at which they smashed 15 pints each. This public sphere began to form first in Britain at the end of the seventeenth century. It resulted in the Licensing Act (1695), which allowed newspapers to print what they want without the Queen’s censorship. However, there were still strict laws. But the sphere is seen as a crucial enabler for this to happen. === Refeudalization of the public sphere === For Habermas, a key feature of the feudal is that small numbers of individuals embodied the public state: a king or similar officer was the realm (what Habermas called 'representative publicity'). Habermas saw the eighteenth-century bourgeois public sphere as a positive contrast to this situation. But in the twentieth century, he perceived the rise of advertising, marketing and 'public relations' trying to manipulate the public and discourage critical thought, and he perceived the state, political parties, and interest groups increasingly using the same approaches to win votes. This is 'refeudalization' because 'the public sphere becomes the court before whose public prestige can be displayed─rather than in which public critical debate is carried on'.Habermas, The Transformation of the Public Sphere, p. 201, quoted by Jamie Warner, 'The New Refeudalization of the Public Sphere', in The Routledge Companion to Advertising and Promotional Culture, edited by Matthew P. McAllister and Emily West (New York: Routledge, 2013), pp. 285-97 (p. 287). \\"Publicity once meant the exposure of political domination before public reasoning; publicity [here Habermas uses the English word] sums up the reactions of a non-binding goodwill. The bourgeois public sphere readopts feudal qualities in proportion to its formation by public relations [in English]: the \\"offering agents\\" display representative expenditure in front of compliant customers. Publicity imitates that aura of personal prestige and preternatural authority which the representative public sphere had once imparted. A \\"refeudalization\\" of the public sphere must be discussed in another, more exact sense. The integration of mass entertainment and advertising, which in the form of public relations already assumes a \\"political\\" character, subjugates namely even the state under its code. Because private companies suggest to their customers in consumer decisions the consciousness of citizens, the state has to \\"appeal to\\" its citizens like consumers. Thus the public use of violence also solicits publicity. Some recent commentators have argued that the politics of twenty-first century America,Jamie Warner, 'The New Refeudalization of the Public Sphere', in The Routledge Companion to Advertising and Promotional Culture, edited by Matthew P. McAllister and Emily West (New York: Routledge, 2013), pp. 285-97.Jamie Warner, 'The Smugglers: The Rationality of Political Satire in the 2014 Elections', PS: Political Science & Politics, 49.1 (January 2016), 48-52. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S104909651500126. and the West more generally,Alain Supiot; The public–private relation in the context of today’s refeudalization, International Journal of Constitutional Law, Volume 11, Issue 1, 1 January 2013, Pages 129–145, https://doi.org/10.1093/icon/mos050 take further the trends observed by Habermas. == Refeudalization in sociology of neoliberal globalization == There is a third context which sociologists, drawing on Habermas, refer to contemporary socio-economic processes in the global economy as refeudalization. The concepts overlap with discussions of neomedievalism. The Swiss sociologist Jean Ziegler uses the German expression \\"Refeudalisierung der Gesellschaft\\" to illuminate the forces behind neoliberal globalization. In his pamphlet \\"The Empire of Shame\\", he criticizes the new system of \\"Refeudalisierung\\" based on scarcity and debt. However, the concept in English is typically translated as the \\"new feudalization\\", which here means the subversion of Enlightenment values (freedom, equality and brotherhood) and the radical privatization of public goods and services.Jean Ziegler, L'empire de la honte (Fayard, 2005), .Jürgen Schutte, 'Was ist: »Refeudalisierung der Gesellschaft\\"?', attacBerlin (26.2.2008). Comparable ideas have been developed by Sighard Neckel.Sighard Neckel, 'Refeudalisierung der Ökonomie: Zum Strukturwandel kapitalistischer Wirtschaft', MPIfG Working Paper 10/6 (Cologne: Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies, July 2010).The historian and Director of CALAS Olaf Kaltmeier extended this approach to include political-cultural dimensions and applied it to Latin America. In doing so, he combines the extreme social polarization of the social structure with the unequal distribution of land in Latin America, spatial segregation in the form of gated communities and shopping centres (often accompanied by retro-colonial architecture), an extractivist economy with accumulation by dispossession, and a duplication of economic power through political power in the form of millionaires who, like Mauricio Macri or Sebastián Pineira, become presidents. == See also == * Neomedievalism == References == Category:Feudalism Category:Globalization Category:Political neologisms ","title":"Refeudalization"},{"id":"3263725","text":"Phillip Lang Crosby (July 13, 1934 – January 13, 2004) was an American actor and singer. He was one of the four sons of Bing Crosby and Dixie Lee; the others were his older brother Gary, his twin brother Dennis, and his younger brother Lindsay. Phillip began his career singing alongside his three brothers and his father. ==Early life and family== Crosby was born at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. He graduated from Bellarmine College Preparatory in San Jose in June 1952 and went on to Washington State College at Pullman with his twin brother Dennis for a three-year animal husbandry course. It was thought for a time that twins might take over the running of their father's ranch in Elko, Nevada. It had been the custom for many years for Bing Crosby to take his sons to the ranch each summer for several weeks before going on to Hayden Lake, Idaho, prior to their return to school. As children, the twins were exposed to show business in a big way and appeared on Bing Crosby's various radio shows with their brothers Gary and Lindsay. When he was 21 in 1955, Phillip inherited $200,000 from his late mother's trust. Phillip began his national service with the Army in 1955 and was posted to West Germany in February 1956 to join his twin. They were part of the 24th Medical Detachment of the 10th Infantry Division at Schweinfurt. After leaving the army, Phillip went into show business. ==Singing career== Phillip had sung with his brothers on their father's radio shows and they participated in a record with Bing in 1950 called \\"A Crosby Christmas\\" which charted at number 22 in the Billboard lists in December, 1950. After leaving the army, Phillip recorded four tracks for UPA-Chevron on July 29, 1958 including \\"Thanks\\" in which his father ad-libbed various comments. Phillip and Dennis had an amusing linking role on the Bing Crosby Show transmitted on ABC- TV on March 2, 1959. When Phillip's younger brother, Lindsay, was released from the Army, the four brothers decided to form a vocal group called The Crosby Brothers. They were featured on the cover of Life on September 15, 1958. An appearance on The Phil Silvers Show on November 14, 1958, followed, and they made their debut as a singing group at Tucson, Arizona in 1959. Moving on to the Chez Paree, Chicago, in June 1959, they earned a good review from Variety which said \\"CROSBY BROS. Chez Paree, Chicago. Songs 58 Mins. Bing Crosby's four sons are launched on the cabaret scene in high style. The frères - Gary, Phillip, Dennis and Lindsay - have a superlative act that is likely to abash those skeptics who surmised the boys would trade merely on the lustrous family name.\\" They continued to perform successfully at locations such as the Sahara in Las Vegas and the El Morocco nightclub in Montreal. However, after one of their performances at El Morocco in December 1959, the boys fought among themselves and Gary Crosby left the group. Phillip, Dennis, and Lindsay continued without Gary and they were given useful exposure on the Bing Crosby Show seen on ABC-TV on February 29, 1960. Bing took the place of Gary to sing \\"Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho\\" with his sons, who also sang two other songs themselves. They made their first LP for their father's company, Project Records, in April 1960, which was released by MGM Records and was well received. \\"The Crosby Brothers – Dennis – Philip – Lindsay Crosby (MGM); \\"Dinah\\" (Mills*), a hip version of the oldie, makes a promising disk bow for this trio of Bing Crosby offspring. \\"The Green Grass Grows All Around\\" (Marfran*) is a bright ensemble of this folk tune. To promote the album, the brothers appeared on the I've Got a Secret show and taught the panel how to lip-sync to \\"I Can't Give You Anything but Love.\\" Starting at the Desert Inn in Las Vegas and continuing for the next two years, the three men enjoyed useful success as The Crosby Brothers at venues such as the Chi Chi in Palm Springs, The Venetian room at the Fairmont in San Francisco, and the Latin Quarter in New York. During their stay at the Latin Quarter, they appeared on the What's My Line? TV show on May 14, 1961. On television, the Crosby Brothers starred on several high-profile shows such as Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall (twice), The Ed Sullivan Show (four times) and of course the Bing Crosby Show (twice). The Crosby Brothers act folded, however, when Lindsay Crosby had a breakdown in July 1962 in Juarez, Mexico. Lindsay had to be hospitalized for some time. Eventually, Phillip decided to embark on a solo career, and he had parts in several films, as well as one of the Ben Casey episodes. He also guest-starred on The Bob Hope Christmas Special on January 17, 1964. Around this time, Phillip was one of the original investors in a chain of Mexican restaurants and he accepted what was at the time a generous offer to buy him out. The chain went on to become the huge Taco Bell organization and Phillip would have made a fortune if he stayed in. As a singer, he launched his solo act on April 27, 1965, at Hyatt's Backstage Bar in Burlingame, California. Having developed his act, Phillip went to Vietnam with Bob Hope twice to entertain the troops and enjoyed the experience so much that he returned there himself to sing on several occasions. He also appeared on The Bob Hope Vietnam Christmas Show on January 18, 1968, The Hollywood Palace show on March 23, 1968 and April 5, 1969 and The Ed Sullivan Show on June 15, 1969. An opportunity then arose to buy an interest in a night club in Atlanta and he performed there nightly for some years. Phillip gave his final performance at an Elk's Club party in Burbank in 1983. ==Personal life== Crosby was married four times to: # Sandra Jo Drummond, a Las Vegas showgirl (1958–1963); two children, daughter Dixie Lee Crosby and son Brian Patrick Crosby (deceased). # Mary Joyce Gabbard, an airline stewardess (1964–1966); two children, daughter Mary Elizabeth Crosby and son Bing (known as 'Flip') Crosby. # Georgi Edwards, a former Las Vegas showgirl (1967–1969) # Peggy J. Compton, an actress (1972–1975); one son Phillip L. Crosby Jr., (a crooner in Los Angeles who revitalizes some of Bing's old songs). In his later years, Phillip's health was not good and he had problems with his back and knees following a motorcycle accident. In the 1980s, he was arrested several times for drunk driving and, despite 18 months of Alcoholics Anonymous, he told People, \\"I don't drink any more -- but I don't drink any less.\\" Despite a promising start to life, the Crosby brothers were clearly overwhelmed by their emotional problems, which resulted in heavy drinking. Their mother died from ovarian cancer in 1952, but her health was not helped by acute alcoholism. Phillip's twin Dennis and his younger brother Lindsay committed suicide with shotguns, in their 50s. Gary died from lung cancer in August 1995, aged 62. Gary Crosby wrote a book called Going My Own Way alleging emotional and physical abuse by his father. Phillip did not accept this and he gave an interview to Neil Blincow of The Globe in 1999 stating: \\"My dad was not the monster my lying brother said he was, he was strict, but my father never beat us black and blue and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond memories of dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. . . He [Gary] knew it [the book Going My Own Way] would generate a lot of publicity and that was the only way he could get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. He wrote it out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name was the only way he could do it. My dad took care of us from a very early age with a trust fund. But we blew it all. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. And he loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.\\" ===Political views=== Crosby supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election. ==Death== Crosby died on January 13, 2004, in Woodland Hills, California from a heart attack, aged 69. ==Discography== Presenting the Crosby Brothers (MGM-C-846) SIDE ONE # \\"You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby\\" # \\"Mine\\" (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin) # \\"Limehouse Blues\\" # \\"Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams\\" # \\"Joshua\\" # \\"Mam'selle\\" SIDE TWO # \\"Once in a While\\" # \\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\\" # \\"The Green Grass Grows All Around\\" # \\"Dinah\\" # \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" # \\"Magic Is the Moonlight\\" (María Grever, Charles Pasquale) ==Filmography== * Out of This World (1945) - Himself, Kid in Audience * Duffy's Tavern (1945) - Himself * Screen Snapshots Series 25, No. 10: Famous Fathers and Sons (1946) - Himself * Sergeants 3 (1962) - Cpl.

Carruthers trained at Holland College between 1979–1981 in its Commercial Design Program (later renamed Graphic Design) which he taught full-time for 25 years until he retired in 2017. He also attended Sheridan College in Ontario, taking its Illustration program and took a correspondence course with The Joe Kubert School. == Works == Carruthers first started working in comics at Malibu Graphics and worked on many black and white titles. His biggest success was The Men in Black (comic) (Lowell Cunningham, creator/writer), which he illustrated. The comic later becoming a film, Men in Black. He also worked on Captain Canuck. He worked as the Editorial Cartoonist for the Charlottetown Guardian newspaper. He published a book of his editorial cartoons entitled Sh- It Happened. He has worked on several graphic novels for Graphic Universe, a division of Lerner Publishing Group (Minneapolis, U.S.) including Yu the Great, written by Paul D. Storrie, Sunjata: Warrior King of Mali (a 13th- century West African story), written by Justine and Ron Fontes. He also illustrated three graphic novels in the style of interactive storytelling: Terror in Ghost Mansion (Paul D. Storrie, writer), \\"School of Evil\\" (Marie P. Croall, writer) and \\"Peril at Summerland Park\\" (Paul D. Storrie, writer). His other past main work was the webcomic Canadiana, also known as the New Spirit of Canada. Beginning in 2004, it drew heavily on the traditions of the superhero genre, centred on the adventures and personal life of Jennifer Neuwirth. Carruthers is aided in chronicling Canadiana's adventures by penciller Jeff Alward and scripter Mark Shainblum, the latter of whom is known in Canadian comics as a practitioner of superhero genre deconstruction via Northguard and parody via Angloman. The series had resumed regular serialization in January 2007 with the assistance of artist Brenda Hickey, but has since been deactivated. === Current Work === Carruthers was working with the Charlton NEO group: a revival effort to bring back Charlton Comics. His art can be found in Charlton Arrow # 1, 2, and 3 with the reworking of 'SPOOKMAN' (with writer Roger McKenzie and editor Mort Todd), a PD character created by Pat Boyette in 1968. He illustrated 'TRAVEST: Spirit Talker', a western he and Roger McKenzie co-created for Charlton Wild Frontier #1, and a horror story 'Skin in the Game' with writer Paul Kupperberg. He has recently signed up to work with writer Nicola R. White and illustrator Kara Brauen as both colorist and letterer on a 5 issue run of 'Wild Rose', a haunting Irish folktale set against the backdrop of London and rural Ireland in 1790. In September,2018, Carruthers started a new partnership with fellow comic creators Robert Doan and Greg Webster to produce SANDSTONE COMICS PRESENTS, an anthology series published by SANDSTONE COMICS. This series will be launched in March 2019, and will be produced on a bi-annual basis. == References == ==External links== *Sandy Carruthers official site, with some of his work.

The group later expanded to present larger-scale works, and was renamed the English Music Theatre Company. The organisation produced its last opera and ceased to run in 1980. ==English Opera Group== Fleeing internal politics at Sadler's Wells Opera at the end of 1945, Britten and singers Joan Cross, Anne Wood, and Peter Pears joined with designer Piper and producer Crozier to found the English Opera Group.Gilbert, p. 107 The new company's goal was to première Britten's operas, and to present other, mostly British, small-scale operas.Rosenthal, Harold. English Opera Group in Sadie, vol. 2, p. 52 The company's first project was to première Britten's chamber opera Albert Herring and give further performances of his opera The Rape of Lucretia during a tour of British and continental European venues. It also commissioned and premièred a new piece by Lennox Berkeley, a setting of the Stabat Mater. Despite heavy subsidies, however, the costs of touring could not be recouped, so Britten and the group's other directors decided that it should be based at a home venue. This was the prime reason for the inauguration of the Aldeburgh Festival in 1948.Britten-Pears Foundation. The English Opera Group and English Music Theatre Company archive. Accessed 9 June 2011 The first opera commissioned by the group, Brian Easdale's The Sleeping Children, was premièred in 1951.

Aside from other new works by Britten, the group commissioned and produced eleven other new operas by British composers. It also gave the British première of Francis Poulenc's opera Les mamelles de Tirésias in 1958. The group also performed older operas, such as Acis and Galatea, The Beggar's Opera, Idomeneo, Iolanta, La rondine and Trial by Jury, and works by Henry Purcell and Gustav Holst. The Royal Opera, London took over management of the group in 1961. In 1971 Steuart Bedford was appointed musical director, and Colin Graham became director of productions. ==English Music Theatre Company== In 1975 the group was enlarged to be able to produce works such as operettas and musicals in addition to opera. As well as appearing at festivals such as Aldeburgh, the company undertook regional tours and yearly performance seasons at the Sadler's Wells Theatre in London. The founder and leader of the company was Colin Graham. One of their 1976 productions was The Threepenny Opera by Kurt Weill, conducted by the young Simon Rattle.In the same season the company also presented Paul Bunyan, The Turn of the Screw, Cinderella and La finta giardiniera (under the title of Sandrina's Secret), all conducted by Steuart Bedford.

It is the collaborative work of about 160 civilian scholars and scientists, known popularly as the savants, who accompanied Bonaparte's expedition to Egypt in 1798 to 1801 as part of the French Revolutionary Wars, as well as about 2000 artists and technicians, including 400 engravers, who would later compile it into a full work. The full title of the work is Description de l'Égypte, ou Recueil des observations et des recherches qui ont été faites en Égypte pendant l'expédition de l'armée française (English: Description of Egypt, or the collection of observations and researches which were made in Egypt during the expedition of the French Army). The cartographic section, Carte de l'Égypte, had approximately 50 plates of maps, was the first triangulation-based map of Egypt, Syria and Palestine, and was used as the basis for most maps of the region for much of the nineteenth century. ==Summary== Approximately 160 civilian scholars and scientists, known as the savants, many drawn from the Institut de France, collaborated on the Description. Collectively they comprised the Commission des Sciences et Arts d'Égypte. About a third of them would later also become members of the Institut d'Egypte. In late August 1798, on the order of Napoleon also known as N.P., the Institut d'Égypte was founded in the palace of Hassan-Kashif on the outskirts of Cairo, with Gaspard Monge as president.Louis de Laus de Boisy, \\"The Institute of Egypt,\\" Napoleon: Symbol for an Age, A Brief History with Documents, ed. Rafe Blaufarb (New York: Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2008), 45-48. The structure of the institute was based on the Institut de France. The institute housed a library, laboratories, workshops, and the savants' various Egyptian collections. The workshop was particularly important, supplying both the army as well as the savants with necessary equipment. Many new instruments were constructed as well, to replace those lost during the sinking of the French fleet in August 1798 at Aboukir Bay (Battle of the Nile) and the Cairo riot of October 1798. One of the goals of the Institute was to propagate knowledge. To this end, the savants published a journal, La Decade Egyptienne, as well as a newspaper, the Courier de L'Egypte, which disseminated information about the French occupation and the activities of the French army, the Commission des Sciences et Arts d'Égypte, and the Institute itself. Plate 87, \\"Views of Qait Bey Fortress and the Diamant Rock\\", published in the Panckoucke edition of 1821-9 The vision of a single comprehensive publication amalgamating all that the French discovered in Egypt was conceived already in November 1798, when Joseph Fourier was entrusted with the task of uniting the reports from the various disciplines for later publication. When the French army left Egypt in 1801, the savants took with them large quantities of unpublished notes, drawings, and various collections of smaller artefacts that they could smuggle unnoticed past the British. In February 1802, at the instigation of Jean Antoine Chaptal, the French Minister of the Interior, and by decree of Napoleon, a commission was established to manage the preparation of the large amount of data for a single publication. The final work would draw data from the already-published journal La Decade, the newspaper Courier de L'Égypte, the four-volume Mémoires sur l'Égypte (published 1798-1801) and an abundance of notes and illustrations from the various scholars and scientists. The huge volume of information to be published meant adopting an apparently haphazard modus operandi: when sufficiently many plates or text on a particular subject were ready, the information was published. Despite this, publication of the first edition took over 20 years. The first test volumes of engravings were presented to Napoleon in January 1808. Initially published by order of the emperor (Napoleon le Grand), successive volumes would be published by order of the king, and the last simply by order of the government. A second edition (known as the Panckoucke edition) was published by Charles Louis Fleury Panckoucke. The text was expanded in more volumes and printed in a smaller format, new pulls were taken from the plates, and these were bound with many of the large format plates folded in the smaller format volumes. ==Description== Murad Bey by Dutertre in Description de l'Egypte, 1809. The typographical quality of the texts, the beauty of engravings, and the unusual formats (the Mammutfolio is 1m x 0.81m) makes Description de l'Égypte an exceptional work. The first edition usually consists of nine volumes of text, one volume with description of the plates and ten volumes of plates. Two additional volumes in Mammut size (also called Elephant plates) contain plates from Antiquites and Etat Moderne and finally one volume of map plates (Atlas), making for twenty-three volumes in all. Variants in the number of volumes do exist. The second edition usually consists of thirty-seven volumes, with twenty-four volumes bound in twenty-six books (volume eighteen is a volume split in three books) of text, volume number ten being the description of the plates and ten volumes of plates, plus one volume of maps. The second edition was made at less cost, and is in black and white; the frontispiece, however, is rendered in full color. The ten volumes of plates consists of 894 plates, made from over 3000 drawings, most of them located in Histoire Naturelle volume I and II. Some of these plates contain over 100 individual engravings of flora or fauna on a single plate. 38 of the plates are hand coloured. Some variants of the work may contain a few more plates; example Bernard J. Shapero Rare Books list a 38 volume second edition with 909 plates. ===The plates=== The plates have been republished partly in different works, most notable by \\"Bibliotheque Image\\", Taschen GmbH, and \\"Institut d'Orient\\" in 1988 and a subsequent edition in 1990. All the illustrations from the 10 volumes of plates from first edition are visible as galleries in Commons : ==Influence== expedition of Napoleon, to be used for the report on the Canal between two seas. Description de l'Égypte has been credited with starting the field of Egyptology, although one historian has argued that the general conception and often-repeated idea that this is a unique and unprecedented work is inaccurate.Bednarski, A. (2005) Holding Egypt: tracing the reception of the Description de l'Egypte in nineteenth- century Great Britain. Goldenhouse Publications. p.1-20. == False reports on destruction of the originals == It was incorrectly reported that the original manuscript of the Description de l'Égypte was destroyed in a fire at the Institut d'Égypte (Egyptian Scientific Institute) on December 17, 2011, during clashes between protestors and the military.Napoleon's \\"Description De L'Egypte\\" Lost to Fire Amid ClashesBurning of the Library of l'Institut de l'Egypte In fact, the burnt building's collection had contained a set of the 23-volume first print edition, which was saved without irreparable damage.Premier bilan de l'incendie de l'Institut d'Egypte au Caire, ENSSIB website, 22 December 2011 (french) Furthermore, according to a statement by the country's minister of culture, at least two more complete sets of the same original edition remained in Egypt.Minister: Egypt still has 3 copies of Napoleon's 'Déscription de l'Egypte', in: Egypt Independent, 19 December 2011 The majority of the original manuscript material for the Description resides in Paris' National Archives and National Library. ==Editions== center There appear to be several variants of these editions, especially the first edition, containing one or more extra volumes. For instance, the Lauinger Library exhibition (Georgetown University Library), November 2000 - January 2001, lists a copy of a first edition presented to Bernardino Drovetti, the French consul general in Egypt from 1802–1814 and 1821–1826, as having 29 volumes, while a \\"standard\\" first edition contains 23 (20 plus 3 Mammutfolio). The dates given on the title pages are often considerably earlier than the actual publication date. For example, Book 8, Volume I (Histoire Naturelle) of the first edition has 1809 on the title page, but its accepted publication date is 1826. The geographical volume (which contains maps) was not printed before 1828, even though the volumes are dated 1818 and 1826 respectively. ===First edition (Imperial edition)=== Frontispiece to the first edition *Book 01 (1809), Volume I - Antiquités, Descriptions. *Book 02 (1818), Volume II - Antiquités, Descriptions. *Book 03 (1809), Volume I - Antiquités, Mémoires. *Book 04 (1818), Volume II - Antiquités, Mémoires. *Book 05 (1809), Volume I - Etat Moderne. *Book 06 (1822), Volume II - Etat Moderne. *Book 07 (1822), Volume II - Etat Moderne (2´ Partie). *Book 08 (1809), Volume I - Histoire Naturelle. *Book 09 (1813), Volume II - Histoire Naturelle. *Book 10 (18xx), Volume I - Préface et explication des planches. *Book 11 (1809), Volume I - Planches : Antiquités. *Book 12 (18xx), Volume II - Planches : Antiquités. *Book 13 (18xx), Volume III - Planches : Antiquités. *Book 14 (18xx), Volume IV - Planches : Antiquités. *Book 15 (1822), Volume V - Planches : Antiquités. *Book 16 (1809), Volume I - Planches : Etat Moderne. *Book 17 (1817), Volume II - Planches : Etat Moderne. *Book 18 (1809), Volume I - Planches : Histoire Naturelle. *Book 19 (1809), Volume II - Planches : Histoire Naturelle. *Book 20 (1809), Volume IIbis - Planches : Histoire Naturelle. *Book 21 (18xx), Volume I - Planches : Antiquités.

He was one of the main figures in Galician Rexurdimento movement. He is also remembered as Rosalía de Castro's husband, publisher and main supporter. ==Life== Manuel Murguía was born on 17 May 1833 in Arteixo (A Coruña), in Galicia (Spain). His father was a chemist. Being at A Coruña, a child Manuel Murguía witnessed the liberal insurrection of locals against the central power on 23 April 1846. This happening ended with the execution of the Mártires de Carral (The Martyrs of Carral). It all caused an important ideological impact on Murguía, who wrote about that later on in his article La Voz de Galicia (The Voice of Galicia). Manuel Murguía studied philosophy, and pharmacy (as was his father's wish), at Santiago de Compostela. However, Murguía had a great interest on literature and history, so he finally gave up his studies to work as a writer and researcher. He used to go to Liceo de la Juventud, the cultural center on Santiago, meeting other students and intellectual people, including Eduardo Pondal, Aurelio Aguirre and Rosalía de Castro. On 1 June 1854 Murguía published his first work in Galician language, Nena das Soidades (Girl of Loneliness). He then began working as a freelance writer in journals and magazines, getting a measure of success. With it, up-and-coming Murguía would publish other works like Mi madre Antonia (My mother, Antonia), Los Lirios Blancos (The White Irises) and El Ángel de la Muerte (Angel of Death). He would then become one of the literary promises of his time. Murguía went to Madrid, where he became friends with authors like Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer; he also began a romantic relationship with Rosalía de Castro, whom he married in Madrid on 10 October 1858. From the very beginning, Murguía encouraged de Castro's literary interests and the publishing of her works. Particularly, de Castro's work Cantares Gallegos will be considered the beginning of the Rexurdimento (Galician literature renaissance). After getting a great success, Murguía left his creative job and began a full-time work on historical research and its popularization. He also tried to extend his own political ideas. This is considered a milestone on the Rexurdimento. Once his first daughter was born, Murguía published La Primera Luz (The First Light), a book of school texts about history and geography. The Spanish Ministry of Promotion encouraged to use of this book to teach in Galicia schools. Murguía published important works, including Diccionario de escritores gallegos (Dictionary of Galician writers) in 1862. He then moved to Lugo in 1865, and then he published Historia de Galicia (History of Galicia). Manuel Murguía. He was named Chief of the Arquivo Xeral de Galicia (General Archives of Galicia) in 1870, and fifteen years later he became Cronista Xeral do Reino (Feature Writer of the Kingdom), all the while writing and publishing different works. In 1890, Murguía became the co-editor of La Patria Gallega (Galicia Native Country), a journal which included the first keys of the Galician nationalism. When he was 72 years old, Murguía decided to create an Academy of the Galician Language. He shared his idea with other writers who met on Coruñan book store A Cova Céltica. This Galician Academy became a reality on August 25, 1906. Murguía also wanted to create a dictionary of Galician language, as he felt Galician vocabulary was scarce; he even suggested that his work in Galician could not be greater because of the absence of this dictionary. Murguía died on 2 February 1923 on A Coruña. One hundred years after he published the book Cantares Gallegos, in 1963, the date was commemorated with the Día das Letras Galegas (Galician Literature Day). Since then, May 17 would be dedicated to a different writer in Galician language every year. It was dedicated to Rosalía de Castro on its first installment in 1963. Afterwards, Murguía's work was recognized when the Día das Letras Galegas was dedicated to him in 2000. ==Works== (Not including articles on the gazette of the Real Academia Gallega). ===Books=== * La primera luz, Vigo, Juan Compañel, 1860. * Diccionario de escritores gallegos, Vigo, Juan Compañel, 1862. * De las guerras de Galicia en el siglo XV y de su verdadero carácter, A Coruña, 1861. * Historia de Galicia, T.

Optical proximity correction (OPC) is a photolithography enhancement technique commonly used to compensate for image errors due to diffraction or process effects. The need for OPC is seen mainly in the making of semiconductor devices and is due to the limitations of light to maintain the edge placement integrity of the original design, after processing, into the etched image on the silicon wafer. These projected images appear with irregularities such as line widths that are narrower or wider than designed, these are amenable to compensation by changing the pattern on the photomask used for imaging. Other distortions such as rounded corners are driven by the resolution of the optical imaging tool and are harder to compensate for. Such distortions, if not corrected for, may significantly alter the electrical properties of what was being fabricated. Optical proximity correction corrects these errors by moving edges or adding extra polygons to the pattern written on the photomask. This may be driven by pre-computed look-up tables based on width and spacing between features (known as rule based OPC) or by using compact models to dynamically simulate the final pattern and thereby drive the movement of edges, typically broken into sections, to find the best solution, (this is known as model based OPC). The objective is to reproduce on the semiconductor wafer, as well as possible, the original layout drawn by the designer. The two most visible benefits of OPC are correcting linewidth differences seen between features in regions of different density (e.g., center vs. edge of an array, or nested vs. isolated lines), and line end shortening (e.g., gate overlap on field oxide). For the former case, this may be used together with resolution enhancement technologies such as scattering bars (sub-resolution lines placed adjacent to resolvable lines) together with linewidth adjustments. For the latter case, \\"dog-ear\\" (serif or hammerhead) features may be generated at the line end in the design. OPC has a cost impact on photomask fabrication whereby the mask write time is related to the complexity of the mask and data-files and similarly mask inspection for defects takes longer as the finer edge control requires a smaller spot size. ==Impact of resolution: the k1 factor== The conventional diffraction-limited resolution is given by the Rayleigh criterion as 0.61\\\\lambda/NA, where NA is the numerical aperture and \\\\lambda is the wavelength of the illumination source. It is often common to compare the critical feature width to this value, by defining a parameter, k_1, such that feature width equals k_1\\\\lambda/NA. Nested features with k_1<1 benefit less from OPC than isolated features of the same size. The reason is the spatial frequency spectrum of nested features contains fewer components than isolated features. As the feature pitch decreases, more components are truncated by the numerical aperture, resulting in greater difficulty to affect the pattern in the desired fashion. OPC applied to contact pattern. Due to the edge modification in the mask layout (top), the center contact in the right column is undersized in the wafer printed image (bottom). ==Impact of illumination and spatial coherence== The degree of coherence of the illumination source is determined by the ratio of its angular extent to the numerical aperture. This ratio is often called the partial coherence factor, or \\\\sigma.K. Ronse et al., J. Vac. Sci. and Tech. B, vol. 12, pp. 589-600 (1994). It also affects the pattern quality and hence the application of OPC. The coherence distance in the image plane is given roughly by 0.5\\\\lambda/(\\\\sigma NA).B. E. A. Saleh and M. C. Teich, Fundamentals of Photonics, pp. 364-5 (Wiley, 1991). Two image points separated by more than this distance will effectively be uncorrelated, allowing a simpler OPC application. This distance is in fact close to the Rayleigh criterion for values of \\\\sigma close to 1. A related point is that the use of OPC does not change the illumination requirement. If off-axis illumination is required, OPC cannot be used to switch to on-axis illumination, because for on-axis illumination, imaging information is scattered outside the final aperture when off-axis illumination is needed, preventing any imaging. ==Impact of aberrations== Aberrations in optical projection systems deform wavefronts, or the spectrum or spread of illumination angles, which can affect the depth of focus. While the use of OPC can offer significant benefits to depth of focus, aberrations can more than offset these benefits.A. Kroyan, M. D. Levenson, and F. K. Tittel, Proc. SPIE 3334, 832 (1998). Good depth of focus requires diffracted light traveling at comparable angles with the optical axis, and this requires the appropriate illumination angle.H. J. Levinson, Principles of Lithography (2nd ed.), 2005, pp. 274-276. Assuming the correct illumination angle, OPC can direct more diffracted light along the right angles for a given pitch, but without the correct illumination angle, such angles will not even arise. ==Impact of multiple exposure== As the k_1 factor has been steadily shrinking over the past technology generations, the anticipated requirement of moving to multiple exposure to generate circuit patterns becomes more real. This approach will affect the application of OPC, as one will need to take into account the sum of the image intensities from each exposure. This is the case for the complementary photomask technique,M. E. Kling et al., Proc. SPIE vol. 3679, pp.10-17 (1999) where the images of an alternating-aperture phase-shifting mask and a conventional binary mask are added together. ==Impact of multiple- etch patterning== In contrast to multiple exposure of the same photoresist film, multiple layer patterning entails repeated photoresist coating, deposition, and etching to pattern the same device layer. This gives an opportunity to use looser design rules to pattern the same layer. Depending on the lithography tool used to image at these looser design rules, the OPC will be different. Multiple-etch patterning may become a popular technique for future technology generations. A specific form of multiple-etch patterning, using sidewall sacrificial features, is currently the only demonstrated way of systematically patterning features less than 10 nm.Y-K Choi et al., J. Phys. Chem. B, vol. 107, pp. 3340-3343 (2003). The minimum half-pitch corresponds to the deposited thickness of the sacrificial feature. ==OPC application today== Today, OPC is rarely practiced without the use of commercial packages from electronic design automation (EDA) vendors. Advances in algorithms, modeling techniques and the use of large compute farms has enabled the most critical patterning layers to be corrected overnight, starting from the 130 nm design rules (when model based OPC was first used) J. Stirniman and M. Rieger. Fast proximity correction with zone sampling. Proc. SPIE Vol 2197, pp 294-301, (1994). down to the most advanced designs of today using 32 nm design rules. The number of layers requiring sophisticated OPC has increased with advanced nodes, as previously non-critical layers now require compensation. The use of OPC is not restricted to the low k_1 features which are commonly encountered today, but can be applied to any desired image correction scheme which can be modeled accurately. For example, proximity effect correction in electron beam lithography is included as an automated capability on commercial electron-beam lithography tools. Since many non-lithographic processes exhibit their own proximity effects, e.g., chemical-mechanical polishing or plasma etching, these effects can be mixed in with the original OPC. ===Subresolution assist features (SRAFs)=== Assist feature OPC. The use of assist features match isolated feature images closer to dense feature images, but the assist features may themselves print accidentally. Defocus effect on SRAFs. Defocus can still limit the benefits of assist features, by allowing their printing. Subresolution assist features (SRAFs) are features which are separated from targeted features but assist in their printing, while not being printed themselves. Printing SRAFs are a critical yield detractor and require additional OPC models to determine and remove SRAFs where undesirable printing may occur.K. Kohli et al., Proc. SPIE 10147, 101470O (2017) SRAFs have more pronounced effects on the diffraction spectrum than targeted feature resizing and/or attachments. The requirement to not print constrains their use with low doses only. This could pose issues with stochastic effects.Stochastic Printing of Sub-Resolution Assist Features Hence their main application is to improve depth of focus for isolated features (dense features do not leave enough room for SRAF placement). Since SRAFs redistribute energy toward higher spatial frequencies or diffraction orders, the depth of focus is more dependent on the illumination angle (center of spectrum of spatial frequencies or diffraction orders) as well as the pitch (separation of spatial frequences or diffraction orders). In particular, different SRAFs (position, shape, size) could result in different illumination specifications.L. Pang et al., Proc. SPIE 7520, 75200X (2009).S. Nagahara et al., Proc. SPIE 7640, 76401H (2010). In fact, certain pitches forbid the use of SRAFs for specific illumination angles.X. Shi et al., Proc. SPIE 4689, 985 (2002). Since the pitch is usually predetermined, some illumination angles must be avoided even with the use of SRAF OPC. Generally, though, SRAFs cannot be a complete solution, and can only approach the dense case, not match it.I. Mochi et al., Proc. SPIE 9776, 97761S (2016). ==See also== * Computational lithography * Phase-shift mask ==References== ==External links== *Overview of OPC, with diagrams, by Frank Gennari Category:Lithography (microfabrication) ","title":"Optical proximity correction"},{"id":"3263876","text":"White Cliffs may refer to: * The White Cliffs of Dover in the southeast of the United Kingdom ** \\"(There'll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs of Dover\\", a popular World War II song ** The White Cliffs of Dover (film), a 1944 American film * White Cliffs, New South Wales, an opal-mining town in Australia ** White Cliffs Solar Power Station, the town's main source of electricity between 1982 and 2004 * White Cliffs (Utah), a series of cliffs in southern Utah formed from the Navajo Sandstone formation * White Cliffs, the former summer house of Daniel B.

It is an ionic compound consisting of two anions of gluconate for each zinc(II) cation. Zinc gluconate is a popular form for the delivery of zinc as a dietary supplement providing 14.35% elemental Zinc by weight. Gluconic acid is found naturally, and is industrially made by the fermentation of glucose, typically by Aspergillus niger, but also by other fungi, e.g. Penicillium, or by bacteria, e.g. Acetobacter, Pseudomonas and Gluconobacter. In its pure form, it is a white to off-white powder. It can also be made by electrolytic oxidation, although this is a more expensive process. The advantages are a lower microbiological profile, and a more complete reaction, yielding a product with a longer shelf life. ==Zinc gluconate and the common cold== Zinc gluconate has been used in lozenges for treating the common cold. However, controlled trials with lozenges which include zinc acetate have found it has the greatest effect on the duration of colds. Zinc has also been administered nasally for treating the common cold, but has been reported to cause anosmia in some cases. ==Safety concerns== Instances of anosmia (loss of smell) have been reported with intranasal use of some products containing zinc gluconate. In September 2003, Zicam faced lawsuits from users who claimed that the product, a nasal gel containing zinc gluconate and several inactive ingredients, negatively affected their sense of smell and sometimes taste. Some plaintiffs alleged experiencing a strong and very painful burning sensation when they used the product. Matrixx Initiatives, Inc., the maker of Zicam, responded that only a small number of people had experienced problems and that anosmia can be caused by the common cold itself. In January 2006, 340 lawsuits were settled for $12 million.zicam.vanosteen.com The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers zinc gluconate to be generally recognized as safe (GRAS) when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice, although this does not constitute a finding by the FDA that the substance is a useful dietary supplement. On 16 June 2009 the FDA \\"warned consumers to stop using and discard three zinc-containing Zicam intranasal products. The products may cause a loss of sense of smell. ... FDA is concerned that the loss of sense of smell may be permanent.\\" Matrixx responded that the FDA's allegations were \\"unfounded and misleading\\", citing a lack of evidence from controlled tests that Zicam causes anosmia. In its warning, the FDA stated, \\"This warning does not involve oral zinc tablets and lozenges taken by mouth.

The play consists of five acts, each divided into several scenes. The play had its première in Weimar, Germany on 14 June 1800. The play formed the basis for Donizetti's opera Maria Stuarda (1835). ==Plot summary== Mary Stuart (drawing by Arthur von Ramberg (1859)) Mary Stuart is imprisoned in England — nominally for the murder of her husband Darnley, but actually due to her claim to the throne of England held by Queen Elizabeth I. While Mary's cousin, Elizabeth, hesitates over signing Mary's death sentence, Mary hopes for a reprieve. After Mary finds out that Mortimer (created by Schiller), the nephew of her custodian, is on her side, she entrusts her life to him. Mortimer is supposed to give Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, a letter from Mary, in which she pleads for help. This is a delicate situation, for Leicester seems to support Queen Elizabeth. After numerous requests, Mary finally gains the opportunity to meet Queen Elizabeth (something that, in reality, never happened). This meeting ends in an acrimonious argument, caused by Mary's unwillingness to submit entirely to Elizabeth's wish. The argument leads to the inevitable suspicion that the cause of reprieve will not succeed. To complicate matters further, Mortimer plans to free Mary from the prison by force, a dramatized version of the unsuccessful Babington Plot, but when his attempt is found out, he commits suicide, while the Earl of Leicester uses this convenient suicide to rescue himself from suspicion. Queen Elizabeth eventually persuades herself to sign Mary's death warrant. Elizabeth insists that her only reason for signing is the pressure from her own people to do so. The signed warrant is handed to Queen Elizabeth's undersecretary William Davison without any clear instructions on what to do with it. In the process, Elizabeth transfers the burden of responsibility to him, fully aware that he in turn will hand over the warrant to Lord Burleigh, and thus confirm Mary's death sentence. Burleigh demands the signed document from Davison, who — despite his uncertainty — eventually hands it to him. As a result, Burleigh has Mary executed. The play ends with Elizabeth blaming both Burleigh and Davison for Mary's death (banishing the former from court and having the latter imprisoned in the Tower), Lord Shrewsbury (who pleaded for mercy for Mary throughout the play) resigning his honors and Leicester leaving England for France. Elizabeth is left completely alone as the curtain falls. ==Recent stage history== Queen Elisabeth in the Mary Stuart-play (drawing by Arthur von Ramberg (1859)) The first UK production of Mary Stuart to be staged for the Schiller bicentenary in 2005, was at Derby Playhouse where it ran from 3rd to 26th May. Using Robert David MacDonald's translation, the play was directed by Uzma Hameed and starred Hilary Tones as Elizabeth I and Chloe Angharad as Mary Stuart. The production drew parallels between the danger to Elizabethan England from Catholic Rome and the modern threat of Islamist terrorism, and was described by The Stage as \\"seriously good drama, powerfully staged.\\" Mary Stuart, which holds a place in the opera repertory in Donizetti's version (as Maria Stuarda), can still hold the stage in its original form as demonstrated in its successful production, given in a 2005 run at the Donmar Warehouse. Using Peter Oswald's new translation, it was directed by Phyllida Lloyd and starred Janet McTeer as Mary, Queen of Scots and Harriet Walter as Elizabeth of England. The production transferred to the Apollo Theatre in London's West End, where it also played a sold-out engagement from late 2005 into January 2006. The production opened on Broadway on 30 March 2009 (previews), officially 19 April, for a limited engagement through mid-August. It earned seven Tony Award nominations including Best Revival of a Play. The L.A. Theatre Works of Los Angeles mounted a production of the Peter Oswald translation in 2007 directed by Rosalind Ayres which was recorded on CD () and featured Alex Kingston as Mary, Jill Gascoine as Elizabeth, Martin Jarvis as Burleigh, Simon Templeman as Leicester, Ken Danziger as Paulet, W. Morgan Sheppard as Talbot, Christopher Neame as Davison, Shellagh Cullen as Hanna Kennedy and Seamus Dever as Mortimer. The Faction Theatre Company, as part of a repertory season, staged an adaptation of Mary Stuart at the New Diorama Theatre in London in early 2012. The production was the third Schiller play translated and adapted by Daniel Millar and Mark Leipacher and staged by the company. On 23 September 2012, BBC Radio 3 broadcast a production translated by David Harrower, adapted for radio by Robin Brooks and produced/directed by Gaynor Macfarlane. The cast included Meg Fraser as Mary, Alexandra Mathie as Elizabeth, Matthew Pidgeon as Mortimer, Robin Laing as Leicester, Richard Greenwood as Burleigh and Paul Young as Shrewsbury. Mortimer's on-stage suicide has had its dangers. On 6 December 2008, German actor Daniel Hoevels slit his neck while playing Mortimer in Mary Stuart. His character's suicide scene was to feature a dull knife, which became damaged and was replaced by a sharp one. The Thalia Theater company had requested that the sharp one be dulled too, though this was \\"carelessly\\" disregarded.Associated Press, \\"Actor hurt after fake knife turned out to be real\\" on NBC News, 11 December 2008 The Stratford Shakespeare Festival ran a production in 2013 at the Tom Patterson Theatre with the Peter Oswald translation and directed by Antoni Cimolino. The cast includes Lucy Peacock as Mary, Seana McKenna as Elizabeth, Brian Dennehy as the Earl of Shrewsbury and Geraint Wyn Davies as the Earl of Leicester. The production began its run on 31 May 2013 and was consistently sold out to the point where the production's run was extended for a fourth time, until 19 October. In 2016 Ben Naylor directed his own adaptation of the play at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. An adaptation by Robert Icke opened at London's Almeida Theatre in 2016, starring Juliet Stevenson and Lia Williams. At the beginning of each performance the two leading actors are randomly assigned the roles of Elizabeth I and Mary Stuart by the spinning of a coin.

In fact, the name Zongli Yamen is an abbreviation of its full name, which makes it the bona fide office of foreign affairs. In contemporary English sources, it was also called the \\"Board of Ministers for Foreign Affairs\\"See, e.g. Hart v Van Gumpach (China and Japan) [1873] UKPC 9 (28 January 1873) ==Function in the Qing government== A photographic engraving of the members of the Zongli Yamen in 1894, at the time of the First Sino- Japanese War. Prior to the creation of the Zongli Yamen, Qing foreign relations were conducted by several different agencies, such as the Ministry of Rites and the Lifan Yuan. The Zongli Yamen was the first significant institutional innovation in the central Beijing bureaucracy that the Qing government had made since the Yongzheng Emperor created the nucleus of the Grand Council in 1729. The Zongli Yamen was supervised by a controlling board of five senior officials (initially all Manchus), among whom Prince Gong was the de facto leader. In their discussions on establishing the new agency, Qing officials reiterated that it was only to be a temporary institution, maintained until the current foreign and domestic crisis had passed. The Zongli Yamen had a relatively low formal status in the Qing administrative hierarchy and its members served concurrently in other government agencies, which further weakened its position. Furthermore, the Zongli Yamen was not the sole policy making body in foreign affairs, a prerogative which still rested in the hands of the emperor. While the Zongli Yamen remained an important body for a few decades after its foundation, its influence was soon overshadowed by influential officials such as Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang. Nevertheless, it became the means of communication between the Qing government and the foreign ministers to China in Beijing's legation quarter. The successor to the Bureau of Translators, the Tongwen Guan was set up by the Qing dynasty for translating western languages and subordinated to the Zongli Yamen instead of the Hanlin. In 1873, the Zongli Yamen got into a quarrel with the foreign ministers to China over the protocol that was to be followed at their audience with the Tongzhi Emperor, as the foreign ministers not surprisingly refused to perform the ritual kowtow to the emperor, with an impasse eventually being solved thanks in part to the Japanese ambassador to China, Soejima Taneomi. Similar protocol would be followed in 1891 with the ministers' audience with the Guangxu Emperor. Following the Boxer rebellion, the Qing government was forced to change its foreign service. According to Article XII in the Boxer Protocol 1901, the Zongli Yamen was replaced with a Foreign Office, known at the time as the Waiwubu (), which ranked above the other six boards in the government; \\"as the course of subsequent events made clear, the Waiwubu was as ineffective in the establishment of good relations between China and the outside world as the Zongli Yamen had been.\\"S.

Involved in the Clyde Workers Committee and the anti-war movement during the First World War, after the conflict ended he was part of the Tramp Trust Unlimited, formed by Maclean to propagandise and campaign for a minimum wage and a six-hour day, amongst other socialist policies. He was a member of the British Socialist Party, like Maclean, but chose to join the Communist Party of Great Britain when it was formed in 1920 rather than follow Maclean into the Scottish Workers Republican Party. McShane stated of the SRWP, that they \\"had some queer people that I didn’t like – they had never been to John’s economics classes, they knew nothing about socialism or revolutionary work. Even if I had not joined the Communist Party I could never have joined with that crowd\\". A firm supporter of the Soviet Union, McShane visited Russia in 1932. He was shocked by some of the things he saw there, particularly the working conditions in a coal mine in the Donbas region, which he described as being like something from the previous century. He met a young American journalist who had come to the USSR as a firm supporter, but had become disillusioned, as \\"people kept disappearing...and no-one asked any questions\\". McShane remembered later that his faith in the Soviet Union remained strong, but he had his first doubts after the trip. In the 1930s he became involved with the National Unemployed Workers' Movement and led a number of hunger marches to London. In 1933 McShane lead an NUWM march from Glasgow to Edinburgh which became known as the Scottish Hunger March. The marchers camped out on the streets of Edinburgh for three days, and McShane chronicled this event in a pamphlet that was published and distributed entitled \\"Three Days that Shook Edinburgh\\". In the 1930s, he also fought to ensure that freedom of speech and assembly was allowed on Glasgow Green along with other socialist figures. McShane had a number of disagreements with the Communist Party, particularly over the policy document The British Road to Socialism which he regarded as \\"reformist\\"; ultimately he would leave the Communist Party, but remained a convinced socialist for the remainder of his life. In 1954 he combined with other socialist figures such as Eric Heffer to create a new organisation, the Federation of Marxist Groups. In 1958, after reading Marxism and Freedom by Raya Dunayevskaya he embraced Marxist Humanism. He was also involved in the Amalgamated Engineering Union and was a Scottish correspondent for the Daily Worker. While not involved as a full-time organiser, McShane worked as an engineer, and continued to do engineering work until he retired at 69. His biography, No Mean Fighter was published in 1978. The book is based on transcriptions of tape recordings made at the suggestion of Paul Foot. Richard Kuper and Pluto Press bought the tape recorder that Joan Smith used to make the recordings. She then worked alongside McShane until together they produced the final draft for publication. He died on 12 April 1988. ==Awards== On 21 December 1984, he was awarded the freedom of the City of Glasgow for his services to the Labour and Trade Union movements. ==References== == External links == *Texts by Harry McShane at marxists.org *Additional texts by Harry McShane at marxists.org *Obituary of Harry McShane by Paul Foot *Red Clydeside: a history of the labour movement in Glasgow 1910-1932 *Raymond Challinor on Harry McShane Category:1891 births Category:1988 deaths Category:People from Glasgow Category:Scottish autobiographers Category:British Socialist Party members Category:Communist Party of Great Britain members Category:Scottish communists Category:Scottish engineers Category:Scottish socialists Category:British Marxists Category:20th-century engineers ","title":"Harry McShane"},{"id":"3263913","text":"In a Muslim context, Islamic studies can include all of academia, both originally researched and as defined by the Islamization of knowledge.

The primary task of the 323-member Assembly is to facilitate inter-parliamentary dialogue, an important aspect of the overall effort to meet the challenges of democracy throughout the OSCE area. The Parliamentary Assembly pursues objectives which are stated in the preamble of the Assembly's Rules of Procedure: assess the implementation of OSCE objectives by participating States; discuss subjects addressed during meetings of the Ministerial Council and summit meetings of OSCE Heads of State or Government; develop and promote mechanisms for the prevention and resolution of conflicts; support the strengthening and consolidation of democratic institutions in OSCE participating States; contribute to the development of OSCE institutional structures and of relations and co-operation between existing OSCE institutions. To pursue these objectives, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly employs a variety of means: a Final Declaration and a number of resolutions and recommendations are adopted each year at the Annual Session; committee work addresses important contemporary international issues; different programmes, including an extensive Election Observation Programme, and various seminars, have been designed to develop and strengthen democracy; and delegations are sent on special missions to areas of latent or active crisis. The Parliamentary Assembly was originally established by the 1990 Paris Summit to promote greater involvement in the OSCE by national parliaments of the participating States. By passing resolutions and issuing formal recommendations to the OSCE's governmental side and to parliaments, it aims to pursue the implementation of OSCE objectives by participating States, including through legislative action. ==Parliamentary Committees and Groups== The three General Committees correspond to the three main sections of the Helsinki Final Act: the General Committee on Political Affairs and Security; the General Committee on Economic Affairs, Science, Technology and Environment; and the General Committee on Democracy, Human Rights and Humanitarian Questions. The Standing Committee consists of Heads of National Delegations to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly and the Members of the Bureau. The Standing Committee and the Bureau prepare the work of the Assembly between sessions and ensure the efficient operation of the Assembly. Several other committees and groups address specific issues or areas that can benefit from parliamentary attention. The Standing Committee approved the creation of bodies to work on problems in Belarus and Moldova as well as to address the need for greater transparency and accountability in the OSCE. ==Election Observation== At the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly's Annual Session in Helsinki (1993) the then Chairperson-in-Office, Swedish Foreign Minister Baroness Margaretha af Ugglas, urged parliamentarians to actively participate in election observation and monitoring. In response to this call, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has developed a particularly active programme for observing elections in the OSCE area. More than 5,000 parliamentarians from the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly have observed some 140 elections since 1993, using their experience as elected officials to enhance the credibility and visibility of the OSCE election observation work. ==President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE== OSCE President Ilkka Kanerva (left) with Secretary General Spencer Oliver (right) At each Annual Session the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly elects a president who acts as the highest representative of the Assembly, appoints Special Representatives on topics of concern, recommends to the OSCE Chairman-in- Office leaders of OSCE election observation missions, and presides over meetings of the Assembly. The president is elected for one year and can be re- elected for an additional one-year term. In June 2014 Ilkka Kanerva from Finland was elected the new president of the Parliamentary Assembly. Kanerva is the former foreign minister of Finland who was sacked in 2008 after sending over 200 text messages to Johanna Tukiainen an erotic dancer. Then Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen had said that \\"Kanerva has shown a great lack of judgment ... he doesn't enjoy the full trust which a minister needs,\\". Kanerva initially denied the reports but later claimed the messages were work related. Previously, in 2005, when Kanerva was deputy speaker of the parliament he had been rebuked for sending text messages to two nude models ==Criticism== In 2010 the International Peace Institute called for the OSCE PA to update its election monitoring guidelines and procedures to ensure that its election reporting would be free from bias. The institute also criticized the OSCE PA’s way of conducting its election-monitoring by stating that “Parliamentarians parachuted in to read out headline-grabbing statements undercut the credibility of long-term and constructive election monitoring” International Peace Institute (October 2010). Issue Brief: Reaching the OSCE Summit in Astana pp. 5. In 2010 the Parliamentary Assembly was criticized from within by the Latvian delegation for lacking transparency and democracy. OSCE PA Secretary General Robert Spencer Oliver (b. 1938), who had held the post since the organization's inception in 1992, faced a challenge from the Latvian Artis Pabriks. According to the rules of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly the incumbent could only be replaced with a full consensus minus one vote of the Standing Committee, which comprises 56 heads of delegations. A full consensus minus one vote would therefore require 55 votes. The incumbent Secretary General however only needed a simple majority to be re-appointed. A rule change proposed by Pabriks, would also have required a consensus minus one vote. Pabriks called the rules \\"quite shocking from the perspective of an organization that's monitoring elections\\" In 2004 the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly sent election observers to the US presidential election. The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly’s president at the time was Democratic Congressman Alcee Hastings. Hastings had previously been impeached for corruption by the US Congress. The OSCE faced criticism of partisanship and double standards due to Hastings's past and the fact that the OSCE's mandate was to promote democracy and the values of civil society. ==Presidents, Vice-Presidents and Secretaries General== ==References== ==External links== *OSCE PA Homepage *OSCE PA Twitter account Category:Parliamentary assemblies Category:Politics of Europe ","title":"Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe"},{"id":"3263930","text":"Haile Gerima (born March 4, 1946) is an Ethiopian filmmaker who lives and works in the United States. He is a leading member of the L.A. Rebellion film movement, also known as the Los Angeles School of Black Filmmakers. His films have received wide international acclaim. Since 1975, Haile has been an influential film professor at Howard University in Washington, D.C. He is best known for Sankofa (1993), which won numerous international awards. ==Early life == Haile Gerima was born and raised in Gondar, Ethiopia. His father was a dramatist and playwright, who traveled across the Ethiopian countryside staging local plays. He was an important early influence. He has discussed the unconscious effect representations of colonialism in film had on him as a child: > ...as kids, we tried to act out the things we had seen in the movies. We > used to play cowboys and Indians in the mountains around Gondar...We acted > out the roles of these heroes, identifying with the cowboys conquering the > Indians. We didn't identify with the Indians at all and we never wanted the > Indians to win. Even in Tarzan movies, we would become totally galvanized by > the activities of the hero and follow the story from his point of view, > completely caught up in the structure of the story. Whenever Africans > sneaked up behind Tarzan, we would scream our heads off, trying to warn him > that 'they' were coming\\". Gerima emigrated to the United States in 1968 to study theatre. He enrolled in acting classes at the Goodman School of Drama in Chicago. As he stated to Los Angeles Times: \\"When I was growing up, I wanted to work in theater—it never occurred to me I could be a filmmaker because I was raised on Hollywood movies that pacified me to be subservient. Film making isn't encouraged or supported by the Ethiopian government.\\" He felt limited by theater and was resigned, notes Francoise Pfaff, to \\"subservient roles in Western plays.\\" In 1970, he moved to California to attend the University of California where he earned Bachelor's and Master's of Fine Arts degrees in film. He was part of a generation of new black filmmakers who became known as the Los Angeles School of Black filmmakers, along with Charles Burnett (Killer of Sheep), Jamaa Fanaka (Penitentiary), Ben Caldwell (I and I), Larry Clark and Julie Dash (Daughters of the Dust). ==Film career== ===1970s=== By the time Haile graduated in 1976, he had made four films:Kristine McKenna, Los Angeles Times, \\"Sankofa: a Saga of Slavery Reaches the Big Screen - Movies: Haile Gerima hit a brick wall when trying to finance his story of a Black woman, so he did it himself\\", May 29, 1995. Hour Glass (1972); Child of Resistance (1972); Bush Mama (1976); and Mirt Sost Shi Amit (also known as Harvest: 3,000 Years; 1976) Haile's 1976 Bush Mama is the story of Dorothy and her husband T.C., a discharged Vietnam veteran who anticipated a hero's welcome on his return. He is arrested and imprisoned for a crime he did not commit. Theirs is a world of welfare, perennial unemployment, and despair. It addresses issues of institutionalized racism, police brutality, and poverty; themes that remain pertinent today. For the production of Mirt Sost Shi Amit (Harvest: 3,000 Years)Asrat, H., Abesha.com, \\"H. Asrat’s review of Harvest:3,000 Years on Abesha.Com \\", March 4, 2009 Haile returned to his native Ethiopia. It is an account of a poor peasant family who eke out an existence within a brutal, exploitative, and feudal system of labor. His film Wilmington 10 -- U.S.A. 10,000 (1978) explores racism and the shortcomings of the criminal justice system in the United States by examining the history of the nine black men and one white woman who became known as the Wilmington Ten. ===1980s=== The travails of black urban life in the United States are explored in the two-hour Ashes and Embers (1982), the story of a moody and disillusioned black veteran of the Vietnam War.Maslin, Janet, \\"Movie Review: Ashes and Embers\\", New York Times, November 17, 1982. Haile discusses his movie Ashes and Embers in an interview, \\"presented in collaboration with ARRAY, the rebirth of the African American Film Festival Releasing Movement (AFFRM)\\" at the Schomburg Center. He states that Hollywood has produced an \\"Anglo-Saxon dictatorship and culture housed in the mainstream cinema [that] dictates.\\" Which he responds \\"with responsibility [the filmmakers] have to the language of cinema because [their] language, [their] accent has to come into cinema. [In] African cinema this accent is local Senega, Burkina Faso etc.\\" Haile made these films to honor the struggles of his ancestors and to make names known throughout history. Haile's films show the concept of identity and independence. He wanted to use his work as a critical lens for personal growth and creative development. After Winter: Sterling Brown (1985) is a documentary about the notable black American poet. ===1990s=== Haile is perhaps best known as the writer, producer, and director of Sankofa (1993). This dramatic tale of African resistance to slavery won international acclaim: awarded first prize at the African Film Festival in Milan, Italy; Best Cinematography at Africa's premier Festival of Pan African Countries (FESPACO); and nominated for the Golden Bear at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival. The film presents a brutally realistic portrayal of African slavery. The story is revealed through the eyes of Mona, a modern- day woman who is possessed by spirits and transported to the past as Shola, a house slave on the Lafayette plantation in Louisiana. The savagery and violence of the evil institution are clearly disturbing and go far beyond the safe and conventional images of slavery presented by Hollywood. Some critics panned Haile for excess brutality, but the black community responded positively and enthusiastically. The film was well received and played to full houses for many weeks in major cities. Imperfect Journey (1994), commissioned by the BBC, explores the political and psychic recovery of the Ethiopian people after the political repression or \\"red terror\\" of the military junta of Mengistu Haile Mariam. The filmmaker suggests questions about the direction of the succeeding government and the will of the people in creating institutions guaranteeing their liberation. Adwa: An African Victory (1999) is a documentary drama of the history of the 1896 battle, which concluded the war in which the Ethiopian people united to defeat the Italian army. ===Teza=== Haile's most recent film is Teza (2008). Set in Ethiopia and Germany, the film chronicles the return of an Ethiopian intellectual to his country of birth during the repressive Marxist regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam and the recognition of his own displacement and powerlessness at the dissolution of his people's humanity and social values. After several years spent studying medicine in Germany, Anberber returns to Ethiopia only to find the country of his youth replaced by turmoil. His dream of using his craft to improve the health of Ethiopians is squashed by a military junta that uses scientists for their own political ends. Seeking the comfort of his countryside home, Anberber finds no refuge from violence. The solace that the memories of his youth provide is quickly replaced by the competing forces of military and rebelling factions. Anberber needs to decide whether he wants to bear the strain or piece together a life from the fragments that lie around him. ==Business ventures == He founded a bookstore, cafe and film center, located in 2714 Georgia Avenue, New York, Washington, D.C. It is directly across the street from Howard University. To gain more independence, Haile and his wife Sirikiana Aina (who is also a filmmaker) in 1984 established Mypheduh Films Inc., a distribution company for low-budget, independent films. They relied on this for his film Sankofa. ==Filmography== * 1972 - Hour Glass * 1972 - Child of Resistance * 1976 - Bush Mama * 1976 - Mirt Sost Shi Amit (also known as Harvest: 3,000 Years) * 1978 - Wilmington 10 -- U.S.A. 10,000 * 1982 - Ashes and Embers * 1985 - After Winter: Sterling Brown * 1993 - Sankofa * 1994 - Imperfect Journey * 1999 - Adwa - An African Victory * 2009 - Teza ==Further reading== *Cham, Mbye Baboucar (1984). \\"Art and Ideology in the Work of Sembene Ousmane and Haile Gerima.\\" Présence Africaine: Revue Culturelle du Monde Noir/Cultural Review of the Negro World, vol. 129, no. 1, pp. 79–91. *Alexander, George, and Janet Hill, eds.

'Bing' is a fine boy as a friend, but married he and I just cannot be happy.\\" Within a week, a reconciliation came about. Dixie had gone with a party of friends to Agua Caliente for the weekend. To one of the girls in the crowd, she confided she was not half as angry with Crosby as she was at the parting a week ago. The girl got Crosby on the long- distance telephone and presently he and Dixie were talking to each other. An hour and a half later, Crosby appeared at Agua Caliente, having flown down in an airplane, and all was well again. They had four sons: Gary (1933); twins Phillip and Dennis (1934); and Lindsay (1938). Lindsay and Dennis both committed suicide as adults, Lindsay in 1989 and Dennis in 1991. After the birth of the twins, she made a brief return to show business. Dixie Lee made two appearances on the Shell Chateau radio program in 1935 and she made three more films. Her most notable film is probably Love in Bloom (1935). Her last film was Redheads on Parade, but the reviews were mediocre. She made a couple of records on March 11, 1935, \\"You've Got Me Doing Things,\\" a song she introduced in the film Love in Bloom. This was her first record and she backed it with \\"My Heart Is an Open Book.\\" She was encouraged back in to the recording studio again on July 27, 1936 and she recorded \\"Until the Real Thing Comes Along\\" and \\"When a Lady Meets a Gentleman Down South\\" for Decca Records. Her final recordings were two duets with her husband recorded on August 19, 1936 - A Fine Romance and The Way You Look Tonight. She then retired from show business. ==Personal life== Dixie Lee, 1935 Crosby's biographer, Gary Giddins, describes Dixie Lee as a shy, private person with a sensible approach to life. Giddins recounts that Dixie and Bing, as young marrieds, were often invited to parties where liquor was plentiful, and Dixie drank socially to keep up with Bing.Malcolm Macfarlane Bing Crosby: day by day - 2001 Page 148 \\"... they were rewarded with a million-dollar impromptu show, when Bing Crosby sang 'Dinah' and 'I Kiss Your Hand, Madame,' Dixie Lee sang 'Lucky Star'.\\"Jim Heimann Out with the stars: Hollywood nightlife in the golden era -1985 Page 141 \\"Bing Crosby and wife Dixie Lee treated an audience at the Century Club on Beverly Boulevard one Sunday night, when Bing took the stage and belted out \\"Dinah\\" and \\"I Kiss Your Lucky Hand, Madame,\\" and Dixie sang \\"Lucky Star\\" to a crowd ...\\" She succeeded in curbing Bing's alcohol consumption, but her own alcoholism worsened. This led to problems with the marriage and divorce was briefly contemplated by Crosby in January 1941. In January 1945, Dixie Lee was rushed to St. Vincent's Hospital after collapsing with a \\"respiratory infection.\\" Crosby accompanied his wife to the hospital in an ambulance and remained at her bedside during the night. A later article in Picturegoer magazine suggested that she had taken an accidental overdose of sleeping tablets and that her life was in the balance for over a week. Bing Crosby went to Europe in 1950 for an extended visit and there were headlines stating that the Crosby marriage was strained, but this was subsequently denied. Crosby persuaded her to take part in his radio show broadcast on December 20, 1950, her first ever appearance with him on radio. It was her first professional appearance since 1936. In January 1951, Press reports indicated that Crosby had recently moved back into his Holmby Hills home with Dixie Lee. He had been spending much of his time at his home at Pebble Beach. Dixie Lee died from ovarian cancer on November 1, 1952, three days before her 43rd birthday. She was interred in the Crosby plot at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California after a Requiem High Mass at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills on November 3. ==Filmography== *1929: Knights Out (Short) *1929: Fox Movietone Follies of 1929 as Lead Dancer In Fashion Number *1929: Why Leave Home? as Billie *1929: Happy Days as Lead Dancer in 'Crazy Feet' number *1930: Harmony at Home as Rita Joyce *1930: Let's Go Places as Dixie *1930: The Big Party as Kitty Collins *1930: Cheer Up and Smile as Margie *1931: No Limit as Dotty 'Dodo' Potter *1931: Mr. Lemon of Orange as Hat Check Girl (uncredited) *1931: Quick Millions as Stone's Secretary (uncredited) *1931: Young Sinners as Girl (uncredited) *1931: Night Life in Reno as Dorothy Pierce *1931: Darn Tootin (Short) as Singer *1934: Manhattan Love Song as Geraldine Stewart *1935: Love in Bloom as Violet Downey *1935: Redheads on Parade as Ginger Blair (final film role) ==In popular culture== *The 1947 film Smash-Up, the Story of a Woman is loosely based on Dixie Lee's life.\\"Forgotten Ones: Dixie Lee Crosby\\" ==Legacy== Dixie Lee (1F 46) Tennessee State Historical Marker near Wilma Wyatt's birthplace in Harriman, Tennessee.

Deutschlandfunk was originally a West German news radio targeting listeners within West Germany as well as in neighbouring countries, Deutschlandfunk Kultur is the result of a merger of West Berlin's RIAS station and East Berlin's DS Kultur after German reunification. Both networks that used to broadcast mainly on the AM bands have since spread throughout Germany, having been allocated many additional FM transmitters. However, because of lack of analogue frequencies, during 2003 Deutschlandradio changed its distribution strategy to digital terrestrial transmission. ==Stations== It operates four national networks: *Deutschlandfunk: mainly news and information *Deutschlandfunk Kultur: culture in a broader sense *Deutschlandfunk Nova: aimed at young adults, mainly spoken-word *Dokumente und Debatten: opt-out channel, often for special events Dokumente und Debatten is a digital-only special-event channel. It broadcasts coverage of the federal parliament, sports events, talk shows and shipping forecasts. Many of the talk shows are rebroadcasts of the audio portions of TV shows made by ARD, ZDF or Phoenix. World Radio Television Handbook (WRTH), pp. 209-211, 2007 edition, and pp. 194-195, 2008 edition It uses digital frequencies of both Deutschlandfunk and Deutschlandfunk Kultur. Deutschlandfunk Nova is knowledge orientated station, started in 2010, targeting a younger audience, and broadcast only digitally - via satellite, cable, DAB, and online. Deutschlandradio is based in Cologne, with some departments—including Deutschlandfunk Kultur—based in Berlin. ==Branding== On May 1 2017, DRadio Wissen was renamed Deutschlandfunk Nova, Deutschlandradio Kultur was renamed Deutschlandfunk Kultur. ==Distribution and transmitters== The three programs and the additional special event channel are all distributed terrestrially via Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB+) on a nation-wide single frequency network (SFN) in VHF channel 5C. The coverage at the end of 2019 is for portable indoor reception 85% of the population and for mobile reception 96% of the area of Germany or 99% of the highways respectively. For an intermediate time the two programs Deutschlandfunk and Deutschlandfunk Kultur are still transmitted in analog way via FM with an average coverage of 64% of the area. The switch over from analogue to digital started in 2015 with the switch-off of medium wave and long wave. In 2018/2019 first small-power FM transmitters were switched-off two. The aim is to further improve the digital terrestrial coverage of DAB+ and to reduce the analogue transmission step by step. For stationary reception the programs are also distributed via satellite on the transponder of ZDF. Of course the programs are streamed via the internet and available on relevant platforms. Beside the linear programs extensive non-linear content is available via audio-on-demand (podcast, mediathek and various platforms). Deutschlandradio is also very active in social media networks in order to make the content available to all public. ==Orchestras and choirs== Deutschlandradio has a 40% share in Rundfunk Orchester und Chöre GmbH, a non-profit organisation which operates: *Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra (East Berlin) *Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin *Berlin Radio Choir *RIAS Kammerchor The other shareholders are the Federal Republic of Germany (35%), the State of Berlin (20%) and RBB (5%) ==Notes== ==External links== * Deutschlandradio website * Live Radio Category:Companies based in Cologne Category:Publicly funded broadcasters Category:Radio stations established in 1994 Category:Radio stations in Germany Category:Mass media in Berlin Category:State media Category:Government-owned companies of Germany Category:1994 establishments in Germany ","title":"Deutschlandradio"},{"id":"3263990","text":"rbb complex of buildings at Theodor-Heuss-Platz The studio in Potsdam Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (, abbreviated: RBB or rbb, , stylized as rbb; Berlin- Brandenburg Broadcasting) is an institution under public law (national broadcaster) for the German states of Berlin and Brandenburg, based in Berlin and Potsdam.

Announcers did not talk over the music. Several songs were played in a row, with no talking between the songs. From the mid- to-late-1980s and through the 1990s, WMGX was owned by the Portland Radio Group, LLC., which also operated talk radio station 560 AM WGAN, country music station 101.9 WPOR and \\"Oldies\\" (1950s and 1960s hits) station 100.9 WYNZ. WMGX had a unique format, blending classic, soft, and progressive rock with adult contemporary music. At this time, the station claimed that \\"[It] never [played] the same song twice [in one 24-hour period],\\" a boast that it later backed up with a monetary prize to anyone who caught the station doing so.

WMGX eventually dropped the \\"80s, 90s and Now\\" slogan and changed it to \\"Today's Best Mix\\" in order to reflect the playlist from the current and recent Top 40 charts, minus any songs deemed too hard-edged or rap-oriented. Songs from the last couple of decades also were heard but WMGX rarely played any song recorded before 1990. As of April 2016, to compete more with the long dominant Top 40 station 97.9 WJBQ, WMGX shifted to an Adult Top 40 format under the branding of \\"Portland's Adult Hit Music Station.\\" The station currently acts as a hybrid between a Hot AC and a Mainstream Top 40 station.

This led to the closure of its production plant in Liverpool in 1983, as it proved too costly for DRG Cups to maintain a competitive position.

Every fourth line repeats the Latin refrain timor mortis conturbat me (fear of death troubles me), a litanic phrase from the Office of the Dead. Apart from its literary quality, the poem is notable for the list of makars it contains, some of whom are historically attestable as poets only from Dunbar's testimony in this work. After listing Lydgate, Gower and Chaucer, the makars invoked are Scottish. All but two are cited as having died by the time of the composition. The two exceptions are the courtier, Patrick Johnston, and known poet Walter Kennedy, the latter of whom died circa 1508. From internal evidence, the lament is generally thought to have been composed c.1505. Most of the names can be traced to either the fourteenth or fifteenth centuries. ==List of names in the Lament== The leet of names in the Lament for the Makaris, all of which are from what Dunbar in the poem calls his \\"facultie\\", suggests a picture of the Scottish literary culture of the period which is wider than that otherwise handed down to us from the surviving record. In order and form of citation, the makars that Dunbar mourns in 'The Lament' are: * Chaucer (died 1400) * The Monk of Bery — John Lydgate (died 1451) * Gower (died 1408) * Syr Hew of Eglintoun — historical figure (died 1377), brother-in-law to Robert II;Tasioulas, J.A. The Makars Canongate 1999, p.788-9. association with the poet Huchoun posited but not certain * Heryot — not identified, no known works * Wyntoun — Andrew of Wyntoun (died 1425), author of the Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland * Maister Johne Clerk — not identified; the name occurs in the Bannatyne MS; the title maister signifies university education * Jame(s) Afflek — (James or Jamie Auchinleck)?, no known works; Dunbar's text might imply Afflek, and Clerk before him (mentioned in the same line), were noted for serious themes (\\"ballad\\" and \\"tragedy\\") * Holland — Richard Holland (died c. 1483), author of the Buke of the Howlat * Barbour — John Barbour (died 1395), author of The Brus * Schir Mungo Lokert of the Le — no known works; posited identification with historical knight (died 1489)Priscilla Bawcutt * Clerk of Tranent — not identified; described by Dunbar as the author of a (lost?)

The title of one poem is given: Clerk of Tranent's \\"Anteris of Gawane\\", an otherwise unknown work. Of Mercer, Dunbar extends his critical opinion to say that he \\"did in luf so lifly write,/ So schort, so quyk, of sentence hie\\", and the reference to him as a poet of love also accords with the fact that some love poems are attributed to a \\"Mersar\\" in the Bannatyne MS. Finally, if the lines \\"That scorpion fell hes done infek,/ Maister Johne Clerk, and James Afflek,/ Fra balat making and tragidie\\" can be taken to impart literal information, then it might infer that some particular reputation for work with more serious themes attached to these names. At that time in Scotland \\"tragedy\\" denoted any \\"story, play or poem with a disastrous or sorrowful outcome\\".Dictionary of the Scots Language, http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/dost/tragedie ==Extract== > On to the ded gois all estatis, Princis, prelotis, and potestatis, Baith > riche and pur of al degre; Timor mortis conturbat me.

Commonly used dimensions are people, products, place and time.\\"Oracle Data Warehousing Guide\\", Oracle Corporation, retrieved 9 June 2014Definition: Dimension\\" Search Data Management, TechTarget, retrieved 9 June 2014. (Note: People and time sometimes are not modeled as dimensions.) In a data warehouse, dimensions provide structured labeling information to otherwise unordered numeric measures. The dimension is a data set composed of individual, non-overlapping data elements. The primary functions of dimensions are threefold: to provide filtering, grouping and labelling. These functions are often described as \\"slice and dice\\". A common data warehouse example involves sales as the measure, with customer and product as dimensions. In each sale a customer buys a product. The data can be sliced by removing all customers except for a group under study, and then diced by grouping by product. A dimensional data element is similar to a categorical variable in statistics. Typically dimensions in a data warehouse are organized internally into one or more hierarchies. \\"Date\\" is a common dimension, with several possible hierarchies: * \\"Days (are grouped into) Months (which are grouped into) Years\\", * \\"Days (are grouped into) Weeks (which are grouped into) Years\\" * \\"Days (are grouped into) Months (which are grouped into) Quarters (which are grouped into) Years\\" * etc. ==Types== ===Conformed dimension=== A conformed dimension is a set of data attributes that have been physically referenced in multiple database tables using the same key value to refer to the same structure, attributes, domain values, definitions and concepts. A conformed dimension cuts across many facts. Dimensions are conformed when they are either exactly the same (including keys) or one is a perfect subset of the other. Most important, the row headers produced in two different answer sets from the same conformed dimension(s) must be able to match perfectly.' Conformed dimensions are either identical or strict mathematical subsets of the most granular, detailed dimension. Dimension tables are not conformed if the attributes are labeled differently or contain different values. Conformed dimensions come in several different flavors. At the most basic level, conformed dimensions mean exactly the same thing with every possible fact table to which they are joined. The date dimension table connected to the sales facts is identical to the date dimension connected to the inventory facts.Ralph Kimball, Margy Ross, The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling, Second Edition, Wiley Computer Publishing, 2002. , Pages 82-87, 394 ===Junk dimension=== A junk dimension is a convenient grouping of typically low-cardinality flags and indicators. By creating an abstract dimension, these flags and indicators are removed from the fact table while placing them into a useful dimensional framework.Ralph Kimball, Margy Ross, The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling, Second Edition, Wiley Computer Publishing, 2002. , Pages 202, 405 A Junk Dimension is a dimension table consisting of attributes that do not belong in the fact table or in any of the existing dimension tables. The nature of these attributes is usually text or various flags, e.g. non-generic comments or just simple yes/no or true/false indicators. These kinds of attributes are typically remaining when all the obvious dimensions in the business process have been identified and thus the designer is faced with the challenge of where to put these attributes that do not belong in the other dimensions. One solution is to create a new dimension for each of the remaining attributes, but due to their nature, it could be necessary to create a vast number of new dimensions resulting in a fact table with a very large number of foreign keys. The designer could also decide to leave the remaining attributes in the fact table but this could make the row length of the table unnecessarily large if, for example, the attributes is a long text string. The solution to this challenge is to identify all the attributes and then put them into one or several Junk Dimensions. One Junk Dimension can hold several true/false or yes/no indicators that have no correlation with each other, so it would be convenient to convert the indicators into a more describing attribute. An example would be an indicator about whether a package had arrived: instead of indicating this as “yes” or “no”, it would be converted into “arrived” or “pending” in the junk dimension. The designer can choose to build the dimension table so it ends up holding all the indicators occurring with every other indicator so that all combinations are covered. This sets up a fixed size for the table itself which would be 2x rows, where x is the number of indicators. This solution is appropriate in situations where the designer would expect to encounter a lot of different combinations and where the possible combinations are limited to an acceptable level. In a situation where the number of indicators are large, thus creating a very big table or where the designer only expect to encounter a few of the possible combinations, it would be more appropriate to build each row in the junk dimension as new combinations are encountered. To limit the size of the tables, multiple junk dimensions might be appropriate in other situations depending on the correlation between various indicators. Junk dimensions are also appropriate for placing attributes like non-generic comments from the fact table. Such attributes might consist of data from an optional comment field when a customer places an order and as a result will probably be blank in many cases. Therefore, the junk dimension should contain a single row representing the blanks as a surrogate key that will be used in the fact table for every row returned with a blank comment field.Kimball, Ralph, et al. (2008): The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit, Second Edition, Wiley Publishing Inc., Indianapolis, IN. Pages 263-265 ===Degenerate dimension=== A degenerate dimension is a key, such as a transaction number, invoice number, ticket number, or bill-of-lading number, that has no attributes and hence does not join to an actual dimension table. Degenerate dimensions are very common when the grain of a fact table represents a single transaction item or line item because the degenerate dimension represents the unique identifier of the parent. Degenerate dimensions often play an integral role in the fact table's primary key.Ralph Kimball, Margy Ross, The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling, Second Edition, Wiley Computer Publishing, 2002. , Pages 50, 398 ===Role-playing dimension=== Dimensions are often recycled for multiple applications within the same database. For instance, a \\"Date\\" dimension can be used for \\"Date of Sale\\", as well as \\"Date of Delivery\\", or \\"Date of Hire\\". This is often referred to as a \\"role-playing dimension\\". This can be implemented using a view over the same dimension table. ===Outrigger dimension=== Usually dimension tables do not reference other dimensions via foreign keys. When this happens, the referenced dimension is called an outrigger dimension. Outrigger dimensions should be considered a data warehouse anti-pattern: it is considered a better practice to use some fact tables that relate the two dimensions. ===Shrunken dimension=== A conformed dimensions is said to be a shrunken dimension when it includes a subset of the rows and/or columns of the original dimension. ===Calendar date dimension=== A special type of dimension can be used to represent dates with a granularity of a day. Dates would be referenced in a fact table as foreign keys to a date dimension. The date dimension primary key could be a surrogate key or a number using the format YYYYMMDD. The date dimension can include other attributes like the week of the year, or flags representing work days, holidays, etc. It could also include special rows representing: not known dates, or yet to be defined dates. The date dimension should be initialized with all the required dates, say the next 10 years of dates, or more if required, or past dates if events in the past are handled. Time instead is usually best represented as a timestamp in the fact table. ==Use of ISO representation terms== When referencing data from a metadata registry such as ISO/IEC 11179, representation terms such as \\"Indicator\\" (a boolean true/false value), \\"Code\\" (a set of non-overlapping enumerated values) are typically used as dimensions. For example, using the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) the data element name would be \\"PersonGenderCode\\" and the enumerated values might be \\"male\\", \\"female\\" and \\"unknown\\". ==Dimension table== In data warehousing, a dimension table is one of the set of companion tables to a fact table. The fact table contains business facts (or measures), and foreign keys which refer to candidate keys (normally primary keys) in the dimension tables. Contrary to fact tables, dimension tables contain descriptive attributes (or fields) that are typically textual fields (or discrete numbers that behave like text). These attributes are designed to serve two critical purposes: query constraining and/or filtering, and query result set labeling. Dimension attributes should be: * Verbose (labels consisting of full words) * Descriptive * Complete (having no missing values) * Discretely valued (having only one value per dimension table row) * Quality assured (having no misspellings or impossible values) Dimension table rows are uniquely identified by a single key field. It is recommended that the key field be a simple integer because a key value is meaningless, used only for joining fields between the fact and dimension tables. Dimension tables often use primary keys that are also surrogate keys. Surrogate keys are often auto- generated (e.g. a Sybase or SQL Server \\"identity column\\", a PostgreSQL or Informix serial, an Oracle SEQUENCE or a column defined with AUTO_INCREMENT in MySQL). The use of surrogate dimension keys brings several advantages, including: * Performance. Join processing is made much more efficient by using a single field (the surrogate key) * Buffering from operational key management practices. This prevents situations where removed data rows might reappear when their natural keys get reused or reassigned after a long period of dormancy * Mapping to integrate disparate sources * Handling unknown or not- applicable connections * Tracking changes in dimension attribute values Although surrogate key use places a burden put on the ETL system, pipeline processing can be improved, and ETL tools have built-in improved surrogate key processing. The goal of a dimension table is to create standardized, conformed dimensions that can be shared across the enterprise's data warehouse environment, and enable joining to multiple fact tables representing various business processes. Conformed dimensions are important to the enterprise nature of DW/BI systems because they promote: * Consistency. Every fact table is filtered consistently, so that query answers are labeled consistently. * Integration. Queries can drill into different process fact tables separately for each individual fact table, then join the results on common dimension attributes. * Reduced development time to market. The common dimensions are available without recreating them. Over time, the attributes of a given row in a dimension table may change. For example, the shipping address for a company may change. Kimball refers to this phenomenon as Slowly Changing Dimensions. Strategies for dealing with this kind of change are divided into three categories: * Type One. Simply overwrite the old value(s). * Type Two. Add a new row containing the new value(s), and distinguish between the rows using Tuple-versioning techniques. * Type Three. Add a new attribute to the existing row. ==Common patterns== ;Date and timeRalph Kimball, The Data Warehouse Toolkit, Second Edition, Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2008. , Pages 253-256 Since many fact tables in a data warehouse are time series of observations, one or more date dimensions are often needed. One of the reasons to have date dimensions is to place calendar knowledge in the data warehouse instead of hard-coded in an application. While a simple SQL date/timestamp is useful for providing accurate information about the time a fact was recorded, it can not give information about holidays, fiscal periods, etc. An SQL date/timestamp can still be useful to store in the fact table, as it allows for precise calculations. Having both the date and time of day in the same dimension, may easily result in a huge dimension with millions of rows. If a high amount of detail is needed it is usually a good idea to split date and time into two or more separate dimensions. A time dimension with a grain of seconds in a day will only have 86400 rows. A more or less detailed grain for date/time dimensions can be chosen depending on needs. As examples, date dimensions can be accurate to year, quarter, month or day and time dimensions can be accurate to hours, minutes or seconds. As a rule of thumb, time of day dimension should only be created if hierarchical groupings are needed or if there are meaningful textual descriptions for periods of time within the day (ex. “evening rush” or “first shift”). If the rows in a fact table are coming from several time zones, it might be useful to store date and time in both local time and a standard time. This can be done by having two dimensions for each date/time dimension needed – one for local time, and one for standard time. Storing date/time in both local and standard time, will allow for analysis on when facts are created in a local setting and in a global setting as well. The standard time chosen can be a global standard time (ex. UTC), it can be the local time of the business’ headquarters, or any other time zone that would make sense to use. ==See also== * Categorical variable * Data warehouse * Degenerate dimension * Slowly changing dimension * Fact table * ISO/IEC 11179 * Measure (data warehouse) * Metadata ==References== Category:Data warehousing Category:Metadata ","title":"Dimension (data warehouse)"},{"id":"3264093","text":"Giuseppe Lugli (born in Rome, Italy, in 1890; died in Rome, Italy, on December 5, 1967) was Professor of ancient Roman topography at the University of Rome from 1933 to 1961.http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giuseppe-lugli/ Lugli's academic career began with the completion of his undergraduate \\"Laurea\\" degree at Università di Roma La Sapienza in 1913, where he wrote a thesis on the villa of the emperor Domitian at Castel Gandolfo.http://www.inasa- roma.it/pdf/Colini%20Ricordo%20di%20Giuseppe%20Lugli.pdf Lugli's career was prolific, although among his many significant contributions, several are paramount.

G. Wodehouse. In the stories, Parsloe resides at Matchingham Hall, near Blandings Castle, and is the rival and enemy of Lord Emsworth. ==Appearances== Parsloe first appears in the short story \\"The Custody of the Pumpkin\\" (included in the 1935 collection Blandings Castle and Elsewhere, but written over ten years earlier). He later shows up in several other Blandings tales, including Summer Lightning (1929), Heavy Weather (1933) and Pigs Have Wings (1953). ==Wild youth== While Emsworth's brother Gally is preparing his reminiscences in Summer Lightning, he reveals quite a lot about the Baronet's black past. Although the first twenty years or so of his life were relatively blameless, he went off the rails to a considerable degree, and was considered a dangerous type by his contemporaries. When Galahad first met him, Parsloe was walking around a supper-table at Romano's, wearing a soup-tureen on his head and holding a stick of celery, claiming he was a sentry outside Buckingham Palace. He is remembered as the only man ever to have been thrown out of the Cafe de l'Europe for trying to raise the price of a bottle of champagne by raffling his trousers at the bar. Notoriously sneaky, he once tricked Gally into parting with over ten pounds, using a fixed spinning top, and at one point, Gally asserts, doped Gally's dog Towser with steak and onions just before a rat-catching competition in the back room of the Black Footman in Gossiter Street, allowing Parsloe's dog Banjo to win the day. While living down the river at Shepperton, where his father was Dean, he wangled free dinners by getting his dog to do tricks for parties of day-trippers, thus getting into conversation with them; he would then blithely follow them into dinner and tuck into their champagne and cigars. Sometime in the late 'nineties (the exact year is uncertain), he stole Lord Burper's false teeth and pawned them at a shop on the Edgware Road; he was also involved in a mysterious incident revolving around the shellfish known as prawns, of which little is known, save that it took place at Ascot, \\"the year Martingale won the Gold Cup\\". At some point in his impecunious youth, he became engaged to one Maudie Montrose, barmaid at the old Criterion, but their wedding was a wash-out thanks to some confusion over dates (although at the time both thought the other had stood them up). ==Later life== By the time we are first introduced to Sir Gregory, he is a rotund man in his early fifties. After he inherited a baronetcy from a cousin at the age of thirty-one, he took up a life of quiet dignity at Matchingham Hall, in the village of Much Matchingham, Shropshire. By the age of fifty-two, he has taken on the appearance of a Regency buck who has overindulged somewhat. Like Professor Moriarty in the Sherlock Holmes books, Parsloe is the chief villain in Lord Emsworth's life, having first sustained a bitter rivalry in the raising of pumpkins for the Shrewsbury Show. After many victories for the dark side, Emsworth's prize pumpkin, \\"Hope of Blandings\\", finally managed to overturn Parsloe's previous dominance in this critical battle, as related in the short \\"The Custody of the Pumpkin\\". In \\"Company for Gertrude\\", not long after Emsworth's pig Empress of Blandings has won the Fat Pigs Contest at the Shropshire Agricultural Show, Parsloe has lured away Emsworth's pig-tender, George Cyril Wellbeloved, in a sinister attempt to gain a crucial advantage for his own porker, Pride of Matchingham. This dark bit of treachery involved offering Wellbeloved a higher salary in order to switch allegiance, in violation of the old feudal ethic. Emsworth was understandably shaken to his foundation by this act, to such a degree that, by the time of Summer Lightning, he is willing to believe (encouraged by his brother Galahad, who had not been on cordial terms with Parsloe since the Winter of the year 1906) that Parsloe would go as far as to kidnap the Empress. At one time, Parsloe had to consult Percy Pilbeam on a matter of some compromising letters, and later does so again, offering him £500 to steal Galahad's manuscript, lest the revelations contained therein jeopardise his candidacy as a \\"Unionist\\" in a forthcoming by-election in the \\"Bridgeford and Shifley\\" Parliamentary Division of Shropshire. Inevitably, Parsloe is a good friend of Emsworth's domineering sister, Lady Constance Keeble, and the two form a syndicate acting through Pilbeam with the aim of destroying Galahad's book - their scheme continues into the events of Heavy Weather. At the start of Pigs Have Wings, Parsloe has become engaged to Gloria Salt, a health-loving, athletic young girl who makes him diet. He is quite pleased when she jilts him for another, especially as soon afterwards he is reunited with his true love, Maudie. ==Adaptations== ;Television * Jimmy Edwards portrayed Parsloe in two episodes of the 1967 Blandings Castle series, part of the television series The World of Wodehouse. * In a 1995 adaptation of Heavy Weather, made by the BBC and partners and broadcast in the United States by PBS, Parsloe was played by Ronald Fraser. * In the 2013–2014 BBC series Blandings, Parsloe was played by Robert Bathurst. ;Radio * In the 1985–1992 Blandings radio series, Parsloe was voiced by Reginald Marsh. * Michael Jayston portrayed Parsloe in the 2010 radio dramatisation of the novel Summer Lightning. ==References== Category:P.

He seems to have been from—or associated with – Cangas do Morrazo, a small town of Pontevedra, Galicia (Spain). Only three of his songs survive. All three are cantigas de amigo and in each of them the girl mentions a religious site (ermida) at San Momede do Mar (\\"San Momede of the Sea\\"). These references to the sea may be symbolic (symbolizing sexuality) as they are real (given the geography), but they have earned this poet the designation of \\"singer of the sea\\". In the first text, a girl asks her mother for permission to go see her boyfriend at San Momede do Mar; in the second she informs her mother that the boyfriend did not come and she has surely lost him; in the third she asks her boyfriend to meet her there, and not to break his word to her again. As with most jograes, nothing is known for certain about his life, although the preservation of three of his cantigas suggests that he performed in the courts of local nobles. The location of the poet's compositions in the manuscript tradition, the use of a place-name (Cangas) in lieu of a surname, and the form and rhetoric of his songs all seem to confirm his status as a jograr. In both manuscripts (Cancioneiro da Vaticana and Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional) his name is spelled Johan (the modern Galician equivalent being Xoán, Portuguese João). Johan de Cangas had attracted almost no critical attention until 1998, when the Galician Literature Day was dedicated to him and to two other \\"singers of the sea\\", Martín Codax and Mendinho. ==Example== A cantiga de amigo of Johan de Cangas (ed.

The attack conducted by the British against the French defense line of Beauport, some east of Quebec was checked, and the British soldiers of General James Wolfe retreated with 443 casualties and losses. == Background == The French and Indian War campaigns of 1758 were mostly successful for the British, who had sent more than 40,000 men against New France and made key gains by capturing Louisbourg and destroying Fort Frontenac, although their primary thrust was stopped by French general Louis-Joseph de Montcalm in the Battle of Carillon. William Pitt continued the aggressive policy in 1759, again organizing large campaigns aimed at the heartland of New France, the Canadien communities of Quebec and Montreal on the St. Lawrence River. For the campaign against Quebec, General James Wolfe was given command of an army of about 7,000 men. === Beauport === When he arrived before Quebec on 26 June, Wolfe observed that the northern shore of the St. Lawrence River around Beauport (the Beauport shore), the most favourable site for the landing of troops, was strongly defended by the French, who had built entrenchments on high ground, redoubts and floating batteries. Wolfe consequently had to devise a plan involving a landing on some other location of the shore. The search for the best site kept him busy for weeks. === Montmorency camp === On the night of 8th or 9 July, British forces landed on the north shore, some 1.2 km (1 mi) east of the Montmorency Falls, east of where the French west-east defence line ended, at the mouth of the Montmorency River. Wolfe landed first, leading the Louisbourg grenadiers, who were followed by the brigade commanded by George Townshend. The landing met no opposition from the French.Stacey, p.60 James Murray, at the head of a part of his brigade, joined Wolfe and Townshend on 10 July. A camp was set up near the landing site. Wolfe ordered the construction of a battery to defend the camp, as well as rafts and floating batteries in anticipation of an attack on the French line.Stacey, p. 66 === Plan of attack === After establishing the Montmorency camp, Wolfe explored various plans of attack and chose his plan on 28 July. He had two main plans. The first plan which Wolfe mentioned in his journal and the correspondence with his officers is that of 16 July. In a letter to Brigadier Robert Monckton, Wolfe wrote that he had hoped to capture one of the French redoubts, the second one counting from the east end of the Beauport line, in order to force the enemy out of their entrenchments. The plan involved an attack by the Navy, an important landing force transported from Île d'Orléans, as well as a body of troops crossing the river Montmorency on rafts and marching westward to the battle site. At the same time, the brigade commanded by Monckton was to land on the French right, between the Saint-Charles River and Beauport. This plan was put on hold on 20 July, when an event of great import to the British occurred: the Royal Navy succeeded, on the night of 18–19 July, in passing seven ships, including the ship of the line and two frigates (HMS Diana and HMS Squirrel), through the narrow passage between Quebec and Pointe-Lévy, thus opening the possibility of a landing west of Quebec.Stacey, pp. 67-68 Batteries firing at the British flotilla from the Lower Town of Quebec, as well as the floating batteries pursuing it, were unable to prevent the crossing. The Sutherland's log records that the French cannonballs flew too high to cause serious damage.Stacey, p. 68 On 19 July Wolfe was at the Pointe-Lévy camp to reconnoiter the north shore west of Quebec. He moved further west the next day, near the mouth of the Chaudière River, to study the opposite shore between Sillery and Cap Rouge.Stacey, p. 68 Wolfe wrote to Monckton with orders for a plan of attack involving a landing near the village of Saint- Michel, something he had already considered in June.Stacey, p. 69 However, at 13:00, Wolfe countermanded his orders to Monckton, ordering him instead to wait a few days and remain ready to act quickly, because of some \\"particular circumstances\\".Stacey, p. 70 It is possible that the circumstance he alluded to was a French counteroffensive in which a newly built battery at Samos (near Sillery) damaged the Squirrel. Wolfe returned to the Montmorency camp on 26 July. Escorted by two battalions, he walked up the Montmorency river to reconnoiter the French lines. At about five kilometres (3.1 mi) from the river's mouth, he observed a ford allowing the easy crossing from the west shore to the east shore. This discovery was followed by a solid skirmish between British soldiers, attempting to cross, and French soldiers entrenched on the other side. The British reported 45 killed and wounded.Stacey, p. 72 On 28 July, Wolfe wrote of an attack on the Beauport line to be executed on 30 July. However, poor winds did not allow for naval movements that day and the operations were postponed to the next day.Stacey, p. 74 The plan of attack then contemplated by Wolfe was a variation of the plan he had described to Monckton in his letter of 16 July. Unlike the earlier plan, there was no mention of a parallel landing on the French right (west of Beauport). == Order of Battle == The order of battles were; === British Forces === British forces were commanded by Major General James Wolfe, who commanded less than 5,000 men. * Converged Grenadiers (13 Companies) from; 15th, 22nd, 28th, 35th, 40th, 43rd, 45th, 47th, 48th, 58th, 2nd Btn, 60th (Royal American), 3rd Btn, 60th (Royal American) Regiment of Foot, and 78th Fraser Highlanders * 2 Companies of the 60th (Royal American) Regiment of Foot (200 men) * Monckton's Brigade commanded by Brigadier General Robert Monckton ** 15th Regiment of Foot ** 78th Fraser Highlanders === French Forces === French forces were commanded by Brigadier General Louis Joseph de Saint Véran, Marquis de Montcalm, who commanded 12,000 regulars and militia but just a part (left wing) of the force took part in the battle. * Extreme Left Wing commanded by Colonel Repentigny ** 800 Volunteers * Left Wing commanded by Colonel François-Gaston, Chevalier de Lévis ** 2nd Battalion, Régiment de Béarn ** 2nd Battalion, Régiment de Guyenne ** 2nd Battalion, Régiment Royal Roussillon ** La Sarre Grenadiers (1 Company) ** Mixed Battalion of Montréal (part militia, part Compagnies Franches de la Marine) ** Montréal Militia ** Trois-Rivières Militia, in reserve ** 500 Natives == Battle == ===Dangers of plan exposed=== On the morning of 31 July the war vessel Centurion positioned itself by the Montmorency Falls to attack the easternmost French batteries. General Wolfe went on board the Russell, one of the two armed transports (the other being the Three Sisters) that were meant for the attack on the redoubt. Wolfe, who was then in the heat of the action, had a better chance to reconnoitre the French position than he could from Île d'Orléans. He immediately realized his mistake: the redoubt he hoped to seize to force the French out of their entrenchments was within range of enemy fire. The French soldiers could then very well shoot toward the redoubt without leaving their entrenchments on high ground. This fact changed everything and Wolfe's plan of attack consequently proved riskier than expected.Stacey, pp. 75-76 In spite of this, General Wolfe decided to proceed with the attack already underway. In his journal, he stated that it was \\"the confusion and disorder\\" he observed on the enemy's side which incited him to action. Townshend, who commanded at Montmorency, and Monckton who was doing the same at Pointe-Lévy, received the order to prepare for the attack. === Difficult landing === At around 11:00, the transport ships (Russell and Three Sisters) reached the north shore where the body of troops mobilized to take the redoubt landed. Toward 12:30, the boats transporting the main landing force left the Île d'Orléans to rendezvous with Wolfe. An unforeseen difficulty caused the landing planned a little to the west of the Montmorency Falls to be suspended: the boats met with a shoal preventing them from reaching the shore. A significant amount of time was lost trying to find a suitable site for landing, which finally occurred at around 17:30.Stacey, pp. 76-77 By that time, the sky was covered by storm clouds. === Confrontation === The first troops advancing toward French lines were the thirteen companies of grenadiers and some 200 soldiers of the Royal Americans.Stacey, p. 77 Fire from the Montreal militia stalled their advance up the hill to the entrenchments above.Stacey, p. 80 Shortly after the firing began, a summer storm broke out, causing gunpowder to become wet and rendering firearms unusable.Stacey, p. 78 When General Wolfe ordered the retreat, the troops marching from the Montmorency camp had not yet met up with the main force transported from the Île d'Orléans camp.Stacey, p. 77 == Consequences == The French were victorious. General Wolfe recorded 443 losses (210 killed and 233 wounded), while the French counted 60 killed and wounded on their side; losses which were attributed to the fire coming from the great battery of the Montmorency camp.Stacey, pp. 79-80 The day after the battle, Wolfe wrote Monckton that the losses incurred in the battle were not great and that the defeat was no cause of discouragement.Stacey, p. 81 While the news of the victory was celebrated in the French camp, General Montcalm remained lucid, writing to Bourlamaque that in his opinion this attack was only a prelude to a more important one, which they could do nothing but patiently wait for.Stacey, p. 80 The attack did eventually arrive, when on 13 September the British landed west of Quebec and defeated the French on the Plains of Abraham in a battle that claimed the lives of both Montcalm and Wolfe. == Notes == === References === * Journal of the Expedition up the St. Lawrence * McLynn, Frank (2004). 1759: The Year Britain became Master of the World, Jonathan Cape, London, * Stacey, Charles Perry (1959).

number 85) that participated in the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. Assigned to the 393d Bomb Squadron, 509th Composite Group, it was used as a weather reconnaissance plane and flew over the city before the attack to determine if conditions were favorable for a visual drop. Pilot Claude Eatherly later expressed remorse, received psychiatric hospitalization, and engaged in anti-nuclear activism, which may be the origin of urban legends that Eatherly, Enola Gay pilot Paul Tibbets, or other members of the two planes' crews went insane after the bombings. ==Airplane history== Straight Flush. Straight Flush was one of the fifteen Silverplate B-29's used by the 509th in its deployment to North Field, Tinian. It was one of ten B-29s built at the Glenn L. Martin Company plant in Omaha, Nebraska, as a \\"block 35\\" B-29 but then designated \\"block 36\\" to denote its special configuration. It was flown from Omaha to the 509th's base at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, on April 2, 1945, and assigned to Capt. Claude Eatherly and crew C-11, and departed Wendover June 8, 1945, arriving at Tinian on June 13. It was originally assigned the Victor (unit-assigned identification) number 5 but on August 1 was given the triangle N tail markings of the 444th Bomb Group as a security measure and had its Victor changed to 85 to avoid misidentification with actual 444th BG aircraft. It was named Straight Flush, purportedly based on a gambling penchant of Eatherly. From June to August it flew 11 training missions, and six combat missions in which \\"pumpkin bombs\\" (five-ton TNT bombs with the same handling characteristics as the nuclear weapons) were dropped on Japanese industrial targets. Eatherly's crew bombed Tokyo (20 July), Otsu (24 July), Kanose (26 July), and Maizuru (29 July) in Straight Flush, while 1st Lt. Charles D. Albury and crew C-15 used it to bomb Koromo (挙母市 Koromo-shi). On August 6, Straight Flush flew a mission over Japan as a weather patrol aircraft for the Hiroshima bombing; two days later, it made its final combat flight, a bombing raid on Yokkaichi. One source (Campbell) states that on the first Pumpkin mission, on July 20, Eatherly attempted to bomb the Imperial Palace through overcast as a \\"target of opportunity\\" but missed, hitting a bridge called Gofukubashi. The attack was contrary to bombing restrictions (to protect the person of Emperor Hirohito) but apparently was not punished. In November 1945 Straight Flush returned with the 509th to Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico. From March to August 1946 it was assigned to the Operation Crossroads task force, then rejoined the 509th BG at Roswell. In June 1949 Straight Flush was transferred to the 97th Bombardment Group at Biggs Air Force Base, Texas, then sent to Tinker Air Force Base in April 1950 for modification to TB-29 trainer specifications at the Oklahoma City Air Materiel Area. Subsequent assignments were to: *2nd Radar Calibration Squadron, Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska (April 1953), and the *5025th Maintenance Group, Elmendorf AFB (August 1953). In December 1953 it was sent to the 3040th Aircraft Storage Group at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, where it was scrapped in July 1954. In 2015 another preserved B-29 known as \\"Hagarty's Hag\\" at the Hill Aerospace Museum was repainted to resemble Straight Flush https://www.hill.af.mil/News/Article- Display/Article/838118/hill-aerospace-museum-planes-get-new- paint/https://www.aerospaceutah.org/b-29-superfortress/. ===Hiroshima mission crew=== Crew C-11 (regularly assigned to Straight Flush) *Capt.

Joseph Adna Hill (1860–1938) was an American statistician, born at Stewartstown, New Hampshire. Hill was descended from \\"an elite, old-line New England family,\\" and attended many well-regarded educational institutions: after graduating from Phillips Exeter he attended Harvard University, graduating in 1885, and completed his graduate studies at the University of Halle (Ph.D.) in 1892. He published The English Income Tax with Special Reference to Administration and Method of Assessment (1899). In 1899 he took on statistical work for the United States Census Bureau, of which he became chief statistician in 1909. In this connection he had charge of census reports on child labor, illiteracy, marriage and divorce, women at work, and a report for the Immigration Commission on occupations of immigrants. He was the author of many census reports on child labor, the insane, divorce, and kindred subjects. Hill was particularly interested in race and nationality and added questions and categories to the census in both 1910 and 1920 that would record more detailed information on those subjects, among them, returning to use the racial designation of \\"mulatto\\" that had been removed from the 1900 census. He was appointed Assistant Director of the Census in 1921. Although revised by Edward Vermilye Huntington, Hill is credited with the conception of the Method of Equal Proportions or Huntington–Hill method of apportionment of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives to the states, as a function of their populations determined in the U.S. Census. This mathematical algorithm has been used in the U.S. since 1941 and is currently the method used.https://www.census.gov/history/www/census_then_now/notable_alumni/joseph_adna_hill.html ==References== ==External links== * Category:American statisticians Category:1860 births Category:1938 deaths Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Presidents of the American Statistical Association Category:People from Coos County, New Hampshire ","title":"Joseph Adna Hill"},{"id":"3264231","text":"The Pentax LX is a 35 mm single-lens reflex camera produced by Pentax in Japan. It was introduced in 1980 and produced until 2001. The LX uses the K mount which is the Pentax proprietary bayonet lens mount. It has manual and aperture priority automatic exposure modes. It is the top-of-the-line \\"professional\\" or \\"system\\" camera in the Pentax manual focus range, and has a large range of accessories. Compared with contemporary professional camera bodies from rival manufacturers, like the Canon New F-1 or Nikon F3, the LX body is smaller and lighter, weighing in at 570 grams (20 ounces) with standard FA-1 finder. Due to the peculiar font used for the Pentax LX logo, the model is sometimes misspelled as ILX. == Construction and features == Construction is strong and durable, with a solid cast metal frame and metal covering plates. All buttons and dials are weather and dust sealed, a unique feature not found on other professional cameras of the day. Underneath the satin black finish is black chrome, so that even as the surface finish inevitably wore through in hard professional use, the underlying metal would not look brassy. Both the viewfinder and the focusing screen are interchangeable to suit the task at hand, a large choice of alternatives were available. The camera has an uncommon frame counter, being able to keep track of the frame number in either direction, whether advancing or rewinding the film; this feature dramatically adds to the flexibility of the camera, as well as aids in multiple exposures. The camera has a multi-function lever that supports mirror lock-up, self-timer and depth of field preview. Both a winder and motor drive were available, and a full complement of other professional accessories. The film take-up spool is of the \\"Magic-Needles\\" type, as found on Pentax M Series cameras, which simplified loading. Two databacks are available, one of which superimposes up to three characters chosen by the user in a corner of the frame, and the other superimposes a tiny analog clockface. Also taking advantage of the removable back is a high capacity magazine allowing for 250 exposures. Pentax LX with SMC Pentax-A Zoom 1:4 70~210 mm == Shutter and metering == The shutter and metering systems are very sophisticated, as much or more than any other camera of its time. The titanium shutter curtains are horizontally running with a flash synchronization ('X') speed of 1/75 second. The film speed dial can be set from 6 to 3200 ASA, and co-axially is an exposure compensation dial. When in compensation mode is active, a small flag appears in the viewfinder to remind of the change from normal. The LX uses dynamic, off-the-film-plane TTL metering called Integrated Direct Metering (IDM). Pre-release exposure information is obtained from light passing through a semi-silvered area of the mirror and then reflected down by a small secondary mirror to a metering cell in the base of the camera. From this, the user is given a shutter speed prediction by means of a vertical row of LEDs in the viewfinder. In auto mode, once the shutter is released, the light reflected from the first shutter curtain and the film continues to be measured by the same photocell as the exposure takes place, and is used to adjust the exposure time even if the subject light level is varying. This exposure metering has a range from EV1 to EV19 for manual exposure and an EV-5.5 to EV20 in automatic making the camera excellent for available light photography, in which automatic exposures can be up to 125 seconds. In manual mode the predicted shutter speed is still displayed in the viewfinder but becomes a recommendation, and the user can choose any other speed indicated by aligning the translucent blue flag along the LED row. The shutter is controlled in manual mode mechanically at flash sync speed and all speeds above it, and electronically for all speeds below it. The whole upper range of speeds, including the flash sync speed, is thus available without batteries in the camera. Because the metering is entirely within the body of the camera, it functions fully with any of the interchangeable viewfinders, or even without one for that matter. The system also removes any necessity for a viewfinder window blind. The lens aperture is visible in the viewfinder via a Judas window with the principle ones of the seven alternative viewfinders. TTL flash control is also available using Pentax and certain third party dedicated units in the hot shoe (e.g. the Pentax AF280T), which are controlled by the camera taking measurements from the IDM during the exposure. The TTL capabilities are extended to dedicated external flash units (such as the Pentax AF400T hammerhead unit) via a special lead which connects to the conventional PC socket and additional contacts adjacent to it. The hot shoe and PC socket can also be used with non-dedicated flash units. == Variations and special releases == In October 1981, Pentax made available 300 limited edition Pentax LX Gold cameras to celebrate having produced 10 million SLR cameras, the first camera manufacturer to reach that milestone according to the accompanying certificate. The camera and its SMC 1:1.2 50 mm lens is partly gold plated and partly covered in brown reptile skin, while some details are made of brown plastic, and it came with a brown ever-ready case. Cameras for some markets such as the U.S. have brown leather instead of reptile skin supposedly due to import laws. The actual number of cameras made is somewhat higher than 300 since a few were retained at Pentax reserved for their own use. The actual number for sale however was 300 cameras according to Pentax in Tokyo. It is a superb example of Japanese camera workmanship. Three limited editions of the Pentax LX were subsequently distributed on the Japanese market according to the Asahi Optical Historical Club: * The Pentax LX Titanium was produced in 1994 to mark the company's 75th anniversary. The titanium plated limited edition of apparently only 1000 LX cameras for the Japanese market came in a presentation box. * Another Pentax LX Titanium was launched in 1996, finished in black in a limited number of 300. * The Pentax LX 2000 with a SMC Pentax-A 1:1.2 50 mm lens in bright metal finish marked the new millennium in the year 2000. ==References== ==External links== * Bojidar Dimitrov's Pentax K-Mount Equipment Page: LX (early version), LX (late version) * Pentax LX Factory service * The Asahi Optical Historical Club * Leo Foo's Pentax LX site LX Category:135 film cameras Category:Pentax K-mount cameras ","title":"Pentax LX"},{"id":"3264232","text":"Rhys Sutherland is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Home and Away, portrayed by actor Michael Beckley from 2000 to late 2004. ==Casting== Beckley spent 20 years as a theatre actor before he joined the cast of Home and Away he told Joanne McCarthy of the Newcastle Herald. \\"I went to my agent and said, 'I want to do some TV, I want some stability', and I basically fell into Home and Away, and I'm very glad I did.\\" On production, Beckley said \\"You do try to be a one-take wonder because we don't have a lot of resources.

The rest of the time if you make a mistake you say, 'Oops, sorry', and you do it again and get it right.\\" He described Summer Bay as a \\"deadly little place\\" and said \\"You've really got to watch your step. And, of course, no one does. We've often joked that you'd only survive living in Summer Bay for about three hours if it actually existed.\\" ==Storylines== Rhys, his wife Shelley (Paula Forrest) and their three teenage daughters Dani (Tammin Sursok), Kirsty (Christie Hayes) and Jade (Kate Garven) relocate to Summer Bay after purchasing Summer Bay House and the adjoining Caravan Park from Pippa Ross (Debra Lawrence). Rhys takes over the running of the surf club kiosk. When Shelley brings home Brodie Hanson (Susie Rugg) from the local drop-in centre, Rhys has reservations at first but they foster her. Rhys is enraged when he learns Dani has been raped by Kane Phillips (Sam Atwell) and this causes friction within the family. Matters are made worse when Kane is found not guilty and Rhys tries to drive him out of town. Kane eventually leaves of his own accord. Rhys' brother, Pete (Christopher Mayer) and his son Max (Sebastian Elmaloglou), arrive for a visit. It soon becomes apparent that Pete is on the run facing gambling debts and he flees leaving Max in Rhys and Shelley's care. Kirsty's rebellion begins to test Rhy's patience and matters are not helped when she begins seeing Kane, who had saved her and Shelley's lives on a cruise. Rhys forces Kirsty to choose between the family and Kane. Kirsty initially choose's the family but runs away with Kane for a while. Kane eventually dumps Kirsty leaving her to return to the family. Angie Russell (Laurie Foell), a former flame of Rhy's arrives in the bay for their 40th birthday and causes havoc by alleging that Rhys is the father of her son, Dylan (Brett Hicks-Maitland). This news threatens to tear the Sutherland's apart. It's later revealed to the shock of Angie and the Sutherlands, that Rhys is not Dylan's father but the damage to Rhys and Shelley's marriage is done and Shelley moves to the city, leaving Rhys and the girls Heartbroken. Kane later returns and gets back together with Kirsty provoking Rhys' anger even further. Dani is later jailed for running over Kane and Rhys struggles to forgive Kirsty for siding with Kane over her sister. Rhys begins a new relationship with Beth Hunter (Clarissa House) and they later become engaged despite the arguments between their respective broods. On Rhys and Beth's wedding day, everybody is present except for Kirsty who has eloped with Kane. After Dani slowly warms to Kane, Rhys drops his hostilities with Kane. After Kirsty is diagnosed with a kidney problem and miscarries, Shelley returns to donate her kidney. The Sutherlands later discover Jade was switched at birth with another baby, Laura DeGroot (also played by Hayes). Shelley and Rhys began to spend a great deal of time together and eventually fall in love again. Rhys breaks Beth's heart and reunites with Shelley in the city and they remarry a year later. ==Reception== Sacha Molitorisz of The Sydney Morning Herald said that the episode featuring Rhys and Beth's wedding was better suited to \\"die hard fans\\". They criticised the plot for being \\"unengaging\\" and opined that the music, performances and dialogue were \\"painful\\" and \\"patchy\\". ==References== ==External links== * Character profile at the Official AU Home and Away website Category:Home and Away characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2000 Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Rhys Sutherland"},{"id":"3264233","text":"Marcel may refer to: == People == * Marcel (given name), people with the given name Marcel * Étienne Marcel (died 1358), a provost of merchants of Paris * Gabriel Marcel (1889-1973), a French philosopher, Christian existentialist and playwright * Jean-Jacques Marcel (born 1931), a French football player * Rosie Marcel (born 1977), an English actor * Sylvain Marcel (born 1974), a Canadian actor * Terry Marcel (born 1942), a British film director == Other uses == * Marcel (Friends), a fictional monkey of Friends * Marcel (horse), a racehorse * Marcel (novel), a novel by Erwin Mortier * \\"Marcel\\" (song), a German entry for Eurovision 1963 * Marcel, California, in Kern County ==See also== * Marcell (disambiguation) * Marcel wave, a hair styling technique * Saint- Marcel (disambiguation) ","title":"Marcel"},{"id":"3264244","text":"Site of the Shawnee village of Old Chillicothe, located at the present community of Oldtown near where the Battle of Chillicothe took place.

He was attached to the same squad during his professional playing career. He was a member of the Munster team that won the 2002–03 Celtic League and was the winning captain during their 2005–06 Heineken Cup success. Foley played for Ireland from 1995 until 2005 and captained the squad on three occasions. ==Schools rugby== In March 1989, Foley led St. Munchin's College to victory in the Munster Schools Junior Cup. He later represented Munster and Ireland Schools on several occasions over two seasons, notably during the 1992 Irish Schools tour of New Zealand. Winning six games out of eight, Ireland narrowly lost the final game to a New Zealand side featuring Jonah Lomu at number 8. A controversial Jeff Wilson penalty- goal won the game in the final minutes. ==Club career== Foley made his professional debut for Munster against Swansea in November 1995, a game that was also Munster's first ever Heineken Cup fixture. He was in the Munster team that lost 8–9 to Northampton Saints in the 2000 Heineken Cup Final, and was again the runner-up when Munster lost 15–9 to Leicester Tigers in the 2002 Heineken Cup Final. Foley was finally on the winning side when Munster won the 2002–03 Celtic League. When Mick Galwey resigned as Munster captain, Foley narrowly lost to Jim Williams in a vote to decide the next captain. When Williams left Munster in 2005, Foley became the new captain, and in his first season in the position, he led Munster to victory over Biarritz Olympique in the 2006 Heineken Cup Final. Foley had played in all but one of Munster's first 78 Heineken Cup games until a shoulder injury sustained during Munster's 21–19 victory over Leicester Tigers at Welford Road in their first game of the 2006–07 Heineken Cup caused him to miss his side's subsequent victory over Bourgoin, as well as back-to-back games against Cardiff in December 2006. He stood down as captain at the beginning of the 2007–08 season, making way for Paul O'Connell. He was dropped for Munster's final fixtures of the 2007–08 Heineken Cup, and announced his retirement for the end of the season. ==International career== Foley made his debut for Ireland against England in the 1995 Five Nations Championship on 21 January 1995. He scored a try on his debut in an 8-20 defeat. He went to the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa, and played as a replacement in one pool game against Japan which Ireland won 50-28. He missed the 1999 Rugby World Cup, but was selected for the 2003 Rugby World Cup, featuring in two of the pool games against Romania and Australia. Foley captained Ireland three times: in 2001 against Samoa, and in 2002 against Romania and Georgia. His last international was against Wales in the 2005 Six Nations. In total Foley played in 62 matches for Ireland and scored 5 tries against England in 1995, Romania in 2001, Fiji in 2002, France in 2004, and Wales in 2004. ==Coaching career== In March 2011, it was announced that Foley would take over as Munster forwards coach at the end of the 2011 season. He temporarily replaced Gert Smal as Ireland's forwards coach during the 2012 Six Nations Championship, after Smal was forced to miss the remainder of the tournament with an eye condition. Foley signed a contract extension with Munster in May 2013. The following year it was announced that Foley would succeed Rob Penney as Munster's head coach, signing a two-year contract that began on 1 July 2014. ==Personal life and death== He was married to Olive; the couple had two children. His father Brendan Foley and sister also played rugby for Ireland. Foley played Gaelic football for his local GAA club Smith O'Briens in the parish of Killaloe, County Clare. He lined out for Smith O'Briens GAA club in a Munster junior club football semi-final in 2010. He played inter-county hurling for Clare at underage level alongside former Munster rugby player Keith Wood. Foley was nicknamed 'Axel', after the Beverly Hills Cop character.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/10/18/anthony- foley-irish-rugby-player--obituary Foley died in his sleep on 16 October 2016, while staying at a hotel in the Paris suburb of Suresnes with the Munster squad; heart disease had caused an acute pulmonary edema. The team was preparing to face Racing 92 in its opening game of the 2016–17 European Rugby Champions Cup. The match was postponed as a result of Foley's death. President Michael D. Higgins and then-Taoiseach Enda Kenny made tributes to Foley, and the Irish flag flew at half mast at government buildings in Munster. Foley was brought home to Ireland on Wednesday 19 October 2016. His funeral took place on Friday 21 October 2016 at St Flannan's Church in Killaloe, County Clare. On 22 October 2016, in the first game after Foley's death, Munster beat Glasgow 38–17 at a sold-out Thomond Park. Tributes were paid to Foley before, during and after the game and the number 8 jersey was retired for the game, with CJ Stander wearing the number 24 for the occasion. Before their historic first ever win against New Zealand in Soldier Field, Chicago on 5 November 2016, the senior Irish men's team paid tribute to Foley by forming a figure of 8, led by Munster's CJ Stander, Simon Zebo, Conor Murray and Donnacha Ryan, to face the All Blacks Haka. Ahead of a game against Munster on 11 November 2016, the Māori All Blacks team paid tribute to Foley by placing a jersey with his initials on the halfway line before performing a Haka. Māori captain Ash Dixon then presented the jersey to Foley's sons. Munster went on to win the historic game 27–14. On 7 January 2017, further tributes were paid to Foley when the rescheduled Round 1 fixture between Racing 92 and Munster took place. ==Legacy== To honour Foley's memory and contribution to European rugby, the EPCR announced that the 2016–17 European Player of the Year would receive the Anthony Foley Memorial Trophy. The trophy was commissioned with the agreement of the Foley family and Munster Rugby and it is envisaged that it will be presented to all future European Player of the Year winners. In June 2017, a monument to Foley was unveiled in Limerick. In September 2017, Foley was posthumously awarded the Richard Harris Patrons' Award at the annual Munster Rugby London Dinner. The award recognises an individual who encapsulated the values of Munster and was presented to Foley's parents. Over €39,000 in proceeds from the special commemorative programme sold for Munster's match against Glasgow Warriors on 22 October 2016 was raised and donated to various good causes. He was posthumously inducted into the Munster hall of fame during the 2018 Munster Rugby Awards. ==Statistics== ===International analysis by opposition=== { class=\\"sortable \\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - - !

The first Centre, in Cambridge, was set up in 1996. There are now five Centres: Cambridge, Norwich, North-West London, and Reading. There is also an online provision called \\"Red Balloon of the Air\\" whose aim is to provide a recovery programme online to children unable to access a physical Centre. Each Centre is a registered charity, as is Red Balloon Learner Centre Group, which provides centralised support for all Centres. ==General information== The main aims of the Red Balloon are to: * help children who have been severely bullied or suffered trauma * provide a safe environment with clear boundaries for behaviour * provide individual, full-time academic, pastoral and therapeutic programmes * encourage and expect consideration and respect at all times * restore self-confidence * teach students how to respond to bullying * help students regain control of their learning and succeed * help students return as soon as possible to mainstream education, or progress to further education or find worthwhile employment The staff and students at a Centre work together as a community. The Centres provide a range of activities such as textiles, clay-work, painting, African drumming, electric guitar and piano. Typical facilities include a purpose-made science lab, a technology studio, a landscaped garden and a therapy room. There are only fifteen students at any one time, and most of the teaching is done on a one-to-one or small group basis, with the exception of sports, drama and PSHE activities. Notable donors to the Cambridge Red Balloon include the Freemasons' Grand Charity and Cambridge University Press football club. ==References== ==External links== * Read Balloon Learner Centres website.

She first appeared in the episode airing on from 19 June 2000 and departed in the finale of 2002. She made sporadic returns in 2003 and 2004. She made her final appearance on 28 October 2009. ==Casting== In 2009, Forrest made a brief return to the serial as Shelley in order to facilitate her on-screen daughter, Kirsty's (Christie Hayes) departure. ==Storylines== Shelley arrives in Summer Bay with her husband Rhys (Michael Beckley) and their three teenage daughters, Dani (Tammin Sursok), Kirsty and Jade (Kate Garven) after purchasing Summer Bay House and the caravan park from Pippa Ross (Debra Lawrence). Shortly after arriving, Shelley starts work as a counsellor at the Sarah McKay drop-in centre. One of her first cases is Brodie Hanson (Susie Rugg), a teenage runaway who has fled her abusive mother. Shelley takes Brodie home and she and Rhys later foster her. Geoff (John Sheerin), Shelley's father arrives in the bay with news that he is separating from her mother, Avril (Suzanne Dudley) and brings his new girlfriend, Linda with him, which causes friction. When a storm occurs and Geoff goes missing, Shelley begins to think the worst and feels guilty after arguing with him. Geoff is found safe and sound and they resume their relationship. Avril arrives and she and Geoff decide to give their marriage another chance and leave. When Dani is raped by Kane Phillips (Sam Atwell), Shelley supports her and the case goes to court. Kane, however is found not guilty. The following Year, Kane returns as a deckhand aboard a cruise ship during the Bay's sesquicentennial celebrations. The boat sinks and Shelley and Kirsty are marooned with Kane on an island. Shelley is almost attacked by a snake but Kane saves her. Kirsty later develops an attraction to Kane that puts strain on the family. Shelley later discovers that Rhys allegedly has a son, Dylan Russell (Brett Hicks-Maitland), as a result of a one-night stand with old flame, new vice principal; Angie (Laurie Foell) almost twenty years ago. This puts Rhys and Shelley's marriage under tremendous strain. Shelley tries to make the marriage work, even offering Dylan a place to stay. Angie confesses that Rhys is not Dylan's father but the damage already has been done and Shelley moves to the city. She returns and asks the girls to leave with her but they refuse to budge and she leaves again. Shelley soon files for divorce and meets David Callahan (Felix Williamson; Nicholas Cassim), a city lawyer who later represents Dani after she stands trial for running over Kane. Dani loses and is imprisoned. Shelley next appears when Kane, who has now married Kirsty, demands to see her after Kirsty flees to the city following a pregnancy lie. After dropping Kirsty back in the Bay, Shelley finds herself at war with Beth (Clarissa House), Rhys's new wife but they eventually make their peace. When Kirsty suffers kidney problems during pregnancy, Shelley is a match, but David, who has an irrational fear of scars is against her doing so and gives her an ultimatum. Shelley chooses to save her daughter's life and she and David end their relationship. After Rhys and Beth separate, he joins Shelley in the city and they remarry the following year. Shelley returns five years later to comfort Kirsty after she miscarries Miles Copeland's (Josh Quong Tart) baby. Kirsty then decides to take her son Oliver (Oliver Davis) and move to the city with Shelley. They leave without telling Miles. ==References== Category:Home and Away characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2000 Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Shelley Sutherland"},{"id":"3264277","text":"The British Mathematical Olympiad (BMO) forms part of the selection process for the UK International Mathematical Olympiad team. It is organised by the British Mathematical Olympiad Subtrust, which is part of the United Kingdom Mathematics Trust. There are two rounds, the BMO1 and the BMO2.http://www.bmoc.maths.org/home/bmo.shtml, BMO website, list of papers ==BMO Round 1== The first round of the BMO is held in December, and from 2006 is an open entry competition, costing £17 to enter. However, this fee is waived for those who (1) achieve the qualifying mark in the Senior Mathematical Challenge and (2) are British citizens, or will have studied for 3 full years of full-time secondary education in the UK by the time they leave school. The paper lasts 3½ hours, and consists of six questions (from 2005), each worth 10 marks. Candidates are encouraged to write full proofs to the questions they attempt, as a full answer to a question is worth many more marks than incomplete answers to several questions. This is because of the marking scheme: an answer is marked on either a \\"0+\\" or a \\"10-\\" mark scheme, depending on whether the answer looks generally complete or not. So if an answer is judged incomplete or unfinished, it is awarded a few marks for progress and relevant observations, whereas if it is presented as complete and correct, marks are deducted for faults, poor reasoning, or unproven assumptions. As a result, it is quite uncommon for an answer to score a middling mark (i.e. 4–6). Roughly 1300 students sit the BMO1 paper each year, and many of these attain a very low score as a percentage of the total number of marks available—the median score in 2004 was approximately 5 or 6 (out of 50). However, the paper is meant to be a way of selecting the best young mathematicians in the country, and is therefore very difficult. In addition to the British students, there is a history of about 20 students from New Zealand being invited to take part. Generally only about 30–40 students will score more than 50% in BMO1, with perhaps only 1 or 2 scoring above 90%. In 2005, UKMT changed the system and added an extra easier question meaning the median is now raised. In 2008, 23 got over 40 out of 60 and around 50 got over 30. 31 was the mark needed to get into the BMO2. For the December 2010 paper, the mark needed for a year 13 pupil to automatically qualify for BMO2 was 28; it was 22 for a year 12 pupil and 17 for a pupil in year 11 and below. From the results of BMO1, 100 students are chosen to be invited to sit BMO2—generally from amongst the top scorers, although younger students scoring slightly less than their older counterparts are often chosen also. It is possible to pay £22 to sit BMO2, but the candidate must have sat BMO1. ==BMO Round 2== BMO2 (known as the Further International Selection Test, FIST from 1972 to 1991) is normally held in early February, and is significantly more difficult than BMO1. BMO2 also lasts 3½ hours, but consists of only four questions, each worth 10 marks. Like the BMO1 paper, it is not designed to test knowledge of advanced mathematics, but rather the candidate's ability to apply basic ideas to unusual problems. Half of the candidates score less than 10, and it is rare for someone to score more than 35. Twenty of the top scorers from BMO2 are subsequently invited to the training camp at Trinity College, Cambridge for the first stage of the IMO UK team selection. ==IMO Selection Papers== For more information about IMO selection in other countries, see International Mathematical Olympiad selection process Since 1985, further selection tests have been used after BMO2 to select the IMO team. (The team was selected following the single BMO paper from 1967 to 1971, then following the FIST paper for some years from 1972.) Initially these third-stage tests resulted in selection of both team and reserve; from 1993 a squad (team plus reserve) was selected following these tests with the team being separated from the reserve after further correspondence training, and after further selection tests from 2001 onwards. The third-stage tests have had names including FIST 2 (1985), Second International Selection Test (SIST), Reading Selection Test (1987), Final Selection Test (FST, 1992 to 2001) and First Selection Test (FST, from 2002); the fourth-stage tests have been Team Selection Test (TST, 2001) and Next Selection Test (NST, 2002 onwards). These tests have been held at training and selection camps in several locations, recently Trinity College, Cambridge and Oundle School. ==See also== * International Mathematical Olympiad * United Kingdom Mathematics Trust ==References== ==External links== *British Mathematical Olympiad Committee site * Details of UK Mathematics competitions Category:Competitions in the United Kingdom Category:Mathematics competitions Category:Mathematics education in the United Kingdom ","title":"British Mathematical Olympiad"},{"id":"3264279","text":"Rough Cutt is the self-titled debut album of the 80's hard rock/heavy metal band of the same name.

Dawson's father was killed in a road accident when he was six and so his mother placed him in the care of The Royal Orphanage of Wolverhampton. ==Royal Air Force career== Dawson matriculated in 1939 and joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve shortly before war broke out. He was called up as an NCO navigator and had less than 22 hours night-flying experience when he took part in bombing raids over northern Europe in 1941. On 24 July 1941 Dawson was the bomb-aimer and navigator in a Halifax aircraft taking part in an attack against the Scharnhorst, a German battleship that had been harassing North Atlantic convoys. Despite heavy fire from the Scharnhorst and circling Me109s, Dawson, who was by then positioned in the exposed aircraft fore-belly, achieved a perfect bomb release and five direct hits. The fierce German counter-attack resulted in Dawson's aircraft being badly damaged and the rear-gunner being seriously injured. Dawson then crawled to the rear of the aircraft and dragged him to the midsection where he injected him with painkillers. Dawson was awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal and promoted from sergeant navigator to pilot officer for his actions. By the end of the war Dawson had completed 74 missions and added two Distinguished Flying Crosses to his DFM. ==Later life and career== Dawson remained in the air force after the war and was eventually promoted to group captain. He completed his air force career at NATO Headquarters in Brussels, where he was chairman of the Tactical Air Group working on arms-reduction talks with the Warsaw Pact. Dawson retired from the RAF in 1974 and took up an appointment with British Aerospace at Warton Aerodrome in Lancashire. Here he played a key role in implementing Project Al- Yamamah, a huge military training and support contract with the Saudi government. He temporarily retired in 1985 but was persuaded by the company to return for another two years. Dawson spent his retirement fundraising for the Theatre Royal and military museums in Winchester. He also edited the Compton and Shawford parish magazine and campaigned with environmentalists against the M3 motorway extension through Twyford Down. Montagu Dawson died on 7 January 2003.

Simson began the company out of her house with a $25,000 personal investment. She grew the company to forty six employees by 2011. The business concept was to sell experiences and memories rather than gifts. Simson launched the company from her home in Balmain, New South Wales. It was at the end of the dot-com era and she had a difficult time signing up businesses to list with the company. It was a total of two months and four days before the company sold its first experience gift, which resulted in a profit of $9 for commission on the sale. Previous RedBalloon office, Pyrmont NSW The company began to grow six months after pop when it was contacted by Fuji Xerox about using the experiences available on the website as an incentive for its sales force. Companies such as Telstra, Westpac, Commonwealth Bank, and Qantas signed up shortly thereafter. The success of using the experiences for incentives led the company to create RedBalloon Corporate in 2004. From 2001 through 2012, it was reported that the company sold more than 1.7 million gift experiences. The company also reported a 40% growth in their 2012 financial year for overall transaction values. The company also sells experience gift cards in offline retailers such as Target, Big W, and Myer. The company migrated its online infrastructure to cloud-based Amazon Web Services in 2013. The move was to manage peak traffic load which included $1Million in sales on Christmas Eve 2012. Prior to that time, the company used caching and had extra servers on standby to deal with peak loads of traffic to the site. The company also made its first external board appointments in 2013 when it appointed Richard England as Chairman of the Board and Scott Farquhar as a non-executive director. Naomi Simson was CEO of the company until 2011 when she took a step back from the operational side of the business. In October 2013 RedBalloon delivered its two millionth experience. In 2015, Nick Baker was hired as CEO of the company and Ken Boundy became Chairman of the Board. RedBalloon went through a re-branding in late 2015, updating the company logo and website. David Anderson took over as CEO in 2017 after becoming the CEO of the newly formed Big Red Group, a holding company that became the parent of RedBalloon. Anderson purchased 50% of Redballoon in 2017. RedBalloon was fined $43,000 in 2017 by the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission after an investigation found they charged four consumers excessive payment surcharges. ==Awards and recognition== RedBalloon's awards and recognition include being named one of The Great Places to Work by Business Review Weekly from 2009 to 2013 and receiving recognition on the BRW Fast 100 list from 2004 to 2009. The company has also been a regular on the Deloitte Fast 50 for Australia, beginning in 2006.

In October 1929, he won the vacant British flyweight title, knocking out Bert Kirby in three rounds. The BBBofC subsequently recognised Brown as the World Champion, succeeding the later Johnny Hill, and received confirmation from the New York State Athletic Commission that they were willing to allow him to defend the title in the US. In March 1930, he defended the British title against Kirby, and was knocked out in the third round. In February 1931, he met Kirby for the third time, winning back the title with fifteen-round points decision. In May 1931, he won the European flyweight title, beating Lucian Popescu, of Romania on points. In the next two months he defended this title twice, winning on points against Emile Degand, of Belgium and Vincenzo Savo, of Italy. In October 1931, Brown married Mary Chapman. In September 1932, he defended both his titles against Jim Maharg, winning on a disqualification in the eighth, for a low blow. ===World title=== In October 1932, he fought Victor 'Young' Perez, of Tunisia for the World flyweight champion, beating him in thirteen rounds when Perez’ corner threw in the towel. Brown was recognized as world flyweight champion by the National Boxing Association of America. In June and September 1933, he defended his World and European titles against Valentin Angelmann, of France, winning both defences on points. In October 1933 he ran over and killed a woman with his car. In December 1933, he defended his British, European and World titles against Chris ‘Ginger’ Foran of Liverpool, winning on points. In June 1934, he defended his World and European titles against Angelmann, for the third time, this time, after his previous two wins drawing on points. Brown was sentenced to four months imprisonment with hard labour in August 1934 after being convicted of assault by occasioning bodily harm for biting a piece out of the ear of Louis Tarchman in a Manchester street after Tarchman had called him a \\"cheese champion\\". In 1935, Brown was stripped of his European title for not giving Angelmann a return bout. On 29 July 1935, Brown won two fights on the same night, stopping Jackie Quinn in the second round of twelve, and Sid Rose in the third of six. ===Loss of World title=== In September 1935, he defended his British and World flyweight titles against the talented Scottish fighter, Benny Lynch. He lost his titles when the referee stopped the contest in the second round. Later that month, he was fined £10 and had his driving licence endorsed after being caught speeding; At the trial it emerged that he had over 20 previous convictions for driving offences, some of them serious. ===Career as a bantamweight=== Following the loss of his titles, Brown continued fighting as a bantamweight. Having won the Northern Area title in October 1936, in May 1937 he fought holder Johnny King for the British bantamweight title, losing by a knockout in the thirteenth round.

It was originally published in a shorter version, named Riders of the Dawn, in the magazine Giant Western in June 1951. It then was published in hardback in 1956 by Avalon Books and in paperback by Bantam Books in 1957. Bantam Books republished the short version in 1986 along with two other stories ( The trail to crazy man which was expanded later to Crossfire Trail and Showdown on the Hogback, the original version of Showdown at Yellow Butte) under the title The Trail to Crazy Man. ==Plot== Silver Canyon takes place in modern-day San Juan County, just east of the Colorado River, in what is today the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and the Canyon Rims Recreation Area, not many miles upstream from Hite, Utah, which is mentioned in the story. The plot revolves around a young rider and gunfighter, Matt Brennan, who drifts into the town of Hattan's Point and immediately falls in love with a local rancher's daughter, Moira Maclaren. The town and the area around it are dominated by two large ranches, the Boxed M owned by Rud Maclaren, Moira's father, and the CP Ranch owned by the Pinder brothers. With a reason to stay in the area, Brennan buys into the Two-Bar Ranch, owned by old man Ball. The Two-Bar is sandwiched between the Pinder and Maclaren Ranches, and being squeezed out, as the two bigger ranches prepare for their showdown with each other. ==Setting== L'Amour demonstrates knowledge of the terrain. Some of the key features: Hattan's Point, both the mesa and the town, are located on what is today called Middle Point, approximately 12 miles east and 5 north of Hite, above Cataract Canyon on the Colorado River. The Boxed M Ranch headquarters was located just north of Bowdie Canyon (Cottonwood Wash in the story) on Bowdie Point, northeast of Hattan's Point. The Pinder Ranch was headquartered on modern Lean-To Point on the edge of Dark Canyon Primitive Area. Two-Bar Canyon is a branch off the north side of Bowdie Canyon, both of which drain Dark Canyon Plateau which rises to the summit of the Sweet Alice Hills. Located almost due west of Monticello, Utah, access to the area is difficult, requiring use of a series of backcountry trails over the Abajo (Blue) Mountains or off State Route 211 near Newspaper Rock, or by boat and foot/horseback northeast from Hite Marina on the upper end of Lake Powell. The terrain can be as deadly today as it was in the 1880s. This area is the setting of a number of other L'Amour novels, including Dark Canyon and Kilkenny. ==Notes== Category:Novels by Louis L'Amour Category:1956 American novels Category:Works originally published in American magazines Category:Works originally published in pulp magazines Category:Novels set in Utah Category:Fiction set in 1881 ","title":"Silver Canyon"},{"id":"3264332","text":"Sjónvarp Símans (), formerly SkjárEinn, is an Icelandic television channel owned by Síminn.

Jones Memorial Bridge) is a bridge in Harris County, Texas. It was acquired from the then–Texas Turnpike Authority (TTA) (now North Texas Tollway Authority) on May 5, 1994, and is now a part of the Harris County Toll Road Authority system. The bridge opened to traffic in May 1982. It carries four lanes of Beltway 8 over the Houston Ship Channel with a clearance of . ==Conception== The 1952 City of Houston planning document recommended a second loop designated the Outer Belt. Harris County took control of the project in 1960. Efforts to construct the Beltway 8 crossing started in the mid-1960s, culminating in an effort vetoed by Governor John Connally on June 18, 1967. Voters twice rejected bond funds for the bridge, so the effort was reconstituted as a toll bridge. This did not work at that time. In 1978, the Texas Turnpike Authority performed a study showing the project as feasible, and sold $102M (approximately $333.1M in 2008) of bonds to fund it. Among designs looked at, a cable-stayed design was studied, but not sufficiently understood at the time. Such was later used on the Fred Hartman Bridge, but in 1978 when this bridge was designed, the only U.S. example of a cable-stayed bridge was the Ed Hendler Bridge, meaning there was a deficiency of design and construction experience for the bridge type. ==Construction and financing== Construction completed in 1982 and the bridge was opened on May 6. At the time of completion, the bridge was the longest box girder span in the Western Hemisphere, which record it held until 1997 and the opening of the Confederation Bridge. It is no longer in the top 20 of longest box girder spans.Slotboom, p. 367 Traffic volume had been projected to be 4 million vehicles in 1982, but came in at only 1.69 million, a 58-percent shortfall. This was attributed to a lack of connections to the bridge. Additional ramps were completed in 1984, but the results were insufficient to service the bonds. The bonds were refinanced in 1985 at a rate of 12.625 percent (original rate was 7.54 percent), and could not be paid off until July 1, 2002. Total debt service as of the end of 1985 was $522M, with a minimum of $176M.Slotboom, pp.368-370 Traffic volume increased, but not sufficiently to cover the 1985 junk bonds. In 1994, Harris County took over the bridge for the consideration of TxDOT contributing money toward further area highway construction. By 2002, the average toll of $2 brought in approximately $20M, enough to cover bond payments. On January 8, 2016, cash tolls were eliminated and the toll bridge became EZ TAG only; According to the Texas Department of Transportation, this removed the toll plazas into the bridge and drivers going to the bridge will need an EZ Tag. This is because of a widening project. ==Future== In 2018, construction began on a twin-span cable-stayed bridge to replace the existing one. The replacement bridges are designed by Figg Engineering Group and the contractor for the project is Ship Channel Constructors, a joint venture between Traylor Brothers Inc. and Zachry Construction Corp. When completed, each bridge will carry 4 lanes of one-way traffic. The bridges will take three years each to be completed, with the southbound bridge set for completion in 2021 and the northbound bridge in 2024. When the southbound bridge is completed the existing bridge will be demolished and the northbound bridge will be built in its footprint. The electronic tolling started in 2016 will continue throughout the duration of the project. ==See also== *Sidney Sherman Bridge *Fred Hartman Bridge ==References== ==External links== * Harris County Toll Road Authority Category:Toll bridges in Texas Category:Crossings of the Houston Ship Channel Category:Road bridges in Texas Category:Bridges completed in 1982 Category:1982 establishments in Texas Category:Sam Houston Category:Concrete bridges in the United States Category:Box girder bridges in the United States Category:Cantilever bridges in the United States ","title":"Sam Houston Ship Channel Bridge"},{"id":"3264354","text":"The Stadio comunale Carlo Castellani is a multi-purpose stadium in Empoli, Italy.

It was later used by Jewish refugees from the Russian-controlled Jewish areas. The camp was located in Feldafing's Höhenberg area and beyond. == Overview == The camp was opened by the United States Army on May 1, 1945 as an emergency measure to house mostly Hungarian Jews who were in cattle cars when liberated at railroad sidings near at the Tutzing Railroad Station next to a German hospital train. The train has originated from Muhldorf-Mettenheim concentration camp for transporting only Jewish prisoners gathered from Mittergars, Muldorf Wald Lager(Ampfing) and Muhldorf-Mettenheim Concentration Camps to be massacred in the Tyrolian mountains by an SS that was waiting for said transport. The war was near its end when the knowing Wehrmacht transport commander kept delaying the train to be liberated by the advance units of the US Army. The Germans kept guarding the train until the Americans took them prisoner, though the worst of the guards escaped. Some prisoners were immediately transferred to the hospital train and the prisoner train was taken to the track right above the Hitler Youth school in Feldafing (the town next to Tutzing), where the prisoners disembarked. The German Train Commander and two female guards, recognized as having helped the prisoners' survival, were given freedom and living quarters along with the liberated prisoners. In charge of the camp was First Lieutenant Irving J. Smith, a Jewish soldier and peacetime attorney, serving in the Army's Civil Affairs Command. The Feldafing DP camp was formed in the grounds of the Reichsschule Feldafing consisting of seven large two- story buildings, at least a dozen temporary buildings and six or seven associated large villas, an elite school for Hitlerjugend situated in a villa area on Höhenberg and beyond in Feldafing, with an expansive view of the lake. The villas were variously purchased, forcibly sold, or confiscated by the Nazi authorities, often from Jewish owners. A few of the barracks were used as a concentration camp for Russian POW's, who were repatriated after a few months. Russian prisoners were a security risk in terms of robbery, fighting, attempted rape. The remainder of the liberated prisoners were all Jews, most from Hungary. The non-Jews were definitely not included in the subject transport. The large camp buildings were set up as a hospital complex ready to receive German wounded. A large red cross was painted on each of their roofs. One of the barracks was put to immediate use as a hospital for a large number of German sick and wounded. Other buildings were also had treatment facilities for lesser cases. The wounded came from the massacre at Poing and a mistaken allied aircraft strafing. Educational and religious life flourished in Feldafing. In addition to Feldafing's secular elementary and high school systems, the camp's religious community founded several schools, including a Talmud Torah (religious elementary school), a yeshiva (religious academy), and several seminaries including Bet Medrash Lita (Lithuania) and Bet Medrash Ungarn (Hungary). Feldafing also had a rabbinical council that supported its religious office, an agency that held considerable influence within the camp. The camp's extensive library also had a noteworthy religious book collection. Secular instruction was available for adults at an evening school, an ORT vocational training school, and a nursing school. Housed in a separate kinderblock of 450 children and adolescents, many of Feldafing's youngsters organized into \\"kibbutzim\\" groups interested in aliyah to Eretz Israel. These included secular kibbutzim like \\"Shayeret Zvi\\" and \\"Zerubavel,\\" and religious kibbutzim such as \\"Chafetz Chaim\\" and \\"Ohel Sarah.\\" Several newspapers were published in Feldafing, including Dos Fraje Wort (The Free Word) and Dos Jiddishe Wort (The Jewish Word) as well as supplementary magazines like the Feldafinger Magazin. Theater troupes such as the \\"Partisans\\" and \\"Habima\\" entertained the camp population. Camp residents also organized an orchestra. The theatre troupe, \\"Amchu\\" [Yiddish: your people], was sponsored by the camp's Jewish Workers Committee.Holdings Registry file No. 20826, Jonas Turkow collection, Ghetto Fighters' House Archives General Dwight D. Eisenhower personally inspected the living conditions of Feldafing in September 1945. The hospital, as well as additional housing, was a direct result of the Harrison report and Eisenhower's visit to the camp. Footage of Eisenhower's visit shows crowds of survivors surrounding Eisenhower, much as they did when Zionist leaders like David Ben-Gurion visited the camp. Ben-Gurion's initial visit to the camp in October 1945 was an important boost of confidence to the population of Feldafing and its central committee. As the first all-Jewish DP camp in the U.S. zone, Feldafing also marked the site of the first elected Jewish camp committee. Feldafing's camp committee was subdivided into several offices, including staffs for housing, provisions, economics, sanitation, culture, and legal matters. The strong camp court launched a project to codify laws for the camp in 1946 and led a movement to standardize law for all the Sh'erit ha-Pletah in the U.S. zone of Germany. The court also issued decisions concerning several former kapos living within the camp. The Feldafing court helped investigate the perpetrators of the Kielce pogrom of 1946 and publicized information about the Nazi murderers of Lithuanian Jews who were thought to have been in the vicinity. In 1946, about 4,000 Jews lived at Feldafing and by Passover 1951, 1,585 Jewish DPs remained in the camp. The camp went over to German administration on December 1, 1951, and closed in March 1953. == Notes == This article incorporates text from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum webpage, and has been released under the GFDL licence.

Variations in the mechanism can be anticipated. The ribosome has three active sites: the A site, the P site, and the E site. The A site is the point of entry for the aminoacyl tRNA (except for the first aminoacyl tRNA, which enters at the P site). The P site is where the peptidyl tRNA is formed in the ribosome. And the E site which is the exit site of the now uncharged tRNA after it gives its amino acid to the growing peptide chain. The selection of an initiation site (usually an AUG codon) depends on the interaction between the 30S subunit and the mRNA template. The 30S subunit binds to the mRNA template at a purine-rich region (the Shine- Dalgarno sequence) upstream of the AUG initiation codon. The Shine-Dalgarno sequence is complementary to a pyrimidine rich region on the 16S rRNA component of the 30S subunit. This sequence has been evolutionarily conserved and plays a major role in the microbial world we know today. During the formation of the initiation complex, these complementary nucleotide sequences pair to form a double stranded RNA structure that binds the mRNA to the ribosome in such a way that the initiation codon is placed at the P site. Well-known coding regions that do not have AUG initiation codons are those of lacI (GUG) and lacA (UUG) in the E. coli lac operon. Two studies have independently shown that 17 or more non-AUG start codons may initiate translation in E. coli. ==Elongation== Elongation of the polypeptide chain involves addition of amino acids to the carboxyl end of the growing chain. The growing protein exits the ribosome through the polypeptide exit tunnel in the large subunit.Structure of the E. coli protein-conducting channel bound to at translating ribosome, K. Mitra, et al. Nature (2005), vol 438, p 318 Elongation starts when the fMet-tRNA enters the P site, causing a conformational change which opens the A site for the new aminoacyl-tRNA to bind. This binding is facilitated by elongation factor-Tu (EF-Tu), a small GTPase. For fast and accurate recognition of the appropriate tRNA, the ribosome utilizes large conformational changes (conformational proofreading). Now the P site contains the beginning of the peptide chain of the protein to be encoded and the A site has the next amino acid to be added to the peptide chain. The growing polypeptide connected to the tRNA in the P site is detached from the tRNA in the P site and a peptide bond is formed between the last amino acids of the polypeptide and the amino acid still attached to the tRNA in the A site. This process, known as peptide bond formation, is catalyzed by a ribozyme (the 23S ribosomal RNA in the 50S ribosomal subunit). Now, the A site has the newly formed peptide, while the P site has an uncharged tRNA (tRNA with no amino acids). The newly formed peptide in the A site tRNA is known as dipeptide and the whole assembly is called dipeptidyl-tRNA. The tRNA in the P site minus the amino acid is known to be deacylated. In the final stage of elongation, called translocation, the deacylated tRNA (in the P site) and the dipeptidyl-tRNA (in the A site) along with its corresponding codons move to the E and P sites, respectively, and a new codon moves into the A site. This process is catalyzed by elongation factor G (EF-G). The deacylated tRNA at the E site is released from the ribosome during the next A-site occupation by an aminoacyl-tRNA again facilitated by EF-Tu. The ribosome continues to translate the remaining codons on the mRNA as more aminoacyl-tRNA bind to the A site, until the ribosome reaches a stop codon on mRNA(UAA, UGA, or UAG). The translation machinery works relatively slowly compared to the enzyme systems that catalyze DNA replication. Proteins in bacteria are synthesized at a rate of only 18 amino acid residues per second, whereas bacterial replisomes synthesize DNA at a rate of 1000 nucleotides per second. This difference in rate reflects, in part, the difference between polymerizing four types of nucleotides to make nucleic acids and polymerizing 20 types of amino acids to make proteins. Testing and rejecting incorrect aminoacyl-tRNA molecules takes time and slows protein synthesis. In bacteria, translation initiation occurs as soon as the 5' end of an mRNA is synthesized, and translation and transcription are coupled. This is not possible in eukaryotes because transcription and translation are carried out in separate compartments of the cell (the nucleus and cytoplasm). ==Termination== Termination occurs when one of the three termination codons moves into the A site. These codons are not recognized by any tRNAs. Instead, they are recognized by proteins called release factors, namely RF1 (recognizing the UAA and UAG stop codons) or RF2 (recognizing the UAA and UGA stop codons). These factors trigger the hydrolysis of the ester bond in peptidyl-tRNA and the release of the newly synthesized protein from the ribosome. A third release factor RF-3 catalyzes the release of RF-1 and RF-2 at the end of the termination process. == Recycling == The post-termination complex formed by the end of the termination step consists of mRNA with the termination codon at the A-site, an uncharged tRNA in the P site, and the intact 70S ribosome. Ribosome recycling step is responsible for the disassembly of the post-termination ribosomal complex. Once the nascent protein is released in termination, Ribosome Recycling Factor and Elongation Factor G (EF-G) function to release mRNA and tRNAs from ribosomes and dissociate the 70S ribosome into the 30S and 50S subunits. IF3 then replaces the deacylated tRNA releasing the mRNA. All translational components are now free for additional rounds of translation. Depending on the tRNA, IF1–IF3 may also perform recycling. ==Polysomes== Translation is carried out by more than one ribosome simultaneously. Because of the relatively large size of ribosomes, they can only attach to sites on mRNA 35 nucleotides apart. The complex of one mRNA and a number of ribosomes is called a polysome or polyribosome. ==Regulation of translation== When bacterial cells run out of nutrients, they enter stationary phase and downregulate protein synthesis. Several processes mediate this transition. For instance, in E. coli, 70S ribosomes form 90S dimers upon binding with a small 6.5 kDa protein, ribosome modulation factor RMF. These intermediate ribosome dimers can subsequently bind a hibernation promotion factor (the 10.8 kDa protein, HPF) molecule to form a mature 100S ribosomal particle, in which the dimerization interface is made by the two 30S subunits of the two participating ribosomes. The ribosome dimers represent a hibernation state and are translationally inactive. A third protein that can bind to ribosomes when E. coli cells enter the stationary phase is YfiA (previously known as RaiA). HPF and YfiA are structurally similar, and both proteins can bind to the catalytic A- and P-sites of the ribosome. RMF blocks ribosome binding to mRNA by preventing interaction of the messenger with 16S rRNA. When bound to the ribosomes the C-terminal tail of E. coli YfiA interferes with the binding of RMF, thus preventing dimerization and resulting in the formation of translationally inactive monomeric 70S ribosomes. Mechanism of ribosomal subunit dissociation by RsfS (= RsfA). RsfS inactivates translation when cells starve (\\"S\\") and thus are short on amino acids. In addition to ribosome dimerization, the joining of the two ribosomal subunits can be blocked by RsfS (formerly called RsfA or YbeB). RsfS binds to L14, a protein of the large ribosomal subunit, and thereby blocks joining of the small subunit to form a functional 70S ribosome, slowing down or blocking translation entirely. RsfS proteins are found in almost all eubacteria (but not archaea) and homologs are present in mitochondria and chloroplasts (where they are called C7orf30 and iojap, respectively). However, it is not known yet how the expression or activity of RsfS is regulated. Another ribosome- dissociation factor in Escherichia coli is HflX, previously a GTPase of unknown function. Zhang et al. (2015) showed that HflX is a heat shock–induced ribosome-splitting factor capable of dissociating vacant as well as mRNA- associated ribosomes. The N-terminal effector domain of HflX binds to the peptidyl transferase center in a strikingly similar manner as that of the class I release factors and induces dramatic conformational changes in central intersubunit bridges, thus promoting subunit dissociation. Accordingly, loss of HflX results in an increase in stalled ribosomes upon heat shock and possibly other stress conditions. == Effect of antibiotics== Several antibiotics exert their action by targeting the translation process in bacteria. They exploit the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation mechanisms to selectively inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria without affecting the host. == See also == * Prokaryotic initiation factors * Prokaryotic elongation factors == References == Category:Molecular biology Category:Protein biosynthesis Category:Gene expression ","title":"Bacterial translation"},{"id":"3264389","text":"Eukaryotic translation is the biological process by which messenger RNA is translated into proteins in eukaryotes. It consists of four phases: initiation, elongation, termination, and recycling. ==Initiation== The process of initiation of translation in eukaryotes. ===Cap-dependent initiation=== some of the protein complexes involved in initiation Initiation of translation usually involves the interaction of certain key proteins, the initiation factors, with a special tag bound to the 5'-end of an mRNA molecule, the 5' cap, as well as with the 5' UTR. These proteins bind the small (40S) ribosomal subunit and hold the mRNA in place. eIF3 is associated with the 40S ribosomal subunit and plays a role in keeping the large (60S) ribosomal subunit from prematurely binding. eIF3 also interacts with the eIF4F complex, which consists of three other initiation factors: eIF4A, eIF4E, and eIF4G. eIF4G is a scaffolding protein that directly associates with both eIF3 and the other two components. eIF4E is the cap-binding protein. Binding of the cap by eIF4E is often considered the rate-limiting step of cap-dependent initiation, and the concentration of eIF4E is a regulatory nexus of translational control. Certain viruses cleave a portion of eIF4G that binds eIF4E, thus preventing cap-dependent translation to hijack the host machinery in favor of the viral (cap-independent) messages. eIF4A is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase that aids the ribosome by resolving certain secondary structures formed along the mRNA transcript. The poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) also associates with the eIF4F complex via eIF4G, and binds the poly-A tail of most eukaryotic mRNA molecules. This protein has been implicated in playing a role in circularization of the mRNA during translation. This 43S preinitiation complex (43S PIC) accompanied by the protein factors moves along the mRNA chain toward its 3'-end, in a process known as 'scanning', to reach the start codon (typically AUG). In eukaryotes and archaea, the amino acid encoded by the start codon is methionine. The Met-charged initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAiMet) is brought to the P-site of the small ribosomal subunit by eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2). It hydrolyzes GTP, and signals for the dissociation of several factors from the small ribosomal subunit, eventually leading to the association of the large subunit (or the 60S subunit). The complete ribosome (80S) then commences translation elongation. Regulation of protein synthesis is partly influenced by phosphorylation of eIF2 (via the α subunit), which is a part of the eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAiMet ternary complex (eIF2-TC). When large numbers of eIF2 are phosphorylated, protein synthesis is inhibited. This occurs under amino acid starvation or after viral infection. However, a small fraction of this initiation factor is naturally phosphorylated. Another regulator is 4EBP, which binds to the initiation factor eIF4E and inhibits its interactions with eIF4G, thus preventing cap-dependent initiation. To oppose the effects of 4EBP, growth factors phosphorylate 4EBP, reducing its affinity for eIF4E and permitting protein synthesis. While protein synthesis is globally regulated by modulating the expression of key initiation factors as well as the number of ribosomes, individual mRNAs can have different translation rates due to the presence of regulatory sequence elements. This has been shown to be important in a variety of settings including yeast meiosis and ethylene response in plants. In addition, recent work in yeast and humans suggest that evolutionary divergence in cis-regulatory sequences can impact translation regulation. Additionally, RNA helicases such as DHX29 and Ded1/DDX3 may participate in the process of translation initiation, especially for mRNAs with structured 5'UTRs. ===Cap-independent initiation=== The best- studied example of cap-independent translation initiation in eukaryotes uses the internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Unlike cap-dependent translation, cap-independent translation does not require a 5' cap to initiate scanning from the 5' end of the mRNA until the start codon. The ribosome can localize to the start site by direct binding, initiation factors, and/or ITAFs (IRES trans-acting factors) bypassing the need to scan the entire 5' UTR. This method of translation is important in conditions that require the translation of specific mRNAs during cellular stress, when overall translation is reduced. Examples include factors responding to apoptosis and stress-induced responses. ==Elongation== The elongation and membrane targeting stages of eukaryotic translation. The ribosome is green and yellow, the tRNAs are dark-blue, and the other proteins involved are light-blue Elongation depends on eukaryotic elongation factors. At the end of the initiation step, the mRNA is positioned so that the next codon can be translated during the elongation stage of protein synthesis. The initiator tRNA occupies the P site in the ribosome, and the A site is ready to receive an aminoacyl-tRNA. During chain elongation, each additional amino acid is added to the nascent polypeptide chain in a three-step microcycle. The steps in this microcycle are (1) positioning the correct aminoacyl-tRNA in the N site of the ribosome, which is brought into that site by eIF3, (2) forming the peptide bond and (3) shifting the mRNA by one codon relative to the ribosome. Unlike bacteria, in which translation initiation occurs as soon as the 5' end of an mRNA is synthesized, in eukaryotes such tight coupling between transcription and translation is not possible because transcription and translation are carried out in separate compartments of the cell (the nucleus and cytoplasm). Eukaryotic mRNA precursors must be processed in the nucleolus (e.g., capping, polyadenylation, splicing) before they are exported to the golgi body for translation. Translation can also be affected by ribosomal pausing, which can trigger endonucleolytic attack of the tRNA, a process termed mRNA no-go decay. Ribosomal pausing also aids co-translational folding of the nascent polypeptide on the ribosome, and delays protein translation while it is encoding tRNA. This can trigger ribosomal continuation. ==Termination== Termination of elongation depends on eukaryotic release factors. The process is similar to that of prokaryotic termination, but unlike prokaryotic termination, there is a universal release factor, eRF1, that recognizes all three stop codons. Upon termination, the ribosome is disassembled and the completed polypeptide is released. eRF3 is a ribosome-dependent GTPase that helps eRF1 release the completed polypeptide. The human genome encodes a few genes whose mRNA stop codon are surprisingly leaky: In these genes, termination of translation is inefficient due to special RNA bases in the vicinity of the stop codon. Leaky termination in these genes leads to translational readthrough of up to 10% of the stop codons of these genes. Some of these genes encode functional protein domains in their readthrough extension so that new protein isoforms can arise. This process has been termed 'functional translational readthrough'. == See also == * 40S * 60S * 80S * Eukaryotic initiation factor * Eukaryotic elongation factors * Eukaryotic release factors == References == == External links == * Animation at wku.edu * Animations at nobelprize.org Category:Molecular biology Category:Protein biosynthesis Category:Gene expression Category:Eukaryote genetics ","title":"Eukaryotic translation"},{"id":"3264391","text":"Alexandre de Pontes (1968–1993), also known as Xandinho, was a Brazilian bodyboarder, and one of the first Brazilians to gain widespread international recognition in the sport.

The village lies five miles (8 km) north of Hastings. Carr-Taylor Vineyards is situated nearby. There is still a village shop with Post Office, butchers and hairdressers. There is one pub currently The New Inn(previously called \\"The Old Courthouse\\". The village's second pub \\"The Plough\\" closed down in 2018. Westfield School opened in 1877 and is a popular choice with parents within the surrounding areas. It was known as Westewelle in the Domesday survey. A prominent sight when entering the village from the south is the church, dedicated to St. John the Baptist. Its many features include extensive buttressing, a 12th-century porch and a 14th-century font with an elaborate 17th-century cover. Above the door to the tower there is carved a Royal Coat of Arms with the list of vicars since 1250 set below. Looking towards the nave there is a Norman arch with squint windows to the side, cut through the 32 inches of stone. Another feature at the road entrance is the lychgate, with its four carved angels; this was added in 1887. The history of Westfield has been extensively researched by a resident of Westfield descended from a family who appear in the records from 1552.

It is located at the intersection of Shoreditch High Street with Hackney Road, within the London Borough of Hackney in East London. The current building dates from about 1740. The church is mentioned in the line \\"When I grow rich, say the bells of Shoreditch\\" from the nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons.The Centre of Attention at Shoreditch Church accessed 06/01/08 The crypt beneath the church is the final resting place of many actors from the Tudor period. ==Origins== The original church is possibly Saxon in origin, though the first historical reference to it occurs in the 12th century. Memorial to Tudor actors buried in the church The church was situated near The Theatre, England's first purpose-built playhouse, built in Shoreditch in 1576, and the nearly contemporary Curtain Theatre (built in 1577).The Bells of Shoreditch accessed 06/01/08 Several members of the theatrical profession from the Elizabethan period are buried in the church, including: *James Burbage, the founder of The Theatre, England's first playhouse. *His son Richard, who was the leading man in many of Shakespeare's plays, which were first performed in the contemporary Shoreditch theatres. *The comedian Richard Tarlton, who was a stalwart of the pre-Shakespearian stage. *The actor Gabriel Spenser, who was killed by Ben Jonson in a duel. These, with others of their profession from the period, are commemorated by a large classical memorial erected by the London Shakespeare League in 1913, inside the church, which serves as a reminder of Shoreditch's Shakespearian heritage. The Shoreditch Vestry levied a special poor rate in 1774 for the purpose of setting up a workhouse for the parish of St. Leonard's, which highlights the level of poverty in the area. ==Current building== One of the bells, removed for maintenance Following a partial collapse of the tower in 1716, the medieval church was rebuilt in Palladian style by George Dance the Elder during 1736–40, with a soaring steeple 192 feet tall—an imitation of Christopher Wren's magnificent steeple on St Mary-le-Bow in Cheapside—and a giant four-columned, pedimented Tuscan portico. Inside the church, the entablature is supported by giant Doric columns. Dance was also architect of the Mansion House. Many original 18th-century fixtures and fittings remain, including the font, the pulpit, the communion table, clock, organ case, bread cupboards and commandment boards.

It lies near Hornafjörður fjord. The town, the second largest in the southeastern part of Iceland, offers scenic views of Vatnajökull (the largest ice cap in Europe by volume). The community was formerly known as Hornafjarðarbær between 1994 and 1998. ==Geography== Höfn harbour Höfn from above Höfn is located on a peninsula in the southeast of Iceland. The name Höfn means harbour and it is a fishing port surrounded on three sides by the sea, with beaches on a long shoreline to the southeast. Shoals and glacial rivers traverse this area with many shifting lagoons and sand reefs being formed. Höfn is surrounded by several small islands to the east of the town, the largest of which is Mikley, followed by Krókalátur and Hellir. Höfn is one of very few harbours in the southern part of Iceland and it needs to be navigated with care due to the changing pattern of shoals. Dredging is an essential requirement to remove sand that has accumulated near the harbour so that ships can safely moor. The entrance channel to Höfn port has a minimum depth of . However, the depth at the entrance itself is . The harbour at Höfn is reported to freeze during periods of extremely cold weather. Eagle Airways operates domestic flights from Höfn airport and the town is a major centre for visitors to the Vatnajökull Glacier. Höfn lies at the end of Road 99, which leaves Iceland's National Road 1 several kilometres north of the town. A tunnel is located near the town, measuring 1,300 metres in length, which is named Almannaskarðsgöng. It was opened in 2005. Nearby areas include Suðursveit (the birthplace of Þórbergur Þórðarson), Öræfasveit, Lón, Mýrar and Nes. In Nes there is a small village called Nesjahverfi. Reykjavík, the capital of Iceland, is about from Höfn along the south coast. ==Economy== Hafnarkirkja, Höfn The main economic activities in Höfn are fishing and tourism. Fishing involves both sea fishing and processing and packaging in the factories; one major fish processing factory, Skinney- Þinganes is one of the largest fish factories in the eastern part of Iceland, which employs a large number of people. The main production of these factories is bacaloa (saltfish) and processed lobster. Herring and capelin are also processed. Ten large and a number of smaller boats operate from Höfn. During the summer tourist season, trips are organised to the nearby Vatnajökull glacier. The surrounding area has served as a filming location for feature films including the James Bond movies Die Another Day and A View to a Kill, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, and Batman Begins. Recently a song in the 2015 Bollywood movie \\"Dilwale\\" has been shot in the surrounding areas.http://icelandreview.com/de/node/82549 Höfn offers a variety of services and stores including a supermarket, pharmacy, a bank, three hairdressers, two gas stations and a swimming pool. In the town there are several guesthouses and restaurants. Restaurants including Pakkhúsið, Humarhöfnin, Íshúsið Pizzeria, Ottó, Kaffihornið, Ósinn, Z Bistro and Hafnarbúðin. The headland of the town is called the Ingólfshöfði, which is high and (in a direct line) from the town. Sea birds such as skuas, guillemots, fulmar and puffins can be seen from the headland. ==Culture== A cultural highlight of the town is the annual Humarhátíð (a lobster festival) held on the first weekend of July. During the summer season, the Glacier Exhibition is held in the old supermarket building. Höfn contains several museums, including an exhibition about the Vatnajökulsþjóðgarð in Gamlabúð which has a variety of displays on the geology, ecology and history of the glacier. == Gamlabúð == thumb Gamlabúð (\\"Old Shop\\") is one of the oldest houses in Höfn still being used. It has served at least three purposes and has been moved around southeast Iceland. First it was a trade center in Papós and then it was a store in Höfn. Most recently it has been moved again and now it serves as an information center.Author unknown. Hornafjörður Cultural Centre.

Now, the three schools have been merged into one school called Grunnskóli Hornafjarðar. In the secondary school Framhaldsskólinn í Austur-Skaftafellssýslu 70 to 100 students study in the day school and over 100 students are under distance-study programmes. The school maintains close collaboration with other schools in Iceland, the College in Egilsstaðir and the Vocational School in Neskaupstaður. The school has modern teaching facilities such as wireless internet, a computer centre, availability of laptop computers for students, overhead projectors and built-in sound systems.

It is situated in the Vesturbyggð municipality and has 200 inhabitants (as of January 2016). The village prospered in the 19th century thanks to sound business enterprise and the booming fishing industry. Ólafur Thorlacius (1761–1815) set up business in Bíldudalur following the end of the Danish trade monopoly. He was one of the most influential businessmen in Iceland at the beginning of the 19th century. He bought and sold fish, traded goods and ran his own small fishing fleet. One of his successors, Pétur J. Thorsteinnsson (1854–1924) successfully continued this operation. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the decline of the fishing industry and the imposition of strict quotas by the Icelandic government led the town to diversify its economy. The village is now home to a factory, which provides employment to many residents, processing a mineral-rich algae found in abundance in the fjord.

The stadium replaced the old Stadio Carlo Pranzo, which was named after a young soldier from Lecce killed in the First World War. On October 2 of that year, the first match between teams from Italy was played with Lecce beating local rivals Taranto 1–0. In 1967 Lecce played a friendly against famous Pelé's Santos here. The initial capacity was 16,000 spectators. In 1976, the capacity was increased to 20,500 seats. With the historic first promotion of Lecce to Serie A in 1985 the stadium was almost completely rebuilt and capacity greatly increased to 55,000, which made it the 6th stadium in Italy by capacity until Fifa World Cup 1990.https://www.leccenews24.it/sport/calcio/la-storia-del- lecce-calcio-dal-1975-a-oggi-terza-puntata.htm Both the Curva Nord, now the terrace of the organized fan groups led by the Ultrà Lecce, and Curva Sud, where Gioventù are based were rebuilt. The tribuna and Distinti were also upgraded and then, to ensure that all seats were numbered, capacity was reduced to 40,670 seats. The seats are colored red and yellow (the colours of U.S. Lecce) and on the Tribuna Est is an inscription of \\"U.S. Lecce\\". After this almost total renovation, the stadium in Lecce, along with the Stadio Friuli in Udine, was the only stadium ready for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. However the funding for a venue allocated to the region of Apulia went to the Stadio San Nicola in Bari, which caused some controversy. During the first day of the Serie B 2007–08 championship, the press room of the stadium was named after the local journalist Sergio Vantaggiato, who died in tragic circumstances in August 2007. The plaque was presented by his son, Martino, in the presence of various local authorities, the management of U.S. Lecce and some journalists of different newspapers. On November 1, 2007, during a regular training session, lightning struck the ground and killed Antonio De Giorgi, a U.S. Lecce equipment manager.

It is one of the first American graphic novels, predating works such as Richard Corben's Bloodstar (1976), Jim Steranko's Chandler: Red Tide (1976), Don McGregor and Paul Gulacy's Sabre (Sept. 1978), and Will Eisner's A Contract with God (Oct. 1978). It was conceived and drawn by comic book artist Gil Kane, and scripted by Archie Goodwin from an outline by Kane. The term \\"graphic novel\\", while seen in print as early as 1964 in an obscure fan publication, was not in mainstream use in 1971 when Blackmark, a science fiction/sword-and-sorcery adventure, was first published; the back- cover blurb of the 30th-anniversary edition published in 2002 calls the book, retroactively, \\"the very first American graphic novel.\\" A 119-page story of comic-book art, with captions and word balloons, published in a traditional book format, Blackmark is the first graphic novel with an original heroic- adventure character conceived expressly for this form. It originally sold for 75 cents, comparable to other paperbacks at the time. ==Publication history== Detail from Blackmark (1971) by scripter Archie Goodwin and artist-plotter Gil Kane Gil Kane — an established comics artist who helped usher in the Silver Age of comic books with his part in revamping the DC Comics characters Green Lantern and the Atom, and who drew The Amazing Spider-Man during a historically notable 1970s run — had experimented with the graphic novel form with his 1968 black-and-white comics magazine His Name is... Savage, a 40-page espionage thriller scripted by Archie Goodwin from an outline by Kane. According to Kane in a 1996 interview, Bantam Books CEO Oscar Dystel had personally taken Kane's pitch after Kane's attorney had secured him an appointment through a mutual friend of the attorney's and Dystel's. Kane went on to say Bantam contracted for four books, and increased the order to eight after Dystel saw and liked the completed pages of the first. Kane said Bantam paid him $3,500 for 120 pages (including the cover) all written, drawn and lettered in \\"camera-ready\\" form, i.e., in completed form suitable to go immediately to the printing press. Kane recalled having to draw \\"30 pages in one week. Then I'd have to knock off for a week or two to make some additional money\\" drawing comic-book stories and, mainly, covers. Goodwin recalled that he came in at \\"the 11th hour\\": The 2002 reissue, in its afterword, credits cartoonist and Mad magazine founder Harvey Kurtzman as laying out a small number of pages, and another major comics artist, Neal Adams, as inking some of Kane's pencil work, both doing so as a favor to help Kane meet his deadlines. Adams' own website, however, states that Adams did not ink but rather \\"penciled pages 80/81/82/92/98-107 / (total of 14pgs.)\\"\\"Book Covers and Illustration\\", NealAdams.com. WebCitation archive. and \\"Neal penciled 14 pages with Gil Kane inks (pages 80,81,82,92,98-107)\\".\\"Magazines and Fanzines\\", NealAdams.com. WebCitation archive. Though Bantam had envisioned a series of eight books, the publisher halted plans after the first sold less well than expected. Kane maintained that, Kane also partly blamed Tarzan comic strip writer-artist Burne Hogarth, an influential figure in the field, for the series' demise: The planned sequel eventually premiered in Marvel Preview #17. Cover art by Romas Kukalis. By this time Kane had already completed The Mind Demons, which eventually premiered — with its contents intact but its panel- layout reconfigured — as the 62-page Marvel Comics magazine Marvel Preview #17 (Winter 1979). In an early use of the term, it was called a graphic novel on the cover. The first Blackmark book had already been reprinted by then — similarly with its contents intact but its panel-layout reconfigured — in Marvel's black-and-white comics-magazine omnibus The Savage Sword of Conan #1-4 (Aug. 1974 - Feb. 1975), as the 15-page \\"Blackmark\\" and the 14-page \\"Blackmark (Chapter 2)\\", \\"The Testing Of Blackmark\\", and \\"Blackmark Triumphant!\\" The 2002 reissue did not include the original's one-paragraph biography of Kane. The 30th-anniversary edition () includes both the original book and the 117-page sequel The Mind Demons; an eight-page historical afterword; and the original paperback's double-page frontispiece. It does not include the original final page: a full-body shot of Blackmark with sword, and a Kane floating-head self-portrait and one-paragraph biography / afterword. Blackmark is unrelated to the music company Black Mark at blackmark.net, or to the fictional insurgent group Blackmark in the TV series Babylon 5. ==Plot== Old Earth is dead, devastated by the nuclear holocausts. New Earth lives on as a shadow world, inhabited by the vestiges of humanity, divided into tyrannical petty kingdoms, wracked by fear, superstitions, and barbaric poverty. Strange, fearsome mutated beast roam the blasted lands and waters, while on the cold northern frontiers, a race of malformed men with strange mental powers plot the eventual conquest of the planet from the fortress of Psi-Keep. Zeph the Tinker travels with his young wife Marnie from Country Clayro through Country McCall and the Demon Waste. While Zeph is hunting game, Marnie is startled by two riders fleeing pursuers. The riders — the dying wizard-king Amarix and his companion Balzamo — make the barren woman a deal to not only transfer the post-holocaust knowledge in his head to Marnie, but to make it possible for that information to be passed onto her unborn child That child, Blackmark, eventually becomes a gladiator slave. ==Awards== The book won its creator, Gil Kane, a Shazam Award for Special Recognition in 1973 \\"for Blackmark, his paperback comics novel.\\" ==Critical assessments== Associate Professor Matt Thorn of the School of Cartoon & Comic Art, Kyoto Seika University, in Japan, said of the 1971 paperback: \\"[I]t's a great read, beautifully illustrated. ... I found the separation of text and images to be no obstacle, and was soon absorbed in the story and art. And speaking of art, this is truly Kane at his finest. Here I think he approaches his own ideal of portraying 'life in motion'. Melodramatic? Cheesy? Maybe. Blackmark is pulp entertainment at its best\\". Additional . Critic Randy Lander, in a review of the reissue, said Blackmark \\"started to push the boundaries of what comics could do. The book does not look particularly revolutionary in 2002, but when you consider that it was created over 30 years ago, this illustrated novel that is a mixture of science-fiction and fantasy genres and is unquestionably aimed at an adult audience, starts to look a lot more impressive. ...Goodwin and Kane take a fairly predictable plot and stock characters and make it a fascinating and twisted ride. ... The material sometimes features cheesy dialogue or veers into melodrama, but mostly it holds up remarkably well. It's hard to argue against the merits of Blackmark. It's a piece of comic-book history, a solidly produced book and an example of work from two of the finest creators to grace the medium\\". Additional . Comics historian R. C. Harvey notes that \\"several sequences ... gain enormous power from the juxtaposition of pictures and prose.\\" Breaking down a four-page scene in which the mother of a six-year-old Blackmark is raped as the child is forced to look on, Harvey observes that, ==References== ==External links== * Blackmark and Blackmark 30th Anniversary Edition at the Grand Comics Database * Blackmark at the Michigan State University Libraries: Index to the Comic Art Collection.

It is the northernmost village in Cambridgeshire (bordering Lincolnshire), on the same latitude as Midlands towns such as Loughborough, Leicestershire and Shrewsbury, Shropshire. The village is in the distribution area of one local free newspaper, The Fenland Citizen. ==History== The name 'Tydd' derives from a corruption of the word \\"Tide\\",http://www.fenland.gov.uk/assets/localplan/downloads/part2/Tydd%20St%20Giles/Tydd%20St%20Giles[1].pdf as the village was home to an important sluice used for draining the Fens. Although many Fenland names derive from Anglo-Saxon words, a few scattered around Wisbech include Anglo-Saxon words referencing the native British population. Although the village is old enough, it does not appear in the Domesday Book, because the village was in the liberty of the Bishop of Ely.A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 4: City of Ely: Ely N. and S. Witchford and the Wisbech Hundreds, Authors: R B Pugh (Editor), T D Atkinson, Ethel M Hampson, E T Long, C A F Meekings, Edward Miller, H B Wells, G M G Woodgate, Cambridge 2002 pp. 224–232 Tydd St Giles was founded in the late 11th century with the building of the church of St. Giles in 1084 on a natural rise in the land of the Fens. The church was built of Barnack stone, known to be the gift of the Bishop of Peterborough. ===Village guilds=== The village had three guilds: the Guild of our Lady (1350), the Guild of the Holy Cross (1385) and the Guild of St Giles (1386). ;The Guild of Our Lady The Guild of Our Lady had a membership restricted to twelve brethren. It was founded by William Everswell, chaplain and Nicholas Clerk. The foundation of the guild also established a chaplaincy. by 1535 the value of the guild was valued at £4 13s 1d. The guild provided candles and torches for the icon of Our Lady in the church. ;The Guild of the Holy Cross The Guild of the Holy Cross had a chapel at Sea Gate, near the outfall of the North Level Main Drain (Then the Shire Drain). ;The guild of St Giles The Guild of St Giles, provided candles for the mass in the church. The membership was paid in bushels of barley. The members was also required to attend Vespers on the eve of St. Giles and mass on the feast day itself (1 September). The guild was also involved in charitable acts in the parish, being required to donate 1s 8d worth of bread to the poor after St. Giles' mass. There was also a Guild of St John, although no guild documentation exists. They may have met in a chapel by the Tritton (now Tretton) Bridge.A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 4: City of Ely: Ely N. and S. Witchford and the Wisbech Hundreds, Authors: R B Pugh (Editor), T D Atkinson, Ethel M Hampson, E T Long, C A F Meekings, Edward Miller, H B Wells, G M G Woodgate, Cambridge 2002 pp. 224–232 ==Geography== The village is completely low-lying, with an average altitude of 0 metres.Ordnance Survey sheet No.131 (Boston and Spalding), Crown Copyright 1998 The village is roughly square shaped (formed by the four main roads of Church Lane, Hockland Road, High Broadgate and Newgate Road). The eastern side of the village is dominated by the Norman church. The western side of the village is dominated by the Community Centre, a large blue roofed barn-like structure. The civil parish of Tydd St. Giles also includes the hamlets of Foul Anchor, and part of Tydd Gote which lies partly in Tydd St Giles and partly in Tydd St Mary in Lincolnshire. the village has no direct \\"A\\" road access, but is joined to the A1101 by the B1165. Tydd St Giles is in the (old) Wisbech postal district, and is the northernmost settlement in Cambridgeshire. It is also the northernmost, and last, parish in the Diocese of Ely. This is enhanced by the fact that the traditional county and diocesan bound is Eau Dyke, to the north of the village. Eau dyke is the only natural watercourse in the village, as it follows the course of the old Cat River. Across the southern boundary of the village runs a part of the North Level Main Drain. The drain is a vital part to the draining and continuing existence of the Fens. The drain then joins the River Nene at Foul Anchor, after passing through a pumping station, that brings the water up to the level of the river. Although the village is officially recorded at an altitude of 0 metres, the age of the settlement, and the vowels \\"i\\" and \\"y\\" in the village name suggest that it stands on a low mound that would have been above the surface of the fen. It is certain that the village was inhabitable before the 16th and 17th Century draining of the fen, because of the age of the church. A survey of 1868 described it thus: \\"TYDD ST. GILES, a parish in the hundred of Wisbech, Isle of Ely, county Cambridge, 5 miles north-west of Wisbech, its post town, and 6 from St. Mary Sutton. The preparation of woad for dyeing is carried on. The construction of the Bedford Level canal, which is 100 feet wide and 30 feet deep, has greatly improved the quality of the land. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Ely, value £653, in the patronage of the bishop. The church is dedicated to St. Giles. The parochial charities produce about £80 per annum. There is an endowed school, and the Independents have a chapel.\\"The National Gazetteer of Great Britain and Ireland, 1868 ==Governance== The village is in the North East Cambridgeshire parliamentary constituency, the seat of Mr. Steve Barclay MP (Conservative). The village polling station is in the community centre to the west of the village. In local government the village is in Roman Bank - Wisbech Ward of Fenland District Council.http://www.fenland.gov.uk/councillors ==St Giles Church== The Norman church dedicated to St. Giles, dominates the eastern side of the village. The church, although extensively redesigned in the 19th century (see below), still retains its Norman architecture and feel. The West Window was designed by Alan of Walsingham, the designer of the famous \\"octagon\\" lantern on Ely Cathedral, this rare clear glass medieval window (which survived the depredations of Oliver Cromwell) fills the whole of the western end of the building. All of the woodwork and pews in the church are later Victorian additions. In the Lady Chapel there are still some remnants of the church's original medieval stained glass, the rest of the church's stained glass is Victorian. The East Window shows the life and passion of Jesus Christ, while the North-Western Window depicts the church's (and village's) patron saint, Saint Giles and St. Paul (one of the patrons of the Church of Ss. Peter & Paul in Wisbech). The outer southern wall of the church still has the remains of a medieval sundial, which was in use when the church was a cell of the priory in Wisbech. ;The Tower The church is one of the few in the area to have a separate tower. The tower fell away from the eastern end of the church in the 18th century (due to poor foundations and strong wind), and was rebuilt by Sir George Gilbert Scott when the building was extensively renovated in the 1880s. Local legend has it that the tower was pushed over by the devil, as he could not abide the sound of the church bells. The tower has a ring of six bells with a tenor weight of 8-2-8cwt tuned to A.http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=Tydd+St.+giles&DoveID;=TYDD+ST+GI The bells were recast for the golden jubilee of Queen Victoria, from the original ring of 5, six bells were cast. The bells hang in a wooden frame, and are rung in the traditional English full circle ringing system. ;Renovation by Sir George Gilbert Scott Starting in 1868, the church was renovated by the famous architect Sir George Gilbert Scott.http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/cambs/vol4/pp224-232 The church was shortened, where the collapse of the tower had destroyed the original sanctuary (The east wall of the building still has the original blank arch). The nave roof was built up to its present level, and a new clerestorey was installed--the original can still be seen on the inside where the builders filled the Norman windows. The side aisles were also extended and the roof was re-leaded. The original plans, drawn by Scott can be seen on display at the back of the church, where they are now displayed after being found in a drawer in the church vestry. ;Repairs to the roof The church's roof was repaired in 2001–2002, as the original Victorian tiling and structure had decayed, letting in rain water along the whole of the nave and the side aisles. At the request of English Nature (now Natural England) the woodwork in the new rooves had holes bored into them to allow the resident colony of pipistrelle bats in and out of the building. The nave roof was blessed by the Right Rev'd Anthony Russell (retired) Bishop of Ely and Lord Spiritual, and the then incumbent of the parish, Rev'd Nigel Whitehouse, the roof was baptised using a bottle of specially brewed ale by Elgood & Sons Ltd., called Tydd St. Tiles. ;Other Items of Interest The Church has a copy of the Coventry Cross of Nails hanging in the sanctuary. The church also has a (tentative) claim to having had a pope in the parish. It is believed that Nicholas Brakespeare (Pope Adrian IV) was a curate of the parish. As a consequence the local pub is called the 'Crown and Mitre'. The parish is the owner of a rare Elizabethan chalice, gifted to the church by the then lord of the manor. It is inscribed: \\"A gift for Tedd sent Gyles\\". The chalice is only used by the church on special occasions, and when not in use is kept under lock-and-key in a local bank vault. The church has a restored Victorian bier, found and restored by a parishioner. The original wooden framework ond cast iron suspension units were in rescuable condition upon its discovery, but the wheels were made by a local smith, and the side rails are in fact lengths of copper heating pipes. ;Parish Priests *2005 – present Rev'd Sandra Gardner *1998–2004 Rev'd Nigel Whitehouse (promoted) * –1998 Rev'd Richard (Jack) Tofts (retired) *1320 Nicholas de Houton (first rector)A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 4: City of Ely: Ely N. and S.

At the time of the charity's founding it managed of land and three cottages in Tydd St. Giles, B&W; also controlled of land in Sutton St. Edmund.

The committee of B&W; consists mostly of local landowners, all elected by the wider membership. The parish priest is an ex officio member of the committee. B&W; was originated in the British attack on the Dutch in Sole Bay in 1672. One of the officers involved was Matthew Wren, son of the Bishop of Ely. In his will (written just before the attack), Wren left of Low Marsh to the poor of the village. By 1837, the Charities Commissioners also acknowledged that John Brigstock had left land to the poor in 1667, although Brigstock never owned the land. He had merely controlled the land for an older charity (whose name is now lost), and his name was on the deedsA History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 4: City of Ely: Ely N. and S.

Also included are the \\"Old School\\", a Victorian primary school building and school master's house on Church Lane, which has fallen into disrepair. The Old Tithe house (also on Church Lane) is a Grade I listed building, that was part of the parish properties (and used as a parish hall). For centuries it was not used, but was bought by a local member of SPAB, and restored.

It was opened in 1987 following the merger of Colvile school in Newton-in-the-Isle and Tydd St Giles School, in 1990 it had 84 children on the school roll, with a capacity of 90.http://www.fenland.gov.uk/assets/localplan/downloads/part2/Tydd%20St%20Giles/Tydd%20St%20Giles[1].pdf ==References== ==External links== Category:Villages in Cambridgeshire Category:Civil parishes in Cambridgeshire Category:Fenland District ","title":"Tydd St Giles"},{"id":"3264492","text":"The American Radiator Building (since renamed to the American Standard Building) is a , 23-story landmark skyscraper located at 40 West 40th Street, in midtown Manhattan, New York City. It was conceived by the architects John Howells and Raymond Hood,\\"AIA Guide to New York City\\", 4th Edition, pg 229 and built in 1924 for the American Radiator Company, five years before it merged with Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Company to form American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corporation which 38 years later, became simply known as American Standard. ==History and description== The building's structural form is based on Eliel Saarinen's unbuilt competition entry for the Tribune Tower, augmented with a strong use of color. 40th Street facade The architects combined Gothic and modern styles in the design of the building. Black brick on the frontage of the building (symbolizing coal) was selected to give an idea of solidity and to give the building a solid mass. Other parts of the facade were covered in gold bricks (symbolizing fire), and the entry was decorated with marble and black mirrors. Howells and Hood employed the talents of their frequent collaborator Rene Paul Chambellan for the ornamentation and sculptures. In 1988, successor company American Standard sold the building to a Japanese company. In 1998, the building was sold to Philip Pilevsky for $150 million. Three years afterwards, the American Radiator Building was converted into The Bryant Park Hotel with 130 rooms and a theatre in the basement. The landmark status of the exterior required the conversion pay special attention to the renovation of the facade decor, and prohibited proposed changes such as bigger guestroom windows. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

She appeared in the series from 19 June 2000 until 3 June 2004. ==Character development== Jade is introduced into the series as part of the new Sutherland family who move from the city to live in Summer Bay. Jade was Garven's first role on television. Garven said that working on Home and Away was a fun experience and that she had developed a good working relationship with those who play her on-screen family. Jade is portrayed as the \\"quieter\\" and \\"dreamy\\" of the Sutherland sisters, a keen book reader who likes to help out those less fortunate than herself. Jade is prone to illness and is a long sufferer of asthma. Jade's family see her as \\"fragile\\" and \\"vulnerable\\" and feel the need to treat her with care. The serial's official website describe her as being \\"stronger that many people realise\\" despite her fragile nature. Jade has also learnt to play on her weakness to get her own way in life. Jade is strong willed in knowing what she wants from life and does not like being told to do something she does not agree with. Garven described Jade stating that \\"she is a nice person and a very sweet girl. She can be a little flighty and she always talks too much. She tends to babble on but genuinely cares for people.\\" Jade and her twin sister Kirsty Sutherland (Christie Hayes) claim to share a \\"telepathic\\" connection in which they know when one another are in trouble. The theme was a prominent feature throughout Jade and Kirsty's tenure. However, producers later implemented a storyline in which Jade discovers that she is not related to the Sutherlands. The revelation that she was mixed up with another baby after birth conflicted their ideas of a telepathic connection between twins. Jade enters into a relationship with the character of Nick Smith and (Chris Egan) who plays Nick said that he and Garven had \\"a lot of fun together\\" portraying their relationship. In one storyline Jade and Nick attempt to appear on a reality television series titled \\"The Dorm\\", which radio host Garth Russell plays the director, who Jade attempts to impress. ==Storylines== Jade arrives in Summer Bay from the city with her twin sister, Kirsty and their older sister Dani (Tammin Sursok) when their parents Rhys (Michael Beckley) and Shelley (Paula Forrest). Jade begins dating Duncan Stewart (Brendan McKensy), while Kirsty dates Nick. When Brodie Hanson (Susie Rugg) moves in with the Sutherlands, she and Jade form a sisterly bond after they share a room for a while. Jade soon resumes her ballet classes but is unnerved by a rival, Tonya (Sharni Vinson) and soon begins having issues with her body and develops bulimia as a result. She and Duncan soon break up after Duncan's behaviour has become uncontrollable following his mother Ailsa's (Judy Nunn) death. Jade later begins a more serious relationship with Nick after he and Kirsty split. Their relationship gets problems when Vice Principal Angie Russell (Laurie Foell) mind games starts playing with Nick and abusing him. Also after Angie is killed, nick is still having a hard time getting close to other people, Jade and Nick don't want to give up their relationship and their love survives ultimately. After a while, Jade Nick makes it clear that she is ready for the first time sex. Nick tells her that he is afraid he can't handle it because of his trauma to sexual abuse. A while later Nick says he is ready, but every time they are with two intimate, he comes up with an excuse not to have sex with her. It becomes clear to Jade that he is not ready at all, but that he suppressed his trauma for her. She than tells him he can take the time that he needs and that he don't have to do something he can't handle. Yet Nick dumps her because he doesn't want that she has to wait for him. They both think it's better that way, but realize after a while that they can't without each other and came back together. After talking to a psygologist for a few months, Nick seems to have gotten over his traumas and they're having sex. Both for the first time. However Jade then falls for Seb Miller (Mitch Firth), The bestfriend of Nick, and she drops Nick to begin a relationship with Seb. Jade later discovers she was switched at birth with Laura DeGroot (also portrayed by Hayes), the revelation shatters her, leading to an identity crisis which sends her off the rails, culminating in a suspension from school. Duncan returns to town and tries to rekindle things with Jade, despite the fact she is now with Seb. Duncan and Jade do drugs one night, which leaves Jade worse for wear. On the night of Robbie Hunter (Jason Smith) and Hayley Smith's (Bec Hewitt) combined birthday party, Duncan steals Robbie's car keys and drives the car while high and involves Jade in a drag race. Seb tries to stop them by jumping on the bonnet but Duncan keeps driving and the car goes over a cliff. The Sutherlands fear that Jade has been killed but she survives with comparatively minor injuries in contrast to Seb, who is left paralysed. After Seb decides to join his grandfather Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn) in the Whitsundays, Jade decides she wants to go too as she feels there is nothing for her in the Bay. Her family tell her they are still there if she wants them. Jade soon then leaves with Kit Hunter (Amy Mizzi) for a fresh start in the city to get to know her biological family, the DeGroots. Jade returns several months later when Kirsty undergoes vital surgery and Shelley donates a kidney to her. ==Reception== In the book Philip Ardagh's book of howlers, blunders and random mistakery, Ardagh claimed that Jade and Kirsty's \\"amazing telepathic empathy\\" was conveniently forgotten by scriptwriters when they were revealed to be unrelated. He added that it must have been a \\"surprise\\" to viewers who had previously seen their connection play out.Ardagh 2009, p. 241. A columnist for the Sunday Mail thought the plot was questionable and said \\"A family arrive and claim Jade was swapped at birth with their daughter. You couldn't make it up.\\" Jaci Stephen from the Daily Mail has often been critical of Jade. When Jade finished writing her diary, Stephen said it was a \\"relief\\" and branded the details of Jade's life as \\"wretched and boring\\". She was delighted to watch Jade lose her diary and said that she \\"couldn't give a stuff\\" about its content. Stephen later said that \\"high drama is not something one would associate with the drippy Jade\\". When the \\"real\\" Jade is introduced into the serial, Stephen quipped \\"that might be a relief; surely she can't be as irritating as the old one\\". ==References== * ==External links== * Character profile at the Official AU Home and Away website * Character profile at the Internet Movie Database Category:Home and Away characters Category:Fictional adoptees Category:Television characters introduced in 2000 Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Jade Sutherland"},{"id":"3264498","text":"Harvardiana was a periodical published in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States by James Munroe and Co. from 1835 to 1838.

The main industries of Vopnafjörður are fish processing, agriculture and tourism and other services. ==Overview== Vopnafjörður is known for its salmon rivers and large areas of untouched landscape. Hofsá and Selá are two of the most exclusive salmon rivers in Iceland. The salmon rivers and other attractions in and around Vopnafjörður have drawn numerous foreign visitors, including artists, celebrities and politicians such as Charles, Prince of Wales, George Bush, Sr., Jack Nicklaus and Queen Paola of Belgium. Vopnafjörður is on Route 85 and has an airport with scheduled flights to Akureyri on business days. Other services include Vopnafjarðarskóli primary school with 99 students, Leikskólinn Brekkubær preschool, Landsbankinn bank and Heilbrigðisstofnun Austurlands clinic. HB Grandi, Iceland's largest fishing company, is the largest employer in the area. The company runs a high-tech freezing plant and a fishmeal factory in Vopnafjörður. ==History== The bay of Vopnafjörður was first settled by Vikings in the late 9th century CE. The name Vopnafjörður literally means Weapon Fjord or Weapon Bay, and comes from the nickname of one of the settlers, Eyvindur vopni. Disputes between local chieftains led to a number of killings in the 10th century. The story of the disputes is told in Vopnfirðinga saga, one of the classic Sagas of Icelanders, a series of epic family histories written in the 13th century. Little is known about the history of Vopnafjörður after Iceland lost its independence to Norway in 1264. Foreign merchants sailed to Vopnafjörður in the early modern age, and it was one of three trade ports in East Iceland in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Danish trading company Ørum & Wulff had extensive operations in Vopnafjörður in the 19th century. A local cooperative, Kaupfélag Vopnfirðinga, was established in 1918, and was one of Vopnafjörður's largest employers throughout the 20th century, but filed for bankruptcy in 2004. In the late 19th century, poor farmers were forced to move into the mountains above Vopnafjörður, when they could no longer afford living on densely populated land in the lowlands. For several decades, many families lived in the highlands, experiencing extreme hardship. The highland farms inspired the setting of the novel Independent People by Halldór Laxness. The book helped him win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1955. Modern infrastructure, including roads, harbors and bridges, was first introduced in Vopnafjörður in the early 20th century. Today, new infrastructure is of highest standards. ===Emigration to America=== Vopnafjörður was the largest port of Icelandic emigration to America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Thousands of North Americans have ancestors who lived in Vopnafjörður. ==Geography== The bay seen from the top of Krossavík Mountains. Vopnafjörður is located in Northeast Iceland. The Vopnafjörður area coastline is characterized by the Tangi peninsula, coastal rocks, islets, coves, river mouths, and black sand beaches. During the Ice Age (up to 10,000 years ago) a large glacier covered the bay. The Ice Age glacier carved the diverse mountains and rock formations that characterize the area. After the Ice Age, the land rose as the heavy load of the glacier fell away, and began to look as it does today. The largest river to run into the bay is Hofsá, one of the best salmon-fishing rivers in the country. Krossavík Mountains at , tower over the bay. The village of Vopnafjörður is located on the Tangi peninsula in the middle of the bay. Surrounding farms reach far into Hofsárdalur and Vesturárdalur valleys, and to the northern coast of the bay. ==Climate== Vopnafjörður has a rainy, mild winter subarctic climate (Köppen: Dfc) or a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) depending on the isotherm used, or , similar to the rest of coastal Iceland.Despite its extreme north Atlantic location, Vopnafjörður is much warmer than most locations at a similar latitude. Temperatures very rarely drop below −10 °C (14 °F) in the winter. This is because the Icelandic coastal weather in winter is moderated by the warm waters of the Gulf Stream. Summers are cool, with temperatures sometimes reaching 20 °C (68 °F). The climate has significantly warmed in recent years. ==Administration== The local government is the municipality of Vopnafjarðarhreppur, which is governed by the municipal council. The council has seven members who are elected in direct elections by the residents of Vopnafjörður for four-year terms. Anyone who is 18 years or older and has his or her legal domicile registered in Vopnafjörður has the right to participate in the local elections. The last municipal elections were held in May 2010. ==Demographics== On 1 January 2011, the population of Vopnafjörður was 668, of whom 529 lived in the village, and 139 in the rural part of the municipality. 350 were males and 318 females. 146 were under 18 years of age. In 2010, the total population was 683, of whom 666 people held Icelandic citizenship. 17 were citizens of other countries, and did not hold dual Icelandic citizenship. Four of those were Danish citizens, one Finnish, three German, one Latvian, one Mexican, one Dutch, one Swiss, three Thai, one British, and one US. The total population of Vopnafjörður was 987 in 1901, 677 in 1950, 908 in 1990, and 789 in 2000. ==Sports== Einherji is Vopnafjörður's sports team.

He served 16 years as principal of Brigham Young Academy. Although he was not the first principal of the Academy, he is considered its founder. The Academy later became Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1903. Before teaching at the Academy, Maeser taught at several different schools in Germany and in Utah. He tutored Brigham Young's children. Maeser incorporated the Monitorial System into his teaching philosophies and believed that students should each have responsibilities. Maeser was influenced by Pestalozzian educational theory, but also advocated that schools should include religion. Maeser served as a missionary for the LDS Church in four nations and held many leadership positions in the church, including serving as the head of the Church Educational System and in the central leadership of the Sunday School. His educational philosophies shaped Brigham Young Academy and other church academies throughout Utah. He represented the church at the Mid- Winter Fair in San Francisco, distributing information about Utah and the church's schools. ==Early life== The house where Karl G. Maeser was born Karl G. Maeser was born on January 16, 1828, in the town of Meissen, in Saxony, Germany, to Johann Gottfried and Federicka Zocher Maeser. Maeser was the oldest of four sons. His family was well known in Meissen. His father was a china painter in a porcelain shop. Maeser went to public school in Meissen. He temporarily lost his sight for eight months when he was 11 years old due to an unknown cause. In 1842, Maeser enrolled in the Kreuzschule in Dresden; he attended for two years, and graduating from the Kreuzschule could have propelled him into the German upper class. However, Maeser chose to study at Friedrichstadt Schullehrerseminar in Dresden, a school to train prospective teachers. He graduated on May 20, 1848. Maeser became a schoolteacher and tutored Protestant children in Bohemia for three years. He returned to Dresden and was a teacher at the First District School in Dresden. He later taught at the Budich Institute, where he was made Oberlehrer (Senior Teacher). In December 1848, Maeser was required to enlist in the military for a two-year assignment; however, he was declared \\"unfit.\\" Maeser had no major physical or mental disabilities that would have impacted his conscription. On June 11, 1854, Maeser married Anna Mieth, the daughter of the director of the First District school in Dresden. The couple had their first child, Reinhard, in 1855. They had eight children together. ==Membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints== ===Conversion=== While teaching at the Budich Institute, Maeser came across Die Mormonen, an anti-Mormon book, by Moritz Busch. He and Edward Schoenfield, Maeser's brother-in-law and fellow teacher, decided to investigate the beliefs and practices of the LDS Church. Maeser wrote letters to missionaries of the church; missionary William Budge volunteered to go to Maeser's home to teach him and answer his questions. Both Maeser and Schoenfield joined the LDS Church. Maeser was baptized by Franklin D. Richards and Budge on October 14, 1855, in the Elbe River. Maeser was baptized at night because the church was banned in Germany at that time. Maeser was the first Mormon baptized in Saxony. His wife, Anna, was baptized shortly after on October 19. The following Sunday, a new branch of the church was established in Dresden, and Maeser became the first president. He and his family were forced to leave Germany by the Dresden police in July 1856, and would eventually travel to Salt Lake City, where Latter-day Saints were gathering. ===Missionary service=== After being exiled from Germany, the Maesers went to London in June 1856, where they were welcomed by members of the LDS Church. Maeser was called by the church to serve a German-speaking mission in London in July 1856. He and his family left London in May 1857; their ship arrived in Philadelphia in July. The Maeser's infant son, Karl Gustav Franklin Maeser, died as they arrived and was buried in Philadelphia. In Philadelphia, Maeser was commissioned by the church to develop pamphlets on basic church principles. After living there a few weeks, Maeser was called to serve as a missionary by the LDS Church to the German-speaking community of Philadelphia. Maeser spent some time in Virginia as part of his mission, where he earned keep for himself and his family by giving music lessons. Among Maeser's music students were the daughters of former United States President John Tyler.Winder, Michael K., Presidents and Prophets: The Story of America's Presidents and the LDS Church. (Salt Lake City: Covenant Communications, 2007) p. 62 Maeser returned with Anna to Philadelphia, where he was called by the church to serve as conference president. Maeser and his family left Philadelphia in June 1860 and traveled across the country to Salt Lake City in Patriarch John Smith's company. Maeser arrived in Utah Territory on September 1, 1860. In 1860, Maeser was appointed by church leaders in the area to head church meetings in Salt Lake City held in German. However, shortly after, most of the Swiss Church members moved to Santa Clara, Utah, and other locations in southern or central Utah, so the meetings in Salt Lake City ended. He was called to serve a mission to Germany and Switzerland in 1867. On his way to Switzerland with Octave Ursenbach they organized a branch of the Church in Paris.Richards. Called to Teach p. 260 and appointed mission president in 1868. He founded the church magazine, Der Stern, in January 1869. Upon his return to Utah in 1870, there were enough German-speaking church members in Salt Lake City for them to hold their own church meetings again, and Maeser presided at their meetings.Jensen, Richard L., \\"Mother Tongue: The Use of Non- English languages in the Church in the United States, 1842–1983\\" in Bitton, Davis and Maureen Ursenbach Beecher, ed., New Views of Mormon History (Salt Lake City, Utah: University of Utah Press, 1987) p. 277. In 1875, Maeser took a plural wife, Emilie Damke. He was arrested for \\"unlawful cohabitation\\" and was charged with a $300 fine in 1884. ==Career== Statue of Karl Maeser in Dresden, Germany Maeser accepted his first teaching position in the First District School in Dresden from 1852 to 1853, and he taught at the Budich Institute beginning in 1854. Maeser continued his teaching career when he arrived in Utah. He taught at the Deseret Lyceum, an academy established in Salt Lake City in November 1860. The teachers at the Lyceum constructed school slates and performed janitor duties because conditions were so poor. When students' families could not afford to pay tuition, Maeser often collected payments of produce via wheelbarrow. In the spring of 1861, Maeser left the Lyceum and was offered a position at the Union Academy, established by Brigham Young. This academy was intended for students above elementary grades. Young appointed Maeser head of the school in February 1861. Maeser was concerned about the school systems meeting the needs and interests of its students, and he left the Union Academy to teach in other schools and seminaries, including the Twentieth Ward Seminary, which he founded in 1862. The school became a well-known training school for teachers. Maeser was elected as the regent of the University of Deseret in 1860, 1863 and in 1865. In 1865, he began to privately tutor Young's fifty-six children and also instructed other children who came to the Young household including Ellis Reynolds Shipp.McCloud, Susan Evans. Brigham Young: A Personal Portrait (American Fork, Utah: Covenant Communications, 1996) During this time, he also kept books for Leonard H. Hardy to supplement his income. He was teaching at Young's family school when he was called on a mission to Germany in 1867. He left for Europe in May 1867, leaving his family in a poor financial state. Maeser returned to Salt Lake City in 1870 and became a professor of German. However, he resigned from this position to return to the Twentieth Ward Seminary. In 1870, he also taught at the University of Deseret, helping to develop their teacher training program. Maeser wrote articles in the Beehive Series of the Juvenile Instructor during 1870. In 1871, he was elected the president of the Salt Lake Teacher's Association. For a short period of time he was also an assistant organist for the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. ===Brigham Young Academy=== In 1875, Brigham Young Academy in Provo, Utah, was founded to combine secular and religious teachings. The Academy followed advice from Joseph Smith: to teach correct principles and to let students govern themselves. Warren Dusenberry served as its interim principal during the school's first \\"experimental\\" term until Maeser was selected to be the founding principal by Brigham Young. The Academy later became Brigham Young University. BYU's Karl G. Maeser Building When Maeser arrived at Brigham Young Academy in 1876, during the school's \\"second experimental\\" term, enrollment had declined since Dusenberry had started the school. The facilities were run down, there was no record system, and the school lacked a uniform schedule. Only 29 students enrolled at the beginning of Maeser's first term, but this number doubled by the end of the term. He was the only teacher during this first term. Maeser agreed to teach for only $1200 per year. The first year of his administration was divided into four terms. Maeser wrote up reports at the end of each term and sent them directly to the general authorities of the church in Salt Lake outlining lesson plans and classes. Under Maeser's administration, the school was divided into different departments based on the ability of students. The lower divisions included the Primary, Preparatory, Intermediate, and Kindergarten departments. Primary students were ages 6 to 8 and had never attended school before. The Primary classes were replaced by the Preparatory Department in 1888. This department consisted of classes beginning with a fourth-grade reading level. The Intermediate Department was for students ages eight to eleven and accepted students graduating from the Primary Department. The higher divisions of the Academy included the Academic Department and the Normal School. The Academic Department offered a wide variety of classes and allowed a student to specialize in one field, and the Norman School trained teachers. Maeser personally oversaw the Norman School. In addition, Maeser established a daily routine. Opening exercises began at 9 a.m. and classes began at 9:30 a.m. Students were allowed 30 minutes for lunch. The school day ended at either 4 or 5 p.m. Over 3,000 different students enrolled at the Academy while Maeser was its principal. Maeser was very strict, and students that attended the Academy had to adhere to a standard of moral conduct. Students were required to follow the Word of Wisdom. However, they were accountable for their own actions under the honor system. Maeser also established training courses for teachers. He also kept parents informed and sent monthly reports to them on the progress of their children. In 1884, the Lewis building, where the academy first met, burned down. Reed Smoot, a former student of Maeser's approached him and said, \\"Dr. Maeser, the academy is no more.\\" Maeser responded \\"no such thing, it's only the building . ... The academy lives on.\\" cited in Maeser turned the devastating fire into a lesson on pride. He had a dream that inspired the construction of new buildings for the Academy. The school struggled financially for some time, and Maeser pondered going elsewhere. He had a dream, or what he called a vision, in which he saw \\"Temple Hill filled with buildings—great temples of learning,\\" which inspired him to stay at the Academy. Message written by Maeser Message written by Maeser Message written by Maeser Maeser had a profound effect on his students. One of them, Alice Louise Reynolds, wrote that \\"he had the ability to inspire. He made his students feel the worth of life; he told us that the Lord had sent each of us to do a special work, and that the proper preparation was necessary for that mission.\\" cited in Among the students who studied under Maeser were George Sutherland, William H. King, Bryant S. Hinckley, James E. Talmage, George Albert Smith and J. Golden Kimball. He also inspired his family members; one of his sons, Karl Emil, studied under Maeser and went on to be a respected educator and school president. Maeser retired from Brigham Young Academy in 1892 to devote his time to his position as the Superintendent of Church Schools. He was succeeded by Benjamin Cluff. Shortly before his death, Maeser was invited to speak at the anniversary of the founders day at the Maeser School, a public school named after him. He wrote his message on four chalkboards which stated: These chalkboards are preserved at Brigham Young University. Karl G. Maeser portrait.Printed in 1904 magazine, the Character Builder, page 212. Online at:https://archive.org/details/builder1904/page/212/mode/2up ===Superintendent of the Church Educational System=== In April 1888, the Church Board of Education was created as part of the LDS Church, inspired by a proposal made by Maeser in 1887. Maeser was made a member of the board, and was later appointed the superintendent of the Church Educational System. The Board of Education was created to maintain and supervise church schools. This position later became the Commissioner of Church Education. As Superintendent, Maeser helped establish initial policies for new academies established by the church. He also helped train teachers, and gave suggestions on the architecture of new school designs. By 1889, Maeser oversaw 19 schools that operated under the academy system. In 1889, Church Board of Education established a board of examiners to certify teachers. The board awarded Maeser a Doctor of Letters and Didactics degree that same year. Maeser also continued writing in the Juvenile Instructor in the 1890s to clarify church educational policies. During this same time Maeser served in the General Superintendency of the Deseret Sunday School Union. He was the Second Assistant to General Superintendent George Q. Cannon from July 1894 to January 1899. He then served as the First Assistant to Cannon from January 1899 until February 1901.LDS Church Almanac, 2008 Edition, p. 115 Maeser also participated in the Utah constitutional convention after Abraham Smoot's death in 1895. He proposed an article to support prohibition, but later backed down. ===Mid-winter Fair in San Francisco=== Missionaries from the LDS Church were removed from California in 1858 due to the Utah War. Missionary work resumed in 1892. Maeser presided over the California mission from January to August 1894 when he was replaced by Henry S. Tanner as president. Maeser's primary responsibility was to head the Utah exhibit at the Mid-winter Fair in San Francisco in 1894, while he was serving as Superintendent of Church Schools. The exposition was patterned after Chicago World's Fair of 1893. At the Chicago exhibit, the church had displayed minerals and produce from Utah. In the San Francisco exhibit, Maeser chose to focus more on beliefs of the church and educational accomplishments of students in the church school systems. The church had an exhibit in the Manufacturers and Liberal Arts Building, and Maeser gave a series of lectures to bring more publicity to the church school exhibit. Utah's participation in the exhibit attempted to gain favor for its becoming a state. He and his companions helped distribute information about the history of Utah. No one was baptized into the church while Maeser was president of the mission; however, he did help create friendlier public-relations between Utah and California. ==Educational philosophies== Maeser opposed educational philosophies of John Locke, who argued that education was for the elite only. Maeser recognized that Johann Bernhard Basedow had good ideas about treating students with kindness and removing physical punishment from the classroom; however, Maeser believed that \\"come, follow me\\" and not \\"thou shalt\\" were the best principles for teaching. In Maeser's eyes, Basedow was not a good example. ===Monitorial system=== Statue of Karl G. Maeser at Brigham Young University Maeser included the Monitorial System from Andrew Bell and Joseph Lancaster in his teacher training courses. This system suggested that more advanced students monitored the less advanced students and that the layout of a classroom should allow one teacher to oversee a large number of students. Maeser believed that this system was flawed, however, because it focused on developing efficiency and disregarded individuality. Maeser argued that the teacher have more personal interactions with students. He implemented his monitorial organization so that each student would be responsible for something or someone else. Students were forced to look outside themselves, creating responsibility and organization. ===Pestalozzian educational theory=== While attending the Friedrichstadt Teacher College, Maeser was exposed to Pestalozzian educational theory, which greatly influenced his educational philosophy. Pestalozzian educational theory recognizes the potential of each individual. Pestalozzi encouraged teachers to treat their students with kindness and respect, and to show love to their students, instead of evoking fear. Pestalozzi was also in favor of universal education and opposed separately educating different social classes. Maeser adopted many of his ideas. He supported the education of women. Maeser believed that students should be allowed to express themselves freely and choose their own careers. His lectures tried to engage students and help them understand concepts through their own experiences. He also included many object lessons to coach students to observe their surroundings and make connections. Maeser admired Prestalozzian teachers Adolph Diesterweg and Friedrich Fröbel Maeser also agreed that \\"education should be balanced head, heart and hand.\\" ===Role of religion=== Maeser believed that religion played a key role in true education. He viewed each student as a child of God that had an individual capacity and potential. He thought that all schools should adhere to some religious aspect. He also argued that public high schools should be supplemented by religion classes. Maeser, however, was respectful of other religious denominations although Brigham Young Academy and Brigham Young University integrated beliefs from the LDS Church. ==Legacy== Karl G. Maeser's grave markerKarl G. Maeser's grave marker Maeser's health had been declining, although he continued working. Maeser died in his home on February 15, 1901. He was an example of dedication and faithfulness. His ideas on educational philosophy, the honor system, and incorporation of religious classes continue to be implemented at Brigham Young University, where the Maeser Building is named after him. A song was written in Maeser's memory, \\"Come, Lay His Books and Papers By\\". The words were written by Annie Pike Greenwood and the music by L. D. Edwards. This song became an LDS hymn and appeared in the 1948 edition of the church's hymnal as hymn number 338. After the title, it states, \\"In memory of Dr. Karl G. Maeser.\\" It is not included in the 1985 hymnal. Maeser also inspired a relationship between Meissen, where he was born, and Provo, Utah. Now, the two cities share a sister-city relationship. It is the hope of both cities that the relationship will grow to include the exchange of delegations, including manufacturers, youth, academicians, scientists, artists, associations, clubs, tourists, technicians and others, which will result in enriching the cultures of the respective cities. As of 2001, the two cities have been sending high school age students on a three-week-long exchange to gain more knowledge about their differences in society and culture.City of Provo, Utah :: ==References== ==Further reading== *Maeser, Karl Gottfried.

The film is set in a private boarding school in the late-1950s with institutional violence as its theme. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 76th Academy Awards. It won three Swedish Guldbagge Awards including Best Film. ==Plot== In 1958, Erik Ponti, a 15-year-old boy, lives with his mother and sadistic stepfather in Stockholm. At home, his stepfather beats him every day after dinner. His docile mother ignores her husband's sadistic nature and allows the violence to proceed. At school, Erik is violent and frequently engages in fights, as a result of his violent upbringing. After a particularly vicious fight, Erik is expelled. The headmaster labels him vicious and accuses him of being pure evil. In an attempt to provide her son with a fresh start and last chance to finish school, his mother sells some of her valuable family heirlooms and sends Erik to an affluent boarding school. Upon arriving in Stjärnsberg, realising the boarding school is his final chance at reaching Sixth Form, Erik attempts to forgo his violent tendencies. At the prestigious school twelve members of the Sixth Form form a Student's Council. They exercise a sadistic rule over the school and punish disobeying students physically and psychologically, which is completely ignored by the school staff members who opt to leave the students to their own ways of governing one another's behaviour. When Erik refuses to obey the ludicrous requests of two councilmen, Silverhielm and Dahlén, he becomes the target of relentless bullying. His refusal to demean himself by obeying their humiliating punishments lands him a number of weekend detentions. Erik befriends his intellectual roommate Pierre, who flies below the radar in order to avoid bullying. Whilst in the school kitchens one weekend, after a particularly grueling day of labour, Erik meets Marja, a pretty cafeteria staff member on a work visa from Finland. The two begin a romantic relationship as Marja admires Erik's resistant and righteous personality. Meanwhile, Erik joins the swimming team. A swimming match approaches and Erik is determined to win, but soon realises that in order to win he must defeat the current school champion and son of the most prominent donor to the school. He knows that winning would make him more of a target than ever, but his fair and dedicated swim coach assures him that it is a matter of honour and he must not lose. Erik wins, breaking a number of school records and humiliating a number of Sixth Formers who sarcastically clap when his accomplishments are vocalised by the swim coach. For Christmas break Erik goes home. His stepfather beats him mercilessly, whilst his mother plays the piano to disguise the sounds of the cane. When he arrives back at school, the student council begins targeting Erik's intellectual friend Pierre. Pierre does not stand up for himself. Pained to see his friend humiliated Erik leaves the swim team as he believes this will save his friend from the relentless bullying. But that doesn't seem to be enough. A while later, Erik is called up to the council president, Silverhielm's room. There Pierre has been made to strip and Dahlén threatens to put out a cigarette on his chest, but Erik volunteers instead and unflinchingly endures the pain. The next day, Pierre is challenged to fight the councilmen. He gets severely beaten but does not obey their requests. The following day, Erik is ambushed when walking back from detention. They tie him to the ground and pour boiling water over him followed by cold water and leave him outside to freeze. However, he is rescued by Marja. The two sleep together and Erik returns to his room to find Pierre has left the school. Erik, bitter and fed up, challenges Dahlén and von Schenken to a fight. He quickly defeats both, and then goes in search of Marja, who has left for Finland after being fired for unknown reasons. The headmaster is given an intercepted love letter by Silverhielm from Marja to Erik, resulting in Erik's expulsion for having sexual relations with a staff member. Erik searches for and finds Silverhielm for revenge in the woods and threatens to kill him. As Silverhielm begs for his life on his knees after being scared into hysteric crying and vomiting, Erik catches himself about to exploit his violent tendencies but stops himself and assures Silverhielm he won't kill him because he is not like him. Erik returns to the school with his mother's family friend, who is a lawyer, and subsequently threatens to publish the culture of loose law and intentional ignorance of the headmaster and other staff members in the school. He is then reinstated, given back the letter from Marja, and is allowed to finish his last semester in relative peace. The school year ends and Erik returns home to find his mother has been beaten by his stepfather. His stepfather tries to beat him again, but Erik warns him that it is over. He tells his mother, who was in shock, that it is the last time there will be violence in the household and closes the door behind himself as he prepares to get payback for years of violence and beats his stepfather off screen, it is unknown if his stepfather changed or if he left his stepson and wife after Erik beat him. He reconciles with Pierre, who is about to leave for Geneva to continue his education, and sets out to contact Marja and realise his dream of becoming a lawyer. ==Cast== *Andreas Wilson as Erik Ponti *Henrik Lundström as Pierre Tanguy *Gustaf Skarsgård as Otto Silverhielm *Linda Zilliacus as Marja *Jesper Salén as Gustaf Dalén *Peter Eggers as Karl von Rosen *Filip Berg as Johan *Johan Rabaeus as Erik's stepfather *Marie Richardson as Erik's mother *Magnus Roosmann as Tosse Berg, gymnastic teacher *Ulf Friberg as Tranströmer, biology teacher *Lennart Hjulström as Lindblad, headmaster of Stjärnsberg *Mats Bergman as Melander, history teacher *Kjell Bergqvist as Gunnar Ekengren, lawyer *Björn Granath as headmaster *Fredrik af Trampe as von Schenken *Petter Darin as von Seth ==Production== Being based on one of the best-selling Swedish books in modern time, there had been discussions about a film adaptions for many years, including several failed attempts, before Mikael Håfström was offered to direct the material. It was originally conceived as a television series, but Håfström felt he was not ready for such an extensive production. Instead he waited a few years and eventually convinced the producers to make it a feature film. Håfström brought in Hans Gunnarsson, with whom he had worked before, as a co-writer, and the writing process as well as the financing went ahead quickly.Carnevale, Rob (2005-11-30) \\"Evil - Mikael Håfström interview.\\" Indie London.

Håfström contacted people he knew had been at the party to get Wilson's phone number, after which he called him and asked him to come over. Håfström was immediately sure that he had found the right person, and after a few physical tests, Wilson was given the role.

Instead most exterior shots were made around Görvälns slott in Jakobsberg, north of Stockholm. The dining area in the film was built in a studio as a replica of the original school's dining hall, based on photographs from the time.

He played for the Queensland Reds. ==Career== Flatley was educated at St. Joseph's Nudgee College where he was signed into the professional ranks of rugby union upon graduating. He made his debut for the Queensland Reds in 1996, the inaugural season of the Super 12, at the very young age of 18 against New Zealand side, Highlanders. In 1997, he made his international debut for Australia, playing against England at Twickenham on 15 November, aged 20. The game was a 15-all draw. Flatley was again in the team for the next game against Scotland, which Australia won. In 2001, he was a member of the Wallabies team that won the test series against the British and Irish Lions during the 2001 tour to Australia. Flatley figured prominently in Australia's 2003 Rugby World Cup campaign, going right to the final against England and scoring the penalty that took the match to extra time, then another penalty which evened the scores at 17-17 before England ultimately prevailed. He finished the tournament as the third highest point score, scoring 100 points for Australia. In April 2004, Flatley reached another milestone, becoming the youngest player ever to reach 100 caps for the Queensland Reds when he led the side out against the Sharks in Durban. Flatley prematurely retired from all forms of rugby on 16 March 2006, on medical advice as he was suffering from continued blurred vision due to a number of concussions.

Stevens's songs have a mystical, faintly psychedelic flavour, and are mostly sung in his native Welsh language. Still largely unknown outside Wales, he was discovered by DJ Jimmy Savile, who saw him performing in a Manchester folk club in 1965. This led to Stevens recording his first single – with arranger John Paul Jones (later of Led Zeppelin) – for Decca Records that same year, though it sold badly. ==Early Life== In 1967 he suffered a nervous breakdown and retreated to his home village of Solva (in Pembrokeshire) to recuperate, and started to write songs in Welsh in a concerted effort to create a distinctive national pop music. From 1967 to 1969 he recorded a series of now rare Welsh-language picture sleeve EPs (Mike Stevens, Rhif 2 (Number 2), Mwg (Smoke), Y Brawd Houdini (Brother Houdini), Meic Stevens, Diolch yn Fawr (Many Thanks), Byw yn y Wlad (Living in the Country)). These were made for local labels like Sain and Wren, for whom he was one of the first artistes to record. He also performed around Britain during the '60s, playing on recording sessions (notably for his friend Gary Farr's debut album on the Marmalade label). He made a one-off English language LP, Outlander, for Warner Bros. Records in 1970, but the contract was abandoned by mutual consent. Today, like his other LPs of the period, Gwymon (Seaweed) and Gog (Cuckoo), it is very rare and highly sought after. ==Career== Today Stevens' psych-folk influence can be heard in contemporary Welsh groups such as Super Furry Animals and Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, and his song \\"Cwm y Pren Helyg\\" was recently covered by Alun Tan Lan. Several CDs of his are available from the Sain label in Caernarfon, and two volumes of his classic 1960s EPs have recently appeared on Sunbeam Records. Stevens can be found occasionally singing in certain pubs/hotels in Aberystwyth until the late hours. He can also be seen performing regularly throughout Wales and England at major festivals, eisteddfodau, pubs, theatres etc. He performs periodically in France, mainly Brittany where he is very popular. ==Albums== * Outlander (1970, Warner Bros) * Gwymon (Wren, 1972) * Gog (1977, Sain 1065M) * Caneuon Cynnar (1979, Tic Toc TTL001) * Nos Du, Nos Da (1982, Sain 82) * Gitâr yn y Twll dan Stâr (Sain, 1983) * Lapis Lazuli (Sain, 1985 Sain 1312M) * Gwin a Mwg a Merched Drwg (Sain, 1987) * Bywyd ac Angau/Life And Death (Fflach, 1989) * Ware’n Noeth – Bibopalwla’r Delyn Aur (1991, Sain SCD 4088) * Er Cof am Blant y Cwm (1993, Crai CD036) * Y Baledi – Dim ond Cysgodion (1992, Sain SCD 2001) * Voodoo Blues (1993?

They protect and promote the flourishing of the specific places where they live, which can be as small as a rock or a corner of a field or as large as a section of a country. ==The nature of landvættir== Some scholars have suggested that landvættir are chthonic in nature, spirits of the dead, but others have interpreted them as nature spirits, since they sometimes live in land that has never been populated.Jan de Vries, Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte, vol. 1, p. 260, Berlin: De Gruyter, 1956, repr. as 3rd ed. 1970, citing Dag Strömbäck. Hilda Ellis Davidson argued that stories such as that of Goat-Björn imply that they were already there when the settlers arrived in Iceland. Goat-Björn was offered a partnership by a \\"rock-dweller\\" (bergbúi) and thereafter prospered. People with second sight saw \\"all the land-spirits\\" following him to the thing and following his brothers hunting and fishing. They told of people worshiping and receiving advice from spirits living in waterfalls, woods, and rocks.Hilda Roderick Ellis Davidson, Myths and Symbols in Pagan Europe: Early Scandinavian and Celtic Religions, Manchester University Press, 1988, , pp. 103-04. Goat-Björn, the waterfall, and the wood she cites from Landnámabók, the advising spirit in the rock from Kristni saga and Þorvalds þáttr ens víðförla.

North Charleston, SC: Booksurge, 2006, , p. 470. When construction was about to start on Keflavík air base, the Icelandic foreman dreamed that a woman came to him asking to delay moving a boulder to give her family time to move out. He did so for two weeks over American objections until she came to him in another dream telling him the landvættir were all out.KveldulfR Hagan Gundarsson, Elves, Wights, and Trolls, Studies Towards the Practice of Germanic Heathenry vol. 1, New York: iUniverse, 2007, , p. 18. Other terms are sometimes used in the texts for the spirits, such as bergbúi, ármaðr, and spámaðr, but there is one mention of pre-Christian Icelanders bringing offerings specifically to landvættir. In a section of Hauksbók, a Christian bishop rails against \\"foolish women\\" who take food out to rocks and hollows to feed the landvættir in hopes of being blessed with a prosperous household.\\"Heimslýsing ok Helgifrœði\\" ch. 9; ed.

Hermann Pálsson and Paul Edwards translate landvættir as \\"guardian spirits\\" in this passage.Egil's Saga, Penguin Classics, 1976, , p. 148. ===The four landvættir of Iceland=== Iceland is protected by four great guardians who are known as the four landvættir (). According to the Saga of King Olaf Tryggvason in Heimskringla, King Harald Bluetooth Gormsson of Denmark, intending to invade Iceland, had a wizard send his spirit out in the form of a whale to scout it out for points of vulnerability. Swimming westwards around the northern coast, the wizard saw that all the hillsides and hollows were full of landvættir, \\"some large and some small.\\" He swam up Vopnafjörður, intending to go ashore, but a great dragon came flying down the valley toward him, followed by many snakes, insects, and lizards, all spitting poison at him. So he went back and continued around the coast westward to Eyjafjörður, where he again swam inland. This time he was met by a great bird, so big that its wings touched the hillsides on either side, with many other birds large and small following it. Retreating again and continuing west and south, he swam into Breiðafjörður. There he was met by a huge bull, bellowing horribly, with many landvættir following it. He retreated again, continued south around Reykjanes, and tried to come ashore at Vikarsskeið, but there he encountered a mountain giant (bergrisi), his head higher than the hill-tops, with an iron staff in his hand and followed by many other giants (jötnar). He continued along the south coast but saw nowhere else where a longship could put in, \\"nothing but sands and wasteland and high waves crashing on the shore.\\"tr. Lee M. Hollander, Austin: University of Texas Press, 1964, repr. 1999, , pp. 173-74; ch. 33, \\"Frá Haraldi Gormssyni\\" at Netútgafn (in Icelandic) . de Vries p. 260 refers only to the initial sight of landwights crowding the landscape; in the remainder of the passage the four guardians themselves are not called landvættir, and at the end they are stated to have been four named Icelanders. The four landvættir are now regarded as the protectors of the four quarters of Iceland: the dragon (Dreki) in the east, the eagle (Gammur) in the north, the bull (Griðungur) in the west, and the giant (Bergrisi) in the south. The four landvættir of Iceland are depicted on the Icelandic coat of arms, on the obverse of the Icelandic króna coins, and the team crest of Iceland's national football teams. ==See also== * Adgilis Deda, a Georgian divinity with a comparable function * Genius loci * Kami, Japanese divinities with similar properties * Landdísir, female spirits of the land attested as venerated in Iceland * Tutelary deity * Vættir ==References== Category:Creatures in Norse mythology Category:Tutelary deities Category:Nature spirits ","title":"Landvættir"},{"id":"3264623","text":"Chris Senn may refer to: *Chris Senn (skateboarder) *Chris Senn (video game designer), best known for the unfinished Sonic X-treme project ","title":"Chris Senn"},{"id":"3264642","text":"Gary Mervin Thain (15 May 1948 – 8 December 1975) was a New Zealand rock bassist, best known for his work with British band Uriah Heep. ==Biography== Thain was born in Christchurch.

Later, Thain was part of the rock trio The New Nadir, and with the drummer Peter Dawkins, he travelled from New Zealand to London, and once jammed with Jimi Hendrix before the trio split in 1969. Thain joined the Keef Hartley Band and, in 1971, they toured with Uriah Heep; they asked him to join them (replacing Mark Clarke) in February 1972, and he stayed in the band until February 1975. He played on four studio albums: Demons & Wizards, The Magician's Birthday, Sweet Freedom and Wonderworld as well as their live album, titled Uriah Heep Live. During his last tour in the United States with Uriah Heep, Thain suffered an electric shock at the Moody Coliseum in Dallas, Texas, on 15 September 1974, and was seriously injured. Due to his drug addiction he was not able to perform properly, and was fired by the band in early 1975 and replaced by former King Crimson bassist/vocalist, John Wetton.

He was a significant figure in the evolution of jazz piano. ==Career== At age 15, McKenna worked in big bands with Charlie Ventura (1949) and Woody Herman's Orchestra (1950–'51). He then spent two years in the military before returning to Ventura (1953–'54). During his career he worked in swing and dixieland settings with Al Cohn, Eddie Condon, Stan Getz, Gene Krupa, Zoot Sims, Joe Venuti, and often with Bob Wilber and Bobby Hackett. McKenna released his first solo album in 1955. During the 1980s, he worked as a pianist at the Copley Plaza Hotel in Boston. ==Recordings== McKenna recorded extensively from 1958–2002, beginning with ABC-Paramount (1956), Epic (1958), Bethlehem (1960) and Realm (1963). He made several recordings for Chiaroscuro in the 1970s, including his comeback album Solo Piano. He debuted with the Concord Jazz label in 1979, for whom he recorded many albums as both a soloist and group member. He was featured in the second volume of Concord's 42-disc series recorded live at Maybeck Recital Hall. His last recording, An Intimate Evening with Dave McKenna was released by Arbors in 2002. ==Musical style== McKenna's musical style relied on two key elements relating to his choices of tunes and set selection, and the method of playing that has come to be known as \\"three- handed swing\\". His renditions usually began with a spare, open statement of the melody; or, on ballads, a freely played, richly harmonized one. He then often stated the theme a second time, gradually bringing in more harmony or a stronger pulse. His improvisation then began in earnest on three simultaneous levels: a walking bassline, mid-range chords, and an improvised melody. The bassline, for which McKenna frequently employed the rarely used lowest regions of the piano, was often played non-legato to simulate a double bassist's phrasing. The chords were played with the thumb and forefinger of the right hand or of both hands combined, if the bass was not too low to make the stretch unfeasible. Sometimes he also added a guide-tone line consisting of thirds and sevenths on top of the bass, played by the thumb of the left hand. With his right hand's remaining fingers, he then played the melody, weaving it into improvised lines featuring colorful chromaticism, blues licks and mainstream-jazz ideas. The result was the sound of a three-piece band under one person's creative control. McKenna often used his left hand to emulate the sound of a rhythm jazz guitarist, playing a four-to-the-bar \\"strum\\" consisting of a bass note (root/fifth/other interval), third and seventh. This pattern often took the form of intervals of a tenth, which is why the voicings were frequently \\"broken\\" arpeggiated, with the top two notes being played on the beat and the bass note slightly before. He often subtly altered these voicings every two beats for variety. His \\"broken tenth\\" sound was frequently mistaken for stride piano. However, it was a more modern four-beat style, as opposed to stride's two-beat \\"oom-pah\\" rhythm (ala Fats Waller). McKenna was also quite capable of playing full stride piano, and occasionally broke into stride choruses, especially on songs associated with traditional jazz or at the height of an up-tempo song's development. The characteristic that perhaps most distinguishes McKenna's playing is his sense of time. One of the biggest challenges of solo jazz piano is the need to provide a compelling time feel, in part by emulating the rhythmic landscape normally provided by three or four players in a small group. By conceiving multiple \\"parts\\" and playing them with distinct volume levels and time feels (often with right hand chords ahead of the beat and the melody behind the beat), McKenna had a unique ability to reproduce, on his own, the sound of a small group. McKenna liked to create medleys around a common word or theme in song titles. He often combined ballads and up-tempo songs with standards, pop tunes, blues, and TV themes and folk songs. ==Partial Discography== ===As leader=== * Solo Piano (ABC- Paramount, 1956) * The Piano Scene of Dave McKenna (Epic, 1959) * Solo Piano (Chiaroscuro, 1973) * Cookin' at Michael's Pub (Halcyon, 1973) * Dave \\"Fingers\\" McKenna (Chiaroscuro, 1977) * Giant Strides (Concord, 1979) * Piano Mover (Concord Jazz, 1981) * Bill Evans: A Tribute (Palo Alto, 1982) * A Celebration of Hoagy Carmichael (Concord, 1983) * Dancing in the Dark and Other Music of Arthur Schwartz (Concord Jazz, 1986) * My Friend the Piano (Concord Jazz, 1987) * No More Ouzo for Puzo (Concord Jazz, 1989) * Live at Maybeck Recital Hall, Volume Two (Concord Jazz, 1989) * Christmas Ivory (Concord Jazz, 1997) * An Intimate Evening With Dave McKenna (Arbors, 2002) ===As sideman=== With Ed Bickert * Bye Bye Baby (Concord, 1984) With Urbie Green *Blues and Other Shades of Green (ABC-Paramount, 1955) *All About Urbie Green and His Big Band (ABC-Paramount, 1956) With Bobby Hackett * Creole Cookin' (Verve, 1967) With Teddi King * This is New (1977) With Zoot Sims * From A to...Z (RCA Victor, 1956), The Al Cohn/Zoot Sims Sextet * Down Home (Bethlehem, 1960) ==References== ==External links== * Dave McKenna: Piano's Most Valuable Player * \\"Remembering Jazz Pianist Dave McKenna\\" at NPR Music Category:American jazz pianists Category:American male pianists Category:People from Woonsocket, Rhode Island Category:Swing pianists Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:Deaths from cancer in Rhode Island Category:1930 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Concord Records artists Category:American male musicians Category:20th-century American pianists Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:American male jazz musicians ","title":"Dave McKenna"},{"id":"3264664","text":"Currants (Ribes species) are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species: ==Monophagous== Species which feed exclusively on Ribes * Geometridae **Spinach (Eulithis mellinata) ==Polyphagous== Species which feed on Ribes and other plants * Arctiidae **Buff ermine (Spilosoma luteum) * Geometridae **Brimstone moth (Opisthograptis luteolata) **Common emerald (Hemithea aestivaria) **Currant pug (Eupithecia assimilata) **Engrailed (Ectropis crepuscularia) - recorded on redcurrant (R. rubrum) **Juniper pug (Eupithecia pusillata) - recorded on redcurrant (R. rubrum) **Mottled beauty (Alcis repandata) **Mottled pug (Eupithecia exiguata) - recorded on redcurrant (R. rubrum) **Mottled umber (Erannis defoliaria) **Scalloped hazel (Odontopera bidentata) **Scalloped oak (Crocallis elinguaria) **Winter moth (Operophtera brumata) * Hepialidae **Common swift (Korscheltellus lupulina) * Lymantriidae **Brown-tail (Euproctis chrysorrhoea) * Noctuidae **Dot moth (Melanchra persicariae) **Dun-bar (Cosmia trapezina) **Grey chi (Antitype chi) - recorded on blackcurrant (R. nigrum) **Hebrew character (Orthosia gothica) **Mouse moth (Amphipyra tragopoginis) - recorded on redcurrant (R. rubrum) **Satellite (Eupsilia transversa) - recorded on redcurrant (R. rubrum) **Setaceous Hebrew character (Xestia c-nigrum) **Small angle shades (Euplexia lucipara) == External links == * Currants Category:Ribes ","title":"List of Lepidoptera that feed on currants"},{"id":"3264665","text":"Landeveien, Åsgårdstrand painted by Hans Heyerdahl (1890) Åsgårdstrand is a small port town in Horten municipality, Vestfold, Norway. It is also the name of a former independent municipality and a center of trade. The town is situated 10 km south of Horten, 10 km north of Tønsberg and 100 km south of Oslo by the west coast of the Oslofjord. On 1 January 1965 Åsgårdstrand and Borre municipalities, plus a part of Sem were merged into the new municipality of Borre. By the time of the merger Åsgårdstrand had 488 inhabitants and was the smallest municipality in Norway. Åsgårdsstrand is a summer resort destinationFodor (1987). Fodor's Scandinavia 1988.

The first element in the farm's name is´ás meaning 'mountain ridge' (the usage here referring to its position on Raet), the last element is garðr meaning 'farm'.Haugen, Einar (1967) Norwegian-English Dictionary A Pronouncing and Translating Dictionary of Modern Norwegian (University of Wisconsin Press) ==History== Summer Night at Åsgårdstrand painted by Edvard Munch (1904) Åsgårdstrand was ladested (center of trade) from 1650 under Tønsberg, from 1660 under Holmestrand. In 1752 the center of trade was given the rights of doing business with national goods. From the beginning of the 19th century, Åsgårdstrand, was a lively export harbor for lumber, of which most was exported to the Netherlands. By the end of the sail ship era, the trade stagnated. The municipality was founded as Åsgårdstrand formannskapsdistrikt in 1837. Merchant and ship owner Anders Riddervold was elected as the first mayor. Dating from the 1880s, the town had been increasingly known as an important center for artists and painters. A number of internationally noted painters has either visited or lived in the town including Edvard Munch, Christian Krogh and Hans Heyerdahl. In 1898 Edvard Munch bought a house in Åsgårdstrand where he spent the first of many summers. The house is now operated as a small museum which is associated with the Vestfold Museum (Vestfoldmuseene). Since the 1920s Åsgårdstrand has been a popular vacation and recreational spot. Visitors come to the small town each summer and spend their holidays in one of the four hotels. From 2007, the town has had the classification of a Tourist Town, which gives the shop owners in the oldest part closest to the sea the right to keep open every day of the week. In order to become a Tourist Town the number of visitors needs to greatly exceed the number of residents throughout the year. In June every year, Åsgårdstrand celebrates Midsummer - the longest day of the year - with a large fire on the shore. ==Notable people from Åsgårdstrand== Edvard Munch's house *Hans Anton Apeness (1842–1930), lumber merchant born in Åsgårdstrand.

For almost twenty years, he was Professor of Economics and Public Administration at the University of Puerto Rico. He described himself as a \\"philosophical anarchist.\\" His most influential work was The Breakdown of Nations. In 1983, he was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for \\"for his early inspiration of the movement for a human scale.\\" ==Life and work== Leopold Kohr's best known book Kohr grew up in the small town of Oberndorf near Salzburg, and it remained his ideal of community.Kirkpatrick Sale, foreword to E.P. Dutton 1978 edition of Leopold Kohr's Breakdown of Nations. He often commented on the fact that the Christmas carol \\"Silent Night\\" was written and composed as \\"Stille Nacht\\" in his home village. He earned doctorate degrees in law, at the University of Innsbruck, Austria, and political science, at the University of Vienna.Yates, Steven (2012-01-21) Who Was Leopold Kohr? , American Daily Herald He also studied economics and political theory at the London School of Economics. In 1937, Kohr became a freelance correspondent during the Spanish Civil War, where he was impressed by the limited, self-contained governments of the separatist states of Catalonia and Aragon, as well as the small Spanish anarchist city-states of Alcoy and Caspe. He became a close friend of journalist George Orwell and shared offices with correspondents Ernest Hemingway and André Malraux.Description of Gerald Lehner's The Biography of philosopher and economist Leopold Kohr. at Kohr Academie web site. Kohr fled Austria in 1938 after it was annexed by Nazi Germany and emigrated to the United States. He later became an American citizen.Dr. Leopold Kohr, 84; Backed Smaller States, New York Times obituary, 28 February 1994. Kohr taught economics and political philosophy at Rutgers University, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, from 1943 to 1955. From 1955 to 1973, he was professor of Economics and Public Administration in the University of Puerto Rico, in San Juan, except for a period in 1965-66 when he was professor of Economics at the University of the Americas in Mexico City, Mexico; during these years he developed his concepts of village renewal and traffic calming, and \\"lent his advice to local city planning initiatives.\\" He also advised the independence movement of the nearby island of Anguilla. After many rejections by American and British publishers, Kohr's first book, The Breakdown of Nations, was published in 1957 in Britain after a chance meeting with anarchist Sir Herbert Read. Kohr moved from Puerto Rico to Wales, where he taught political philosophy at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth from 1968 until 1977. The project of Welsh independence, founded on the ideal of 'cymdeithas' (community) was dear to him, and Kohr became a mentor to Plaid Cymru and a close friend of its then leader, Gwynfor Evans. After retiring from teaching, Kohr divided his time between Gloucester, England, and Hellbrunn, outside Salzburg. In 1983, in Stockholm, Sweden, Kohr received the Right Livelihood Award, \\"for his early inspiration of the movement for a human scale.\\" In 1984, Salzburg created the Leopold Kohr Academy and Cultural Association \\"Tauriska\\" to put his theories of regional autonomy into practice. Kohr was planning to return to his hometown of Oberndorf to live when he died in 1994. His ashes were buried in Oberndorf. Salzburg journalist Gerald Lehner completed a biography of Kohr, based in part on long audiotaped interviews, in 1994. Kohr has been described as a charming conversationalist and a witty, elegant debunker of popular assumptions. Author Ivan Illich describes him as \\"a funny bird—meek, fey, droll, and incisive\\", as well as \\"unassuming\\" and even \\"radically humble.\\"The Wisdom of Leopold Kohr, Ivan Illich, Fourteenth Annual E. F. Schumacher Lectures, October 1994, Yale University. ==Philosophy== Kohr described himself as a \\"philosophical anarchist.\\" Kohr protested against the \\"cult of bigness\\" and economic growth and promoted the concept of human scale and small community life. He argued that massive external aid to poorer nations stifled local initiatives and participation. His vision called for a dissolution of centralized political and economic structures in favor of local control. In his first published essay \\"Disunion Now: A Plea for a Society based upon Small Autonomous Units\\", published in Commonweal in 1941, Kohr wrote about a Europe at war: \\"We have ridiculed the many little states, now we are terrorized by their few successors.\\" He called for the breakup of Europe into hundreds of city states. Kohr developed his ideas in a series of books, including The Breakdown of Nations (1957), Development without Aid (1973) and The Overdeveloped Nations (1977). From Leopold Kohr's most popular work The Breakdown of Nations: > ... there seems to be only one cause behind all forms of social misery: > bigness. Oversimplified as this may seem, we shall find the idea more easily > acceptable if we consider that bigness, or oversize, is really much more > than just a social problem. It appears to be the one and only problem > permeating all creation. Whenever something is wrong, something is too big. > ... And if the body of a people becomes diseased with the fever of > aggression, brutality, collectivism, or massive idiocy, it is not because it > has fallen victim to bad leadership or mental derangement. It is because > human beings, so charming as individuals or in small aggregations, have been > welded into overconcentrated social units. Kohr was an important inspiration to the Green, bioregional, Fourth World, decentralist, and anarchist movements, Kohr contributed often to John Papworth's \`Journal for the Fourth World', Resurgence. One of Kohr's students was economist E. F. Schumacher, another prominent influence on these movements, whose best selling book Small Is Beautiful took its title from one of Kohr's core principles. Similarly, his ideas inspired Kirkpatrick Sale's books Human Scale (1980) and Dwellers in the Land: The Bioregional Vision (1985). Sale arranged the first American publication of The Breakdown of Nations in 1978 and wrote the foreword. ==See also== * Anarchism * Bioregionalism * City state * Decentralization * Ecovillage * Green anarchism * Human scale * Plaid Cymru * Secession * Simple living * Transition Towns * Welsh Nationalism == References == == Bibliography == *Small Is Beautiful: Selected Writings from the complete works.

The triggering event is often a catastrophic natural event which may ordinarily precipitate a loss or a series of losses. But parametric insurance principles are also applied to agricultural crop insurance and other normal risks not of the nature of disaster, if the outcome of the risk is correlated to a parameter or an index of parameters. == Transaction cost == Parametric insurance may reduce transaction costs involved in writing and administering insurance policies because there is less need for actual loss assessment for payment of claims or underwriting rating requirements to determine the premium based on liabilities and extent of risk sharing. == Application == Applications in Agriculture (CLI-INS: https://en.climate- insurance.eu/agriculture) \\\\- Drought insurance by satellite, \\\\- Meadows insurance by satellite, \\\\- Hail insurance by hail sensor, \\\\- Frost insurance or Excess of heat by weather station or satellite, \\\\- Excess of water or lack of water insurance by weather station Applications in Transport (CLI-INS: https://en.climate-insurance.eu/trasnport) \\\\- Low water insurance for river transportation (to cover the Low Water Surcharge), \\\\- High water insurance for river transportation, \\\\- Snow insurance (critical height on the tarmac) for airports Applications in Energy (CLI-INS: https://en.climate- insurance.eu/energy) To cover the energy production in case of a lack of wind (wind farm) or solar radiation (photovoltaic power) Parametric insurance is suited for low-frequency but high-intensity losses as in catastrophic perils, weather-related risks in agriculture or other economic activities, and risks sought to be covered without sufficient history of losses captured as insurance-readable data. == Users == For example, the various public sector development finance institutions such as the World Bank, as well as private sector insurers and reinsurers covers hurricane and earthquake risks based on category parameters. The successful designs of these instruments is dependent on the rigour parameters that are set. These need to be independent, verifiable and reported frequently. National Insurance Academy in India propounded the concept of parametric life insurance premium setting based on variations in mortality table rather than setting constant level premium, which results in wide scale surrenders on improvements in mortality table due to better life expectancies at various age layers. Another application of parametric insurance propounded by K C Mishra of National Insurance Academy, India is for managing risks of island dwellers. Usually islands depend on supplies from mainland or mainlands. If there is a parametric hazard in the mainland, the island dwellers suffer from supply bottlenecks leading to financial loss of debilitating dimensions. In such cases an index of parametrization is warranted if there can be supplies from multiple mainlands. Such improvisation is better known as transinsurance rather than pure form parametric insurance. == Transurance == Transurance is an innovation at non- catastrophic levels akin to parametric insurance at catastrophic levels, according to K C Mishra, former Director of the National Insurance Academy, Pune, India. Although businesses spend huge amounts annually on property and casualty insurance premiums (in 2005-06 this amount may exceed 1500 billion dollars globally), insured loss recoveries are becoming a smaller portion of the economic costs of insured events. In effect, losses that are collateral to insurable events are becoming larger. Transurance eliminates complex coverage definitions and loss adjustment processes by defining its coverage as a percentage of the loss recoveries under selected traditional insurance policies. This approach enables the insured to express its view of the relationship between insurable losses and collateral losses as a proportion of the underlying loss recovery. In short, Transurance makes uninsurable losses insurable, in a way that is effective and efficient, and helps insureds deal with the full impact of loss events. By supplementing insurance with Transurance, insurance recoveries will more closely resemble the total economic loss of insured events. Transurance may be substituted for ambiguous policy wording in traditional insurance so as to eliminate coverage disputes. For the insurer, Transurance represents an opportunity to write more insurance with less transaction costs, since the underwriting effort is minimal and claims adjustment expenses are all but eliminated. The transparency, liquidity, and accessibility are the features Transurance wants to achieve for relatively opaque collateral losses. To Transure collateral losses, a company must create a relationship between the amount of collateral losses and the size of the insurance recovery it is likely to receive. For example, if a company believes it will have uninsurable collateral losses equal to 20% of the amount it recovers from its insurance policy, it can purchase a Transurance policy that pays 20% of the amount that its insurance policy pays to create a budget for collateral losses. Transurance enables the insured and the insurer to agree in advance how large the collateral losses will be in relation to the amount of the proceeds from an underlying property or casualty policy. By predefining this relationship, business continuity costs that are coincident to insured losses but aren't covered by traditional insurance because they are too difficult to define or substantiate can now be insured. In an interdependent economy where supply is on demand, not stockpiled, the adverse effects of large property and casualty losses are frequently magnified and systemic. Absent immediate assurance of business continuity, stakeholders will disengage and form other business relationships. Providing assurance requires financial resources that go beyond traditional insurance. Transurance gives companies an opportunity to leverage the financial efficiency of conventional insurance and helps assure business continuity. Parametric Insurance and Transurance are complementary. Transurance usage is likely to step out of property and casualty insurance to all areas of insurance, reinsurance and even life insurance and annuity insurance. == Providers == CLI-INS (your CLImate-INSurance) is a FinTech specialized in parametric insurance working with the world’s top-insurance companies.

Among its other achievements, Funnies, Inc. supplied the contents of Marvel Comics #1, the first publication of the company that would evolve into Marvel Comics. Characters created by Jacquet's company include the Sub-Mariner and the original Golden Age Human Torch. ==Biography== ===Early life and career=== Lloyd Jacquet was born in Brooklyn to a father who had emigrated from France.

The village is the major settlement in Hanborough parish. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 2,630. ==History== An infants' school was built in 1879 and enlarged in 1893. It closed in 1998 and was merged into Hanborough Manor School. The old school building has been converted to a private house. Christ Church Church of England parish church was built in 1893. It is now part of the Benefice of Hanborough and Freeland. The village also has a Methodist church. The Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway was built to the north of Long Hanborough in 1853, with Handborough Station (recently renamed Hanborough Station) opened just to the east of Long Hanborough to serve the village. The franchisee Great Western Railway, offers a good service and an excellent commuter service to Oxford, London (Paddington), Worcester and Hereford. In 1935 the Great Western Railway opened a small station on the Combe Road to serve , although as near Long Hanborough as Combe, and with a very limited service. On 30 January 1965 a funeral train with the coffin of Sir Winston Churchill was hauled to Hanborough Station by Battle of Britain Class locomotive 34051 Winston Churchill. From Hanborough the funeral cortège proceeded to St Martin's Church, Bladon where the funeral took place. ==Amenities== The old school house was built in 1879 and was still the infants' school until 1998 Long Hanborough has a post office, a GP's practice, a dental practice, a Co- Operative store, a fish and chip shop and a bicycle repair shop. It has two pubs, the Three Horseshoes and the George & Dragon. Until the 2000s it had two other pubs. In 2009 the Swan, in Millwood End, was a gastropub, but it has since ceased trading and is now a private home.

As a teenager, he began acting in bit parts in live theatre, and in 1910 he got a job as chauffeur, driving Biograph Studios executives around Los Angeles to determine the suitability of the West Coast as a place for a permanent studio. ==Career== Neilan made his film debut as part of the acting cast on the American Film Manufacturing Company Western The Stranger at Coyote (1912). Hired by Kalem Studios for their Western film production facility in Santa Monica, Neilan was first cast opposite Ruth Roland. Described as confident, but egotistical at times, Neilan's talent saw him directing films within a year of joining Kalem. After acting in more than seventy silent film shorts for Kalem and directing more than thirty others, Neilan was hired by the Selig Polyscope Company then Bison Motion Pictures and Famous Players-Lasky Corporation. In 1915, Neilan was one of the founding members of the Motion Picture Directors Association along with directors such as Cecil B. DeMille, Allan Dwan, and William Desmond Taylor. At the end of 1916, Neilan was hired by Mary Pickford Films where he directed Pickford in several productions including Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm and The Little Princess in 1917, plus Stella Maris in 1918, Amarilly of Clothes-Line Alley, M'Liss in 1918, and Daddy-Long-Legs in 1919. Having all but given up acting, Neilan's directing successes led to him creating his own production company and between 1920 and 1926, Marshall Neilan Productions made eleven feature- length films almost all of which were distributed through First National Pictures. He received critical acclaim for directing and producing such films as Bits of Life and The Lotus Eater. In 1929, he was hired by RKO Radio Pictures; although he reputedly had difficulty adapting to directing the new talkies, that year he successfully directed Rudy Vallee and Marie Dressler in the \\"all-talking\\" The Vagabond Lover. Contrary to the legend that the film was a commercial and critical failure (except for Dressler's highly praised performance), the film was a hit, making a profit of $335,000,Richard Jewel, 'RKO Film Grosses: 1931-1951', Historical Journal of Film Radio and Television, Vol 14 No 1, 1994 p55 and was one of four top hits for RKO in 1929. Early in his career Neilan had done as most others in the pioneering days of film and helped out in many areas of filmmaking through performing, directing, and writing. A talented screenwriter, in 1927 he wrote the original story for the Howard Hughes film, Hell's Angels. Initially, he had also been hired as the film's director, back when it was still a silent, but Hughes' overbearing style forced him to drop out, and he was replaced a few weeks into production by a more pliable director, Edmund Goulding; due to massive reshoots (as well as the recasting of the lead role with Jean Harlow), none of the footage Neilan shot made it into the final film. He was then hired by Hal Roach Studios, for whom he directed a few films in 1930, and he made his final directorial effort in 1937. Having battled alcoholism for a large part of his adult life, twenty years after he made his last film, Neilan returned to acting on the screen in a small role portraying an aging and less than enlightened United States Senator in the Elia Kazan film, A Face in the Crowd. In 1955, Neilan was awarded The George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film. In recognition of his contribution to the motion picture industry, in 1940 the Directors Guild of America conferred on him an \\"Honorary Life Member Award.\\" He later received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6233 Hollywood Blvd. ==Personal life and death== Marshall Neilan married actress Gertrude Bambrick in 1913 with whom he had a son, Marshall Neilan, Jr, their only child. A year after he and Bambrick divorced in 1921, Neilan married actress Blanche Sweet, whom he directed on several occasions. They too divorced in 1929. Neilan with Blanche Sweet in 1922, the year they married Neilan died in Los Angeles in 1958 of throat cancer. He is interred there in Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery. ==Selected filmography== ===Actor=== * Ranch Girls on a Rampage (1912) * The Wooers of Mountain Kate (1912) * Fatty's Busy Day (1913) * The Wall of Money (1913) * The House of Discord (1913) * Judith of Bethulia (1914) * Ham the Iceman (1914) * Put Me Off at Wayville (1915) * Madame Butterfly (1915) * A Girl of Yesterday (1915) * Mice and Men (1916) * Calamity Anne, Guardian (1916) * The Crisis (1916) * Daddy-Long-Legs (1919) * Broadway Gold (1923) * A Star is Born (Uncredited, 1937) * A Face in the Crowd (1957) ===Director=== * The American Princess (1913) * Rube, the Interloper (1914) * The Deadly Battle at Hicksville (1914) * The Chronicles of Bloom Center (1915) * The Prince Chap (1916) * Freckles (1917) * Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917) * The Little Princess (1917) * Stella Maris (1918) * Amarilly of Clothes-Line Alley (1918) * M'Liss (1918) * Hit-The-Trail Holliday (1918) * Heart of the Wilds (1918) * Out of a Clear Sky (1918) * Her Kingdom of Dreams (1919) * The Unpardonable Sin (1919) * Daddy-Long-Legs (1919) * Go and Get It (1920) * Don't Ever Marry * Bits of Life (1921) * Bob Hampton of Placer (1921) * The Lotus Eater (1921) * Fools First (1922) * Minnie (1923) * The Eternal Three (1923) * Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall (1924) * Tess of the d'Urbervilles (1924) * The Great Love (1925) * The Sporting Venus (1925) * Mike (1926) * Diplomacy (1926) * Wild Oats Lane (1926) * Her Wild Oat (1927) * Venus of Venice (1927) * Three- Ring Marriage (1928) * Taxi 13 (1928) * His Last Haul (1928) * Take Me Home (1928) * The Vagabond Lover (1929) * Black Waters (1929) * The Awful Truth (1929) * Sweethearts on Parade (1930) * Social Register (1933) * Chloe, Love Is Calling You (1934) * This Is the Life (1935) * Sing While You're Able (1937) * Swing It, Professor (1937) * Thanks for Listening (1937) ===Producer=== * The River's End (1920) * Don't Ever Marry (1920) * Go and Get It (1920) * Dinty (1920) * Bob Hampton of Placer (1921) * Bits of Life (1921) * The Lotus Eater (1921) * Penrod (1922) * Fools First (1922) * The Strangers' Banquet (1922) * Wild Oats Lane (1926) * Everybody's Acting (1926) * Tanned Legs (1929) * Social Register (1934) ===Writer=== * Saved from Court Martial (1912) * The Reformation of Dad (Story, 1913) * The Wall of Money (1913) * Si's Wonderful Mineral Spring (1914) * The Deadly Battle at Hicksville (Story; 1914) * Ham the Iceman (Story, 1914) * The Winning Whiskers (Story, 1914) * The Reformation of Ham (1914) * Ham at the Garbage Gentleman's Ball (1915) * The Come Back of Percy (Scenario, 1915) * The Cycle of Fate (1916) * The Country That God Forgot (Story, 1916) * A Strange Adventure (Story, 1917) * Dinty (1920) * Bits of Life (1921) * Minnie (1922) * The Strangers' Banquet (1922) * The Eternal Three (1923) * The Great Love (1925) * Mike (1926) * Hell's Angels (Story, 1930) * Chloe, Love Is Calling You (Story and screenplay, 1934) * The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Uncredited, 1938) ==References* *Marshall Neilan at Virtual History Category:American male film actors Category:1891 births Category:1958 deaths Category:American male silent film actors Category:American male screenwriters Category:Film producers from California Category:Male actors from California Category:Actors from San Bernardino, California Category:Burials at Angelus- Rosedale Cemetery Category:Deaths from esophageal cancer Category:Deaths from cancer in California Category:20th-century American male actors Category:Screenwriters from California Category:20th-century American male writers Category:20th-century American screenwriters ","title":"Marshall Neilan"},{"id":"3264747","text":"New England Cable News (NECN) is a regional 24-hour cable news television network owned and operated by NBCUniversal (as part of the NBCUniversal Owned Television Stations division, both ultimately owned by Comcast) serving the New England region of the United States. It focuses on regional news, though in some low priority timeslots, paid programming and programming from WNBC such as Talk Stoop and Open House are seen. NECN, along with NBC owned and operated WBTS-CD (channel 15), Telemundo O&O; WNEU (channel 60), and NBC Sports Boston, are based at the NBCU Boston Media Center on B Street in Needham. NECN also operates several news bureaus in the New England area, including Manchester, New Hampshire; Hartford, Connecticut; Worcester, Massachusetts; Portland, Maine; Providence, Rhode Island; and Burlington, Vermont. New England Cable News maintains a remote camera in the television studio of Suffolk University in downtown Boston. New England Cable News is available across New England in 3.7 million homes and produces several original programs. ==Overview== NECN was launched March 2, 1992, as a joint partnership between Continental Cablevision (now part of Comcast) and the Hearst Corporation. On June 18, 2009, Hearst sold its stake in NECN to Comcast, which began to operate it as a division of the Comcast Sports Group and Comcast SportsNet.Comcast assumes full ownership of NECN When Hearst owned a stake in NECN, it used the resources of several New England stations owned and operated by Hearst Television to assist in news coverage of the region. The Hearst stations include Boston ABC affiliate WCVB-TV (early in NECN's existence, the network rebroadcast WCVB's 6:00 p.m. newscast at 8:00 p.m., an arrangement discontinued in 1998); New Hampshire's ABC affiliate WMUR-TV; ABC affiliate WMTW in Portland (NECN and WMTW both maintained bureaus in the Time and Temperature Building in downtown Portland, though the operations were physically separate and NECN used its own news vehicles in Maine); and WPTZ and WNNE, Vermont's two NBC affiliates. Other partnerships NECN maintained in its early years included WGGB-TV in Springfield, Massachusetts, WGME-TV in Portland (prior to Hearst's 2004 purchase of WMTW), WTNH in New Haven, Connecticut, WPRI-TV in Providence, Rhode Island, and The Boston Globe. Before its merger into the NBC Owned Television Stations, NECN was a training ground for local news reporters. Some of the better-known reporters who got their start at NECN include ABC's Dan Harris, CNN's Suzanne Malveaux, and CNBC's Maya Kulycky. Several of Boston's current television reporters and anchors also began at NECN. Conversely, NECN has also employed some of the long-lived veterans of the Boston television market, including R. D. Sahl, Tom Ellis and Chet Curtis. In addition to its cable production operations, NECN began to produce a 10:00 p.m. newscast for Boston Fox affiliate WFXT, known as Fox 25 News at 10:00 on September 7, 1993. (subscription content preview) Shortly after Fox Television Stations bought WFXT from the Boston Celtics, it chose not to renew the contract with NECN upon its expiration on October 1, 1995 (the station would launch its own news operation a year later); the next day, the newscast moved to UPN affiliate WSBK-TV and was renamed UPN 38 Prime News. The 10:00 p.m. newscast left the air on October 4, 1998, when WSBK canceled it to focus on sports and entertainment programming. During the 2000s, NECN partnered with Charter Communications to produce Worcester News Tonight for its Charter TV3 channel. Comcast systems carry NECN as part of its limited basic tier, usually on a low and prime channel position (channel 6 in most Metro Boston communities). It is also seen on Verizon FiOS on channel 13 as part of local Digital, and on RCN on channel 318 as part of its Signature package. Most other cable TV systems in New England carry NECN, with the exception of Cox. The service is not available on satellite. On January 18, 2010, NECN began broadcasting in high definition. Most Boston-area Comcast subscribers can watch NECN-HD on Channel 840. Verizon carries NECN-HD on channel 513, also as part of local digital, while RCN subscribers can watch NECN-HD on channel 618. In July 2013, as part of a corporate reorganization resulting from Comcast's purchase of NBC Universal, NECN was moved into the NBC Owned Television Stations division—aligning it with NBC and Telemundo's owned-and-operated stations, although Boston's NBC affiliate WHDH was not owned by the network. On January 1, 2017, low-power station WBTS-LD became Boston's new NBC O&O;, replacing WHDH as its affiliate; it shares studios and resources with NECN. WNEU, the Telemundo O&O; for Boston, has also shared resources with NECN since launching a news operation in 2015. Under NBCUniversal management, NECN also began sharing resources with the other NBC affiliates in New England: WVIT in New Britain, Connecticut (an O&O;), WWLP in Springfield, Massachusetts, WJAR in Providence, Rhode Island, and WCSH in Portland, Maine (and its Bangor semi-satellite, WLBZ), along with maintaining its existing relationship with WPTZ.

The major goal of the ULS as for many other linear divertor simulators, is to reproduce the same temperature and density conditions of the SOL (Scrape Off Layer) of a tokamak in a linear environment and therefore to make easier the study of its properties. In the past few years, ULS has been used with great insight to analyze the molecular activation and the electron-ion recombination modes, and to determine the conditions for their activation: diffusive processes have also been considered. However, research on these subjects is still ongoing and our understanding of the elementary processes involved in a detached plasma is still far from being satisfactory. ==References== ==Further reading== *Kay, Michael J.

Written just after the Prussian victory in the Franco-Prussian War, it describes an invasion of Britain by a German-speaking country referred to in oblique terms as The Other Power or The Enemy. == Background == Chesney was a captain in the Royal Engineers and had grown concerned over the ramshackle state of Britain's armed forces. He used fiction as a device to promote his views after letters and journalism on the issue had failed to impress public opinion. The Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871) had just demonstrated the speed, superiority and adaptability of the Prussian Army, which meant that Chesney's depiction of a fast-moving and determined invader hit a nerve. == Plot == The story is told as a narrative by an unnamed veteran who participated in the Battle of Dorking. He is recounting the final days before and during the invasion of Britain. It is addressed to his grandchildren as an event fifty years earlier. Beginning sometime after an event similar to the Franco-Prussian War, concerns grow with the mobilisation of armed forces near the Netherlands. The Royal Navy is destroyed by a wonder- weapon (\\"fatal engines\\"), and an invasion force suddenly lands near Worthing, Sussex. Demilitarisation and lack of training means that the army is forced to mobilise auxiliary units from the general public, led by ineffective and inexperienced officers. The two armies converge outside Dorking, Surrey, where the British line is cut through by the advancing enemy and the survivors on the British side are forced to flee. The story ends with the conquest of Britain and its conversion into a heavily-taxed province of the invading empire. The British Empire is broken up, with only Gibraltar and Malta being kept by the victorious Germans. Canada and the West Indies are ceded to the United States, and Australia, India and Ireland are all granted independence. Ireland enters a lengthy civil war as a result. == Publication history == Front cover of the 1871 pamphlet edition of The Battle of Dorking The Battle of Dorking was first published as a serial in Blackwood's Magazine, then in pamphlet form before finally appearing as a novel. It went through several editions and engaged the interest of soldiers and politicians, as well as the reading public. It has appeared in a number of collections, including Michael Moorcock's Before Armageddon: An Anthology of Victorian and Edwardian Imaginative Fiction Published Before 1914 (1975). The pamphlet is in the public domain worldwide, because the author died more than 100 years ago. == References == ==Sources== * * ==Further reading== * * * (Kirkwood notes that Surrey was also to be the scene of the invasion in H.

He served in the missions in Asia once he was ordained and was stationed in India where he led a diocese of his own. He also established his own religious congregation. Ferrando's cause of sainthood has commenced and was granted the title Servant of God as being the first stage in the process. On 3 March 2016 he was proclaimed to be Venerable after Pope Francis recognized that Ferrando led a life of heroic virtue. ==Life== Stephen Ferrando was born on 28 September 1895 in Genoa. Ferrando was ordained to the priesthood on 18 March 1923 at the Salesian Institute of Borgo San Martino in Alessandria. A few months later he was assigned to serve in British India as part of the third batch of missionaries dispatched. Ferrando left Venice on 2 December 1923 along with nine other companions, reaching Shillong – then the capital of the Assam province of British India and headquarters of the Prefecture Apostolic of Assam – on 23 December. There he was entrusted with the task of forming future missionary personnel for the Prefecture, serving as the Master of Novices. He also served as the catechist and then the Rector of Our Lady's House in Shillong and in 1929, became a Council Member of the Provincial team of the Salesians in the diocese. At that time, the Holy See had entrusted the Archdiocese of Madras as well as the diocese of Krishnanagar and also the Prefecture Apostolic of Assam to the Salesians. On 9 July 1934, Ferrando was appointed as the bishop of Krishnanagar in Nadiab, the island- city in the province of Bengal; he choose Apostolus Christi (\\"An apostle for Christ\\") as his motto. He received – from the Archbishop of Calcutta – his episcopal consecration on the following 10 November. When the Prefecture of Assam was elevated as the bishopric of Shillong shortly after, Ferrando was transferred as the Bishop of Shillong as its second bishop on 26 November 1935, a position he held until 26 June 1969 when he retired (The diocese was then promoted to an archdiocese, so that his successor was an archbishop). The new diocese was faced with many challenges, none greater than the shortage of personnel. Ferrando immediately threw himself into the work of increasing the diocesan personnel. On 18 March 1932, he wrote to the Rector Major of the Salesians: \\"St. Francis Xavier made that emotional appeal to the studious youth of his times. From the same wonderful land of India I renew his appeal so that many may come to work in Assam ... The harvest is rich... but the laborers are few\\". At that time, missionaries were valued as facilitators for social improvement and uplift, and delegations were continually calling on Ferrando from the Asom, Khasis, Mundas, Karbis, Tiwas, Bodos, the Manipuris, Garos, Nagas and other tribes requesting that he assign priests, nuns, doctors, educationists and other personnel to their communities. In his annual report of 1945–46, Ferrando wrote: \\"This makes me very anxious, because if once a favorable occasion is lost, it is difficult to regain it\\". Missionaries such as L. Piasecki, A. Pianazzi, C. Vendrame and A. Ravalico expended themselves to conform and strengthen the Christians of the large and extensive diocese. On 10 April 1936, the Bishop's House – formerly the residence of the Prefect Apostolic – went up in flames. Ferrando immediately began plans to build the diocese a proper Cathedral with adjacent seminary, bishop's house and a resthouse for exhausted missionaries. At the beginning of 1937, Ferrando spent several weeks visiting villages and baptized hundreds of catechumens and confirmed two hundred souls. During World War II, the British Government ordered the internment of most of the Italian and German missionaries throughout British India. While fifty-six of his missionaries were interned or expelled, he was left with thirty priests and twenty other clerics to man the diocese. Believing it necessary to organize the local people to take up clerical positions, Ferrando founded the \\"Missionary Sisters of Mary, Help of Christians\\" (MSMHC) in 1942. In 1962, he succeeded at last in setting up the St. Paul's Minor Seminary in Shillong. In early 1969, the Government of India declared that foreign missionaries must be recalled and replaced by locals. As a result of this, Ferrando too resigned (he submitted his resignation to Pope Paul VI) and made way for an Indian citizen to be appointed; he was appointed as the Titular Archbishop of Troyna. Ferrando retired to Italy, where he lived back in his hometown of Genoa. Ferrando was a regular contributor of articles of missiological, cultural, anthropological, geographical and historical nature on the Assam Mission to such publications as the Bollettino Salesiano, Gioventù Missionaria and more. Ferrando died in Genoa on 21 June 1978. ==Beatification process== The process of beatification commenced in Shillong after the Archdiocese of Genoa transferred its rights to conducting the cause on 11 April 2003. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints – under Pope John Paul II – granted approval to the cause on 23 April 2003 which gave Ferrando the title Servant of God. The diocesan process spanned from 8 August 2003 until 13 August 2006. The Congregation declared the process valid on 17 October 2008 and began their own evaluation. The postulation compiled the Positio for the Congregation and submitted it to them upon its completion in 2012. On 5 March 2015 the theologians advising the Congregation approved his life and virtues while the Congregation itself met on 23 February 2016 and also approved the cause's continuation – it received papal approval on 3 March 2016 allowing for Pope Francis to declare him as Venerable. The postulator is Pierluigi Cameroni. ==References== ==Sources== The non-copyrighted book Apostle of Christ: Essays in Honor of Bishop Stephen Ferrando, S.D.B. edited by Drs.

To claim the diamonds, all three benefactors must be present at the bank or, if dead, their death certificates must be presented. Shortly after Don's death, Vikrant attempts to eliminate Guru by assassinating the Indian home minister in full view of television cameras while disguised as him. Guru flees to the US disguised as someone else to escape prosecution. Guru moves to the street where Anmol and his family live. Anmol recognizes him from the news. His mother-in-law forces him to go to India, along with his father-in-law, Manilal to tell Vikrant about Guru and get the reward.

Most notably, she worked for a manufacturer named Victor Bijou, designing \\"sport dresses and beach wraps\\".Bernadine Morris, \\"Ellen Stewart's Two Scenes\\", The New York Times, February 13, 1968. Stewart had no background in theatre, yet she became a key figure in the beginnings of the Off-Off- Broadway movement. In 1961, Stewart founded Café La MaMa together with Paul Foster and others. A major reason she began the theatre was because her foster brother, Frederick Lights, wanted to be a playwright and he was having difficulty getting his work produced. Café La MaMa eventually became La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club. The theatre was named, La MaMa, after Stewart because she was referred to by many as \\"Mama\\". La MaMa was created as a space for playwrights to experiment with their new work without the influence of critics or commercial interests. These young playwrights included Sam Shepard, Lanford Wilson, Robert Patrick, and Harvey Fierstein as well as actors such as Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Bette Midler. In the early days of La MaMa, Stewart continued designing clothing in order to support the theatre. She had an incredible work ethic and dedication, and her influence on experimental theatre was enormous. Stewart was known to come out before a performance to “ring a cowbell and announce La MaMa’s dedication to the playwright and all aspects of the theatre.” She also contributed as a designer to many of the early productions, including Tom Eyen's Miss Nefertiti Regrets (1965)La MaMa Archives Digital Collections. \\"Production: Miss Nefertiti Regrets (1975)\\".

In 1974, Stewart converted a former television studio at 66 East Fourth Street into a 295-seat theatre entitled, La MaMa Annex. In 2009, the annex was renamed as, the Ellen Stewart Theatre. La MaMa also has an art gallery and a six-story rehearsal space in the East Village. Altogether, La MaMa puts up approximately 70 productions a year. In 1992, Stewart was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame. She was the first Off-Off-Broadway Producer to receive this honor.

She was appointed an officer in the Ordre de Arts et des Lettres of France and received a Distiguished Services to Art and Culture Award in the Ukraine. She also received an award from Japan and a human rights award from the Philippines. More recently, the Ellen Stewart International Award was created to be given to ”an individual theatre artist or theatre company whose work promotes social change and community participation with a particular focus on the engagement of young people”. The International Executive Committee chooses ten artists or companies, then gives the award to one of the ten chosen. The awardee receives a trip to attend the International Theatre Institute’s World Congress and a residency at La MaMa Umbria to create a new work to be produced at the Spoleto Festival of Two Worlds and at La MaMa. A book about Stewart and La MaMa, Ellen Stewart Presents: Fifty Years of La MaMa Experimental Theatre, by Cindy Rosenthal, was published in 2017. ==Death== Ellen Stewart died on January 13, 2011, at the age of 91.

His father was a blues musician who played guitar and accordion. When Henry was young, his family moved near Cairo, Illinois. Henry left home at the age of nine because of his abusive father and hoboed his way to St. Louis, Missouri. He learned guitar while in his early teens from a locally renowned blues guitarist known as Dudlow Joe. With aspirations to earn a living with his guitar, Townsend also worked as an auto mechanic, a shoe shiner, a hotel manager, and a salesman. By the late 1920s he had begun touring and recording with the pianist Walter Davis and had acquired the nickname Mule, because he was sturdy in both physique and character. In St. Louis, he worked with some of the early blues pioneers, including J. D. Short. During this time period, he also learned to play the piano. Townsend was one of the only artists known to have recorded in nine consecutive decades. He first recorded in 1929, for Columbia Records in Chicago, and remained active up to 2006. He performed on 35 recordings in 1935 alone. By the mid-1990s, Townsend and his one-time collaborator Yank Rachell were the only active blues artists whose careers had started in the 1920s. He recorded on several different labels, including Columbia, Bluesville Records, and Folkways Records. By the mid-1950s, the popularity of the St. Louis style of blues had begun to wane in the United States, so Townsend worked in Europe where he felt his music was more appreciated. His European concerts drew large audiences, and he also appeared at many festivals. Townsend said wryly that he has been \\"rediscovered three or four times\\". Articulate and self-aware, with an excellent memory, Townsend gave many invaluable interviews to blues enthusiasts and scholars. Paul Oliver recorded him in 1960 and quoted him extensively in his 1967 work Conversations with the Blues. That book was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1991, in the Classics of Blues Literature category. Thirty years later, Bill Greensmith edited thirty hours of taped interviews with Henry to produce a full autobiography, A Blues Life, giving a vivid history of the blues scene in St Louis and East St Louis in its prime. In 1979, Bob West recorded Townsend in St. Louis. That recording was released on CD in 2002 on Arcola Records as The Real St. Louis Blues. Townsend died on September 24, 2006, at the age of 96, at St. Mary's Ozaukee Hospital, in Mequon, Wisconsin, just hours after having been the first person to be presented with a \\"key\\" in Grafton's Paramount Plaza Walk of Fame. > While [Henry Townsend] did not scorn his old recordings, he had no taste for > spending his later years simply recreating them. Blues, for him, was a > living medium, and he continued to express himself in it, most remarkably in > his songwriting. —Tony Russell, The Guardian ==Selected discography== * 1966: Blues Rediscoveries (Folkways Records) * 1970: The Country Blues: Vol. 2 (Folkways Records) * 1973: Henry T.

In 1982, his album St. Louis Blues (with his wife Vernell Townsend) was nominated for a Blues Music Award in the Traditional Blues Album category. Townsend was a recipient of a 1985 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. In 1995 he was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. On February 10, 2008, Townsend was posthumously awarded a Grammy, his first, at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards. The award, in the category Best Traditional Blues Album, was given for his performances on Last of the Great Mississippi Delta Bluesmen: Live In Dallas, released by the Blue Shoe Project. Townsend's son, Alonzo Townsend, accepted the award on his behalf. On December 4, 2009, a marker commemorating Townsend was added to the Mississippi Blues Trail. ==See also== * List of blues musicians * Chicago Blues Festival * Kentuckiana Blues Society ==References* Blue Shoe Times outlining Henry's life * Illustrated Henry Townsend discography * Townsend Discography on Folkways * Henry James Townsend (1909): The last surviving Paramount recording artist, by Alex van der Tuuk. *, 35 minutes.

There was no federal gaming structure before this act.Burris, Tracy. \\"How Tribal Gaming Commissions Are Evolving\\", Gaming Law Review 8 Number 4(2004): 1-4. The stated purposes of the act include providing a legislative basis for the operation/regulation of Indian gaming, protecting gaming as a means of generating revenue for the tribes, encouraging economic development of these tribes, and protecting the enterprises from negative influences (such as organized crime).Utter, Jack. American Indians: Answers to Today's Questions. 2nd Ed. University of Oklahoma Press, 2001 (362-363) The law established the National Indian Gaming Commission and gave it a regulatory mandate. The law also delegated new authority to the U.S. Department of the Interior and created new federal offenses, giving the U.S. Department of Justice authority to prosecute them. The law has been the source of extensive controversy and litigation. One of the key questions is whether the National Indian Gaming Commission and Department of Interior can be effective in regulating tribal economic decisions related to Indian gaming. Many of the controversies have produced litigation, some of it reaching U.S. Supreme Court. ==Background and precedents== ===Historic and cultural=== Gambling is a part of many traditional Indian cultures. Tribal games include dice and shell activities, archery competitions, races, and so on. When Native Americans were moved to Indian Reservations in the mid- to late 1800s, most were left with limited economic opportunity. Today, most of these reservations \\"are located in remote areas with little indigenous economic activity…[They] have some of the highest rates of poverty, unemployment, welfare dependency, school dropout, alcoholism, and other indicators of poverty and social distress of any communities in the U.S.\\" The use of gaming to generate profit did not begin until the late 1970s and early 1980s within Indian communities. Several tribes, especially in California and Florida, opened bingo parlors as a way to earn revenue. Their actions were related to the search for new sources of revenue, given the emphasis the Reagan administration placed on economic self- sufficiency for the tribes. ===Legal=== While bingo was legal in California and Florida, those states had stringent regulations. Operating on the history of tribal sovereignty, some tribes did not comply with these laws. High-stakes Indian bingo operations soon arose in California, Florida, New York and Wisconsin. The industry grew rapidly. State governments began contending that revenues from their own gaming operations dropped as Native American operations increased the potential stakes. Several laws influenced the creation of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). Many of these influential laws came from U.S. Supreme Court rulings regarding tribal sovereignty. While a number of court rulings played a significant role in the development of legislation regarding reservation gambling rights, two landmark cases, Bryan v. Itasca County and California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, provided major legal breakthroughs. ====Bryan v. Itasca County==== In the early 1970s, Helen and Russell Bryan, members of the Chippewa Tribe, lived on a reservation in Itasca County, Minnesota. In 1972, the county notified them that their mobile home was subject to state property taxes. Unable to pay the tax, they turned to legal services and filed a class action lawsuit against the state, alleging that the state did not have the jurisdiction to tax personal property of Native Americans living on reservations. According to the U.S. Constitution, the federal government possesses the sole right to treat with Native Americans. Case law has since granted Congress jurisdiction over Indian reservations. Yet, Public Law 280, passed by Congress in 1953, transferred criminal jurisdiction over Indian reservations from the federal government to certain states.Melton, Ada P., and Jerry Gardner. \\"Public Law 280: Issues and Concerns for Victims of Crime in Indian Country.\\" American Indian Development Associates-Supporting Tribal Self-Determination Through Education, Health, Justice and Community Development. Web. 02 Dec. 2011. Although both the district court and Minnesota Supreme Court originally ruled in favor of the state, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed this decision in 1976. The Court interpreted PL 280 more narrowly, designed to address only \\"crimes and civil disputes, not a unilateral grant of broad authority to states.\\" Therefore, states were given jurisdiction over criminal laws on reservations, but not over civil regulatory laws. This new interpretation of PL 280 opened the gates for the Indian gaming industry and led to the creation of a variety of economic development ventures on reservations. Gaming soon became the most widely successful economic initiative on reservations across the country. ====California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians==== Another court case that paved the way for the IGRA was in the mid-1980s when the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians started a small bingo parlor and card club on their southern California reservation. Although the state attempted to shut down these gambling operations, the Cabazon tribe filed a lawsuit against the state, claiming that such an action was illegal in light of prior court rulings and the sovereign rights of the reservation. The state, on the other hand, argued that running such a high-stakes gambling organization was illegal and therefore punishable as a criminal violation of law, in accordance with Public Law 280. The Cabazon case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The \\"Native American cause\\" prevailed as California gambling laws were ruled regulatory, not prohibitory. The ruling was made because of the allowance of another form of gambling: the state lottery. This ruling plainly recognized the sovereign rights of Indian tribes living on reservations. By affirming that gambling could not be regulated by states (unless state law prohibited all forms of gambling), the Court opened the door for the Native American gaming industry. Gambling quickly became a popular instrument for economic development on reservations striving for economic opportunity. As the growth in Indian gaming continued in the 1980s (grossing over $110 million in 1988), though, tensions increased.Kramer, Kelly B. \\"Current Issues in Indian Gaming: Casino Lands and Gaming Compacts\\", Gaming Law Review 7, Number 5(2003): 1-7 States began lobbying the federal government to allow states to regulate Indian gaming. States argued that their regulation was needed to stop infiltration by organized crime. They also wanted to be able to tax revenues gained by Indian gaming. Tribes fought the states in an effort both to maintain tribal sovereignty and to protect Indian gaming revenues to support economic development.Light, Steven Andrew, and Kathyryn R.L. Rand. Indian Gaming and Tribal Sovereignty: The Casino Compromise, University Press of Kansas, 2005. (41-43) Congress responded with the set of compromises which evolved into the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. pp. 60–64. The primary legislators involved in drafting the Act were Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, Representative and then (as of 1987) Senator John McCain of Arizona, and Representative Mo Udall of Arizona. Representative Udall had previously sponsored numerous bills regarding Native American issues and rights. At the time, Senator McCain was serving as a member of the Committee on Indian Affairs, of which Senator Inouye was the chairman. As S.555, the bill passed the United States Senate on September 15, 1988. The House passed the bill on September 27. President Ronald Reagan signed it into law on October 17, 1988. Some aspects of the law were later clarified through court cases. Whether revenue from the Indian casinos was subject to other governmental taxation was determined in Chickasaw Nation v. United States. And, in 2009, the Supreme Court ruled in Carcieri v. Salazar that the Department of the Interior could not take land into trust that was acquired by tribes recognized after 1934. ==Three classes== The Act establishes three classes of games with a different regulatory scheme for each: ===Class I=== Class I gaming is defined as (1) traditional Indian gaming, which may be part of tribal ceremonies and celebrations, and (2) social gaming for minimal prizes. Regulatory authority over class I gaming is vested exclusively in tribal governments and is not subject to IGRA's requirements.Utter, Jack. American Indians: Answers to Today's Questions, 2nd edition, University of Oklahoma Press, 2001 (362) ===Class II=== Class II gaming is defined as the game of chance commonly known as bingo (whether or not electronic, computer, or other technological aids are used in connection therewith) and, if played in the same location as the bingo, pull tabs, punch board, tip jars, instant bingo, and other games similar to bingo. Class II gaming also includes non-banked card games, that is, games that are played exclusively against other players rather than against the house or a player acting as a bank. The Act specifically excludes slot machines or electronic facsimiles of any game of chance from the definition of class II games. Tribes retain their authority to conduct, license, and regulate class II gaming so long as the state in which the Tribe is located permits such gaming for any purpose, and the Tribal government adopts a gaming ordinance approved by the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC). Tribal governments are responsible for regulating class II gaming with Commission oversight. Only Hawaii and Utah continue to prohibit all types of gaming.Utter, Jack. American Indians: Answers to Today's Questions, 2nd. University of Oklahoma Press, 2001 (363) ===Class III=== The definition of class III gaming is broad. It includes all forms of gaming that are neither class I nor II. Games commonly played at casinos, such as slot machines, blackjack, craps, and roulette, clearly fall in the class III category, as well as wagering games and electronic facsimiles of any game of chance. Generally, class III is often referred to as casino-style gaming. As a compromise, the Act restricts Tribal authority to conduct class III gaming. Before a Tribe may lawfully conduct class III gaming, the following conditions must be met: *The Particular form of class III gaming that the Tribe wants to conduct must be permitted in the state in which the tribe is located. *The Tribe and the state must have negotiated a compact that has been approved by the Secretary of the Interior, or the Secretary must have approved regulatory procedures. *The Tribe must have adopted a Tribal gaming ordinance that has been approved by the Chairman of the Commission. The regulatory scheme for class III gaming is more complex than a casual reading of the statute might suggest. Although Congress clearly intended regulatory issues to be addressed in Tribal-State compacts, it left a number of key functions in federal hands, including approval authority over compacts, management contracts, and Tribal gaming ordinances. Congress also vested the Commission with broad authority to issue regulations in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Accordingly, the Commission plays a key role in the regulation of class II and III gaming. == FBI jurisdiction == The Act provides the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with federal criminal jurisdiction over acts directly related to Indian gaming establishments, including those located on reservations under state criminal jurisdiction. Since the inception of IGRA, the FBI has devoted limited investigative resources to Indian gaming violations. The Indian gaming industry has grown from one that produced nearly $100 million in total revenues in its first year, to one that exceeds $22 billion annually. This total exceeds the combined gaming revenues of Las Vegas and Atlantic City. This growth, coupled with confusing jurisdictions and limited regulatory resources, has generated great concern over the potential for large-scale criminal activity and influence in the Indian gaming industry. Recent allegations of large-scale fraud and corruption have led to extensive media scrutiny and inquiries from Congressional leaders as to the FBI's response to these allegations. ==The industry== The most recent Indian gaming statistics, provided by the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC), indicate there are approximately 360 Indian gaming establishments in the United States. These casinos are operated by approximately 220 federally recognized tribes, and they offer Class I, Class II and Class III gaming opportunities. The revenues generated in these establishments can be substantial. Tribal casinos located in the eastern United States generated roughly $3.8 billion in FY02. Those located in the Central United States recorded gross revenues of approximately $5.9 billion, while those located in the Western United States generated close to $4.8 billion. Most of the revenues generated in the Indian gaming industry are from Indian casinos located in, or near, large metropolitan areas. Currently, 12% of Indian gaming establishments generate 65% of Indian gaming revenues. Indian gaming operations located in the populous areas of the West Coast (primarily California) represent the fastest growing sector of the Indian gaming industry. There are 565 federally recognized tribes in the United States. While not all tribes will seek to establish tribal gaming establishments, it is likely that more may do so. Additionally, many of the non-federally recognized tribes are seeking federal recognition to gain access to Indian gaming opportunities and other benefits of the federal relationship. ===Regulations=== The Act's purpose is to provide a statutory basis for the operation of gaming by tribes to promote tribal economic development, self- sufficiency, and strong tribal governments. IGRA provides a basis for the regulation of Indian gaming adequate to: shield it from organized crime and corrupting influences; ensure that the tribe is the primary beneficiary of gaming revenues; and ensure Indian gaming operations are fair and honest for the operator and the players. Indian gaming revenues grew from $100 million in 1988 to $16.7 billion in 2003. Since 2009, over $26.5 billion has been generated yearly. Over 220 tribes in 29 states currently conduct 350 Indian gaming operations. Although gaming has caused economic growth among many tribes, it has also become an attractive target to criminal groups who hope to profit from illegal betting, embezzlement, etc. Tribes are responsible to keep their casinos honest and under control; however, with the rapid growth of Indian gaming, federal agencies became involved in keeping Indian casinos crime-free. The IGRA also established an independent federal regulatory authority for gaming on Indian lands, federal standards for gaming on Indian lands, and the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC). NIGC's headquarters is located in Washington, D.C. It is managed by a chairman, appointed by the President of the United States, and has five regional divisions. NIGC Regional Headquarters are located in Portland, Oregon; Sacramento, California; Phoenix, Arizona; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Tulsa, Oklahoma. The NIGC's mission is to regulate gaming activities on Indian lands for the purpose of shielding Indian tribes from organized crime and other corrupting influences. It also seeks to ensure that Indian tribes are the primary beneficiaries of gaming revenue and to assure that gaming is conducted fairly and honestly. In order to achieve this, \\"the Commission is authorized to conduct investigations; undertake enforcement actions, including the issuance of violation, assessment of civil fines, and/or issuance of closure orders; conduct background investigations; conduct audits; and review and approve Tribal gaming ordinances.\\" NIGC auditors and investigators ensure that Indian gaming establishments are complying with the minimum gaming standards outlined in IGRA. To accomplish this, NIGC auditors conduct yearly audits of gaming records maintained by Indian gaming establishments and, when appropriate, investigate regulatory matters. The NIGC has a major responsibility in the growing Indian gaming industry. Based on its congressional mandate, it is dependent on the FBI and/or other federal agencies to investigate allegations of criminal activity in Indian gaming establishments. ===The National Indian Gaming Association (NIGA)=== The National Indian Gaming Association (NIGA) is a nonprofit organization founded in 1985 made up of 184 Indian Nations, with additional nonvoting associate members.Darian-Smith, Eve. New Capitalists:Law, Politics, and Identity Surrounding Casino Gaming on Native American Land, Belmont, CA: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning, 2004 The purpose of the NIGA is \\"to protect and preserve the general welfare of tribes striving for self-sufficiency through gaming enterprises in Indian country,\\" and to \\"maintain and protect Indian sovereign governmental authority in Indian Country.\\" The NIGA seeks to advance the lives of Indian people economically, socially, and politically. To fulfill its mission, the NIGA works with the federal government and members of congress to develop sound policies and practices and to provide technical assistance and advocacy on gaming issues. The NIGA's office building is located in Washington, D.C. The NIGA headquarters building was purchased by a tribal collective. It is the first structure to be owned by Native Americans in Washington, D.C. NIGA is presided by Ernest L. Stevens, Jr. who serves as the chairman and by Andy Ebona acting as the treasurer. ===The Indian Gaming Working Group (IGWG)=== In February 2003, in an effort to identify and direct resources to Indian gaming matters, the FBI and NIGC created the Indian Gaming Work Group (IGWG). The IGWG's purpose is to identify resources needed to address the most pressing criminal violations in the area of Indian gaming. This group consists of representatives from a variety of FBI subprograms (i.e. Economic Crimes Unit, Money Laundering Unit, LCN/Organized Crime Unit, Asian Organized Crime Unit, Public Corruption/Government Fraud Unit, Cryptographic Racketeering Analysis Unit, and Indian Country Special Jurisdiction Unit) and other federal agencies, which include Department of Interior Office of Inspector General (DOI-OIG), NIGC, Internal Revenue Service Tribal Government Section (IRS-TGS), Department of Treasure Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN), Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), US Department of the Treasury, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Office of Law Enforcement Services (BIA-OLES). The IGWG meets monthly to review Indian gaming cases deemed to have a significant impact on the Indian gaming industry. As a result of these meetings, several investigations have been initiated. The IGWG through its member agencies has provided financial resources, travel funds, liaison assistance, personnel resources, coordination assistance and consultation. The IGWG works as follows: # If suspected criminal activities are taking place in the Indian gaming industry and the interested office/agency does not have adequate resources to investigate this matter, the office/agency contacts the Indian Country Special Jurisdiction Unit, FBIHQ, at 202-324-3666. This contact may come from the FBI or an outside source or agency. # A small group of IGWG members will convene to determine if the alleged criminal violation is a matter of \\"national importance\\" in its effect(s) on the Indian gaming industry. If so, the IGWG will invite representatives from the affected FBI division, other federal agencies (if appropriate), the affected United States Attorney's office, and IGWG member agencies to meet and further review the case. # During this review, the agency eliciting the support of the IGWG will make a case presentation. Following a full review, the IGWG will assist the requesting office/agency to identify and obtain resources to assist in the investigation. # Throughout the investigation, the IGWG will assist by providing \\"experts\\" to assist in the investigation; allocating special funding (i.e., facilitating TDY travel, Title III support, special forensic examination, etc.); conducting liaison with other federal agencies; facilitating the establishment of Indian gaming task forces, and/or providing consultation. To properly detect the presence of illegal activity in the Indian gaming industry law enforcement offices with jurisdiction in Indian gaming violations should: # Identify the Indian gaming establishments in their territory. # Establish appropriate liaison with Tribal Gaming Commission (TGC) members, State Gaming Commission Representatives, State Gaming Regulatory Agency Representatives, and Casino Security Personnel. # Establish liaison with representatives from the NIGC and regional Indian gaming intelligence committees. Both will provide valuable information on scams, allegations of criminal wrongdoing, and other patterns of illegal activity. # Make proactive attempts during crime surveys to identify criminal activity in Indian gaming establishments. # Send investigators and financial analysts to training which provides them with the knowledge and skills they need to effectively investigate criminal activity in Indian gaming establishments. ==Economic and social impacts== The overall economic impact of the IGRA on American Indian communities remains unclear. According to Census Bureau data, the inflation-adjusted income of Native Americans living on reservations grew by 83 percent from 1970 to 2000. Although much of this growth was stimulated by federal support in the 1970s, such support faded in the 1980s and 90s. According to the U.S. Census, 24 percent of American Indian families were living in poverty in 1979. Ten years later, following the passing of the IGRA, American Indian poverty rates were at 27 percent. Similarly, the 2010 Census estimated that 26.6 percent of American Indians were below poverty level, the highest of any ethnicity. In 2011, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that of over 4 million Native American citizens, nearly 30 percent are living in poverty, often lacking basic infrastructure. Likewise, Native Americans continue to have the highest unemployment rates of any ethnicity in the U.S. According to the earliest report by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1982, the unemployment level of American Indians living on or near a reservation was about 31 percent. In 1987, just prior to the IGRA, unemployment was 38 percent. By 1989, the year following the enactment of the IGRA, it had increased to 40 percent. The most recent BIA report from 2005 found American Indian unemployment at a staggering 49 percent.U.S. Department of the Interior. Bureau of Indian Affairs. Office of Indian Services. 2005 American Indian Population and Labor Force Report. Washington: GPO, 2005. Web. 12 Nov. 2011. http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/text/idc-001719.pdf The 2010 U.S. Census reported unemployment of Native Americans (including those living both on and off reservations) and Alaskan Natives to be 17.9 percent, tied with African American unemployment as the highest of any race in the U.S. ==Tribal sovereignty== The issue of Native American sovereignty has been debated for over 200 years. Chief Justice John Marshall stated that Native American tribes are \\"domestic dependent nations under the umbrella of U.S. government protection.\\" The IGRA's goals – strong tribal government, self- sufficiency, and economic development—greatly affect sovereignty issues today. Tribes, state governments, the federal government, and businesses disagree about who should be given regulatory power over the thriving Indian gaming industry. To understand the issues of gaming regulatory power and sovereignty, both state and tribal rights must be considered. ===State rights=== Wayne Stein, professor of Native American Studies at Montana State University, says that the purpose of states is to benefit their citizens, especially in economic matters. According to his article titled \\"Gaming: The Apex of a Long Struggle,\\" states are likely the largest \\"opponent of Indian nations, their governments, and their new efforts in the gaming world.\\" States, likely concerned about their own interests, receive criticism for taking a stance that opposes tribal sovereignty. Stein argues that Native Americans are still state citizens, regardless of tribal affiliation, and therefore, like any other state citizen should be benefitted by the state. Because Native Americans are technically part of a state, they are required to pay federal and state income taxes. The only exception is when an Indian both works and lives on a reservation. In that case, Indians are exempt from income taxes. Native Americans are likewise exempt from paying taxes on gaming revenue. Recognizing that they are missing out on untaxed revenue, states often try to gain more control over Indian gaming. Individual states have protested their own lack of control over gaming. Some even cite the tenth amendment – the right for states to have all other powers not specifically designated to the federal government– to fight against gambling. Others feel the federal government is forcing states to enter into unfair gaming-related compacts with Native American tribes. A few states, like Utah and Hawaii, do not permit gambling or casinos. State officials, in general, do not believe Native Americans should be exempt from state laws. Another reason why states argue they have a right to regulate gaming has to do with negative effects associated with gambling. Gambling, in general, has been known to lead to \\"compulsive addiction, increased drug and alcohol abuse, crime, neglect and abuse of children and spouses, and missed work days.\\" Those problems affect communities near Indian casino establishments. Many believe that because states are forced to deal with the negative consequences of Native American gaming, states should have greater power to regulate the Indian gaming industry. ===Tribal rights=== The other side of the issue—tribal rights—also carries important points of consideration. Native American tribes enjoy a limited status as sovereign nations but are legally considered as \\"domestic dependent nations\\" as opined by the Marshall Court in 1829. Native Americans have always had difficulty finding a source of steady income. Traditional Native American ways of life had been taken away, and so a new way to be economically independent was needed. Widespread poverty among Native Americans continues today, nearly two hundred years later. Gaming is one way to alleviate this poverty and provide economic prosperity and development for Native Americans. Naomi Mezey, a professor of law and culture at Georgetown, argues that as Native American gaming regulations currently stand, the IGRA fails to provide Indians with economic independence. The act forces tribes to depend on both federal and state governments. Many Native Americans give up rights in order to receive government financial assistance. \\"The federal entitlement of Native Americans to game on tribal lands does not implicate economic development policy and wealth distribution alone. By redistributing culture and sovereignty, the IGRA has fueled the tribe's long battle from cultural survival and political autonomy.\\" ==Opposition to the IGRA== The IGRA has proven to be a major focus of the controversy surrounding Indian gambling. The controversy and concerns come from the following three main areas: (1) tribal-state compacts (2) negative public reaction, and (3) gambling competition. Tribal-State Compact is a form of cooperation commonly used in Class III gambling. These compacts affect the balance of power between states, federal, and tribal governments. Although the compact must receive final approval from the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, the compact demonstrates a state's ability to regulate and even tax Class III tribal gaming within its borders. In addition, compacts often include language relating to a state's right to enforce criminal and civil law and prosecution for gambling-related crimes. This right may conflict with tribal law enforcement jurisdictions and legal procedures. Since enforcement of gambling-related laws requires resources, states make sure to include language in the compact that requires tribes to financially compensate the state for regulation and law enforcement. As problems often arise because of compacts, the IGRA seeks to carefully define what compacts entail. Some public voices oppose the current practice of government. One reason for the opposition comes from the fact that the Bureau of Indian Affairs grants tax-payer money to tribes for economic development purposes. Some tribes take that money and use it to create casinos and other gaming establishments. Certain citizens reject the idea of using tax payer money to build tax-exempt tribal casinos which generate tax-exempt revenues. Another complaint from other U.S. citizens is the negative effects casinos have on nearby neighborhoods. They argue that casinos increase the amount of traffic, pollution, and crime. As a result, cities find themselves paying the cost of dealing with these issues. Because Indian casinos pose a threat to the Non-Indian casinos, a gambling competition has developed between the two kinds of casinos. Such high-stakes gambling in tribal areas and tax-exempt policy give Indian casinos great advantages in this competition. Consequently, Non- Indian casinos have lobbied the government to strengthen the regulatory power of the states toward Indian gaming. ==Proposed changes to IGRA== Since its passage a variety of changes and proposals have been considered, and changes are still being considered. Congress has discussed proposals to impose a moratorium on any new tribal-state compacts or on new Indian gaming operations. The Indian Trust Lands Reform Act was introduced in 1995 and 1997, marking an attempt to deny the Secretary of Interior the power to take additional lands in trust for Native American tribes if it were for \\"commercial\\" purposes (such as gaming). Several Congressional members have expressed concern about the lack of regulation related to revenue sharing from funds generated by gaming.Light, Steven Andrew, and Kathyryn R.L. Rand. Indian Gaming and Tribal Sovereignty: The Casino Compromise, University Press of Kansas, 2005 (52-53) It is important to note that the regulations and methods of Indian gaming are still evolving and changing. == See also == * Gambling in the United States * Gaming law ==References* * National Indian Gaming Commission * Federal Bureau of Investigation: Indian Gaming Investigations Gaming Regulatory Category:United States federal gambling legislation Category:1988 in law Category:United States statutes that abrogate Supreme Court decisions Category:Wampanoag tribe ","title":"Indian Gaming Regulatory Act"},{"id":"3264828","text":"The Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands was an early joint stock association, which began with private exploration and enterprise, and was to have been incorporated by King Edward VI in 1553, but received its full Royal Charter in 1555. It led to the commencement of English trade with Russia, Persia and elsewhere, and became known informally, and later formally, as the Muscovy Company. ==First phase== The Company was formed in London in about 1551 by Richard Chancellor, Sebastian Cabot and Sir Hugh Willoughby.Early English voyages to Northern Russia: comprising the voyages of John Tradescant the Elder, Sir Hugh Willoughby, Richard Chancellor, Nelson, and others Some 240 adventurers (investorsMorison, Samuel Eliot. The European Discovery of America: The Northern Voyages, p.483) purchased shares at $25 each and a royal charter was prepared for their company under King Edward in 1553, making Sebastian Cabot its Governor. However the King died before it could receive the Seal. The circumstances are described at the opening of the Charter of 1566: > \\"divers very good Subiects of this Realme of England in the latter end of > the reigne of the late right high and mightie prince our Soueraigne Lord > king Edward the sixt, at the gracious incouragement and right good liking of > the said king, and by his Maiesties liberall example, did at their > aduenture, and to their exceeding great charges, and for the glory of God, > the honor and increase of the reuenues of the Crowne, and the common > vtilitie of the whole Realme of England, set forth three ships for the > discoverie by sea, of Iles, lands, territories, dominions and Seigniories > vnknowen, and by the Subiects of the sayd late king not commonly by seas > frequented: and after that Almightie God [...] called to his mercie the said > king, who died before the finishing and sealing of his most ample and > gracious letters of priuiledges promised to the sayd Subiects...\\"E.

Goldsmid, Edinburgh 1886), p. 319. The purpose of the Company was to seek a new, northern trade route to Cathay (China) and the Spice Islands (the Moluccas, now part of Indonesia). The first expedition of the Company was led by Willoughby seeking the Northeast Passage to China. Three ships were outfitted and crewed for the expedition, which departed from London's Deptford Docks on 11 May 1553. Willoughby was aboard the Bona Esperanza (120 tons), with Richard Chancellor in command of the Edward Bonaventure (60 tons) and Bona Confidentia (90 tons). The ships became separated in a storm in the North Sea: the Bona Confidentia and Bona Esperanza rejoined, rounded North Cape and sailed east to Novaya Zemlya. The Edward Bonaventure likewise sailed around North Cape and along the Kola Peninsula, entering the White Sea in August. On 24 August 1553, Chancellor cast anchor near the mouth of the Dvina River and was met by local Russians.The Trade Route around the North Cape to the White Sea While his crew wintered over near present-day Arkhangelsk, Chancellor travelled overland to Moscow, where he was received by Tsar Ivan the Terrible. Willoughby's two ships turned back from Novaya Zemlya in September and attempted to winter over on the coast of Lapland. Every crew member soon died from cold and hunger. Chancellor returned to the White Sea in March 1554 and arrived back in London in the autumn, bearing a letter from Tsar Ivan to the English king, welcoming trade between the two Christian nations. By this time King Edward had died and Queen Mary was ruling in England. ==The Charter of Incorporation, 1555== In 1555 the Company received its formal royal approbation in a Charter of Incorporation issued under the date 6 February 1554/5 (but long afterwards amended to 26 February) by King Philip and Queen Mary, of which the full name was > \\"The Marchants Adventurers of England for the Discovery of Lands, > Territories, Iles, Dominions and Seigniories Unknowen, and Not before that > Late Adventure or Enterprise by Sea or Navigation Commonly > Frequented\\"Goldsmid (ed.), Principal Navigations, III Part ii (1886), pp. > 101-112. as one body and perpetual Fellowship and Commonalty. The promoters of this Charter are headed by William Marquess of Winchester (Lord high Treasurer), Henry Earl of Arundel (Lord Steward of the Household), John Earl of Bedford (Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal), William Earl of Pembroke, and William Lord Howard of Effingham (Lord high Admiral of England), who with others > \\"Haue at their own aduenture, costs and charges, prouided, rigged and > tackled certaine ships, pinnesses and other meete vessels, and the same > furnished with all things necessary haue advanced and set forward, for to > discouer, descrie, and find, Isles...\\" (etc.) The Charter constituted the Company under its Governor, Sebastian Cabot (\\"the chiefest setter forth of this iourney or voyage\\"), with four Consuls, Sir George Barne, William Garrard, Anthony Hussey and John Southcot, with 24 Assistants named from among the principal Adventurers, its many named investors becoming the Fellowship.The fellowship names are omitted from the older printings of the Charter in Hakluyt, but are found in the Calendar of Patent Rolls: Philip & Mary II: 1554-1555 (HMSO 1936/Kraus, Lendeln 1970), pp. 55-59 (Hathi Trust). The Fellowship was to meet annually to elect one or two Governors and 28 of 'the most sad, and honest persons' of their fellowship as Assistants to the Governor or Governors, of whom four were to be chosen Consuls. This became known (for short) as the \\"Muscovy Company\\" or Russia Company, and its members the Merchants of Muscovy or Merchants of Russia.T.S. Willan, The Muscovy Merchants of 1555 (Manchester University Press 1953). See also J. Olson, Historical Dictionary of the British Empire: K-Z (Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996), p. 769. The Company sent Richard Chancellor again to the White Sea in 1555, in the Edward Bonaventura and the Philip and Mary, where he learnt of the fate of Willoughby and spent 1556 in further exploration and negotiations with the Tsar. Having recovered and refitted the Bona Esperanza and Bona Confidentia, he set out to return, taking with him the first Russian Ambassador to England, Osip Gabrilovitsch Nepeya. Three of the ships attempted to overwinter at Trondheim, where both of Willoughby's ships were lost, the Philip and Mary arriving in London in April 1557. Chancellor's ship went ahead but in November 1556 foundered off the east coast of Scotland near Pitsligo, and Chancellor was drowned. Nepeya however was rescued, and was conducted by Viscount Montagu to London, where in March 1557 he was met by a grand procession led by Sir Thomas Offley, Lord Mayor, and conducted through the City to his appointed lodging. Here during the months of March and April he was fêted by the City Companies, and with the exchange of royal gifts he returned safely to Moscow.'A Discourse of the Honourable Receiving into England of the First Ambassador of the Emperor of Russia... Registered by Master Iohn Incent, Protonotary', in Goldsmid (ed.), Principal Navigations, III Part ii (1886), pp. 141-51. ==Elizabeth's Charter of 1566== In 1566 Queen Elizabeth I issued a new Charter of Incorporation to confirm the Company's privileges. This Charter, which was confirmed by Act of Parliament, reincorporated the Company as > \\"The Fellowship of English Merchants for the Discovery of New > Trades\\".Goldsmid (ed.), Principal Navigations, III Part ii (1886), pp. > 319-25. Having referred to Mary's Charter of 1555, this continues: > \\"Since the making of which letters patents, the said fellowship haue, to > their exceeding great costes, losses and expences, not onely by their > trading into the said dominions of the said mightie prince of Russia, &c.;, > found out conuenient way to saile into the saide dominions: but also passing > thorow the same, and ouer the Caspian sea, haue discouered very commodious > trades into Armenia, Media, Hyrcania, Persia, and other dominions in Asia > minor, hoping by Gods grace to discouer also the country of Cathaia, and > other regions uery conuenient to be traded into by merchants of this realme, > for the great benefite and commodities of the same.\\" It continues to explain that there has since arisen unlicensed trade: \\"divers subiects of this realme... minding for their peculiar gaine, vtterly to decay the trade of the said fellowship, haue contrary to the tenor of the same letters patents, in great disorder traded into the dominions of the said mightie prince of Russia, &c.;, to the great detriment of this common wealth:\\" and therefore, that in future no part of these places \\"shall be sailed or traffiqued vnto, visited, frequented or haunted by any person being or that shalbe a citizen or denizen of this realme, by themselues, their factor or factors\\" other than by the order, agreement, consent and ratification of the Fellowship, on penalty of the forfeit ipso facto of their ships and goods so trafficking, half to the Crown and half to the Fellowship.

The agency is headquartered in Woodbridge Township, New Jersey. The NJTA was created in 1949 to oversee construction and maintenance of the New Jersey Turnpike. In 2003, the authority assumed control of the Garden State Parkway, which had previously been maintained by an agency known as the New Jersey Highway Authority (NJHA). ==Board of Commissioners== The New Jersey Turnpike Authority is governed by an eight-person Board of Commissioners (with one current vacant seat). The members of the commission, along with the chairman, are appointed by the Governor of New Jersey. , the commissioners are: *Diane Gutierrez-Scaccetti – Chair *Ronald Gravino – Vice Chairman *Michael R. DuPont – Treasurer *Raymond M. Pocino – Commissioner *Ulises E. Diaz – Commissioner *John D. Minella – Commissioner *Raphael Salermo – Commissioner ==History== The New Jersey Turnpike Authority was created by special legislation on April 14, 1949, to regulate the New Jersey Turnpike, which opened to traffic on November 30, 1951. It issued revenue bonds to finance the road based solely on future tolls, without using tax money. Another agency, known as the New Jersey Highway Authority, was established in 1952 and responsible for maintaining the Garden State Parkway, which opened to traffic in 1954. In July 2003, the New Jersey Legislature approved and Governor James McGreevey signed into law a bill consolidating the New Jersey Turnpike Authority and the New Jersey Highway Authority. The main headquarters of the Turnpike Authority before consolidation was in East Brunswick, while the main headquarters of the Highway Authority was in Woodbridge Township. A few years later, the headquarters of the consolidated Turnpike Authority was relocated to an eight- story office tower on Main Street in Woodbridge, nearby exit 11 on the NJ Turnpike. The Woodbridge building that once housed the Highway Authority now houses the Statewide Traffic Management Center, from which Turnpike Authority personnel monitor traffic on the Turnpike and the Parkway, broadcast traffic and weather advisories to patrons over three AM radio channels, and operate more than 200 variable message and speed limit signs. The Authority also has closed-circuit TV cameras that show pictures of current traffic conditions on the Turnpike and the Parkway. The Turnpike Authority is accountable for the inspection and structural integrity of more than 1,000 bridge structures on the Turnpike and Parkway, to comply with the federally mandated National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS). On July 22, 2014, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority filed a federal lawsuit against Jersey Boardwalk Pizza, a pizza chain in Florida, for using a logo too similar to the signs for the Garden State Parkway. The suit was ultimately dismissed, despite the NJTA having spent $276,000 in legal fees. The New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway toll plazas currently do not recognize pennies as an acceptable payment. As per the Legal Tender Laws of the United States Code, \\"United States coins and currency are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues.\\" ==Traffic management== The New Jersey Turnpike Authority is one third of the participants of a Traffic Management Center (TMC) called STMC (Statewide Traffic Management Center) located in Woodbridge Township. STMC is also the home to New Jersey Department of Transportation and the New Jersey State Police. The STMC is staffed 24/7 and is responsible for the coordination & logistics of statewide resources during major incidents within the State of New Jersey. ==See also== * * ==References== ==External links== * *Letter from Chief Engineer Category:Toll road authorities of the United States Category:Government agencies established in 1949 Category:State agencies of New Jersey Category:Woodbridge Township, New Jersey ","title":"New Jersey Turnpike Authority"},{"id":"3264859","text":"is a Japanese manga artist best known for his work on the manga Outlaw Star from his affiliated Morning Star Studio.

He remained the Head of Department from 1969 to 1977. He was one of the editors of the original Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 68 and a contributing editor to the Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 68. He has written an article outlining his personal account of being part of the design team. Before assuming his role as the Head of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, he was the first Head of the University of Calgary's newly built Math Department. Many of his publications are indexed on the DBLP computer science bibliography site, and the Computer History Museum, software preservation group site. ==Early years== John spent his early years in South Africa receiving a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Mathematics and Physics at the University of Natal, South Africa, after which he received a Master of Science (M.Sc.) in mathematics. His first teaching position was lecturing in mathematics. In 1946, he took a scholarship to Yale University, where he obtained a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in 1950, with a thesis on the topological semigroups. He then went on to teach at Brown University for three years before returning to the University of Natal. In 1955, he emigrate to Canada and taught at the University of New Brunswick followed by four years at McGill University. He left McGill to form the Mathematics Department at the University of Calgary. His interest in computers began in 1959, when he responded to a request from McGill's mathematics department to learn to program a Datatron, and his first programs were written for it. As a result of this experience, he visited the University of Oklahoma to learn to program an IBM 650, another drum memory machine, which had an optimizing assembler named SOAP. The programming language Fortran was emerging then, as the translation was from Fortran to Internal Translator (IT) to SOAP to object code. At the time, his programming was in assembly code. In 1959, when McGill acquired an IBM 650, he was one of the few individuals who could program it. Around 1961, after arriving at the University of Calgary, the university acquired an IBM 1620. He became the computing centre director, while performing his duties as head of the mathematics department. On this machine, he explored list processing methods, and then used these to write a compiler for the language ALGOL 60. This led to an invitation to attend the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) congress as Canada's representative. At this time, revisions were being made to ALGOL 60. He became the Canadian member of the IFIP Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi, which specified, supports, and maintains the languages ALGOL 60 and 68. After his time as department head, he continued to teach at UBC, circa 1978–1979. He was seen arriving at the computer centre's terminal room early morning each weekend on his old-fashioned solid bicycle, beating many graduate students who headed to the terminal room to use the Amdahl mainframe computer in less crowded morning hours. He arrived around 9:00 o'clock, weather permitting. Presumably he was working on an ALGOL 68 compiler system. That a professor of his status was sitting and typing at the terminal at each weekend gave some unspoken lessons to the future researchers. ==References== Category:Canadian computer scientists Category:University of British Columbia faculty Category:1918 births Category:2013 deaths ","title":"John E.

The Cuban band Irakere of Chucho Valdés and El Trabuco Venezolano led by Alberto Naranjo shared a stage three times – twice in Venezuela at the Poliedro de Caracas, in 1979 and 1981 (two concerts each year), and once at the Teatro Carlos Marx in Havana, Cuba in 1981. This recording shows the first of the two face-to-face historic encounters between Irakere and Trabuco that were held in Caracas on May 14 and 15 of 1981. The tone is set by Carlos Daniel Palacios singing the opening Tres días, a tune composed by Valdés and arranged by Naranjo for his Trabuco, as a warm greeting to the foreign guests. Highlights include a rejuvenated version of El Cumaco de San Juan, a traditional Venezuelan merengue metido en clave this time by sonero Joe Ruiz, followed by Formas Libres – a cool and spacious mix of free jazz experimentation and simple composed elements conceived by Naranjo. The other side starts with a Valdés arrangement of La Molinaria de Paisello [sic], based in a variation created by Ludwig van Beethoven on La Molinara theme composed by Giovanni Paisiello in 1788. In this track, tenor sax and flautist Carlos Averhoff and guitarist Carlos Emilio Morales combine to provide a touching performance of jazz and academic. The last track A romper el coco, with the energetic vocalization of Oscar Valdés and Morales soloing on guitar, is quite enjoyable from beginning to end. This album has a significant amount of musical variety and finds Irakere and Trabuco in fine form. ==Track listing== { cellpadding=\\"1\\" width=\\"500px\\" style=\\"font-size: 85%; border: 1px solid gray;\\" - align=\\"center\\" style=\\"font-size: larger;\\" - style=\\"background:lightblue;\\"  #  Song  Composer(s)  Vocal(s)  Solo(s) -  A1  Tres días  Jesús Valdés  Carlos Daniel Palacios  Felipe Rengifo -  A2  El Cumaco de San Juan  Francisco D.

Around 1957, Boris Vian wrote a song La Java Javanaise. The lyrics are a didactical method to learn the javanais. Each verse is firstly articulated in regular French, then translated in slang. As the title suggests, the song is a Java, a Parisian dance craze. In 1962, Serge Gainsbourg wrote and sang a song called La Javanaise, a pun playing on Javanese dancing and the javanais style of speaking.

Born in Pittsburgh in 1786, he was educated by his father, the writer and judge Hugh Henry Brackenridge, and private tutors before attending a French academy at Ste. Genevieve in what is now Missouri. He studied law and was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in 1806, then practiced in Somerset, Pennsylvania. Brackenridge subsequently moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where he was a lawyer and journalist. In 1811, he became the first recorded tourist to present-day South Dakota, hosted by fur trader Manuel Lisa. Henry was appointed deputy attorney general of the Territory of Orleans (Louisiana), and district judge of Louisiana in 1812. He played an intelligence role during the War of 1812, and in 1814 published a history of the war. In 1817 he was appointed secretary of a mission to South America. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1818.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory In 1821, Brackenridge entered the diplomatic service of General Andrew Jackson, who was the new commissioner of Florida. Through Jackson's influence, he served as U.S. judge for the western district of Florida from 1821 to 1832. When President John Quincy Adams established the Naval Live Oak Area on January 18, 1829, Superintendent Brackenridge lived on the property and experimented with cultivating the live oak tree for shipbuilding. He is therefore considered the country's first federal forester. Brackenridge returned to Pennsylvania in 1832 and became owner of a large tract of land upon which he founded the town of Tarentum, 22 miles northeast of Pittsburgh on the Allegheny River. The adjacent Allegheny County borough of Brackenridge is named for him. He was elected as a Whig to the 26th United States Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Richard Biddle, and served from October 13, 1840, to March 3, 1841. He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1840. After politics, Brackenridge pursued literature until his death in Pittsburgh on January 18, 1871. He is buried in Prospect Cemetery in Brackenridge, Pennsylvania. Brackenridge's published works include Views of Louisiana (1814), part of which was a source for Washington Irving's Astoria, and a pamphlet, South America (1817), which puts forth a policy similar to the Monroe Doctrine. Sent to South America to study political conditions, he recounted his experiences in Voyage to South America (1819). His Recollections of Persons and Places in the West (1834) is considered a valuable historical source. == References == * * * The Political Graveyard Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania Category:1786 births Category:1871 deaths Category:Politicians from Pittsburgh Category:Pennsylvania lawyers Category:Pennsylvania state court judges Category:Pennsylvania Whigs Category:Whig Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:People from Pennsylvania in the War of 1812 Category:Members of the American Antiquarian Society Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"Henry Marie Brackenridge"},{"id":"3264887","text":"Stadio Città di Arezzo (formerly Stadio Comunale) is a multi-purpose stadium, located in Arezzo, Tuscany, Italy.

They were popular before the introduction of the vacuum cleaner and have been largely superseded by them. However, they continue to be used in many home and commercial applications because they are lightweight and quiet, enabling users to quickly clean small messes up from the floor without disturbing patrons, patients, babies and pets, and because they do not require electricity to operate. ==Operation== leftA carpet sweeper typically consists of a small box. The base of the box has rollers and brushes, connected by a belt or gears. There is also a container for dirt. The arrangement is such that, when pushed along a floor, the rollers turn and force the brushes to rotate. The brushes sweep dirt and dust from the floor into the container. Carpet sweepers frequently have a height adjustment that enables them to work on different lengths of carpet, or bare floors. The sweeper usually has a long handle so that it can be pushed without bending over. ==Design== The design was patented by Melville R. Bissell of Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States, in 1876. Bissell began selling carpet sweepers in 1883. They became popular in the UK after the first Ewbank model went on sale in 1889.Gantz, Carroll (2012) The Vacuum Cleaner: A History, McFarland and Co Inc, , p. 33 New powered versions were designed at the beginning of the 20th century, with rechargeable batteries and an electric motor to spin the rollers and brushes. ==Modern usage== Carpet sweepers are still available commercially. Their legacy lives on in floor cleaning robots that have limited suction power and rely on sweeping to collect larger bits of debris from the floor. While some research models of robotic vacuums only rely on vacuum motors, models on the market such as Roomba or bObsweep invariably combine suction and sweeping. ==In popular culture== A very early appearance in film occurs in the 1914 Charlie Chaplin film Laughing Gas, where Chaplin uses a sweeper to clean the waiting-room floor of a dentist. Another appearance occurs in the 1989 computer adventure game The Colonel's Bequest, where the butler, Jeeves, uses one to clean up the library and the parlor after the murders of Dr. Wilbur C.

She was a daughter of his sister Adelaide of Normandy, Countess of Aumale and Lambert II, Count of Lens. == Life == In 1070, Judith married Earl Waltheof of Huntingdon and Northumbria. They had three children. Their eldest daughter, Maud, brought the earldom of Huntingdon to her second husband, David I of Scotland. Their daughter, Adelise, married Raoul III de Conches whose sister, Godehilde, married Baldwin I of Jerusalem. In 1075, Waltheof joined the Revolt of the Earls against William. It was the last serious act of resistance against the Norman conquest of England. Judith betrayed Waltheof to her uncle, who had Waltheof beheaded on 31 May 1076. After Waltheof's execution Judith was betrothed by William to Simon I of St. Liz, 1st Earl of Northampton. Judith refused to marry Simon and she fled the country to avoid William's anger. William then temporarily confiscated all of Judith's English estates. Finally, Simon married Judith's daughter, Maud, in or before 1090. Judith founded Elstow Abbey in Bedfordshire around 1078. She also founded churches at Kempston and Hitchin. She had land-holdings in 10 counties in the Midlands and East Anglia. Her holdings included land at: *Earls Barton, Northamptonshire *Great Doddington, Northamptonshire *Grendon, Northamptonshire *Ashby Folville, Leicestershire *Lowesby, Leicestershire *Merton, Oxfordshire *Piddington, Oxfordshire *Potton, Bedfordshire *Sawtry, Huntingdonshire The parish of Sawtry Judith in Huntingdonshire is named after the Countess. ==From the Domesday Book== In POTONE Hugh holds ½ virgate of land from the Countess.

Apotropaic observances may also be practiced out of vague superstition or out of tradition, as in good luck charms (perhaps some token on a charm bracelet), amulets, or gestures such as crossed fingers or knocking on wood. The Greeks made offerings to the \\"averting gods\\" (), chthonic deities and heroes who grant safety and deflect evil. == Symbols == === Egypt === An ancient Egyptian apotropaic wand shows a procession of protective deities. It was used in birth rituals, perhaps to draw a magic circle around the mother and child. Apotropaic magical rituals were practiced throughout the ancient Near East and Egypt. Fearsome deities were invoked via ritual in order to protect individuals by warding away evil spirits. In ancient Egypt, these household rituals (performed in the home, not in state-run temples) were embodied by the deity who personified magic itself, Heka.Robert Ritner (1988). The Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice. Chicago: The Oriental Institute of Chicago, 14-28. The two gods most frequently invoked in these rituals were the hippopotamus-formed fertility goddess, Taweret, and the lion-demon, Bes (who developed from the early apotropaic dwarf demon-god, Aha, literally \\"fighter\\").James F. Romano (1978), The Origin of Aha (also called Bes). New York: College Art Association, 1978. Objects were often used in these rituals in order to facilitate communication with the gods. One of the most commonly found magical objects, the ivory apotropaic wand (birth tusk), gained widespread popularity in the Middle Kingdom (ca. 1550 – 1069 BCE).Hartwig Atlenmüller (1965). Die Apotopaia und Die Götter Mittelägyptens. Munich: Ludwig-Maximilians University. These wands were used to protect expectant mothers and children from malevolent forces, and were adorned with processions of apotropaic solar deities. Likewise, protective amulets bearing the likenesses of gods and goddesses like Taweret were commonly worn. Water came to be used frequently in ritual as well, wherein libation vessels in the shape of Taweret were used to pour healing water over an individual. In much later periods (when Egypt came under the Greek Ptolemies), stele featuring the god Horus were used in similar rituals; water would be poured over the stele and—after ritually acquiring healing powers—was collected in a basin for an afflicted person to drink. === Ancient Greece === The Gorgon, flanked by lionesses and showing her belt clasp of serpents; the pediment of the 580 BCE temple of Artemis in Corfu. Archaeological Museum of Corfu. Chalcidian black-figured eye-cup, circa 530 BCE. Staatliche Antikensammlungen Among the ancient Greeks, the most widely used image intended to avert evil was that of the Gorgon, the head of which now may be called the Gorgoneion, which features wild eyes, fangs, and protruding tongue. The full figure of the Gorgon holds the apex of the oldest remaining Greek temple where she is flanked by two lionesses. The Gorgon head was mounted on the aegis and shield of Athena.Harrison, pp 196ff. === Evil eye === Eyes were often painted to ward off the evil eye. An exaggerated apotropaic eye or a pair of eyes were painted on Greek drinking vessels called kylikes (eye-cups) from the 6th century BCE. The exaggerated eyes may have been intended to prevent evil spirits from entering the mouth while drinking. Fishing boats in some parts of the Mediterranean region still have stylised eyes painted on the bows. The defunct Turkish budget airline, Fly Air, adopted the symbol nazar boncuğu (nazar bonjuk) on the vertical stabilizer (fin) of its aeroplanes. The apotropaic Yiddish expression, (in modern Hebrew, ), is somewhat equivalent to the expression, \\"knock on wood.\\" === Grotesquerie === A 12th-century sheela na gig on the church at Kilpeck, Herefordshire People believed that the doorways and windows of buildings were particularly vulnerable to the entry or passage of evil. On churches and castles, gargoyles or other grotesque faces and figures such as sheela na gigs and hunky punks were carved to frighten away witches and other malign influences. Figures may also have been carved at fireplaces or chimneys; in some cases, simple geometric or letter carvings were used for these. When a wooden post was used to support a chimney opening, this was often an easier material for amateur carving. To discourage witchcraft, rowan wood may have been chosen for the post or mantel. Similarly the grotesque faces carved into pumpkin lanterns (and their earlier counterparts, made from turnips, swedes or beets) at Halloween are meant to avert evil: this season was Samhain, the Celtic new year. As a \\"time between times\\", it was believed to be a period when souls of the dead and other dangerous spirits walked the earth. Many European peoples had such associations with the period following the harvest in the fall. (See also: Celtic calendar) === Other === Mirrors and other shiny objects were believed to deflect the evil eye. Traditional English \\"Plough Jags\\" (performers of a regional variant of the mummers play) sometimes decorated their costumes (particularly their hats) with shiny items, to the extent of borrowing silver plate for the purpose. \\"Witch balls\\" are shiny blown glass ornaments, like Christmas baubles, that were hung in windows. Geto-Dacian apotropaic eyes on the Helmet of Iron Gates (4th century BCE) Items and symbols such as crosses, crucifixes, silver bullets, wild roses and garlic were believed to ward off or destroy vampires. In Ireland and Great Britain, magpies are traditionally thought to bring bad luck. Many people repeated various rhymes or salutations to placate them.The children's TV series Magpie preserved these rhymes as its theme song into the 1970s. A worn-out man's buckle shoe from the 18th century was found in the wainscoting of the Combination Room, St John's College, Cambridge. This was placed in the wall \\"as an apotropaic item intended to ward off evil and bad luck.\\" The discovery was interesting, because this kind of magic is a silent tradition in England. After the repairs were done to the wall, the shoe was re-interred along with some current coins, a custom when dealing with finds like this. Replacing the shoe and concealing it respects the original desire of the owner.\\"Artifact\\". Archaeology Magazine. November/December 2016. Page 68. In Ancient Greece, phalloi were believed to have apotropaic qualities. Often stone reliefs would be placed above doorways, and three-dimensional versions were erected across the Greek world. Most notable of these were the urban monuments found on the island of Delos. Grotesque, satyr-like bearded faces, sometimes with the pointed cap of the workman, were carved over the doors of ovens and kilns, to protect the work from fire and mishap.Harrison, pp 187ff \\"The Ker as Gorgon\\". Apotropaic marking, Niemelä Tenant Farm, now at Seurasaari Open Air Museum, Finland A similar use of phallic representations to ward off the evil eye remains popular in modern Bhutan. It is associated with the 500-year-old Buddhist tradition of Drukpa Kunley. It is paralleled by other South Asian uses of the lingam symbol. In Roman art, apotropaic imagery was a common theme. Envy was thought to bring bad luck to the person envied. To avoid envy, Romans sought to incite laughter in their guests by using humorous images. Images such as large phalluses (see fascinus), deformities like hunchbacks, or Pygmies and other non-Roman subjects were common. Romans saw deformity as comical and believed that such images could be used to deflect the evil eye. In Europe, apotropaic figureheads carved onto the prow of sailing ships are considered to have been a replacement for the sacrifice of a thrall during the Age of Invasions by Saxon and Viking sailors, to avoid bad luck on the voyage. Dredging of the Thames under London Bridge led to the discovery of a large number of bent and broken knives, daggers, swords and coins, from the modern period and dating back to Celtic times. This custom seems to have been to avoid bad luck, particularly when setting off on a voyage. Similarly, the burial of an old boot or shoe by the lintel of the back door of a house seems to have had a similar intention. Apotropaic marks such as the initials of the Virgin Mary were scratched near the openings of buildings in England to ward off witches. == Good luck tokens and charms == Amulets for specific purposes on sale at a Shinto shrine in Japan It is difficult to differentiate between items supposed to avert evil and items intended to attract good fortune, but generally a talisman brings good luck whereas an amulet wards off or protects against and is therefore apotropaic. nazars against the evil eye In Western culture, a horseshoe was often nailed up over, or close by, doorways (see Oakham's horseshoes). Model horseshoes (of card or plastic) are given as good- luck tokens, particularly at weddings, and small paper horseshoes feature in confetti. Irish Travelers and Roma often sell white heather to \\"bring good luck\\". (Sometimes white sea-lavender, a species of Limonium, is sold instead.) In Ireland, St Brigid's crosses, woven from rush, were kept indoors (in houses and animal houses) to keep away illness for the year. In some Native American cultures, a dreamcatcher made of yarn like a web is placed above a bed or sleeping area to protect sleeping children from nightmares. == Apotropaic names == Ashkenazi Jews' apotropaic names were often given not at birth but during serious illness. An example is Nekras (Некрас, \\"not handsome\\" in Russian), with the hope the child would be handsome, and Yiddish names Alter and Alte (\\"old\\"). Among Serbian names are many apotropaic names (zaštitna imena, \\"protective names\\"), such as Vuk (and its many derivatives) and Staniša. Some traditional Taiwanese names referenced domestic animals such as \\"buffalo\\" (水牛) and \\"dog\\" (狗, 犬), or humble elements of the landscape like \\"soil\\" and \\"water\\" (土, 水). They conveyed contentment with a peaceful and low- profile life. == See also == * Amulet * Anasyrma * Exorcism * Eyespot (mimicry) * Gargoyle * Gorgoneion * Azusa Yumi * Hama Yumi * Hamsa * Jack-o'-lantern * Witch bottle * Hoko (doll) * Mezuzah * Ofuda * Painted pebbles * Pazuzu * Peijainen * Rosary * Sheela na gig * Singa (mythology) * Talisman == References == == Further reading == * Frazer, Sir James, The Golden Bough, * Graves, Robert, The White Goddess, * Jane Ellen Harrison, Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion * Roud, Steve (2004).

It is also known as Josephus's Discourse to the Greeks concerning Hades because it was erroneously attributed to the Jewish historian since at least the 9th century, although it is now believed to be (at least in its original form) the work of Hippolytus. It was first published in the translation of Josephus by William Whiston. As Whiston's translation is in the public domain, it appears in many present-day English editions of Josephus' work without any noting of its erroneous attribution. == Synopsis == This work describes the author's views on the afterlife against the prevailing view of the \\"Greeks\\" (i.e., the Greco-Romans) of his day. He asserts that : \\"...Hades is a place in the world not regularly finished; a subterraneous region, wherein the light of this world does not shine; from which circumstance, that in this region the light does not shine, it cannot be but there must be in it perpetual darkness. This region is allotted as a place of custody for souls, in which angels are appointed as guardians to them, who distribute to them temporary punishments, agreeable to every one's behavior and manners\\".Wikisource:Discourse to the Greeks concerning Hades The author describes Hades as having \\"a lake of unquenchable fire\\" prepared by God for a future date of judgment. However, both the just and unjust dead are confined in other, separate portions of Hades; all go through a gate guarded by \\"an archangel with an host\\", with the just being guided to the right hand toward a region of light called the Bosom of Abraham. The unjust are violently forced toward the left hand by angels, to a place characterized by fire and which emits \\"hot vapor\\", from which they can see the just but cannot pass over due to a \\"chaos deep and large\\" that serves as a barrier. The author assures the Greeks he is addressing that God will resurrect the dead, raising again their bodies and not transmigrating their souls to different bodies. He insists that God is able to do this, likening the dead body both to sown seed and to material cast into \\"a potter's furnace, in order to be formed again\\". The author says that when clothed with their pure resurrected bodies, the just will no longer be subject to disease or misery. The unjust, in contrast, will receive their bodies unchanged, including their original diseases. All (just and unjust) will be brought before Jesus Christ who will come as Judge; the author specifically dismisses Minos and Rhadamanthus, those whom the Greeks believed were judges of the underworld, as the arbiters of mankind's fate. Instead, Christ will exercise \\"the righteous judgment of the Father towards all men\\", with everlasting punishment for the wicked and eternal bliss for the righteous. The author exhorts his audience to believe in God in order to participate in the reward of the just. The final paragraph quotes an alleged saying of Christ, \\"In whatsoever ways I shall find you, in them shall I judge you entirely\\", which the author uses to claim that if a person living a virtuous life falls into sin, his virtue will not help him escape punishment, while a wicked person who repents in time may still recover \\"as from a distemper\\". == Biblical references == There are many references to the New Testament throughout the \\"Discourse\\". For example, the division of the just and unjust to the right and left suggests ; the reference to the Bosom of Abraham and the \\"chaos\\" clearly are related to the story of Lazarus and the rich man (); the comparison of the body to seed that has been planted recalls ; and the committing of all judgment to Christ comes from . Several of these references are mentioned by William Whiston in his dissertation attempting to prove Josephus was the author (see below). == Authorship == William Whiston in \\"Dissertation 6\\", part of the appendix to his Josephus translation, printed the text of this \\"Discourse\\" in Greek and maintained that the piece was by Josephus, \\"preached or written when he was bishop of Jerusalem\\". However, although generally still reprinted in editions of Whiston's Josephus, later scholars have realized that this attribution is incorrect. This brief discourse, at least in its original form, is now attributed to the church father Hippolytus.; (From the website of the Project on Ancient Cultural Engagement.) The attribution to Josephus, recorded by Photius in his Bibliotheca, did not stand unchallenged even in antiquity, and the \\"Discourse\\" was also ascribed to Caius, Presbyter of Rome, Justin Martyr, and Irenaeus. (From the website of the Project on Ancient Cultural Engagement.) We now know that a work by Hippolytus published in Vol. 5 of the Ante-Nicene Fathers under the title \\"Against Plato, on the Cause of the Universe\\" is essentially the same work as the \\"Discourse\\" attributed to Josephus. This Hippolytus work is in fact a fragment from a longer treatise entitled \\"Against the Greeks.\\" There are, however, some slight differences between the Hippolytus version and the one that has passed under Josephus' name, notably in the final \\"Josephus\\" paragraph. This includes the \\"In whatsoever ways I shall find you\\" quote mentioned above, which is not in Hippolytus' fragment as given in the Ante- Nicene Fathers but does appear in Justin Martyr's Dialogue with Trypho (chapter 47), where it is also attributed to Jesus.

Terry Johnson is the duet lead heard, along with Paul Wilson, on \\"Lovers Never Say Goodbye\\", \\"Love Walked In\\", \\"Time Was\\" and \\"But Not For Me\\", all Billboard chart hits except the latter which is a beautiful album cut. Terry recorded three albums with The Flamingos, Flamingo Serenade, Requestfully Yours and Flamingo Favorites. They toured extensively and appeared five times on the TV show American Bandstand. ==Touring as The Flamingos featuring Terry Johnson== Shortly after Tommy Hunt left the group in 1961, the Flamingos split into 2 groups, one with the Careys and Paul Wilson and one with Terry Johnson and Nate Nelson calling themselves at varying times, the Modern Flamingos, the Fabulous Flamingos and later simply, Terry Johnson's Flamingos. The two recorded on Atco together in 1963 as the Starglows. The result was the beautiful Johnson-penned ballad \\"Let's Be Lovers\\" (b/w \\"Walk Away Softly\\", written by Skyliners' manager and \\"Since I Don't Have You\\" co-author Joe Rock). Johnson wanted to record more than tour and Nate, having a family to support by this time, wanted to perform. Nate joined The Platters shortly after. Terry Johnson would later re-record \\"Let's Be Lovers\\" in 2005 with artists Jeff Calloway and TeeTee for his own Hot Fun Record label. Terry Johnson is the owner of \\"The Flamingos\\" federal trademark and leads the current incarnation of the group. The current lineup is Johnson, Starling Newsome, Stan Prinston and musical director Theresa Trigg. The Flamingos featuring Terry Johnson appeared on two PBS specials: Rock and Roll at Fifty (in which they were the only group to have more than two songs featured) and Doo Wop Cavalcade: The Definitive Anthology. In 2013, The Flamingos released the Diamond Anniversary Tour CD. They continue to perform in concerts across the country. ==At Motown== In 1964, Smokey Robinson recruited Johnson onto the staff of Motown Records where he and Robinson became regular collaborators. Their most notable credited work was the beautiful 1969 Top 10 Miracles hit, Baby, Baby Don't Cry . Other charted hits include \\"Malinda\\" for Bobby Taylor & The Vancouvers and \\"Here I Go Again\\" for Smokey Robinson & The Miracles. Terry also wrote and produced for the Four Tops, the Temptations, Martha and the Vandellas and the Supremes. In 1969, Johnson released the solo 45's \\"My Springtime\\" and \\"Whatcha Gonna Do\\", both b/w \\"Suzie\\" on Gordy Records (a Motown subsidiary.) He then released the follow-up \\"Stone Soul Booster\\" b/w \\"Sandy\\" under the name \\"Buzzie\\". When Smokey moved to California in 1974, Johnson remained in Detroit and later had a short-lived stint as Harold Melvin & The Blue-Notes’ musical conductor. ==Awards, accolades and latter-day ventures== In 1996, Terry Johnson and the surviving Flamingos were awarded the Rhythm & Blues Foundation's Pioneer Award and in 2001, Terry Johnson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with The Flamingos. Shortly after, he re-focused his energy on touring as Terry Johnson's Flamingos, establishing the group as a mainstay of casinos and major concert package tours. In 2003, Johnson was honored by NARAS as \\"I Only Have Eyes For You\\" was inducted into the Grammy Award Hall of Fame. He is also an inductee of The Vocal Group Hall of Fame and has received the Heroes & Legends Award (HAL). In 2017, Terry Buzzy Johnson released two No. 1 singles on the European Indie Music Chart breaking records for being No. 1 for four weeks and is featured on multiple playlist on Spotify. Pollstar Magazine calls him the \\"Musical Chameleon\\". Boyz II Men recruited him and his producing partner Theresa Trigg for their 2017 CD release Under The Streetlight, where they re-produced his famous arrangement of \\"I Only Have Eyes For You\\", which Terry had arranged, sang and played guitar on for The Flamingos. In 2013, Terry released the \\"Diamond Anniversary Tour 2013\\" CD to commemorate the 60th anniversary of The Flamingos. In 2015, Terry's group, The Flamingos, appeared on The View with Whoopi Goldberg. == References == Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:African-American musicians Category:American rhythm and blues musicians Category:The Flamingos members Category:Musicians from Baltimore Category:American songwriters Category:American record producers Category:African-American songwriters Category:Motown artists Category:African-American record producers ","title":"Terry &quot;Buzzy&quot; Johnson"},{"id":"3264999","text":"Frances Mayes is an American university professor, poet, memoirist, essayist, and novelist. ==Biography== Born and raised in Fitzgerald, Georgia, Mayes attended Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia, and obtained her BA from the University of Florida. In 1975 she earned her MA from San Francisco State University, where she eventually became Professor of Creative Writing, director of The Poetry Center, and chair of the Department of Creative Writing. Mayes has published several works of poetry: Climbing Aconcagua (1977), Sunday in Another Country (1977), After Such Pleasures (1979), The Arts of Fire (1982), Hours (1984), and Ex Voto (1995). In 1996 she published the book Under the Tuscan Sun: At Home in Italy. The book is a memoir of Mayes buying, renovating, and living in an abandoned villa in rural Cortona in Tuscany, a region of Italy. It went to Number One on the New York Times Best Seller list and remained on the list for over two years. In 2003 the film Under the Tuscan Sun was released. Adapted to the screen by director Audrey Wells, the movie was loosely based on Mayes's book. In 1999, Mayes followed this literary success with another international bestseller, Bella Tuscany: The Sweet Life in Italy, and in 2000 with In Tuscany. Mayes's first novel, Swan, was published in 2002. With photographer Steven Rothfeld and her husband Edward Kleinschmidt Mayes, she published the phototext Bringing Tuscany Home in 2004. Also a food-and-travel writer, Mayes is the editor of The Best American Travel Writing 2002 and the author of A Year in the World: Journeys of A Passionate Traveller (2006), narratives of her and her husband's travels in Greece, Turkey, Spain, Morocco and other countries.

George Duff had a passion for the sea from early childhood, stowing away on a merchant ship for a voyage when not yet a teenager. At thirteen he joined his great uncle Captain (later Admiral) Robert Duff in the Mediterranean, and was commissioned lieutenant at sixteen, breaking several fleet regulations but made possible by his uncle's interest in his career. During these years, Duff saw action thirteen times on both sides of the Atlantic, including at the Great Siege of Gibraltar and culminating in the battle of the Saintes in 1782 when he was serving on . == Naval career == With a reputation thus secured and plenty of family interest in his career, Duff had little difficulty progressing, being promoted to commander in 1790 and then Post Captain in 1793, a meteoric rise resulting from the growth of the Navy in the buildup to war during this period. It was at this time that he married his childhood sweetheart, Sophia Dirom (sister of Alexander Dirom) in Edinburgh, and that his son Norwich Duff (later to become an admiral in his own right) was born.15 August 1792 In the next ten years, Duff commanded , and all very capably, but without winning the acclaim of some of his contemporaries, particularly those in the Mediterranean under Nelson. Duff was a proud Scotsman as well as a strict disciplinarian. He enforced cleanliness parades every week, and made every effort to make sure that as many Scots as possible served on his ships, although he never gave them preferential treatment over their English comrades. He was also a devoted husband and wrote lengthy letters to his wife during every journey. He and his wife felt that the letters were so personal that they destroyed them after reading, and so the only survivor is his final letter home, which Sophia reportedly was unable to destroy. Following the Peace of Amiens, Duff was given ,April 1804 something of a celebrity ship in the Royal Navy following her capture of the French Hercule in 1799 in which her captain Alexander Hood was killed. Rapidly moulding the ship with his own brand of Scottish discipline, Duff took her to join the fleet off Cadiz at the beginning of October and instantly became friends with Nelson, despite their vastly different characters. Such was Duff's reputation, that Nelson entrusted him with the command of the inshore squadron, which watched the harbour entrance for an enemy appearance. The job was dangerous due to the proximity of the shore, and unpleasant because ships stationed at this point were exposed to the enemy and the threat of failure if the enemy were able to escape. Duff handled the job excellently however, and on 21 October reported that the enemy had left Cadiz and were heading out to sea. == Trafalgar == When the battle began, Mars was stationed directly astern of and was ordered by Nelson to attempt to overtake this, Collingwood's flagship, if he was able. Collingwood however had the advantage, with the Royal Sovereign's hull having been freshly re-coppered before action, so the Mars was the second ship to enter the enemy lines. During this approach, which due to poor wind had been conducted at walking speed, Duff was able to write a final note home to his wife, which he entrusted to his thirteen-year-old son Norwich, who was serving as a midshipman on Mars: > \\"Dearest Sophia, I have just time to tell you we are going into Action with > the Combined Fleet. I hope and trust in God that we shall all behave as > becomes us, and that I may yet have the happiness of taking my beloved wife > and children in my arms. Norwich is quite well and happy. I have, however, > ordered him off the quarter-deck. Yours ever, and most truly, George\\" === Death === Duff did not see more than the few opening shots of the battle, for as Mars engaged the French Fougueux and Pluton, a cannonball from Fougueux raked the quarter-deck and struck Captain Duff at the base of the neck, severing his head completely. The crew were undismayed however, carrying the headless corpse around the deck and giving three cheers in memory of their captain, before replacing him where he fell and covering him with a Union Flag. Command of the Mars devolved on the first lieutenant, William Hennah, who performed a good service and was promoted as a reward. ==Burial and memorial== Following the battle, Duff was buried at sea with his shipmates, 28 of whom had been killed and 69 wounded in the fight. Both Collingwood and young Norwich Duff wrote letters of consolation to Sophia Duff, and Captain Duff was mentioned with honour alongside Nelson and John Cooke in the official report of the battle. Lloyd's Patriotic Fund granted Sophia honours and money. Norwich remained in the Navy, retiring many years later as an admiral. A large marble monument with the inscription \\"Erected at the Public Expense to the memory of Captain George Duff who was killed the XXIst of Octr MDCCCV. commanding the Mars in the battle of Trafalgar in the forty-second year of his age and the twenty-ninth of his service.\\" was raised in St Paul's Cathedral on the wall on the south side of a passage, next to Nelson's tomb, where it can still be seen.

A pieing or pie attack is the act of throwing a pie at a person. In pieing, the goal is usually to humiliate the victim while avoiding actual injury. For this reason the pie is traditionally of the cream variety without a top crust, and is rarely if ever a hot pie. In Britain, a pie in the context of throwing is traditionally referred to as a custard pie. An aluminium pie pan or paper plate filled with whipped cream or more typically, shaving foam can substitute for a real pie. Although pieing is often a harmless practical joke, it can be a political action when the target is an authority figure, politician, industrialist, or celebrity and can be used as a means of protesting against the target's political beliefs, or against perceived arrogance or vanity. Perpetrators generally regard the act as a form of ridicule to embarrass and humiliate the victim. Non-consensual pieing is a punishable offence in criminal law, and depending on jurisdiction is a battery but may also constitute an assault. Non-consensual pieing may also be actionable as a civil wrong (tort) giving in the victim of the pieing the right to recover damages in a lawsuit from the tortfeasor. Pieing and pie fights are a staple of slapstick comedy, and pie \\"tosses\\" are also common charity fundraising events, especially in schools. ==Slapstick== The \\"Mumming Birds\\" sketch (1904), by Fred Karno, the \\"father of \\"slapstick\\", a pie in the face appears in the 'Frivolity music hall scene'. Pieing has its origins in the \\"pie in the face\\" gag from slapstick comedy. It appears on stage in the music hall sketches of the English theatre impresario Fred Karno. It was first seen in film in the 1909 Essanay Studios silent film Mr. Flip starring Ben Turpin. In the story, Turpin has a pie pushed into his face for taking liberties with a woman. Beginning in 1913 with That Ragtime Band and A Noise from the Deep, filmmaker Mack Sennett became known for using one or two thrown pies in many of his comedy shorts. Sennett had a personal rule about who received the pies: \\"A mother never gets hit with a custard pie ... Mothers-in- law, yes. But mothers? Never.\\" At least a half dozen films have been made incorporating extended pie-throwing battles. The first was Charlie Chaplin's Behind the Screen released in 1916. The definitive pie fight in film occurs in The Battle of the Century (1927) starring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, using 3,000 pies. Our Gang's Shivering Shakespeare (1930) winds up with an auditorium full of people throwing pies. The 1935 short subject Keystone Hotel featured a large pie-fight ending with the camera taking a pie. Another major pie-fight film appeared (their first one ever): The Three Stooges' In the Sweet Pie and Pie (1941). Pieing had become such an established gag in Hollywood comedy that the song \\"Make 'Em Laugh\\" from Singin' In The Rain (1952) concludes with the line \\"And then you get a great big custard pie in the face!\\" A film involving pies was the comedy, The Great Race (1965); known for having the largest pie fight in cinematic history. Its $200,000 pie-fight scene used 4,000 pies and one large cake, and took five days to shoot. Pie fights also featured in Beach Party (1963), Smashing Time (1967) and Blazing Saddles (1974). In Bugsy Malone (1976), the \\"splurge guns\\" resembled spud guns which fired custard. Original plans called for Dr. Strangelove (1964) to end with a pie fight; the scene, though filmed, was ultimately deemed excessively farcical by director Stanley Kubrick and removed from the final cut. Surviving stills from the excised pie fight have appeared online. There are many instances in the Looney Tunes series of cartoons where characters \\"pie\\" each other in the face. Bugs Bunny repeatedly hits Elmer Fudd with cream pies during a scene in Slick Hare (1947), and also shoves one in Elmer's face in Hare Do. In Shishkabugs (1962), Bugs Bunny releases a spring-loaded pie into the face of the king, causing the royal cook Yosemite Sam to be led away to a dungeon. Daffy Dilly (1948) has Daffy Duck trying to cure a dying millionaire by getting him to laugh. After he achieves this inadvertently, by landing in a cake, Daffy is hired as a sort of household jester and ends the cartoon by getting repeatedly pelted with cakes and pies. Bugs himself gets pied in Case of the Missing Hare, provoking him to spend the rest of the short wreaking revenge. Frank Sinatra and Soupy Sales covered in pie. Many comedy routines have used a pie as a gag, including ones performed by Soupy Sales and Monty Python, and those of clowns in many circus performances. A popular Nickelodeon reality show called What Would You Do? also features contraptions designed to hit participants in the face with multiple cream pies, often as punishment for losing, or sometimes as a reward for winning, a game performed on the show. The UK Saturday morning programme Tiswas had custard pies as a regular feature and even had a character called The Phantom Flan Flinger, a masked man who pied people. The World Custard Pie Throwing Championships take place annually in the village of Coxheath in Kent, England. ==Political acts== The probable originator of pieing as a political act was Thomas King Forcade, the founder of High Times magazine. In 1970, Forcade pied Otto N. Larsen, the Chairman of the President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography; his action was called the first Yippie pieing.Tom Forcade: Unsung Hero of the Counter-culture By Bill Weinberg. World War 4 Report. Aron Kay, also a Yippie, went on to take up Forcade's pieing tactics. Kay pied, among many others, William F. Buckley, Phyllis Schlafly, G. Gordon Liddy, E. Howard Hunt, and Andy Warhol. A disciple of Aron Kay, Thom Higgins, pied singer and anti-gay rights activist Anita Bryant in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1977 (audio footage of the incident is included in the Chumbawamba song Just Desserts, an homage to the concept of pieing).Rutledge, Leigh (1992).

A computer game was later released in which Gates' head pops up around the screen and the object is to \\"pie\\" as many of his heads as possible in the allocated time. Other victims include designer Karl Lagerfeld, American singer Kenny Rogers, former Dutch finance minister Gerrit Zalm and media tycoon Rupert Murdoch. The anonymous Biotic Baking Brigade has pied or attempted to pie, among others, conservative pundits Ann Coulter and David Horowitz; and Fred Phelps, the controversial leader of the Westboro Baptist Church. Coulter has also been attacked by the \\"terrorist\\" group Al Pieda. The Canadian group the Entartistes, founded by Rhinoceros Party of Canada founder François Gourd, has also pied many, including then-Prime Minister of Canada Jean Chrétien. In 2003 in the city of Calgary they pied Ralph Klein, the premier of the Canadian province of Alberta, saying in their press release: \\"Is it surprising to see Ralph Klein opposing the Kyoto Accord for the right of big corporations to pollute, the same corporations that finance his campaigns?\\"\\"The Art of Pieing.

Newsweek columnist Gersh Kuntzman wrote that pieing \\"deserves to be one of the most celebrated traditions in our so-called culture.\\" Sometimes pieing targets suffer the prank with good humor. Godard was very pleased at being pied and said \\"this is what happens when silent movies meet talking pictures\\"; he intervened with the Cannes authorities on behalf of Noël Godin to prevent him from being arrested. Anti-gay campaigner Anita Bryant, upon being pied by a gay activist on television, joked that \\"at least it's a fruit pie\\", apparently making a pun on the derogatory term for a gay man (\\"fruit\\"). However, moments later she was in tears. By contrast, Bernard-Henri Lévy has on multiple occasions attacked Godin and his followers, and Ann Coulter pressed charges in 2005 when she narrowly evaded a pie at the University of Arizona. Activist David Horowitz said of his pieing, \\"These attacks are sinister. The person who throws a pie is saying, ‘I hate you. I don't want you to speak.' I never saw it coming. And it took away my dignity. When you're lecturing, you're supposed to have an authority. But a pie turns it into a food fight.\\" On January 25, 2010, Canada's Fisheries and Oceans Minister Gail Shea was hit with a pie in her face while touring the Canada Centre for Inland Waters in Burlington, Ontario, in an act of protest against the seal hunt in Canada by animal rights group PETA.\\"Anti-sealing PETA protester smacks Minister with tofu pie\\" .

On May 9, 2017 Alan Joyce, the chief executive of Australian airline Qantas, had a speech interrupted by a man who shoved a pie in his face. === Convicted === ==== Canada ==== Former Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien was hit in the face with a pie by a protester in Prince Edward Island in 2000. His attacker initially was given a prison sentence, but subsequently received a conditional sentence. A woman who missed Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach with a pie at the annual Calgary Stampede breakfast in 2007, and hit a security official instead, was sentenced to 30 days in prison. So was a woman who threw a pie at Calgary Mayor Dave Bronconnier in the summer of 2007. In 2003, a protester who hit then-Alberta premier Ralph Klein in the face with a pie at the Stampede breakfast was convicted of assault and ordered to serve a 30-day intermittent prison sentence. In 2010, a PETA supporter threw a tofu cream pie at Canadian fisheries minister Gail Shea to protest the Canadian Government's support on seal hunting. The act was later condemned by Liberal MP Gerry Byrne as an act of terrorism. ==== United Kingdom ==== Comedian Jonathan May-Bowles (also known as Jonny Marbles) pied Rupert Murdoch in July 2011 during a highly publicized testimony before a British parliamentary committee in connection with the News International phone hacking scandal. May-Bowles was sentenced to serve a six-week prison sentence at Wandsworth Prison in London; this sentence was later reduced to four weeks. ==== United States ==== In August 2010, a Michigan State University student named Ahlam Mohsem, 23, threw a Dutch apple pie into Michigan Senator Carl Levin's face and was arrested on assault and battery charges. The police also charged a man who allegedly distracted the senator before the pie was thrown. Mohsem said she threw the pie with the aim of \\"bringing to light Sen. Levin's war crimes\\" as a \\"Zionist\\". In September 2016, Sacramento, California, mayor Kevin Johnson was attending a charity event at Sacramento Charter High School when a man approached him and hit him in the face with a cream pie. Johnson then punched his assailant. The perpetrator, Sean Thompson, was arrested on a felony charge of assaulting a public official and misdemeanor charge of battery on school. ==== Spain ==== Pie smash to Yolanda Barcina in Toulouse On 27 October 2011, the Spanish politician Yolanda Barcina was hit by three pies during a meeting in Toulouse, France. The pies were thrown by Gorka Ovejero Bengoa, Deputy Mayor of Arruazu at the time, Julio Martín Villanueva and Ibon García Garrido, protesting against a high-speed rail line. On 27 November 2013 a Spanish court condemned all three to a fine of 900 euros and two years in prison each. An accomplice who did not throw a pie was condemned to one year in prison. Yolanda Barcina claimed bodily harm, suffered because of \\"the hardness of French meringue pie\\". ==== Sweden ==== In September 2001, the Swedish king Carl XVI Gustaf was visiting Varberg when a 16-year-old boy threw a strawberry tart at him. Such an attack could possibly have counted as high treason under Swedish law, which would have warranted a long prison sentence. However, the perpetrator was only convicted of assault, as it could not be proven that his action was politically motivated. He was later ordered to pay day-fines. Two other boys, who had helped to prepare the attack by making the tart, were also fined. ==Charity== A person gets \\"pied\\" in a fundraiser for ALS. At charity fundraisers, a pie-toss event usually involves a local celebrity, generally a person either in a position of authority or fame, who is intended as the \\"victim\\". People attending the event pay for or bid on the opportunity to smoosh the volunteer victim in the face with a pie; throwing is generally not allowed anymore as the impact can cause injury, and the smoosh is usually in slow-motion and applied without great pressure. Although this takes the element of chance out of the event, it allows the opportunity to smear pie more thoroughly in the victim's face and potentially through their hair. One additional option is allowing the person who has purchased or won the opportunity to use the pie to also fill it, usually with a variety of extremely messy dessert toppings: chocolate, cherries, caramel sauce, strawberry sauce, etc. Plastic bags for the victim to protect their clothing and hair are optional. Witnesses standing too close to the victim(s) may be splattered. Pie-in-the-face variants on the Ice Bucket Challenge also emerged in 2014, most commonly under the name \\"Pie In The Eye Challenge\\", in which the nominated person must receive a pie in the face instead of the bucket of iced water poured over the head. In some cases, individuals underwent both challenges in the same video. One particular occurrence of this, the late 2016 Waitress Pie Challenge, was initiated by the cast of the musical Waitress to raise awareness of breast cancer. ==Sports== In Major League Baseball, Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher A. J. Burnett (formerly of the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Phillies) pies teammates who drive in or score the winning run in a walk-off win (a game won on a hit by the last batter). Burnett's \\"pies\\" are filled with either shaving cream or whipped cream. Burnett has pied Alex Rodriguez, Johnny Damon, Melky Cabrera, Jorge Posada, Hideki Matsui, Nick Swisher (twice), Robinson Canó (twice), Francisco Cervelli,Pie Is Again Served at Yankee Stadium New York Magazine Juan Miranda, Mark Teixeira, Jerry Hairston, Jr., Marcus Thames, Brett Gardner, Alex Presley, and most recently, Josh Harrison and Russell Martin. Burnett usually pies the player while he is being interviewed on the field by a TV reporter. Other players have become well-known and celebrated for their pieing. During his tenure as a member of the Philadelphia Phillies, utility infielder Tomás Pérez would commonly pie teammates during post-game interviews. The pieing tradition in baseball has extended beyond game-winning hits to any outstanding performance. Rookie Stephen Strasburg was pied by teammate John Lannan after his historic debut when he struck out 14 Pittsburgh batters. Matt Garza of the Tampa Bay Rays was pied by Evan Longoria after Garza pitched the first no-hitter in Rays history July 26, 2010. Most recently, Baltimore Orioles rookie Manny Machado was pied by teammates Robert Andino and Adam Jones after hitting two home runs (the youngest Oriole ever to do so) in only his second major league game. On July 26, 2010, the Florida Marlins left fielder Chris Coghlan injured himself while pieing teammate Wes Helms after Helms's single won the game in the bottom of the 11th inning. In response, manager Edwin Rodríguez said that there will be no more such celebratory antics. J. P. Arencibia was pied in the face after hitting two home runs in his MLB debut against the Rays. ==See also== *Egging *Food fight *Glitter bombing *Incidents of objects being thrown at politicians *List of people who have been pied *List of practical joke topics *Milkshaking *Shoeing *Slapstick comedy == References == ==Further reading== * Agent Apple.

The service supports the WGA screenwriting credit system but is also available for non-members to use. This is one of the distinctions that makes the WGAE and WGAW true guilds and not simply a trade union bargaining for existing members. Registration with the Guilds has become important in lawsuits for copyright infringement, especially where the degree of copying is very loose or vague or conceptual: invoking a Guild itself as registrar indicates that the Guilds' standard concept of property rights in literary works were expected to be followed by at least the registrant. Although registration is an important part of assisting in protecting a writer's rights to his or her work and determining compensation, registration is not the same as a U.S. copyright. Although a registration may constitute evidence in a copyright dispute, registration is not proof of copyright registration or ownership. Additionally, an official copyright registration with the U.S. Library of Congress is required to invoke the jurisdiction of U.S. federal courts, where most copyright infringement claims are adjudicated. ==See also== * WGA screenwriting credit system * Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE) * Writers Guild of America West (WGAW) * Writers Guild of America Award * Screenwriter * Screenplay ==External links== *Writers Guild of America, West script registry service *Writers Guild of America, East script registry service Category:Copyright law Category:Intellectual property law Script registration service ","title":"WGA script registration service"},{"id":"3265059","text":"Eduardo Paolozzi's The Wealth of Nations, located in South Gyle in the sculptor's home town of Edinburgh. The inscription is from Albert Einstein and says, Knowledge is wonderful, but imagination is even better. South Gyle (pronounced ) is an area of Edinburgh, Scotland, lying on the western edge of the city and to the south and west of an area of former marshland once known as the Gogarloch, on the edge of Corstorphine. Most of the buildings in the area are of recent origin, dating from the later 1980s, 1990s and early 21st century, with the exception of some farm workers' cottages and an early 1970s council estate abutting South Gyle railway station. South Gyle can be neatly divided into two main zones - a residential one, incorporating Gogarloch and the neighbouring area centred on South Gyle Mains; and a commercial/business one which incorporates the Gyle Shopping Centre, Edinburgh Park, Gyle Park (an actual park, but with some shopping centres near it), and South Gyle Crescent. The Royal Bank of Scotland and sportscotland are all based in this district. The Lochside development also features a number of busts of Scottish poets. ==Etymology== \\"Gyle\\", which is pronounced with a hard \\"g\\", is of uncertain etymology. It has been suggested that it comes from an old Gaelic word \\"goill\\" meaning a \\"bog\\", which would make sense given the former Gogar Loch in the area. There is also a North Gyle about away, which is named after a local farm. This is incorporated in some street names in that area. ==Transport== Edinburgh Airport is nearby at Ingliston, and also close is the city bypass (A720), connecting to several major routes into the city. South Gyle has two branch railway stations: South Gyle station is on the line between Edinburgh and Fife, and Edinburgh Park station provides services to Edinburgh, Stirling and Dunblane and to Bathgate. Edinburgh Trams serve the area with stops at Bankhead, Edinburgh Park Station, Edinburgh Park Central (Lochside) and The Gyle Shopping centre. North of the Gogar Roundabout, the Edinburgh Gateway Interchange opened in December 2016. It connects trains from Fife with the tram to and from the airport. A subway under the busy A8 provides access to the Gyle Shopping Centre. ==Government== The Scottish Prison Service has its headquarters in South Gyle.\\"Headquarters.\\" Scottish Prison Service. Retrieved on 30 May 2010. ==Education== The area is served by Gylemuir Primary School, on Wester Broom Place. The closest secondary schools are St Augustine's RC High School and Forrester High School. ==Political ward== Drum Brae/Gyle is the name of a political ward within the Edinburgh West UK Parliament Constituency and the Edinburgh Western Scottish Parliament constituency. ==Notable residents== * Andrew & George Combe, 18th Century phrenologists, who lived at Redheughs during childhood. * William Neill lived here towards the end of the 1960s. ==References== * Bell, Raymond MacKean Literary Corstorphine: A reader's guide to West Edinburgh, Leamington Books, Edinburgh 2017 * Cant, Michael, Villages of Edinburgh volumes 1 & 2, John Donald Publishers Ltd., Edinburgh, 1986-1987. & * Cosh, Mary Edinburgh the Golden Age (2003), Birlinn, Edinburgh * Grant, James, Old and new Edinburgh' volumes 1–3 (or 1–6, edition dependent), Cassell, 1880s (published as a periodical): Online edition * Harris, Stuart (1996).

Next he cut off Dapyx, who had taken refuge in a fort, and besieged him.

He was the son of Count Nikolay Pavlovich Ignatyev, who was the Minister of the Interior under Tsar Alexander III. After the October Revolution brought the Bolsheviks into power, Ignatieff fled Russia with his family, ultimately ending up in Canada. ==Life and family== Ignatieff married Princess Natalia Nikolayevna Meshcherskaya (1877-1944) in Nice, France, on April 16, 1903. They would have seven children, all boys, two of whom died as infants. He was a graduate of the University of Kiev. Afterward, he entered the Imperial Ministry of Agriculture, eventually becoming a director of one of its departments in 1909. He was appointed in 1912 as Assistant Minister of Agriculture. In 1915, during the First World War, he was appointed Minister of Education. He held that position until December 1916. During the October Revolution, Ignatieff was arrested and was to be executed. However, he was spared by the Polish commissar overseeing his execution, who said that Ignatieff was a good man because he had implemented progressive policies such as Polish language rights while Education Minister. Ignatieff and his family then fled to England in 1919 and lived on a farm in Sussex, before moving to Canada. In 1925, the family immigrated to Canada and settled permanently three years later in Upper Melbourne in Quebec, where he died on August 12, 1945. One of Ignatieff's sons, George, was a prominent Canadian diplomat. One of his grandsons, Michael Ignatieff, is an author, Harvard professor, former Canadian Member of Parliament and former leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. ==References== * Ignatieff, Michael.

It was the fifth in Nikon's professional film camera line, which began in 1959 with the Nikon F. It followed the Nikon F4 of 1988, which had introduced in-body autofocus to Nikon's professional line. The F5 was in turn succeeded by the Nikon F6, as well as Nikon's parallel range of professional digital SLRs, beginning with the Nikon D1. Important advances in the F5 included: * Nikon 3-D color matrix meter (the F4 had introduced multi- segment matrix metering to the F series, but color sensing was new). * A self- diagnostic and self-adjusting shutter. * A mirror-balance system that reduced camera shake. * Electronically controlled exposure times from 1/8000 second to 30 seconds. * Built-in 8 frame per second motor drive (up from 5.7 frame/s on the F4). * 1/300 second flash sync (up from 1/250 on the F4). However, at 1/300 second, flash units could not use their full capacity. * Full support for Nikkor AF-S and G designated lenses (the F4 could not use G lenses in aperture-priority or full manual modes). * Support for the Vibration Reduction (VR) image stabilization feature of newer Nikkor lenses. * Five focus points for the autofocus sensor (up from one on the F4) with intelligent dynamic autofocus mode. * A new industrial design by Giorgetto Giugiaro (also designer of the F3 and F4). * An integral vertical/battery grip with additional shutter release and adjustment wheel controls (previous Nikon F models had used a range of removable battery grips). The Nikon F5's standard DP-30 metering prism.Like all previous Nikon F series cameras, the F5 maintained a manual film rewind (with a rapid power rewind built in), high durability, exceptionally short shutter lag, interchangeable 100% coverage viewfinders (including a large-view Action Finder, Waist-Level Finder, and 6x High- Magnification Finder, in addition to the stock DP-30 multi-metering pentaprism), and support for a wide range of Nikon F-mount lenses. In common with the F3 and F4 it relied upon battery power in order to function, either from eight AA batteries or an optional rechargeable NiMH battery pack. Variants: Nikon introduced a very limited production anniversary edition of the F5 to celebrate 50 years of Nippon Kogaku (Japanese Optical). It featured a titanium colored top plate, grey handgrip (vice red) and a special DP-30 metering prism with its historic \\"Nikon\\" font. On the reverse is found the original Nippon Kogaku trademark logo and a stylized \\"50\\" beneath it. Approximately 3000 were made for the global market. They were quickly snatched up around the world by collectors who saw the F5 as the last of the true professional grade film SLRs by Nikon. It was discontinued in 2004 as it was facing tough competition from its competitors. == Kodak digital camera conversions == A Kodak DCS 760, a 6 megapixel digital SLR based on a Nikon F5 body During the late 1990s, Nikon and Kodak collaborated on a range of professional digital SLRs which combined Nikon bodies with Kodak digital sensors and electronics. The initial range was based around the semi- professional Nikon F90, but the later Kodak DCS 600 and DCS 700 models were based on the Nikon F5. On a physical level they consisted of a Nikon F5 with the film transport equipment replaced with a custom-made Kodak digital back. The digital back extended beneath the camera to house the battery and a pair of PCMCIA card slots. The Kodak DCS 600 series was launched in 1999, and initially consisted of the 2 megapixel Kodak DCS 620 and the 6 megapixel DCS 660, which had an initial launch price of $29,995.David Brooks, September 1999, \\"Digital Cameras At PhotoPlus Expo West '99\\", Shutterbug.com The DCS 600 series was continued in 2000 with the Kodak DCS 620x, a high-sensitivity model with an upgraded indium tin oxide sensor and a cyan-magenta-yellow Bayer filter, which had a then-unique top ISO setting of ISO 6400. Kodak replaced the 600 series with the upgraded DCS 700 series in 2001, which consisted of the high-sensitivity DCS 720x and the 6 megapixel DCS 760. By 2001 Kodak faced competition from the popular Nikon D1 and Nikon D1x,Digital Photography Review: Kodak DCS 760 Review, July 2001 which were physically smaller and cheaper.

The Writers Guild of America, for instance, uses this term exclusively to refer to works registered with its WGA script registration service, so as not to restrict the claims it or its users can make regarding their rights. ==Narrower than \\"intellectual property\\"== Since it applies only to literary works and not technological or social constructs such as are covered by patent or trademark law, the term is much narrower in scope than the hotly contested term \\"intellectual property\\" sometimes used to refer to all non-physical works in which property rights are recognized. ==Differences between literary property and other non-physical property== Among other differences, in literary works a very specific concept of attribution is a critical part of the work itself - works tend to become markedly less valued or more valued based upon who originated or created it, which is simply not the case for inventions or brand names. Also, most countries recognize moral rights that are not alienable from the work, that is, a purchaser of rights in the work does not have the right to relabel it as if someone else had written it. While the USA does not recognize moral rights, it does have complex de facto standards such as the WGA screenwriting credit system which are actually more demanding and rigorous in specific industries.

The area is along the western end of the Frogston Road between Fairmilehead and Gilmerton; it is just to the south of Liberton and the Braid Hills. Mortonhall House The area was the estate of Mortonhall House, a fine country mansion house of 1769, with an exceptional interior. It is thought to be designed by the Edinburgh architect, John Baxter, with interior work added by Thomas Bonnar. The main house has been converted into offices and flats. The stable range (now a bar) dates from around 1780 and is also particularly fine, including an intact cobbled courtyard. The immediate grounds of the Hall contain a caravan site and a garden centre. To the north, the land has been developed as Mortonhall Golf Club; to the east, there is a 1970s housing estate. The land to the south, on the far side of Frogston Road, is mostly farmland. Some half a mile to the west, on Frogston Road lies Morton House, the Dower house to Mortonhall. This is smaller and less ornate but still impressive, sitting in a small group of historic properties all originally connected to the estate. Ironically, being built in 1702, it predates the current Mortonhall House. This is because the current main house replaced an earlier house marked on early maps from the 17th century.Ainslies Map of Scotland The area is perhaps best known for the Mortonhall Crematorium, designed by Sir Basil Spence, which is considered to be an outstanding example of Scottish modern architecture. It is based on the same design as his work at Coventry Cathedral. The crematorium opened in 1967. It has a lush woodland setting, and acts as a local park. The land to the north-west acts as a Garden of Remembrance. The large expanse of open ground to the west acts as a Cemetery, but owing to a policy of all stones having to be laid flat, it has a rather sterile appearance. ==History== The Mortonhall scabbard was recovered nearby although its exact findspot is uncertain. This scabbard is from a sword dating to the first century AD, probably from around the time of the first Roman invasion of Scotland.Stead, I.M. 2006, British Iron Age Sword and Scabbards British Museum Press, Catalogue number 206. The land of Morton and of Mortonhall, part of the Moor of Pentland, was originally granted to Sir Henry St Clair of RosslynSt. Clair was one of the signatories of the Declaration of Arbroath; his brother was William Sinclair, Bishop of Dunkeld, and he was presumably related to William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness, builder of Roslin Chapel in 1317 by Robert I. In 1630, Morton came into the ownership of one William Rigg, whose son sold it to the Porterfield family of Comiston; it was later bought back by another son, and in 1789 it was sold to the Trotter family, who had acquired the Mortonhall estate in 1635.History of Mortonhall They built a modern house on the land, Mortonhall House, in 1769, which was later improved in 1835.Liberton, A Topographical Dictionary of Scotland (1846) ==References== Category:Areas of Edinburgh ","title":"Mortonhall"},{"id":"3265197","text":"Plasma recombination is a process by which positive ions of a plasma capture a free (energetic) electron and combine with electrons or negative ions to form new neutral atoms (gas). Recombination is an exothermic reaction, meaning heat releasing reaction. Recombination usually takes place in the whole volume of a plasma (volume recombination), although in some cases it is confined to some special region of it. Each kind of reaction is called a recombining mode and their individual rates are strongly affected by the properties of the plasma such as its energy (heat), density of each species, pressure and temperature of the surrounding environment. An everyday example of rapid plasma recombination occurs when a fluorescent lamp is switched off. The low-density plasma in the lamp (which generates the light by bombardment of the fluorescent coating on the inside of the glass wall) recombines in a fraction of a second after the plasma-generating electric field is removed by switching off the electric power source. Hydrogen recombination modes are of vital importance in the development of divertor regions for tokamak reactors. In fact they will provide a good way for extracting the energy produced in the core of the plasma. At the present time, it is believed that the most likely plasma losses observed in the recombining region are due to two different modes: electron ion recombination (EIR) and molecular activated recombination (MAR). ==See also== Recombination, plasma ","title":"Plasma recombination"},{"id":"3265205","text":"In statistical analysis of time series and in signal processing, directional symmetry is a statistical measure of a model's performance in predicting the direction of change, positive or negative, of a time series from one time period to the next. ==Definition== Given a time series t with values t_i at times i=1, \\\\ldots, n and a model that makes predictions for those values \\\\hat t_i, then the directional symmetry (DS) statistic is defined as :\\\\operatorname{DS}(t,\\\\hat t) = \\\\frac{100}{n-1}\\\\sum_{i=2}^{n}d_i, :d_i = \\\\begin{cases} 1, & \\\\text{if }(t_i - t_{i-1})(\\\\hat t_i - \\\\hat t_{i-1})> 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, & \\\\text{otherwise} .\\\\end{cases} ==Interpretation== The DS statistic gives the percentage of occurrences in which the sign of the change in value from one time period to the next is the same for both the actual and predicted time series. The DS statistic is a measure of the performance of a model in predicting the direction of value changes. The case DS=100\\\\% would indicate that a model perfectly predicts the direction of change of a time series from one time period to the next. ==See also== *Statistical finance == Notes and references == * Drossu, Radu, and Zoran Obradovic. \\"INFFC data analysis: lower bounds and testbed design recommendations.\\" Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering (CIFEr), 1997., Proceedings of the IEEE/IAFE 1997.

The Stadio Dino Manuzzi, officially known as Orogel Stadium Dino Manuzzihttp://www.orogelstadium.it/ for sponsorship reason, is a football stadium in Cesena, Italy. It is currently the home of Cesena FC. The stadium holds 23,860. ==History== The stadium was initially constructed in 1957 but at the time had no seats, just two terraces. In 1973, when AC Cesena reached Serie A status, the stadium was greatly expanded and could hold 30,000 spectators. In this version of the stadium, the highest ever attendance was recorded when on 10 February 1974, 35,991 people watched Cesena defeat giants AC Milan. The stadium was called La Fiorita from its construction until 1982, when it became named after former Cesena president Dino Manuzzi. In 1988, the stadium underwent a complete restructuring were all of the existing stands were demolished and then rebuilt. The new capacity was reduced to 23,860. As a part of Italy's Euro 2016 bid, the Dino Manuzzi was included and there were plans to invest close to €30m on the stadium. The planned changes included an increase in capacity to over 31,000, new press boxes, VIP lounges and media boxes. This fell through after Euro 2016 was awarded to France. At the beginning of the 2011–12 season, the pitch was converted to an artificial playing surface, with Cesena becoming the first club to do so. On 13 August 2011, at the end of the Italy - Japan rugby match, fans were allowed to enter the pitch and take a cut out of grass with them. That same summer some further work was carried out on the stadium, including a capacity expansion by 1,000 seats. New chairs were installed. The chairs were a white and black colour and on one terrace they spell out AC Cesena. Two Plexiglas boxes were also installed on the side of the pitch, each holding eight supporters, where the fans can track the progress of the match from just a few meters away. In 2014, signed a sponsorship agreement with A.C. Cesena, the tenant of the stadium. The stadium would be called Orogel Stadium – Dino Manuzzi. ==References== ==External links== * Dino Manuzzi Dino Category:A.C.
