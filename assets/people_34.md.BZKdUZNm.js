The law replaced the Tobacco Act, Bill C-71 during the 35th Canadian Parliament in 1997, which itself replaced the former Tobacco Sales To Young Persons Act of 1994 as well as the Tobacco Products Control Act of 1989. The Tobacco Act was amended on July 5, 2010 and renamed to Tobacco and Vaping Products Act in 2018 when similar laws concerning vaping products were added. == Purpose == The purpose of the Act is to protect the health of Canadians by imposing limits on the sale and production of tobacco products. It increases awareness of the health risks associated with use of tobacco products. The Act also protects young people by restricting the age of purchase. == Regulations made under the Act  Tobacco (Access) Regulations === The legal age to purchase tobacco products varies with each province. A person may be asked for documentation to verify their age before purchasing a tobacco product. Under the Act, suitable forms of identification include a driver's license, passport, Canadian permanent resident document, certificate of Canadian citizenship with signature, or a Canadian Armed Forces identification card. Forms of identification issued by a provincial, federal, or foreign government with a signature, photo, and date of birth are also accepted. In addition, every retailer must place a sign near the tobacco products. The sign must adhere to the specifications outlined in the Tobacco Act. It must be in a visible location with a surface area no smaller than 600 cm2 with the following text: :\\"It is prohibited by federal law to provide tobacco products to persons under 18 years of age. Il est interdit par la loi f√©d√©rale de fournir des produits du tabac aux personnes √¢g√©es de moins de 18 ans.‚Äù === Tobacco products labelling regulations (cigarettes and little cigars) === Tobacco products must have legible packaging with text in both of Canada's official languages, English and French. The package must contain health warnings and information on toxic emissions, either in the form of text or pictures and text. They must be displayed on equal opposite sides of the packaging, on the largest visible side, and on the lid. The warnings may also be included on a leaflet that is visible when accessing the product. === Promotion of tobacco products and accessories regulations (prohibited perms) === The Act prohibits the promotion and advertising of tobacco products when the terms \\"light\\" or \\"mild\\" are used. This applies to products, packaging, and accessories associated with tobacco. A retailer also cannot display these products if \\"light\\" and \\"mild\\" are on the packaging. === Cigarette ignition propensity regulations === The Act requires that every brand of cigarettes manufactured on or after October 1, 2005, be tested by manufacturers to make sure the cigarette burns up completely less than 25% of the time. The test is to be conducted using 10 layers of filter paper and each cigarette tested must be of the same brand. == References == Category:Canadian federal legislation Category:Health in Canada Category:Tobacco control ","title":"Tobacco and Vaping Products Act"},{"id":"20477444","text":"Mattru Jong commonly known as Mattru (sometimes spelled Matru) is the capital of Bonthe District in the Southern Province of Sierra Leone. Mattru Jung is located on the mainland of Bonthe District, along the Jong River, 52 miles southwest of Bo. The town is the seat of Mongerewa Jong Chiefdom, and is the home of Mongerewa Jong Paramount Chief Alie Badara Sheriff III. The town's current estimated population is about 20,000 people. In 2010 it was 8,199, and in the 2004 census the town had a population of 7,647. The main industries in Mattru Jong are fishing, rice-growing, cassava-farming, and palm oil production. The town is largely inhabited by the native Sherbro and Mende people. The town has several secondary schools, a major hospital and a police station, operated by the Sierra Leone Police Force. ==Name and founding legend== The name Mattru Jong is said to be derived from the Mende words \\"Mo- Tewoo,\\" meaning \\"Place of the Buffalos.\\" According to legend a hunter from Senehun, a village on the bank of the Jong river, canoed across the river in search of game. He was successful in capturing and slaughtering a large buffalo on the opposite side of the river. As more hunters found out about the location and its plentiful supply of buffalo, people began to settle there, rather than return across the river to Senehun. ==Hospital== Mattru Hospital was founded as a dispensary in 1950 by missionary nurses from the United Brethren in Christ (UBC). By 1959 the dispensary had become a 15-bed hospital. The hospital continued to grow in capacity during the 1960s and 1970s, and by 1981 Mattru Hospital had grown to 69 beds, with pediatrics, obstetrics, surgical, and outpatient units, and x-ray and laboratory facilities. In 1994 the hospital was shut down because of the threat of civil war violence, and international personnel working in the hospital were evacuated from the country. The hospital was destroyed by Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels during the war. After the war, Mattru Hospital was rebuilt and reopened by Doctors Without Borders in 2001. They turned the hospital over to the UBC's Sierra Leone Conference in 2002. In October 2009 the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) provided funding through the office of Sierra Leone's First Lady, Sia Nyama Koroma to refurbish and \\"re-brand\\" the hospital as a \\"centre of excellence.\\" On March 31, 2010 President Ernest Bai Koroma visited Mattru Jong Hospital in order to assess its preparedness for the planned April 27, 2010 rollout of free medical services for pregnant women, lactating mothers, and children under the age of five. Staffing, electricity supply and confusion over the hospital's funding status (as a part mission-, part government-run entity) were seen as the major challenges to the hospital's effectiveness. ==Civil war== RUF rebels fighting in the Sierra Leone Civil War captured Mattru Jong at the end of January, 1995. They faced little military resistance as the Sierra Leone Army (SLA) had already withdrawn from the town. Earlier in January the RUF had briefly taken over the Sierra Rutile Company mine in Imperi Chiefdom, Bonthe District, about 10 miles north west of Mattru Jong, but it was recaptured by the end of January. Most of the RUF forces who captured Mattru Jong entered from the direction of Imperi Chiefdom but some may have come from Sumbaya, Lugbu Chiefdom, Bo District, about fifteen miles east of Mattru Jong. Upon settling in Mattru Jong, the RUF set up its own governing structures in the town. The RUF stole medical supplies from the hospital and used it as a training base. Another base known as \\"Camp Lion\\" was set up at Gambia Palm Oil Plantation, nine miles from Mattru Jong. The RUF remained in Mattru Jong for eight months until it was recaptured by the SLA in October, 1995. ==Communications== Mobile phone company Airtel provides coverage of the Mattru Jong area. The service was launched in 2006 by Celtel (now owned by and renamed Airtel). A Western Union branch is located in the town. ==Visits by First Lady== Mattru Jong has been visited by Sierra Leone's First Lady, Madam Sia Nyama Koroma once in 2009 and once in 2010. In February 2009 Madam Koroma addressed supporters of the All People‚Äôs Congress (APC) at the compound of Late Paramount Chief Goba in Mattru Jong. According to a statement released by her office, some of the issues faced by people in Bonthe district that she had identified during her visit included \\"improper health care delivery, poor infrastructure, poor water and sanitation and inadequate means to transport their agricultural produce from place to place\\". In February 2010 it was reported that Madam Koroma would be visiting Bonthe District, including Mattru Jong, as part of an effort to investigate the district's health care needs, especially those of women. A meeting with the board of Mattru Jong Hospital was scheduled and Madam Koroma was also expected to give the keynote speech at a graduation ceremony for nurses who had been trained at the hospital. ==A Long Way Gone== The town was featured prominently in the book A Long Way Gone by Ishmael Beah, a memoir of the author's experiences during the Sierra Leone Civil War. Beah and his brother were visiting Mattru Jong with a group of friends when he learned that his home village of Mogbwemo had been attacked by rebels. Beah and his friends remained in Mattru Jong until the rebels arrived there about one month later. ==References== Category:Populated places in Sierra Leone ","title":"Mattru Jong"},{"id":"20477460","text":"Barry Fey (1938 - April 28, 2013) was an American rock concert promoter from Colorado who was best known for bringing prominent music acts to the United States for the first time. == Career == Fey's first concert was Baby Huey and the Babysitters in 1965 at the American Legion Hall in Rockford that made only $92. On December 26, 1968 Fey promoted the first Led Zeppelin show in the United States. In June 1969, Feyline presented the 3 day Denver Pop Festival, which featured the final performance of The Jimi Hendrix Experience. In 1976 Fey's company Feyline started his Summer of Stars concert series at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. For three consecutive years (1978, 1979, 1980) Fey was voted promoter of the year by Billboard magazine. In 1983 Fey, Chris Blackwell, and U2 produced the U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky concert film. In 1997, Fey was voted into the Touring Hall of Fame by Performance magazine. In 1998, Fey was the majority owner of Breeder's Cup Sprint champion Reraise. Besides concerts Fey has been credited with saving the bankrupt Denver Symphony, and forming the Colorado Symphony Orchestra. He put them on a pay as you go basis, which allowed the symphony to thrive. When the historic Paramount Theater in downtown Denver was facing destruction, Fey stepped in, and signed a ten-year contract, saving the building. In 1983, he opened the doors for Major League Baseball in Denver by teaming up with Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, and putting on an old timers baseball game. In 1991, Fey merged with Universal Concerts, which later bought him out in 1997, after a 30-year career. In an interview with Image magazine they called Fey, \\"Not only the best promoter in the land, but \\"A National Treasure.\\" President Bill Clinton videotaped a message of thanks and congratulations upon Fey's retirement in 1997. In 2009 Fey got his own radio show called \\"Behind the Scenes with Barry Fey\\" on Mile High Sports Radio, 1510 AM that discussed the music business and sports with callers. On January 1, 2010 his official website Barry Fey.com titled the \\"Rockfather\\" was launched where he announced that he would be teaching a class \\"Real History of Rock -n- Roll\\" at the University of Colorado beginning in February and doing speaking engagements worldwide. He also announced that he was in negotiations to write a tell all book about the music business. On November 1, 2011 Fey announced the completion of his book \\"Backstage Past\\" with forewords written by Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne and Pete Townshend. == Death == In spring of 2013, Fey had hip-replacement surgery and struggled afterwards. Unusually dour in the weeks before his death, of the surgery ordeal, Fey said, \\"They tell you it's a major surgery, but they don't tell you how hard it's going to be.\\" With his son Geoffry taking care of him after the surgery, Fey had arranged for his other sons to also be near him. Fey committed suicide on Sunday, April 28, 2013, quite literally between a breakfast omelet order with son Geoffry and its delivery. The Barry Fey Foundation was formed \\"to eradicate suicide in our Colorado entertainment community.\\" The planned 30th anniversary Red Rocks showing of U2's \\"Under a Blood Red Sky\\", a foundation fundraiser in conjunction with the Denver Film Society, was cancelled so as not to compete with fundraising efforts for the devastating mid-September Colorado floods. They plan to show the film in 2014 as part of the popular Film on the Rocks series. Years ago, Fey had made a deal with a former mayor of Morrison, home of the Red Rocks Amphitheatre, to be buried at the residents-only cemetery just below his beloved Red Rocks, but the paperwork was lost and the request denied. The back-up plan was to scatter Fey's ashes at Red Rocks. == References == The Denver Post Denver Biz Journals Colorado Westword ==External links== Category:American entertainment industry businesspeople Category:1938 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Businesspeople who committed suicide Category:Suicides in Colorado ","title":"Barry Fey"},{"id":"20477498","text":"The Visio Karoli or Caroli (\\"Vision of Charles\\") may refer to either of two pieces of early medieval visionary literature: *Visio Karoli Magni, about a dream of Charlemagne *Visio Karoli Grossi, about a dream of Charles the Fat ","title":"Visio Karoli"},{"id":"20477503","text":"The Saga of the Light Isles is a historical fantasy duology by Juliet Marillier.

Leavitt became an early innkeeper, politician and landowner in Warren, Trumbull County, Ohio. Capt.

Dwight was the progenitor of the Dwight family of Northampton, which produced a succession of major New England divines and Yale College presidents, including Timothy Dwight IV and Timothy Dwight V, named for Nathaniel Dwight's father Timothy, an early Puritan immigrant to Dedham, Massachusetts. and John Leavitt of Suffield, a carpenter, farmer and landowner whose family was among the first settlers of Suffield.

Other extended family members were also involved in purchase of Western Reserve lands including Oliver Ellsworth, whose son Henry Leavitt Ellsworth later traveled to the Reserve to oversee family land grants, staying at the inn belonging to his cousin John Leavitt. Capt. John Leavitt, a farmer and merchant, married Silence Fitch of Suffield in 1777.History of the Descendants of John Dwight of Dedham, Massachusetts, Vol. I, Benjamin W. Dwight, John F. Trow & Son, New York, 1874 In 1800 John Leavitt and his wife set out for the Western Reserve, where the town of Leavittsburg was named for the family with the expectation that it would become the market town for Trumbull County. (John Leavitt was also one of the original proprietors of Aurora, Ohio, with members of the King, Phelps, and Granger families of Suffield. Leavitt was also an original proprietor of Mantua, Ohio.) ==Founding of Warren== On his arrival in the Western Reserve, Leavitt discovered that the prospective town of Warren was better situated than Leavittsburg, having more open bottom land and better mill sites. The original ownership of 'township four, range four' - what became Warren - was vested in Ebenezer King Jr. and Capt. Leavitt. On his arrival in the summer of 1800, Capt. Leavitt built a cabin on the west side of what would later become Warren's Main Street. Leavitt subsequently returned to Connecticut, then came back to Warren the following year with wife Silence. The couple had eight children, many of whom later moved to Ohio: William, John Jr, Cynthia, Sally, Henry Fitch, Abdiah, Humphrey Howe and Albert.History of Trumbull and Mahoning Counties, Vol. I, H. Z. Williams & Brothers, Cleveland, Ohio, 1882 The new town, according to some accounts, was infested at the time of Leavitt's arrival by enormous rattlesnakes. In one early account, written when Warren consisted of 16 settlers, an observer mentions a hunt which netted 486 rattlers. \\"At this time,\\" wrote the observer, \\"rattlesnakes abounded in some places.\\" The hunt he witnessed, in which cudgel-wielding settlers chased the snakes off their rock ledges and into their dens, was deemed a success, with the \\"slain collected into heaps... a good portion of which were larger than a man's leg below the calf, and over five feet in length.\\"Historical Collections of Ohio: An Encyclopedia in Three Volumes, Vol. III, Henry Howe, printed by Henry Howe & Son, Columbus, 1891 But Warren's location - rattlesnakes aside - meant the town soon became the dominant town in the Mahoning Valley region. \\"Warren had influence that Youngstown did not possess\\", said the Mahoning Valley Historical Society, referring to Warren's early prominence in the region.Historical Collections of the Mahoning Valley, Vol. I, Mahoning Valley Historical Society, Youngstown, Ohio, 1876 Later settlers also chose to gather at the more propitiously-located Warren, instead of at Leavittsburg. Shortly after his arrival, Capt. Leavitt converted his new home into an inn and tavern, opening the first hotel in Warren.History of the Western Reserve, Vol. I, Harriet Taylor Upton, Harry Gardner Cutler, The Lewis Publishing Company, Chicago, New York, 1910 He was followed to Warren by a steady stream of other family members, including his son John Jr., known as 'Esquire John', who was county treasurer when he died at Warren in 1815; Capt. John's brother Samuel, known as 'Esquire Samuel,' born in Suffield in 1756, who upon visiting Warren in 1800, purchased a farm next door to that of his nephew John Jr. (Samuel Leavitt moved to Warren full-time in 1802, bringing his wife Abigail Kent Austin with him from Suffield. Following the death of his wife in 1816, Samuel Leavitt moved into a house on Main Street in Warren.) ==Other family members== Many members of the family became prominent, including Samuel Leavitt, who served as an Ohio state representative; John Leavitt Jr., who served as Trumbull County treasurer; Humphrey Howe Leavitt, the son of pioneer Capt.

(A later canal built through the farm destroyed the site, and the first race track decayed.) Eventually, members of the extended Leavitt family All the Leavitt family immigrants to Ohio were descendants of Lt. Joshua Leavitt of Suffield, Connecticut, who married Hannah Devotion, daughter of John Devotion (born at Brookline, Massachusetts) of Suffield. Lt. Joshua Leavitt was the son of Josiah Leavitt, born in 1653 in Hingham, Massachusetts, the son of the immigrant English ancestor deacon John Leavitt and his second wife Sarah Gilman, daughter of Edward Gilman, Sr., of Exeter, New Hampshire. in Suffield followed, including Enoch Leavitt (born in 1746, and known as 'Esquire Enoch'), who purchased the land on which most of the town of Warren now stands. Enoch died in 1815 and, like most of the Leavitt family, was buried in the family cemetery at Leavittsburg, largely a wooded area devoid of settlement. Enoch's son, Enoch Jr. became a well-known local physician who resided on his farm at Leavittsburg and by the time of his death in 1827 at age 52 had accumulated roughly of land in Trumbull County. Leavittsburg, the town named for the early Ohio family, had a gristmill for many years, but largely escaped development.History of Youngstown and the Mahoning Valley, Ohio, Vol. I, Joseph Green Butler Jr., American Historical Society, Chicago, 1921 Today it is still rural, and the site of the Leavitt family cemetery, where many members of the family are buried.

Built in the 15th century by the Mamluks of Egypt, it was completed in the reign of Sultan Qaytbay, after whom it is named. It is also colloquially known as The Fountain of Hamidiye by the reason of Abdul Hamid II‚Äôs restoration. It has been called \\"the most beautiful edifice in the Al-Haram Al-Sharif\\" after the Dome of the Rock.Murphy-O'Connor, Jeremiah. (2008). The Holy Land: An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700. Oxford University Press US, pp.98-99. ==History== The fountain/sabil was originally built in 1455 on the orders of the Mamluk sultan Sayf ad-Din Inal.The fountain where the Fountain of Qayt Bay is located today; nothing remains of this original Fountain of Sayf ad-Din Inal. In 1482 (AH 887), then Sultan al-Ashraf Qaytbay (r. AH 872‚Äì901 / AD 1468‚Äì96) completely renovated the structure and made it an extension to his neighbouring Madrasa al-Ashrafiyya, which Qaytbay had ordered built to replace another earlier Mamluk building (in this case, a madrasa built by Sultan Khusqadam in 1465). It is probable that the same team of engineers, architects and builders constructed both the Madrasa al-Ashrafiyya and the Fountain of Qayt Bay, and that they were sent by Sultan Qaytbay from Egypt to Quds to execute the work. The fountain was constructed in a style mostly seen in Egypt, characteristic of the late Burji Mamluk architecture of Qaytbay's period. In 1882-83, the Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid II restored the fountain and made some additions to it. The fountain which is still used continues to provide visitors to the Al-Haram al-Sharif with fresh water. ==Architecture== The Islamic heritage of Jerusalem was maintained by the successor to the Prophet, caliphs, begin with, such as Umar and Abd al-Malik, but also by sultans the likes of Salah al-Din, al-Malik al-Nasir Muhammad, and Qayt Bay, and viceroys such as al-Amir al-Nashashibi. Evidence of these rulers' veneration for Quds is found not only in their exploits as recorded by Mujir al-Din but also in the institutions they founded and patronized, the monuments that survive. The one of that is the Fountain of Qayt Bay. Placed on a raised prayer platform, together with a freestanding mihrab, the Fountain of Qayt Bay is a three-tiered structure over 13 metres high, consisting of a base, a transition zone and its dome.Peterson, Andrew. (1996). Dictionary of Islamic architecture. Routledge, p.136. The tallest part of the fountain is the base, which is a simple square room built in an ablaq construction method of blending red and cream stones, with wide grilled windows and a small entrance. The windows are located on three sides of the building, and there are four steps leading up to the windows on the northern and the western sides, as well as a large stone bench beneath the southern window. On the eastern wall of the fountain, four semi-circular steps lead up to the entrance door. The complex zone of transition steps in several stages from the square base to the round and high drum that merges into the dome itself. At its peak, the building is crowned by a pointed dome decorated with low-relief arabesque stone carvings. The dome is crowned by a bronze crescent, which, unlike other crescents in the sanctuary, faces east and west. It is the only significant dome of its kind that exists outside Cairo and also one of the finest examples of the Mamluks‚Äô use of highly ornate stone-engraved calligraphy. On all four sides of the fountain are ornate inscriptions containing Qur'anic verses, details of the original Mamluk building and the 1883 renovation of the structure. Mamluk-era star-pattern strap work details the building interior, but the external lintels are from the Ottoman era of rule in Palestine. The 1883 renovation largely kept Qaitbay's structure mostly intact. The fountain is dated by an inscription band which goes around the top of the all four sides of the facade. The date is further verified by the writing of the historian, Mujir al-Din al-Hanbali (d. 928 / 1521) who describes the works of Sultan Qaytbay in Quds. ==ReferencesBibliography=== * (pp. 338-343) * (pp. 159‚àí162) * (pp. 606‚àí612) ==External links== *Sabil al-Sultan QƒÅ ºit BƒÅy, archnet *Sabil of Sultan Qaytbay Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1455 Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1482 Category:Mamluk architecture in the State of Palestine ","title":"Fountain of Qayt Bay"},{"id":"20477823","text":"√áomixon Muxiddinov (; born on 15 April 1976) is a retired Tajikistani footballer.

With the team, he scored his first and so far only goal in the top division, under Peloritana. Since 2006, he has played for Mantova in the second division of Italian Football. In July 2009, he signed a two-year contract with Ancona. ==Style of play== Equipped with a powerful physique, Cristante was a hard-working, tenacious and hard-tackling footballer who specialised in defensive roles; a versatile player, he was capable of playing anywhere along the back-line, and throughout his career he was used as a left or right-back, and as a central defender. Originally he played as an attacker, but was soon deployed in defence. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:People from the Province of Pordenone Category:Italian footballers Category:Italy under-21 international footballers Category:Cosenza Calcio 1914 players Category:Calcio Padova players Category:Ravenna F.C. players Category:Piacenza Calcio 1919 players Category:A.C.R.

The film stars Kane Kosugi, Show Aikawa, Masaya Kato, and Naoto Takenaka. In the film, an ex-Navy SEAL attempts to bring down a criminal organization that is benefitting from a dangerous drug called \\"Blood Heat.\\" Muscle Heat was theatrically released in Japan on October, 26, 2002. == Plot == In the year 2009, CPO Joe Jinno (Kane Kosugi), a former U.S. Navy SEAL is sitting in a military jail cell in Roanoke, Virginia. Japanese detective Aguri Katsuragi (Show Aikawa) has gotten amnesty for Jinno, whose refusal to kill terrorists because the enemies he found were scared children had him court martialed. Two months later, Jinno was tasked by U.S. Secretary of Defense to join an undercover mission with Katsuragi to stop the circulation of Blood Heat, a new drug on the market that acts as a super steroid. The man in charge of the drug's circulation, Lai Kenjin (Masaya Kato), has set up the Muscle Dome, an underground fight ring where his champion, Lee Son-Min (Ken Lo), uses Blood Heat and goes through his opponents with ease. At a local nightclub, a deal is about to be made between Kenjin and Russian drug dealers ( Robert Baldwin). However, Joe and Aguri are able to stop the deal from happening. They are unable to stop Kenjin as he escapes and Aguri ends up kidnapped. That night, Joe looks at a big screen TV and finds Aguri in the Muscle Dome, where he is viciously beaten by Lee and is crucified. Lai gets a visit from his Chinese half-brother Lai Kenkyo, whom he hopes can make a merger to distribute Blood Heat. The next day, Joe finds Kenjin's place and begins to make his way through Kenjin's men. When Kenkyo refuses to help his brother, Kenjin murders his brother by impaling a chopstick through his mouth. Joe fights hard against Kenjin's men in the hallway leading to Kenjin's apartment. However, Kenjin escapes by helicopter and Joe is busted by female cop Ayane Katsuragi, Aguri's sister. While in custody, Joe makes his escape and even knocks out Ayane in the process. The next day, Ayane finds Joe again but this time she is not alone. With the cops hot on his trail, Joe jumps off a bridge and lands on a cargo ship. Ayane is warned by her superior, Asakura, that Joe is a \\"walking weapon\\" and that he may be involved with the circulation of Blood Heat. Meanwhile, Joe rescues a young girl named Haruka, whose father turns out to be the creator of Blood Heat and was forced to continue making it by Kenjin. As Haruka and Joe make their way to escape, they find a reluctant group of youngsters underground. The youngsters are revealed to be orphans whose parents were victims of Kenjin, whether it was Blood Heat or losing major bets at the Muscle Dome. The leader of the \\"rats\\" is the mysterious Ken (Noboru Kaneko), who refuses to help Joe and Ayane, who learns of everything that has transpired and decides to help. However, when Joe is caught by Kenjin and refuses an offer to work for him, Joe finds himself in the Muscle Dome against Lee. To give him motivation, the video of Aguri's death is played at the Muscle Dome. In a fit of rage, Joe begins to unleash his skills on Lee, eventually knocking him down. Lee takes Blood Heat and seems to get the upper hand. However, the fight is interrupted by Ken, who decided not only to help but had planted bombs within the confines of the Muscle Dome. Ken appears on the big screen in the dome and tells Kenjin of all he had done and makes various areas explode. However, despite the chaos, Lee continues to fight Joe until Joe finally is able to kill Lee. Ayane learns Asakura was also in cahoots with Kenjin and a scuffle resorts to Ayane gunning down Asakura. Meanwhile, Joe follows Kenjin to an abandoned parking garage, where Lee reveals he wanted Joe because he knows that anger is the driving force to kill someone. Joe and Lee, who has taken Blood Heat, begin to fight using sledge hammers but soon find themselves fighting bare-handed. The two stand off and lunge kick at each other, where just before the hit is made, we get a narration from Joe. A dark figure walks out of the garage and it is revealed to be Joe as Kenjin is seen dead on the ground. Joe meets with the \\"rats\\" and Ayane as they celebrate the end of Blood Heat. When Ken asks Joe who he is, Joe, who had not smiled throughout the film, finally releases a smirk before the credits roll. ==CastProduction== The story for the film was created by Ushio Higuchi, the creator of the popular show Sasuke, known to American audiences as Ninja Warrior. Higuchi had come up with the story with Kane Kosugi, who at the time was not only an actor, but a competitor in a few of the Sasuke competitions. Music video director Ten Shimoyama made his feature film directorial debut with this film. In an age where CGI would replace action, action director Sam Wong revealed at the press conference that he wanted to bring a new style of action for Kane Kosugi, who had become influenced with Hong Kong's style of action. The film would be shot mostly in English and Japanese, but have a few scenes in Cantonese with the appearances of Jackie Chan Stunt Team member Ken Low and the late Hong Kong actor Joe Lee, who plays Kenjin's half-brother. == Stunts == The action scenes were choreographed by two men from Jackie Chan's stunt team, Chan Man Ching (Rumble in the Bronx, Rush Hour), and Sam Wong (Thunderbolt, Supercop). Chan, who befriended Kane due to Kane's friendship with Jackie's godson Sammy Hung (the son of film legend Sammo Hung), loaned Chan and Wong out for the film along with fellow stunt team member Antonio Carpio, who served as assistant action director. A translator was assigned to both men. Kane Kosugi performed all of his own stunts. ==Reception/U.S. release== Despite not being released in North American theaters, the film received reviews from American critics. High Impact Reviews awarded the film a solid 4 stars out of 4, calling it a \\"MUST-SEE Japanese action-er!\\" Netflix.com called it an \\"Intense pulse pounding action film\\". Upon the film's release in the United States, it was re-titled Blood Heat, named after the drug constantly referenced in the movie. Some international DVDs also renamed the film Blood Heat upon release while others kept the film's original title. ==Soundtrack== The film was composed by K≈çji End≈ç. The R&B; band Full Of Harmony (F.O.H.) contributed their song Casino Drive to the film's ending credits. ==NotesReferences== * ==External links== * *Muscle Heat (2002) on Youtube Category:2002 films Category:Films directed by Ten Shimoyama Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese action films Category:Japanese- language films Category:2002 action films Category:Japanese martial arts films Category:Martial arts tournament films Category:Underground fighting films Category:American action films Category:American films Category:Japanese sports films ","title":"Muscle Heat"},{"id":"20478355","text":"This is a list of mayors of the 50 largest cities in the United States, are ordered the United States Census Bureau's by estimated populations as of July 1, 2017.

Klein surfaces may have a boundary and need not be orientable. Klein surfaces generalize Riemann surfaces. While the latter are used to study algebraic curves over the complex numbers analytically, the former are used to study algebraic curves over the real numbers analytically. Klein surfaces were introduced by Felix Klein in 1882. A Klein surface is a surface (i.e., a differentiable manifold of real dimension 2) on which the notion of angle between two tangent vectors at a given point is well-defined, and so is the angle between two intersecting curves on the surface. These angles are in the range [0,œÄ]; since the surface carries no notion of orientation, it is not possible to distinguish between the angles Œ± and ‚àíŒ±. (By contrast, on Riemann surfaces are oriented and angles in the range of (-œÄ,œÄ] can be meaningfully defined.) The length of curves, the area of submanifolds and the notion of geodesic are not defined on Klein surfaces. Two Klein surfaces X and Y are considered equivalent if there are conformal (i.e. angle-preserving but not necessarily orientation-preserving) differentiable maps f:X‚ÜíY and g:Y‚ÜíX that map boundary to boundary and satisfy fg = idY and gf = idX. ==Examples== Every Riemann surface (analytic manifold of complex dimension 1, without boundary) is a Klein surface. Examples include open subsets of the complex plane (non- compact), the Riemann sphere (compact), and tori (compact). Note that there are many different inequivalent Riemann surfaces with the same underlying torus as manifold. A closed disk in the complex plane is a Klein surface (compact, with boundary). All closed disks are equivalent as Klein surfaces. A closed annulus in the complex plane is a Klein surface (compact, with boundary). Not all annuli are equivalent as Klein surfaces: there is a one- parameter family of inequivalent Klein surfaces arising in this way from annuli. By removing a number of open disks from the Riemann sphere, we obtain another class of Klein surfaces (compact, with boundary). The real projective plane can be turned into a Klein surface (compact, without boundary), in essentially only one way. The Klein bottle can be turned into a Klein surface (compact, without boundary); there is a one-parameter family of inequivalent Klein surfaces structures defined on the Klein bottle. Similarly, there is a one-parameter family of inequivalent Klein surface structures (compact, with boundary) defined on the M√∂bius strip. Every compact topological 2-manifold (possibly with boundary) can be turned into a Klein surface, often in many different inequivalent ways. ==Properties== The boundary of a compact Klein surface consists of finitely many connected components, each of which being homeomorphic to a circle. These components are called the ovals of the Klein surface. Suppose Œ£ is a (not necessarily connected) Riemann surface and œÑ:Œ£‚ÜíŒ£ is an anti-holomorphic (orientation-reversing) involution. Then the quotient Œ£/œÑ carries a natural Klein surface structure, and every Klein surface can be obtained in this manner in essentially only one way. The fixed points of œÑ correspond to the boundary points of Œ£/œÑ. The surface Œ£ is called an \\"analytic double\\" of Œ£/œÑ. The Klein surfaces form a category; a morphism from the Klein surface X to the Klein surface Y is a differentiable map f:X‚ÜíY which on each coordinate patch is either holomorphic or the complex conjugate of a holomorphic map and furthermore maps the boundary of X to the boundary of Y. There is a one-to-one correspondence between smooth projective algebraic curves over the reals (up to isomorphism) and compact connected Klein surfaces (up to equivalence). The real points of the curve correspond to the boundary points of the Klein surface. Indeed, there is an equivalence of categories between the category of smooth projective algebraic curves over R (with regular maps as morphisms) and the category of compact connected Klein surfaces. This is akin to the correspondence between smooth projective algebraic curves over the complex numbers and compact connected Riemann surfaces. (Note that the algebraic curves considered here are abstract curves: integral, separated one-dimensional schemes of finite type over R. Such a curve need not have any R-rational points (like the curve X2+Y2+1=0 over R), in which case its Klein surface will have empty boundary.) There is also a one-to-one correspondence between compact connected Klein surfaces (up to equivalence) and algebraic function fields in one variable over R (up to R-isomorphism). This correspondence is akin to the one between compact connected Riemann surfaces and algebraic function fields over the complex numbers. If X is a Klein surface, a function f:X‚ÜíCu{‚àû} is called meromorphic if, on each coordinate patch, f or its complex conjugate is meromorphic in the ordinary sense, and if f takes only real values (or ‚àû) on the boundary of X. Given a connected Klein surface X, the set of meromorphic functions defined on X form a field M(X), an algebraic function field in one variable over R. M is a contravariant functor and yields a duality (contravariant equivalence) between the category of compact connected Klein surfaces (with non-constant morphisms) and the category of function fields in one variable over the reals. One can classify the compact connected Klein surfaces X up to homeomorphism (not up to equivalence!) by specifying three numbers (g, k, a): the genus g of the analytic double Œ£, the number k of connected components of the boundary of X , and the number a, defined by a=0 if X is orientable and a=1 otherwise. We always have k ‚â§ g+1. The Euler characteristic of X equals 1-g. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:Surfaces ","title":"Klein surface"},{"id":"20478470","text":"Justice Anderson may refer to: *Albert Anderson (jurist), an Associate Justice of the Montana Supreme Court *Alexander O.

His father sold some primitive \\"ground hog\\" machines (imported from England) that helped speed up the separation of grain after it was harvested. In 1840, Jerome started a small business threshing his neighbors' crops with the horse-powered devices. In the summer of 1842, he bought six of the machines on credit and traveled first to Chicago by ship. On his way north to Rochester, Wisconsin he sold five and kept one for his own business. Through the winter he worked on improvements to the thresher, but the new model was not ready for the 1843 harvest. By May 1844 the new model which did a better job of fully separating the grain was working. Since Rochester did not have water power available, he moved to Racine, Wisconsin. ==Racine== The Case home on Main Street of Racine He first manufactured the machines in a small shop in Racine, and then built a three-story brick factory in 1847 on the Root River. A new vibrator process introduced in 1852 was so successful he was selling throughout Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio by 1853. By 1855 the plant covered several acres, including a private boat dock on Lake Michigan. In 1856 he was elected mayor of Racine, declined the re-nomination the next year, but was elected again in 1858 and 1860. He often financed the machines with high interest rates. This worked until the panic of 1857 and unreliable state-issued paper money caused many customers to default. Case accepted animals, supplies, and land instead of cash. At the start of the American Civil War, farmers would often walk away from their debts to enlist, sometimes not returning. The labor shortage combined with increased demand for food (with no imports from the south) resulted in a growing business in the 1860s. Massena B. Erskine, Robert H. Baker, and Stephen Bull (his brother-in- law) became partners when J. I. Case Company was officially organized in 1863. Case was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate in 1865 and served one two-year term. Also in 1865 he happened to meet up with a company of the 8th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment returning from the war. He adopted the mascot of the regiment, an eagle named Old Abe, as company symbol. In 1871 he was a founder of Manufacturers' National Bank of Racine and the First National Bank of Burlington. He was an early investor in the Northwestern Life Insurance Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1876 he started another company to make plows, licensing the \\"center draft\\" technology from Ebenezer G. Whiting. Initially called Case, Whitney & Company, when he became sole owner in 1878 it became the J. I. Case Plow Company, and J. I. Case Plow Works in 1884. He was a founder of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters, and president of the Racine County Agricultural Society. Some time in the 1870s he had one of the rare two-story houses built on Main Street in Racine. ==Horses== Currier and Ives print of Jay-Eye-See setting the trotting record in 1884 As he turned over the business to other partners, he spent more time on breeding race horses on his Hickory Grove Farm. Harness racing was the sport of choice among the wealthy in the 1880s. One of his favorite horses was named Jay-Eye-See, a pun on Case's initials. The black gelding, foaled in 1878, broke the mile trotting record of 2:10 at Narragansett Park in 1884. After winning many other races, the horse was injured and retired in August 1889. However, Jay-Eye-See was retrained by Edwin D. Blither to race with a new gait, and three years later set a pacing record of 2:06.25 in 1892 at Independence, Iowa. Both records were quickly broken; the trotting mark on the next day, and the pacing mark in a subsequent heat of the same race. However, the feat of two records was unique enough that the horse became a celebrity. Currier and Ives did a series of prints and the horse's image was used to advertise products by the Case company for years. The horse outlived Case and died in 1909 at the age of 31. The horse \\"known the country over\\" had its obituary printed in national newspapers such as the New York Times. Jay-Eye- See was inducted into the Harness Racing Hall of Fame in 1990 and the Wisconsin Harness Racing Hall of Fame in 1996. ==Death and legacy== Case also owned some Great Lakes ships, a winter home in California, a ranch in Texas, and a stock farm in Kentucky. In 1849 he married Lydia Ann Bull, daughter of DeGrove Bull of Yorkville, Wisconsin. He died on December 22, 1891 in Racine, less than a year before the comeback of his favorite horse. His widow, born August 6, 1826, died December 9, 1909. They had four children live to adulthood: one son and three daughters. Henrietta Case was born March 3, 1858 and married Percival Strong Fuller (1858‚Äì1896). Jessie Fremont Case was born April 17, 1861 and married Mitchell Wallis. Amanda Case was born October 1, 1862 and married Jonathan James Crooks of San Francisco. Following in the footsteps of her horse-loving father, in 1926 she was instrumental in the survival and then success of the Pendleton Round-Up, the huge and still thriving Pendleton, Oregon rodeo. Jackson Irving Case was born October 23, 1865, married Henrietta May Roy on May 25, 1886, and had four sons. He was elected mayor of Racine when he was only 26, but died January 8, 1903 before he was 38. Jay-Eye-See racecar in 1912 with driver Louis Disbrow Three other children died young. The family continued its interest in racing, but times had changed. The company sponsored a team of racing cars, led by driver Lewis Strang until he died in 1911. Around 1912, they named a car after Jay-Eye-See, driven by Louis Disbrow. One of the largest at the time, it had a 290-horsepower engine, and a streamlined shape that looked like an upside-down canoe. A popular, easy to read biography of Case in the context of his company and his times is Stewart H. Holbrook, Machines of Plenty, Pioneering in American Agriculture (New York: Macmillan, 1955). Jerome I. Case High School, located in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, is named in his honor. It is in what is now suburban Racine, near the site of his farm. Most of Hickory Grove Farm is now developed, except for a small open space at named Case-Harmon Field. Jay- Eye-See Avenue at was named for his horse, a block away from Case Avenue which intersects Jerome Boulevard. A planned marble monument to Jay Eye See was never erected, and the horse's grave site neglected for almost a century. After a developer planned to build a parking lot over the suspected grave, local historians located and removed the bones in July 1997. The remains were proposed to be re-interred in the Case family mausoleum at Mound Cemetery. However, by 2003 the bones were still stored in a box at the historian's home waiting for funding for the memorial. The J. I. Case Wetland Wildlife Refuge in Terre Haute, Indiana is also named in his honor. In 2008, Case was inducted into the Association of Equipment Manufacturers Hall of fame. ==References* * Depiction of Jay-Eye-See and two other horses by Currier & Ives * 1915 photo of Jay-Eye-See racecar * Article on Case's involvement with an 1870s experimental automobile * Category:1819 births Category:1891 deaths Category:Mayors of places in Wisconsin Category:Wisconsin state senators Category:Politicians from Racine, Wisconsin Category:People from Williamstown, New York Category:Businesspeople from Racine, Wisconsin Category:19th-century American politicians Category:People from Rochester, Wisconsin Category:United States Harness Racing Hall of Fame inductees ","title":"Jerome Case"},{"id":"20478524","text":"Agaricus pattersoniae is an edible species of mushroom. It is found in the United States, where it associates with cypress trees. It has been proposed for inclusion in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. ==Taxonomy== It was first described in the literature in 1907 by Charles Horton Peck, based on specimens found by , a botany student at Stanford University. She found fruit bodies on Stanford campus in January, where they were growing under pine and cypress trees. The specific epithet was originally spelled \\"Pattersonae\\" by Peck, although this is now considered an orthographic variant. This species is placed in section Sanguinolenti of genus Agaricus. ==Description== The cap, in diameter, is initially almost hemispherical in shape, transforming to broadly convex and finally to flattened or with edges upturned in age. The cap surface is dry, with fibrils when young, but later the fibrils form large, dark brown appressed squamules (2‚Äì9 mm long by 2‚Äì5 mm broad). The cap color may be various shades of brown depending on the maturity of the specimen. The cap flesh is typically thick, firm, white, and stains deep red 20‚Äì30 seconds after injury or bruising. The odor immediately after cutting is mild, faintly spicy, but several minutes may be described as 'fruity'. An edible mushroom, the taste of A. pattersoniae is described as mild, pleasant, and slightly sweet. The gills are free in attachment, closely spaced, broad, and marginate. The light-cinnamon color in young specimens turns to a dark blackish brown in age after the spores develop. Bruised gills stain a vinaceous (wine-colored) red. The stipe is usually long by thick with a bulbous shape. The interior is hollow, with the internal cavity being between thick. The stipe context somewhat fibrous and white in color, except for the basal section which is yellowish. Bruising or cutting results in a red stain after a minute. The surface of the stipe is barely striate above the annulus, and smooth below except for fragments of the universal veil. During development the veils rupture and form an upper veil (partial veil), which initially hangs from the edge of the cap, and a lower veil. As the partial veil disintegrates, it often leaves fragments 2‚Äì3 mm in size attached to the margin. The spores are roughly elliptical in shape, 7‚Äì8.5 by 5.5‚Äì6.5 Œºm. The basidia, which may be 1‚Äì, 2‚Äì, 3‚Äì, or 4‚Äìspored (although usually 4‚Äìspored during active sporulation), are 26‚Äì34 by 7‚Äì11 Œºm, cylinder- to club-shaped, with sterigmata that are 2‚Äì3 Œºm long. Cheilocystidia are 12‚Äì32 by 6‚Äì15 Œºm in size, almost cylindrical or club- shaped, and may appear clumped or continuous. ==Habitat and distribution== Agaricus pattersoniae is associated with cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa) trees, where it fruits singly or in groups. Richard Kerrigan noted that it seems to be restricted to mature trees (age 40+ years) located in the coastal counties of California, although Alexander H. Smith mentions that it has also been found in the Great Lakes regions. The species has been proposed for inclusion in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as part of the Global Fungal Red List initiative. Its main threats include habitat destruction, drought, and decline of cypress trees due to cypress canker from infection by Seiridium cardinale. The cypress trees have been removed from the type locality. ==See also== *List of Agaricus species ==ReferencesExternal links== *California Fungi pattersoniae Category:Edible fungi Category:Fungi described in 1907 Category:Fungi of the United States ","title":"Agaricus pattersoniae"},{"id":"20478527","text":"≈ûu√ßoat Ne'matov (born 26 September 1981) is a Tajikistani footballer whose last known club was Regar-TadAZ Tursunzoda. ==CareerInternational=== Nematov was a part of the Tajikistan national football team squad who won the 2006 AFC Challenge Cup. ==Career statisticsInternational=== {   - !colspan=3Tajikistan national team - !Year!!Apps!!Goals - 200330 - 200400 - 200500 - 200651 - !Total81 } Statistics accurate as of 22 October 2015 ===International goals=== {  ! # !!

He is best known for his translation of the Bible, the most widespread French Bible in the 18th century, also known as the Bible de Port-Royal. ==Biography== Louis-Isaac Lemaistre de Sacy was born in Paris, one of five sons of Huguenot Isaac Le Maistre, and of Catherine Arnauld, who was one of the sisters of Marie Ang√©lique Arnauld. In 1638, when his older brothers Antoine and Simon gave up their careers to retire to Port-Royal, Louis-Isaac joined them to take care of his education. In 1650, he published a collection of prayers, the Heures de Port-Royal, in which he translated the highly successful liturgical hymns. De Sacy was imprisoned in the Bastille on 13 May 1666, remaining there until 14 November 1668. He took advantage of this time to complete the translation of the Old Testament into French from the Vulgate begun by his brother Antoine, and thus became the driving force behind a French language translation of the Bible, called the Bible du Port-Royal or Bible de Sacy. After his release, Louis-Isaac devoted much of his time to revising his translation, and drafting the Commentaires that he wanted to accompany each of the books of the Bible. From 1672 to 1684, the date of his death, de Sacy published 10 additional books of the Bible. Using the manuscripts left by de Sacy, his friend Pierre Thomas (1634‚Äì1698) pursued this task, and undertook the publication, from 1685 to 1693. In 1696, La Sainte Bible contenant l'Ancien et le Nouveau Testament (The Holy Bible containing the Old and New Testament) was published in 32 volumes. == A Bible in French == 225px In the 12th century, the first French version of the Bible was created by Pierre de Vaux, chief of Vaudois. There followed the translation of Guyart des Moulins, composed in the late 13th century and printed in 1488, and then that of Ren√© Beno√Æt, published in Paris in 1566, with marginal notes but which was censured as containing certain Calvinist \\"heresies\\". De Sacy's is better known than previous translations and has been much reproduced. It was really the first translation of the Bible accessible to the non-Latin reading general public. The initiative of translation of the Vulgate came from the lawyer Antoine Le Maistre (1608‚Äì1658), who was the brother of Louis-Isaac, but that translation was not a good fit. At his brother's death (1658), Louis-Isaac then began with his friends at Port-Royal (including Blaise Pascal, Robert Arnauld d'Andilly, Pierre Nicole, and Pierre Thomas) a revision of his Biblical translation, complete with additional books, Greek texts, and the New Testament. This new translation was to be published by Mons in 1667, taking the name Nouveau Testament de Mons. It was presented in 2 volumes in octavo. A new version, corrected by Beaubrun, was published in Paris in 1717 in 3 volumes in folio, with a fourth volume containing the Biblical apocrypha, the Old Testament, the writings of apostolic times, the prefaces of Saint Jerome, and essays on various Biblical matters. ==Characteristics of de Sacy's Bible== Some theologians criticized the translation of de Sacy as sometimes deviating from the letter of the original for no apparent reason. Others saw it as sober and elegant. Sacy's annotations were criticised for favouring the theories of Cornelius Jansen. The Bible de Port-Royal was founded on work carried out in logic at the Port-Royal Abbey in Paris (see Port-Royal Logic). This system of logic proposed to apply mathematical reasoning to other fields of knowledge and thought, including the syntactic and grammatical elements of all statements of language, offering an ideal of a rational language which could reconcile the spirit of finesse and the spirit of geometry: the discourse par excellence. ==See also== * Port-Royal Logic ==Bibliography== * The Bible de Sacy was reissued in 1990 in Bouquins. * Abb√© Dardenne.

Bourdouleix went on to defend himself saying, \\"You all call me Hitler, and you think that's okay, no?\\" He then went on to clarify, \\"[I said that] if I were Hitler, these people here would be killed. There, that's basically what I said.\\" After Bourdouleix refuted comments published by Lemaire, Le Courrier de l'Ouest published audio recording in order to verify their claims, and a forensic analysis of the recording certified it as authentic. This, along with the initial accusations, led to an investigation of Bourdouleix by the Criminal Court of Angers which charged him with condoning crimes against humanity and defamation of the newspaper Le Courrier de l'Ouest. On 23 January 2014 Bourdouleix was found guilty of the charge and was fined 3,000 euros, though his fine was suspended. On 12 August 2014 Bourdouleix's conviction was upheld by the Court of Appeal.

It also authorized the Governor, Secretary of State, and Attorney General to approve the site and upon approval and transferring the one million dollars into the state treasury, the legislature would provide for the erection of the building, and the removal of the capital at Sacramento. As a taxpayer and citizen, Horatio Livermore brought action against the secretary of state to restrain from publishing in the statutes, and sending to the county clerks of the state, the proposed senate constitutional amendment because he felt that congress had out stepped its authority in making this amendment, and that it would be inoperative if approved by the people.

The court provided a definition under Article XVIII of an amendment and a revision: > The very term \\"constitution\\" implies an instrument of a permanent and > abiding nature, and the provisions contained therein for its revision > indicate the will of the people that the underlying principles upon which it > rests, as well as the substantial entirety of the instrument, shall be of a > like permanent and abiding nature. On the other hand, the significance of > the term \\"amendment\\" implies such an addition or change within the lines of > the original instrument as will effect an improvement, or better carry out > the purpose for which it was framed. The court decided that by making the amendment conditional pending the approval was of the new location of the capital by the Governor, Secretary of State, and Attorney General, their votes superseded the vote of the people, and that in effect, the vote of the people would was simply a manner in which to send it to a higher power for approval. This amendment would not become operational on popular approval, but on conditions not specified there. This meant that the proposition was not passed in accordance with either method in the Constitution for amendment or revision, therefore rendering it unconstitutional. == Significance == In August 1999, the Alaska Supreme Court used the ruling in Livermore v. Waite in the case Bess v. Ulmer noting \\"it is helpful to look to the law of California, a state which has considered the issue carefully over a period of nearly one hundred years. A line of California Supreme Court cases, beginning with Livermore v. Waite, has outlined the parameters of the procedures for constitutional change in that state.\\"Bess v.

Pollard and music by George C. Stebbins. It was first published in 1907 in the \\"Northfield Hymnal with Alexander's Supplement\\". Later that year, it also appeared in two other popular hymnals, Ira Sankey's \\"Hallowed Hymns New and Old\\" and Sankey and Clement's \\"Best Endeavor Hymns\\". ==Background== In 1902, Adelaide A. Pollard was hoping to go to Africa as a missionary but found herself unable to raise the needed funds to make the journey. Greatly discouraged, she attended a prayer service one evening and as she sat there, she overheard an elderly woman say \\"It really doesn't matter what you do with us, Lord, just have your own way with our lives.\\" The elderly woman inspired Pollard and she contemplated the story of the potter from Jeremiah 18:3 and, upon her return home that evening, wrote all four stanzas before retiring for the night. Five years later George Stebbins wrote a tune titled \\"Adelaide\\" to accompany the text. ==Lyrics== Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way! Thou art the Potter, I am the clay. Mold me and make me after Thy will; While I am waiting, yielded and still. Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way! Search me and try me, Master, today! Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now, As in Thy presence humbly I bow. Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way! Wounded and weary, help me, I pray! Power, all power, surely is Thine! Touch me and heal me, Savior divine. Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way! Hold o‚Äôer my being absolute sway! Fill with Thy Spirit ‚Äôtill all shall see Christ only, always, living in me. ==Recordings== \\"Have Thine Own Way, Lord\\" remains popular and has been recorded by such artists as: Mahalia Jackson, Marty Robbins, Johnny Cash, Eric Copeland, Cristy Lane, Jim Reeves, Eddy Arnold, John Fogerty, Ned Beatty and most, recently by, Ronnie Milsap on his 2009 gospel album, Then Sings My Soul. ==References== * Barrows, Cliff and Husted, Don.

She received the customary education of young ladies from professional families. She later taught German and French, and some Latin and Italian at a small learning institution which had been founded by her father. Her family lived mostly on fruit growing and farming. She is known principally as a hiker and artist, as well as for her travel journals. Between 1826 and 1858, Catharine K√∂lle carried out at least fifteen long journeys at home and abroad. She twice traveled by foot to Italy, including trips to Venice in 1841 and Genoa in 1858. She chronicled her travels in journals which provided documentary material about the places she visited. Her travel journals totaling over 400 pages are maintained at the library of the University Museum of Bergen. She also painted at least 251 watercolor paintings of which over 200 watercolors are also maintained at the University Museum of Bergen. The total list of works contains not only scenes from places she has visited. She also painted the images in the travel descriptions from inaccessible destinations including North America, Guinea, Istanbul, Sri Lanka and Jakarta. Additionally she painted biblical and mythological scenes. Her works are painted in bright, bold colors. They have a naive expression, with accuracy in description of the topography and architecture. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * Category:1788 births Category:1859 deaths Category:People from B√¶rum Category:Norwegian explorers Category:Norwegian educators Category:Norwegian travel writers Category:19th- century Norwegian painters Category:Norwegian women painters Category:19th- century women artists Category:People from Ulvik ","title":"Catharine Hermine K√∏lle"},{"id":"20479208","text":"East Grinstead Cycling Club is a cycle touring club that engage in road racing championships. ==History== East Grinstead Cycling Club was formed in 1950, and was initially a cycle touring club.

Harper was added to the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list on November 29, 2008. After 15 years on the run, he was captured in Wyoming by the FBI on July 23, 2009. ==BackgroundEarly life and family=== Edward Eugene Harper was born in New Mexico to Nell Trimue Harper, a Baptist from Forrest City, Arkansas. Edward Harper has at least three sisters, he has been married twice and has two children. ===Personal life=== Harper, who had little formal education has worked as a truck driver, mechanic and a ranch worker. He reportedly subscribed to Sovereign Citizen Movement ideology and claimed to be a member of the Montana Freemen, although authorities have never been able to confirm his affiliation with the group. Harper was diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder by a behavioral psychologist in Mississippi, shortly after his 1994 arrest. The disorder is characterized by a desire for social isolation, social anxiety and odd behavior. Harper is described as a survivalist, who has lived outside of modern society, but according to FBI Special Agent Ryan Arton he \\"could distinguish right from wrong\\". ==Child molestation accusations== From fall of 1993 to March 1994, Harper allegedly molested two girls in Hernando, Mississippi. In 1993, Harper, who was forty-eight years old, lived with his eighteen-year-old wife, Debra Busby,http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2010/oct/20/longtime-fugitive- found-guilty/ in a trailer park in DeSoto County, Mississippi.http://courts.ms.gov/Images/HDList/..%5COpinions%5CCO75694.pdf According to Arton, the FBI Special Agent, Harper and his then-19-year-old wife began to look after one of his alleged victims, a three-year-old girl, whose homeless mother could not take care for her. Alleged sexual abuse by Harper and his wife Debra began within a month. The second alleged victim was an eight-year-old girl who lived in the neighborhood. Arton said Harper threatened his wife and alleged victims with violence if they ever told anyone of the abuse. In March 1994, after the girls told their parents about the alleged sexual abuse, police obtained a search warrant. When Harper's trailer home was raided, he had already fled. After the raid, a highway officer in Utah performed a routine traffic stop and pulled over Harper and his wife. When the officer ran his name, the warrant came to his attention. Harper was arrested and extradited back to Mississippi.AMW.com - Edward Harper - Fugitive (HTML) America's Most Wanted. Retrieved on 2008-11-30 Harper was indicted on April 27, 1994 and released on $20,000 bond, but he failed to appear for a court hearing and his bond was revoked. A state warrant was issued for his arrest on October 31, 1994, in DeSoto County, Mississippi. Subsequently, a federal arrest warrant was issued for Harper by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, after he was charged in violation of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution on February 5, 1999.FBI Top Ten Fugitive Apprehended in Wyoming (HTML) Federal Bureau of Investigation - Denver Field Office. Retrieved on 2009-07-25 ==Fugitive== Age progressed photograph of Harper During Harper's time on the run, his mother received several letters from \\"Ed Harmon\\" - an alias used by Edward Harper. The letters mentioned him doing ranch work in Montana and Wyoming. Harper's phone calls to his half-sister mentioned \\"cattle work\\", but he did not reveal his location. His mother died in 1998, and her obituary mentioned that her son Edward E. Harper was living in Montana. Harper was believed to be in Montana, Wyoming or Arkansas, where he has family ties. He was placed on Oprah Winfrey's Child Predator Watch List and was profiled on the television program America's Most Wanted: America Fights Back. On November 29, 2008 Harper was named by the FBI as the 491st fugitive to be placed on the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. He replaced Michael Registe on the list. There was a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to Harper's capture being offered by the FBI. The reward will be paid to the tipster. Harper lived a nomadic lifestyle, living in a truck with a camper top, moving from place to place, and earning a living by doing odd jobs and herding sheep. He would make trips to buy groceries and tobacco to the general store in Kaycee, which was said to be the nearest town to his camp. Harper himself told the judge he had been living on and off for 15 years in the Broken Horn Creek area. ==Capture== The FBI received a telephone tip in June at the Denver office regarding Harper, and brought a SWAT team and a hostage negotiation team to apprehend him. He was captured in Washakie County, Wyoming in the southern portion of the Big Horn Mountains on July 23, 2009 by FBI and Wyoming Game and Fish Department officers after nearly 15 years on the run. Harper surrendered without an incident and admitted his identity. He had an unspecified number of handguns and rifles in his truck but was not carrying them when he was apprehended. Harper was transported to Casper, where he was being held at the Natrona County jail and extradited to Mississippi in September 2009. ==Trial and conviction== At trial, Harper testified that he never abused the girls, and that he fled because he did not feel he would get a fair trial. Harper was convicted by the DeSoto County Circuit Court of six counts of sexual battery, two counts of fondling, and two counts of conspiracy to commit sexual battery in October 2010. Harper was sentenced to a total of fifty years to serve in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections. ==See also== *List of fugitives from justice who are no longer sought ==ReferencesExternal links== *FBI press release announcing Harper's addition to the list *FBI press release announcing Harper's capture *Harper's FBI Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitive Alert *Harper's profile on America's Most Wanted Category:1946 births Category:American nomads Category:American prisoners and detainees Category:American ranchers Category:American truck drivers Category:Criminals from New Mexico Category:FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives Category:Formerly wanted fugitives Category:Living people Category:People extradited within the United States Category:People from Hernando, Mississippi Category:People from New Mexico Category:People with schizotypal personality disorder Category:Prisoners and detainees of Mississippi ","title":"Edward Eugene Harper"},{"id":"20479347","text":"Saint Matthew Passion () is a 1966 Hungarian short documentary film directed by Tam√°s Czig√°ny.

The film won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film. The film is inspired by the real life shenanigans of Devinder Singhhttp://www.realitytv.nfo.ph/devinder-singh-alias-bunty/ alias Bunty, a real-life \\"super-chor\\", originally from Vikaspuri, Delhi. ==Plot== A boy from a poor, dysfunctional family from suburban West Delhi grows up to become a charismatic and fearless man who robs the elite of several major cities in India in a unique fashion, often not out of necessity, but just for fun. After being arrested by Special Crime Branch Inspector Devender Singh, Lucky Singh reflects upon his life: his childhood, his father's second marriage, his siblings; his entry into crime and association with Gogi Arora; his romance with and subsequent marriage with the lovely Sonal; and his subsequent betrayal by his hanger-on and a business partner. Meanwhile, the media speculates on how he got away with stealing 140 TV sets, 212 Video cassette recorders, 475 shirts, 90 music systems, 50 jewellery boxes, 2 dogs, and a greeting card ‚Äì in a spree of burglaries that included households in Bangalore, Chandigarh, Mumbai, and other cities in India. ==Cast== * Abhay Deol as Lovinder 'Lucky' Singh / Sunny Arora * Paresh Rawal as Lucky's Father / Gogi Arora / Dr. B.

Lucky Oye! works perfectly as a simple story of a young boy (Abhay Deol) who is driven to crime not because he is hungry, poor, starving.\\" Syed Firdaus Ashraf of Rediff gave 3/5 stars, concluding that \\"The film only fails in the music department, by Sneha Khanwalkar. The dhols and drums get too loud from time to time, and get very annoying. If you can overlook this minor discomfort, go for it!\\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave 3/5 stars, stating that \\"Watch it because it's a film that respects your intelligence. And films like that are hard to find.\\" Sonia Chopra of Sify gave it 2.5/5 stars, saying that \\"Writer-director Dibakar Banerjee cannot live down the expectations Khosla Ka Ghosla brings with it. Banerjee does meet those expectations, however Oye Lucky! is a different product altogether. More than a beginning-middle-end story, Oye Lucky! is more a peek into Delhi's belly, into the characters' lives, and into complex bitter-sweet relationships.\\" Martin D'Souza of Glamsham gave 2.5/5 stars, concluding that \\"A film with a feel of the eighties, OLLO will identify well with the viewers from the North. But yes, if you want a quiet, funny outing to lighten your mood, watching OLLO is not a bad option.\\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the movie 2/5 stars, saying that \\"On the whole, OYE LUCKY! LUCKY OYE! is a well-executed enterprise, which has its share of limitations. At the box-office, the film caters to the Northern audience mainly ‚Äì Delhi and Punjab specifically. Besides North, the plexes in Mumbai should fare slightly better.\\" ===Box office=== Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye! was an average grosser, with nett in its lifetime, releasing two days after the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. ==Production== Originally, Paresh Rawal was only approached by Dibakar Banerjee to play the role of Gogi. He was then convinced by the director to also take on the role of Dr. Handa, and finally the role of Lucky's father. Despite his initial hesitation to sport a beard in the role of Lucky's father, Paresh Rawal called working on this film the most satisfying experience of his career. ==Awards== The Director of the film, Dibakar Banerjee, the Actors Paresh Rawal, Abhay Deol and the Director (M&C), PIB, Ms. Prabhavati Akashi at a press conference, during the 39th International Film Festival (IFFI-2008), in Panaji, Goa on 27 November 2008. * 2009: National Film Award ** Best Popular Film * 2009: Filmfare Award ** Critics Award for Best Actor: Manjot Singh ** Best Dialogue: Manu Rishi ** Best Costumes: Rushi Sharma / Manoshi Nath * 2009: IIFA Award ** Best Dialogue: Manu Rishi * 2009: Star Screen Award ** Best Story: Dibaker Banerjee: Nominated ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:2000s Hindi-language films Category:Indian films Category:2008 films Category:Films about con artists Category:Films set in Delhi Category:2000s crime comedy films Category:Films about organised crime in India Category:Films directed by Dibakar Banerjee Category:Films shot in Delhi Category:Films scored by Sneha Khanwalkar Category:UTV Motion Pictures films Category:Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment National Film Award winners Category:2008 comedy films ","title":"Oye Lucky!

Best known for his stints with Tenerife and Gimn√†stic ‚Äì he began playing professionally for Barcelona, but had virtually no impact for its first team ‚Äì he also served as general manager at the latter club, playing in more than 500 official matches for seven different clubs in exactly 20 years, 242 of those in La Liga over the course of 11 seasons (40 goals scored). ==Club careerBarcelona=== Born in Badalona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Pinilla was formed in the youth ranks of FC Barcelona. During the 1989‚Äì90 season, a week before turning 19, Johan Cruyff gave him the chance to make his La Liga debut, on 18 February 1990 in a match against Rayo Vallecano: he appeared 25 minutes in the 4‚Äì1 away win, having come on as a substitute for Julio Salinas.Pinilla: debut feliz (Pinilla: happy debut); Mundo Deportivo, 19 February 1990 The following campaign, Barcelona won the league and Pinilla appeared in seven matches, scoring a decisive goal against Valencia CF. He also played in the final of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, subbing in for veteran Jos√© Ram√≥n Alexanko in a 1‚Äì2 loss against Manchester United. However, strong competition in the emerging Dream Team meant Pinilla had to leave Bar√ßa on loan, and he joined RCD Mallorca, scoring four goals in a season which ended in top flight relegation. The following campaign he signed with top level newcomer Albacete Balompi√©, only missing two games as the Castile-La Mancha club retained its league status. ===Tenerife / N√†stic=== Pinilla was finally released in the summer of 1993, signing for CD Tenerife where he remained seven seasons, helping the Canary Islands team to the semi- finals of the 1996‚Äì97 UEFA Cup. He previously entered the club's history books when scoring its first goal ever in European competition, against AJ Auxerre on 15 September 1993; 1998‚Äì99 brought with it relegation, and the player followed the side into the second division. After one season with UD Salamanca, also in the second level, Pinilla joined Catalonia's Gimn√†stic de Tarragona, freshly promoted into that tier. His seven goals, however, proved insufficient to prevent the team from being immediately relegated; in addition, a serious knee injury in the final months of the campaign forced him into the operating room which led two a six-month period of inactivity, in turn prompting his release.Pinilla: \\"En Tenerife viv√≠ cosas grandes, pero el N√°stic me ha marcado m√°s\\" (Pinilla: \\"In Tenerife i experienced great things, but N√†stic touched me more\\"); Marca, 4 June 2008 After recovering on his own, Pinilla was re-taken by Gimn√†stic in the 2003 winter transfer window. Although he barely managed to make the team while they were in division three, he became a basic element in their return to the second level, adding five goals in the last ten days of 2005‚Äì06 in an historic return to the top flight. Pinilla served as captain during Gimn√†stic's short-lived spell in the top division, netting twice from 28 appearances for the last-ranked team, against RCD Espanyol (4‚Äì0 at home) and against Athletic Bilbao (2‚Äì0, away). On 11 September 2007, the club was proclaimed champion of the Catalonia Cup for the first time after a 2‚Äì1 defeat of Barcelona ‚Äì the player, who started the final, netted one of the Grana.

After the post-war border changes, the German population that had not yet fled was expelled. The area east of the Oder, known as Farther Pomerania (), and the Szczecin (Stettin) area were resettled primarily with Poles. Some of the German cultural heritage was removed and some reconstructed.Dan Diner, Raphael Gross, Yfaat Weiss, J√ºdische Geschichte als allgemeine Geschichte, p.164Gregor Thum, Die fremde Stadt. Breslau nach 194, 2006, p.344, Most of Western Pomerania remained in East Germany and was later merged into Mecklenburg. With the consolidation of Communism in East Germany and People's Republic of Poland, Pomerania became part of the communist Eastern Bloc. In the 1980s, the Solidarnosc movement in Poland that started in the city of Gda≈Ñsk and the Wende movement in East Germany forced the Communists out of power and led to the establishment of democracy in both the Polish and German parts of Pomerania. The name Pomerania comes from Slavic po more, which means \\"land by the sea\\".Der Name Pommern (po more) ist slawischer Herkunft und bedeutet so viel wie ‚ÄûLand am Meer‚Äú. () ==Post World War IISoviet occupation=== Szczecin (Stettin) in 1945 Soviet occupation of Pomerania had started just after the East Pomeranian Offensive, at the time of the northern campaigns of the Battle of Berlin by the Red Army and First Polish Army, in March and April 1945. The Soviet's administrative installation basically followed the existing previous German administrative structures.Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, p.371, Every-day life, however, was dictated according to Soviet decrees. Outside of civilian administration, this newly assembled local Soviet administration aimed to secure the hinterland regions, just beyond the frontline. In so doing, German property was referred to as \\"post-German\\". Items that could be carried were transported to the Soviet Union. This included largely domestic household furniture, instruments such as pianos, and textiles such as carpets. In some instances, the livestock and some machinery were sent to Russia as well. Most significantly, the industrial and manufacturing buildings and their shipyards were literally all deconstructed. Likewise, they too were simply transported to the Soviet Union.Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, p.373, Vast areas of Farther Pomerania were vacated as the ethnic German population had fled the advancing Red Army. This was primarily the case with the areas around the Netze (Noteƒá) and Oder rivers. For example, in the town of Arnswalde (now Choszczno) with a previous population of 14,000 only a few dozen German civilians remained. In other areas, a heterogeneous population remained, consisting of Pomeranians as well as stranded refugees from areas further east and evacuees from the industrial centers. For example, there were 330,000 Germans in the counties of Stolp, Schlawe, K√∂slin, and Belgard.Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, pp.370,371, The ethnic German population was ordered to participate in the acquisition and transportation of Soviet war loot, and to live in assigned to them neighbourhoods of the towns. Some were also employed by the Soviet authorities in industry or its deconstruction, in agriculture, and in the clean-up of the wartime destruction, and were paid a low salary. There were numerous examples of mistreatment of the ethnic German populations by the occupying Soviets including: manhunts, arrests and deportations for slave labor, holdups, forays, and often rapes.BBC, Contributed by Audrey Lewis, The von Thadden Family in Pomerania (part six), Article ID: A8683130, ===Formation of Polish communist administration in Farther Pomerania=== First Polish communist officials arrived in Farther Pomerania in April 1945. The provisional government of Poland on March 14 had created the Polish administrative district of Pomerania, which included Farther Pomerania and the northern Neumark. This was based on a decision of the Soviet state council for defense in February to place some eastern territories of Germany under Polish administration, and a subsequent order of the military council of the First Belorussian Front in early March requiring a solely Polish civilian administration in the territories that were handed over and also required the Soviet military to assist in the Polish administration's establishment.Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, pp.373,374, The Polish plenipotentiary for the new Pomeranian district since April 11 was colonel Leonard Borkowicz.Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, pp.374,375, Subordinate to Borkowicz were forty county assignees (starosts). Borkowicz and the starosts had a very limited knowledge of the area they were to govern, and were sent in only with an official attestation of their position, sketches of the counties, 500 Zloty, and alcohol to use as valuta. Their primary objective was the preparation of the area for Polish settlement. The Polish officials were regarded no more than auxiliary personnel by the Soviet military administration, which was in charge of most of industry, bakeries, most of the farmland, and fishery. The Polish administrators concentrated on reinstating electricity, gas, and water supply and on stockpiling groceries for the expected Polish settlers. Conflicts arose when they tried to charge the Soviets for power, gas, or water. Also they failed to have the Soviet authorities inhibit the forays of Red Army soldiers and officers. Overall Soviet attitude toward the Polish administrators ranged from providing aid to neglect. ===Deportations of Germans before the Potsdam Agreement=== In two weeks of June 1945, the Polish Army under the Soviet command deported 110,000 ethnic Germans from the areas adjacent to the eastern bank of the Oder river, and the counties of Stargard, Labes, Pyritz (Pyrzyce), and Arnswalde (now Choszczno), all in Farther Pomerania. Many German civilians were deported to labor camps like Vorkuta in the Soviet Union, where a large number of them perished or were later reported missing. ==Border shift and consequences== Province of Pomerania (yellow) superimposed on post-war Germany (red) and Poland (blue) Oder-Neisse line, Usedom In the Potsdam Agreement, the allies decided to move the Polish-German border west to the Oder-Neisse line, pending a final peace conference with Germany. Since a peace conference never took place, the provisions of the Agreement effectively defined the new border. ; ; Most of the remaining German population was expelled. In case of Pomerania, the Free City of Danzig and most of the pre-war German province of Pomerania, including the city of Swinem√ºnde (Swinoujscie), became Polish. In addition, a strip of land 20 km west of Stettin/Szczecin, and a small part of the Usedom island also became part of Poland in order to facilitate the growth of these cities. The remainder of Pomerania west of Stettin/Szczecin and the Oder River was joined with Mecklenburg and formed Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. In Potsdam, the border was defined as leaving the Oder river at a bridge some three kilometers west of Greifenhagen and from that point running north as a straight line to the church of Ahlbeck. On September 21, 1945, the Polish plenipotentiary Borkowicz and the Polish president of Szczecin, Piotr Zaremba, adjusted the border in the Treaty of Schwerin. The border now started at a point in the Bay of Pomerania 3 miles (5,5 kilometers) off the shore, from which it ran south through the Szczecin Lagoon and left Camminke on the East German and Papart on the Polish side.Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, pp.385,386, In January 1951, the border was again adjusted. The potable water reservoir of Swinoujscie, which was on the German side since the Treaty of Schwerin, and the islands of the Oder River were assigned to Poland, and a small part of Usedom to East Germany. Also, the border within the Pomeranian Bay was extended to 6 miles.Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, pp.386,387, ===Polish part of Pomerania - Szczecin Voivodship=== The Soviet Army kept proving grounds and naval bases in Pomerania; the areas were excluded from Polish jurisdiction until 1992. Russia used the area to store nuclear warheads. In the summer of 1945, the Soviets started to dissolve their administrative institutions in Pomerania. In 14 towns, the civilian administration was handed over to Polish officials.Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, p.379, In October, the counties of Stettin and Swinem√ºnde were handed over to Polish administration. The areas on the Oder's left bank (P√∂litz area) stayed under Soviet control until 1946. There, a provisional Soviet county was set up on order of marshal Zhukov, where 25,000 Germans had to completely deconstruct an industrial facility used to produce synthetic fuels. Also the Stettin port stayed directly under Soviet control, and was only handed over to Poland from February 1946 to September 1947, officially only in May 1954. The Oder waterway was handed over to Poland in September 1946. Farmland and estates were handed over until 1949 - in February 1946, half of the farmland was still Soviet property.Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, pp.379-381, The Red Army started to increase the withdrawal of troops from the Polish part of Pomerania in the fall of 1945.Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, p.381, Polonization With its eastern territories (the Kresy) annexed by the Soviet Union, Poland was effectively moved westwards and its area reduced by almost 20% (from 389,000 km¬≤ to 312,000 km¬≤). With the establishment of the People's Republic of Poland followed sweeping changes in population, a \\"repatriation\\" of millions that resulted in what Geoffrey Hosking describes as \\"the biggest population exchange in European history.\\"Geoffrey Hosking, George Schopflin, Myths and Nationhood, 1997, p.153, Germans, Ukrainians and others who were not perceived as Polish were shuffled out of the new boundaries, while the Poles east of the Curzon line were shuffled in. The picture of the new western and northern territories being recovered Piast territory was used to forge Polish settlers and \\"repatriates\\" arriving there into a coherent community loyal to the new regime.Martin √Öberg, Mikael Sandberg, Social Capital and Democratisation: Roots of Trust in Post-Communist Poland and Ukraine, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2003, , Google Print, p.79 Largely excepted from the expulsions of Germans were the \\"autochthons\\", close to three million ethnically Slavic inhabitants of Pomerania, the Kashubians and Slovincians, of whom however many did not identify with Polish nationality.Tomasz Kamusella in Prauser and Reeds (eds), The Expulsion of the German communities from Eastern Europe, p.28, EUI HEC 2004/1 The Polish government aimed to retain as many \\"autochthons\\" as possible for propaganda purposes, as their presence on former German soil was used to indicate the intrinsic \\"Polishness\\" of the area and justify its incorporation into the Polish state as \\"recovered\\" territories. \\"Verification\\" and \\"national rehabilitation\\" processes were set up to reveal a \\"dormant Polishness\\" and to determine which were redeemable as Polish citizens; few were actually expelled The \\"autochthons\\" not only disliked the subjective and often arbitrary verification process, but they also faced discrimination even after completing it,Philipp Ther, Ana Siljak, Redrawing Nations: Ethnic Cleansing in East-Central Europe, 1944-1948, 2001, p.114, such as the Polonization of their names.Gregor Thum, Die fremde Stadt. Breslau nach 1945, 2006, pp.363, =Treatment and expulsion of Germans after the Potsdam Agreement= The remaining Germans were to be expelled from the now Polish areas of Pomerania.Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, pp.381,383, The major staging area from which the Germans were deployed to post-war Germany was the Stettin-Scheune railway station. The station became notorious due to the frequent raids by armed gangs, composed of German, Polish and Russian deserters, who raped and looted those who were leaving. Germans were either transported by ship from Stettin to L√ºbeck or sent in trains to the British occupation zone.BBC, WW2 - People's War, The von Thadden Family in Pomerania, part one, part two, part three, part four, part five, part six, part seven, part eight, part nine, part ten. Last three parts cover the Polish stage. In one month-long period, lasting from November 20 to December 21, 1945, 290,000 Germans were expelled; a subsequent, lengthier movement from February 1946 to October 1947 saw the expulsion of 760,000 more. Germans deported in the latter period, which has been named \\"Jaskolka\\" (swallow), were prioritized in five groups according to the risks they were perceived to represent or the value they offered, with those termed \\"obstructive\\" the first to go.Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, p.383, According to Piskorski, expellees were often not even allowed to carry household articles with them, and the few items they managed to take along were often robbed on the way. Piskorski notes that the Germans who were not yet expelled were legally \\"considered troublesome foreigners, temporarily residing in Poland\\" and were both disallowed communication devices like telephones or radios and restricted in their movements.Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, pp.383,384, According to Werner Buchholz, during the Soviet capture of Farther Pomerania and the subsequent expulsions of Germans until 1950, 498,000 people from the part of the province east of the Oder-Neisse line died, making up for 26,4% of the former population. Of the 498,000 dead, 375,000 were civilians, and 123,000 were Wehrmacht soldiers. Low estimates give a million expellees from the then Polish part of the province in 1945 and the following years. Only 7,100 km2 remained with East Germany, about a fourth of the province's size before 1938 and a fifth of the size thereafter. In 1949, the refugees from West Prussia and the Province of Pomerania established the non- profit Landsmannschaft Westpreu√üen and Landsmannschaft Pommern, respectively, to represent West Prussians and Pomeranians in the Federal Republic of Germany. =Removal of German population and heritage= The Recovered Territories after the assignment to Poland still hosted a substantial ethnic German population. This had to be changed quickly, as the territories' legal status was uncertain at the end of the war, and left room for different interpretations even after the Potsdam Agreement. The Polish administration set up a \\"Ministry for the Recovered Territories\\", headed by communist prime minister W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka.Karl Cordell, Andrzej Antoszewski, Poland and the European Union, 2000, , p.167 A \\"Bureau for Repatriation\\" was to supervise and organize the expulsions and resettlements. The expulsion of the remaining Germans in the first post-war years presaged a broader campaign to remove the footprints of centuries of German history and culture. All German place names were replaced with Polish or Polonized medieval Slavic ones.Tomasz Kamusella and Terry Sullivan in Karl Cordell, Ethnicity and Democratisation in the New Europe, 1999, pp.175ff, If no Slavic name existed, then either the German name was translated or Polish assigned.Gregor Thum, Die fremde Stadt. Breslau nach 1945, 2006, p.344, 349, The German language was banned, and many German monuments, graveyards, buildings etc. were demolished. Objects of art were moved to other parts of the country.Gregor Thum, Die fremde Stadt. Breslau nach 1945, 2006, p.520, Since Poles were predominantly Roman Catholic most Protestant churches were converted into Catholic ones. Official communist propaganda spread all-round anti-German sentiment, which was shared by many of the opposition as well as many in the Catholic Church.Karl Cordell, Andrzej Antoszewski, Poland and the European Union, 2000, p.166, A Polish law of May 1945 declared German property \\"abandoned\\". Only a decision of March 1946 declared it \\"state property\\" and prohibited further removal by the public. Many institutions in Central Poland ordered art, furniture, machines, bureau equipment, cars and construction material from the regional authorities. Over years, bricks were sent to Warsaw.Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, p.399, =Resettlement= People from all over Poland moved in to replace the former German population in a process parallel to the expulsions. The settlers can be grouped according to their background: *settlers from Central Poland moving voluntarily (the majority)Karl Cordell, Andrzej Antoszewski, Poland and the European Union, 2000, , p.168: 2.8m of 4.55m in the first years (whole western territories) more than half a million in 1950.Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, p.403, *Poles that had been freed from forced labor in Nazi GermanyDierk Hoffmann, Michael Schwartz, Gegl√ºckte Integration?, p142Karl Cordell, Andrzej Antoszewski, Poland and the European Union, 2000, , p.168: 1.5m of 4.55m in the first years (whole western territories) and Poles from other European countries, about 47,000 people.Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, p.406, *so-called \\"repatriants\\": Poles expelled from the areas east of the new Polish-Soviet border were preferably settled in the new western territories, where they made up 26% of the population (up to two million)Karl Cordell, Andrzej Antoszewski, Poland and the European Union, 2000, , p.168: 1.55m of 4.55m in the first years *non- Poles forcibly resettled during Operation Vistula in 1947. Large numbers of Ukrainians were forced to move from south-eastern Poland under a 1947 Polish government operation aimed at dispersing, and therefore assimilating, those Ukrainians who had not been expelled eastward already, throughout the newly acquired territories. Belarusians living around the area around Bia≈Çystok were also pressured into relocating to the formerly German areas for the same reasons. This scattering of members of non-Polish ethnic groups throughout the country was an attempt by the Polish authorities to dissolve the unique ethnic identity of groups like the Ukrainians, Belarusians and Lemkos,Thum, p.129 and broke the proximity and communication necessary for strong communities to form. 53,000 people were forced to settle in the Szczecin Voivodship in 1947. *Jewish Holocaust-survivors, most of them \\"repatriates\\" from the East, creating Jewish cooperatives and institutions ‚Äì the largest community was founded in Szczecin (Stettin).Selwyn Ilan Troen, Benjamin Pinkus, Merkaz le- moreshet Ben-Guryon, Organizing Rescue: National Jewish Solidarity in the Modern Period, pp.283-284, 1992, About 30,000 Jews from the Soviet Union settled in the Szczecin Voivodship, but most emigrated soon after. Most had left Poland by 1968 due to communist governmental antisemitic campaign,Thum, p.127 + p.128 with the first mass flight of Jews from Poland taking place as a consequence of postwar anti-Jewish violence culminating in the Kielce pogrom in 1946.Selwyn Ilan Troen, Benjamin Pinkus, Merkaz le-moreshet Ben-Guryon, Organizing Rescue: National Jewish Solidarity in the Modern Period, pp.284ff, 1992, *since the 1950s, Greeks, Macedonians, and Romani people settled in the Szczecin Voivodship, with the Romani first sticking to their nomadic way of life. Polish and Soviet newspapers and officials encouraged Poles to relocate to the west ‚Äì \\"the land of opportunity\\".Karl Cordell, Andrzej Antoszewski, Poland and the European Union, 2000, p.168, These new territories were described as a place where opulent villas abandoned by fleeing Germans. In fact, the areas were devastated by the war, most of the infrastructure largely destroyed, suffering high crime rates and looting by criminal gangs. It took years for civil order to be established. The newly created society, first binational and multi-cultural, quickly became subject to homogenisation decreed by the state. This new Pomeranian society was tied to the Polish one, and failed to develop a local or regional identity.Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, p.407, =Demography= In the fall of 1945, 230,000 Poles had settled in the Szczecin Voivodship, and more than 400,000 Germans remained.Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, p.402, In the spring of 1946, Polish and German population were about equal in number. By the end of 1947, 900,000 Poles and 59,000 Germans lived in the Szczecin Voivodship. ===German part of Pomerania=== Western part of the former Province of Pomerania (Vorpommern, red) in modern Germany In May 1945, the armies of the Soviet Union and the western allies met east of Schwerin. Following the Potsdam Agreement, the western allies handed over the western part of Mecklenburg to the Soviets. Mecklenburg-Vorpommern was established on July 9, 1945, per order Nr. 5 of Red Army marshal Zhukov, head of the Soviet administration (SMAD), as the Province of Mecklenburg and West Pomerania (sapadnoi Pomeranii).Brunner, Detlev, Inventar der Befehle der Sowjetischen Milit√§radministration Mecklenburg (-Vorpommern) 1945-1949 in Texte und Materialien zur Zeitgeschichte 12, 2003, The post-war period was characterized by the extreme difficulties arising from the need of housing and feeding the occupation forces as well as the refugees, while simultaneously state and private property was carried to the Soviet Union. Furthermore, many of the towns had suffered severe war damages. Demographic changes During and after the war, the make-up of Mecklenburg and Vorpommern's population changed due to wartime losses and the influx of evacuees (mainly from the Berlin and Hamburg metropolitan areas that were subject to air raids) and people who fled and were expelled from the former eastern territories of Germany east of the Oder-Neisse line, which became the eastern border of Mecklenburg Vorpommern. After the war, the population had doubled with more than 40% of the population being refugees. Before the war, Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania had a population of 1,278,700, of whom many perished during the war and another share moved west in the course of the Red Army's advance. In October 1945, the authorities counted 820,000 refugees in Mecklenburg- Vorpommern, of whom a number of 30,000 and 40,000 moved about without destination.Beatrice Vierneisel, Fremde im Land: Aspekte zur kulturellen Integration von Umsiedlern in Mecklenburg und Vorpommern 1945 bis 1953, 2006, p.11, Before the war, the about 7,100 km¬≤ of Vorpommern that would remain German were inhabited by about half a million people. After the war, 85,000 of these were either dead, had fled or were imprisoned. In 1946, the influx of 305,000 refugees raised the population to 719,000.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p.515, In 1946, the refugees in Vorpommern made up for 42,4% of the population. In the Stralsund and Grimmen counties, half of the population were refugees. The towns of Stralsund and Greifswald had the lowest rates of refugees.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p.518, More than half of the refugees in Vorpommern were expellees from the former eastern parts of the Province of Pomerania, the other ones were from any other former eastern territory. In 1947, some 1,426,000 refugees were counted in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, 1 million of which was from post-war Poland. Most of them were settled in rural communities, but also the towns' population increased, most notably in Schwerin from 65,000 (1939) to 99,518 (January 1947), in Wismar from 29,463 to 44,173, and in Greifswald from 29,488 to 43,897.Beatrice Vierneisel, Fremde im Land: Aspekte zur kulturellen Integration von Umsiedlern in Mecklenburg und Vorpommern 1945 bis 1953, 2006, p.12, In 1949, out of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's population of 2,126,000, refugees accounted for 922,088. Yet, many people - both refugees and pre-war locals - moved towards the western allies' occupation zones, causing the number of inhabitants to decrease within the following decades. Land reform Peasant ploughing his newly assigned soil with an ox, 1948An official (\\"Feldwart\\", center) supervising foraging women on an already harvested field, 1947 Following the land reform of 1945/46, all farms larger than 100 ha were seized by the administration. Two thirds of the seized farms, making up for 54% of the overall seized farmland, were distributed among the refugees, who had become the majority in many rural communities. The remaining large farms not distributed among the population were run by the administration as so-called \\"People-owned farm\\" (Volkseigenes Gut, VEG).Heinrich-Christian Kuhn, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Der B√ºrger im Staat, \\"Die Bundesl√§nder\\", Heft 1/2, 1999 After the reform, one out of two refugees was assigned to an own small farm.Beatrice Vierneisel, Fremde im Land: Aspekte zur kulturellen Integration von Umsiedlern in Mecklenburg und Vorpommern 1945 bis 1953, 2006, p.13, The new partitions of land were usually of a size of five hectares. Administration On June 5, 1946, a law enacted by the Soviets led to the constitution of a provisional German administration (Beratende Versammlung) under Soviet supervision on June 29, 1946. After the unfree elections of October 20, 1946, a Landtag replaced the Beratende Versammlung and worked out the constitution of January 16, 1947, for the Land Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. On March 1, 1947, the state's name was shortened to Land Mecklenburg following a Soviet order. Earlier attempts by local politicians like Otto Kort√ºm, mayor of Stralsund, to have the Pomeranian part of the new state organized in a separate administrative subdivision such as \\"Regierungsbezirk Stralsund, or to have a representative of the state's administration in Greifswald had all failed.\\" Parties In April 1946,the social-democratic party (SPD) party was forced by the communists and the SMAD (Soviet administration) to merge with the communist party (KPD), resulting in the creation of the SED, which in the following years would act on Moscow's behalf.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp.518,519, image:Germany Laender 1947 1990 DDR.pngMecklenburg-Vorpommern within East Germany, black: 1947 border, red: 1990 border image:DDR Verwaltungsbezirke farbig.svgMecklenburg-Vorpommern dissolved (northern districts Rostock, Schwerin, Neubrandenburg, 1947-1990 image:Tal_der_Ahnungslosen.pngIn most of German Pomerania, it was not possible to receive West German TV programs (red area), thus referred to as \\"Tal der Ahnungslosen\\" (\\"Valley of the Clueless\\") ==Communist eraPolish part of Pomerania=== The situation changed for the worse in 1948, when all countries of the Eastern Bloc had to adopt Soviet economic principles. Private shops were banned and most farmers were forced to join agricultural cooperatives, managed by local communists. In 1953 Poland was forced to accept the end of war reparations, which previously were solely placed on East Germany, while West Germany enjoyed the benefits of the Marshall Plan. In 1956 Poland was on the verge of a Soviet invasion, but the crisis was solved and the Polish government's communism developed a more human face with W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka as the head of politburo. Poland developed the ports of Pomerania and restored the destroyed shipyards of Gda≈Ñsk, Gdynia and Szczecin. These were organised as two harbour complexes: one of Szczecin port with Swinoujscie avanport and the other was Gda≈Ñsk-Gdynia set of ports. Gda≈Ñsk and Gdynia, along with the spa of Sopot located between them, became one metropolitan area called Tricity and populated by more than 1,000,000 inhabitants. In 1970, after putting an end to the uncertain border issue with West Germany under Willy Brandt, the massive unrest in the coastal cities marked the end of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka's rule. The new leader, Edward Gierek, wanted to modernize the country by the wide use of western credits. Although the policy failed, Poland became one of the main world players in the shipyard industry. Polish open sea fishing scientists discovered new species of fish for the fishing industry. Unfortunately, countries with direct access to the open seas declared 200 mile (370 km) economic zones that finally put the end to the Polish fishing industry. Shipyards also came under growing pressure from the subsidized Japanese and Korean enterprises. During 1970, Poland built also the Northern Harbour in rebuilt Gda≈Ñsk, which allowed the country independent access to oil from OPEC countries. The new oil refinery had been built in Gda≈Ñsk, and an oil pipeline connected both with main Polish pipeline in P≈Çock. The West Pomeranian Voivodeship's rural countryside from 1945 until 1989 remained underdeveloped and often neglected, as the pre-1945 German structures of Prussian-style nobility leading and steering agricultural cultivation had been destroyed by expulsion and communism.  Reorganisation of Catholic Church in Polish Pomerania  According to the Prussian Concordat of 1929 Pope Pius XI assigned all of then German Pomerania either to the new Catholic Diocese of Berlin (est. on 13 August 1930) or to the new Territorial Prelature of Schneidem√ºhl (), also comprising the Pomeranian districts of B√ºtow and Lauenburg in Pommern. Diocese and prelature became part of the new East German Ecclesiastical Province as suffragans of the prior exempt Diocese of Breslau simultaneously elevated to archdiocese. After World War II Berlin's diocesan territory east of the Oder-Nei√üe line (East Brandenburg and central and Farther Pomerania) - with 33 parishes and chapels of ease - came under Polish control. Most of the Catholic parishioners and priests there had either fled the invading Soviet Red Army or were subsequently expelled by Polish authorities. Cardinal August Hlond demanded the diocesan territory east of the new border for the creation of new Catholic dioceses, he appointed a diocesan administrator for Berlin's eastern diocesan territory seated in Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski (Landsberg an der Warthe). Pope Pius XII refused to acknowledge these claims. But most of the churches and ecclesiastical premises of the Pomerania ecclesiastical province of the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union within now Polish Pomerania were taken by newly established Catholic congregations, since the Poles who had been transferred to the area via the Soviet demands of the Potsdam Agreement were predominantly Roman Catholic. In 1951, when the Holy See - similar to West Germany - still asserted that Farther Pomerania would be returned to Germany at a near date, the Pope appointed Teodor Bensch (1903‚Äì1958), titular bishop of Tabuda, as auxiliary bishop responsible for the Polish part of the diocese of Berlin and the Prelature of Schneidem√ºhl. His office was titled Apostolic Administration of Cammin, Lebus and the Prelature of Schneidem√ºhl (). This name referred to the prelature and Catholic bishoprics such as Cammin and Lebus, which existed prior the Protestant Reformation. On 27 June 1972, however, - in response to West Germany's change in Ostpolitik and the Treaty of Warsaw - Pope Paul VI redrew the diocesan boundaries along the post-war political borders. The Apostolic constitution Episcoporum Poloniae coetus disentangled the Polish Pomeranian diocesan area of Berlin, becoming the new westerly Diocese of Szczecin-Kamie≈Ñ and the easterly Diocese of Koszalin- Ko≈Çobrzeg).Paulus VI: Const. Apost. Episcoporum Poloniae coetus, AAS 64 (1972), n. 10, pp. 657seq. ===East German part of Pomerania=== The part of Pomerania west of the Oder Neisse line was attached to Mecklenburg by a SMAD order of 1946 to form the Land of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. This Land was renamed Mecklenburg in 1947, became a constituent state of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in 1949 and was dissolved by the GDR government in 1952, when the East Berlin government abandoned \\"states\\" in favour of districts (German: Bezirke). The area of Western Pomerania was split into the eastern Kreis districts of the newly established Bezirk administrative GDR subdivisions Bezirk Rostock and Bezirk Neubrandenburg, Gartz (Oder) joined Bezirk Frankfurt (Oder). The administrative changes also made the historical border between Mecklenburg and Pomerania vanish from the maps.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p.519, The Pomeranian counties had already undergone changes in 1950: Randow county, recreated in 1945, was dissolved, the southern parts with Gartz (Oder) joined Brandenburg. Thus, Western Pomerania lost the last link with the Oder river, the historical eastern border. Ueckerm√ºnde county was renamed Pasewalk county and 22 Brandenburgian communities were merged in. The Pomeranian town Damgarten was fused with the Mecklenburgian town Ribnitz to Ribnitz-Damgarten, thus Western Pomerania's historical western border (Recknitz river, flowing between Ribnitz and Damgarten) vanished from the administrative maps. In 1952, another county reform made other parts of the historical Mecklenburgian and Pomeranian frontier vanish from the maps. The name \\"Pomerania\\" was now only used by the Pomeranian Evangelical Church, which had to change this name in \\"Evangelical Church Greifswald\\" in 1968.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p.521, Throughout the 1950s, small farms including those created in the previous land reform were forced to group to Socialist-style LPG units. In 1986, 90 LPGs ran close to 90% of the farmland, in addition there were the state estates (VEG, \\"Volkseigenes Gut\\"). An LPG had an average size of 4,700, a VEG 5,000 hectares. Agriculture was characterized by huge fields up to a hundred hectares, the use of large machines and an industrial way to work. Fertilizer was in many cases applied by planes. In Aktion Rose, private property of housing was turned over to the state. From this stock, various state organizations ran the GDR's seaside resort, serving 75% of the East German Baltic coast tourists. The East German policy of industrialization led to the establishment of a nuclear power plant in Lubmin near Greifswald, the Stralsund Volkswerft shipyard, and the Sassnitz ferry terminal directly linking Western Pomerania to the Soviet Union via Klaipeda. The Volkswerft was the main industry of Western Pomerania with 8,000 employees. One third of the Soviet fish trawlers were built in Stralsund. Another shipyard set up during the Communist era was the Peenewerft in Wolgast, where East German navy ships were built. In Greifswald, industry constructing electronic supplies for the shipyards was settled, employing 4,000 people.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp.521,522, ==Democratic eraPolish part of Pomerania=== {align=\\"right\\"  Pomeranian Voivodeship, established in 1999, comprising Eastern Pomerania and the right bank of the Vistula river West Pomeranian Voivodeship, established in 1999, compromising most of pre-1945 German Province of Pomerania. } In 1980, Polish Pomeranian coastal cities, notably Gda≈Ñsk, became the place of birth for the anticommunist movement, Solidarity. Gda≈Ñsk become the capital for the Solidarity trade union. In 1989 it was found that the border treaty with the Communist German Democratic Republic had one mistake, concerning the naval border. Subsequently, a new treaty was signed. ===German part of Pomerania=== In October 1990, after the GDR regime was overthrown by the peaceful Wende revolution of 1989, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern was reconstituted and joined the Federal Republic of Germany, with Vorpommern being a constituent region of the Bundesland with a special status, but not an administrative one. Since then, the region suffers from a population drain as mostly young people migrate to the West due to high unemployment rates. ===Pomerania euroregion=== The Pomerania euroregion was set up in 1995 as one of the euroregions, thought to connect regions divided between states of the European Union. The name EUROREGION POMERANIA is taken from the region of Pomerania, yet the euroregion is of a different shape than the historical region. It comprises German Western Pomerania and Uckermark, Polish Zachodniopomorskie, and Scania in Sweden. ==Sources== *Werner Buchholz et al., Pommern, Siedler, 1999/2002, , 576 pages; this book is part of the Deutsche Geschichte im Osten Europas series and primarily covers the history of the Duchy of Pomerania and Province of Pomerania from the 12th century to 1945, and Western Pomerania after 1945. *Jan Maria Piskorski et al.

Koppitz later continued his work in small commercial studios as a contract photographer but in 1912, he left professional life to go back to school to continue his studies at the Graphische Lehr- und Versuchsanstalt, \\"Institute for Teaching and Research in Graphic Arts\\" in Vienna, Austria. Composition c. 1927 His time at the Institute was interrupted by the First World War in which Koppitz found himself putting his talents to use as an aerial reconnaissance photographer.Lenman, R. (2005) Rudolf Koppitz. The Oxford Companion to the Photograph. Oxford University Press. Retrieved November 29, 2008 During the First World War he served in aerial reconnaissance. The bulk of the body of work he produced during this time consisted of landscapes captured during his aerial reconnaissance work, his favorite of which was the study of water from the air and the geometric elements of flying machines that carried him into war. When Koppitz was not photographing for the Army he spent his time documenting the lives of soldiers and the communities of people he came into contact with. Photographs from this period are laden with dramatic sentiments due to Koppitz's use of light, the sun, clouds and mist to express the emotions of the people and the time. After the war, Koppitz returned to the Institute to teach photography where in 1923 he took the nude self-portrait, In the Bosom of Nature, in which he framed himself by tree trunks, rocks, snowy mountains, and is posed to convey a dreamlike harmony reminiscent of a symbolist painting and graphic art.Lenman, R. (2005) Rudolf Koppitz. The Oxford Companion to the Photograph. Oxford University Press. Retrieved November 29, 2008 In c. 1925 Koppitz created his masterpiece, Bewegungsstudie, \\"Motion Study\\" in which he photographed dancers from the Vienna State Opera; the nude dancer, credited to be the Russian Claudia Issatschenko but is more likely, her daughter, ballet dancer and choreographer, Tatyana Issatschenko Gsovsky, with her head thrown dramatically back and flanked by three dark-robed women, lends Bewegungsstudie to the highly decorative and symbolist tradition of the Viennese Jugendstil. ==Work== Bewegungsstudie c. 1927 Koppitz's work is marked by a pronounced awareness of form, line, and the surface play of light and shadow. Early in his career, Koppitz was known for staging groups of subjects in the style of the Vienna Secession, the most well known example of this being his Bewegungsstudie, \\"Motion Study\\". Bewegungsstudie's languid nude, elaborately robed women and undeniable sensuality, in the context of its rigorous and artistic composition, bring to mind the sexual morbidity of Viennese artists like Gustav Klimt and Alphonse Mucha, as well as the Swiss symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler and has made it as unforgettable then as it is today. It has become the Koppitz's signature image, and was also his best-seller. Prints of the image were purchased by, among others, the Toledo Museum of Art; the New York Camera Club notable Joseph Bing, head of that club's print committee; and the Englishman Stephen Tyng, who published it in a small portfolio of works from his collection. Heavy Burden c. 1930 His earliest works show evidence of influence by Gustav Klimt, Japanese art, Art Nouveau and Constructivism. During the First World War, Koppitz's photographs took on a documentary quality when his photographs became more simple and direct in their subject matter and composition. Koppitz's work came of age during the inter-war period when most of Austria's photographers were supporters of art photography. Photographs from that time are full of symbolic meanings often capturing nude and clothed dancers as well as liberal use of the both male, many of which were of Koppitz himself, and female nudes placed in elements of nature and posed to give the impression of a Greek or Roman statue. Although he did not possess a consistent style, Koppitz was a virtuoso of the dark room, seemingly determined to make the photograph as much of an art object as possible. His beautifully grainy, subtly tinted images align him with American Pictorialists like Edward Steichen and Clarence Smith. Koppitz's work, much of it using the gum bichromate process, reflected his links with modern artists such as Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele, and their involvement with the 'life reform' movement including; nudism, sun culture, and expressive dance popular in Central Europe from the early 1900s as well as agrarian romanticism. Koppitz's extraordinary mastery of pictorial processes‚Äîpigment, carbon, gum, and bromoil process of transfer printing‚Äîgained the respect of his colleagues throughout the world and garnered mention in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica of 1929. Over the course of 30 years of work, Koppitz's photography came full circle returning in his later years to where he started, working with a renewed focus on nature and documenting the lives and condition of rural peasants. Koppitz is perceived by some as a progressive modern artist while on the other hand he was one of the more conservative photographers in his time, holding true to a number of traditions and always telling a story with his photographs. ==See also== * Iconography ==Notes References == * Baatz, W.

He was born in Calella de Palafrugell, Gerona in Catalonia. Early in his life, he relocated to Vigo, in Galicia, where he lived since at least 1750, and where he soon became one of its most important businessmen by building a new salting installation for the processing and distribution of fish to his native land. The good result of his business attracted some other Catalan families to the area, such as the Buch, the Curbera, the Escofet or the F√°bregas. As one of the most important ship- owners in Spain, he obtained from King Charles III of Spain in 1773, the first concessions to allow trading between the port of Vigo and the new world. In 1779 he obtained permission to attack the British naval commerce and that of its allies such as portugueses, during the American Revolutionary War. The good fortune of his ships made him a fortune in such articles as salt, oil, leather and cloth among others. In 1817, as a regidor of Vigo, he ordered the reconstruction of the Concatedral de Santa Mar√≠a de Vigo, which had been destroyed during the Peninsular War. He personally donated the statue of the Cristo de la Victoria,http://www.turismodevigo.org/en/el-cristo-de-la- victoria-christ-victory which is still the most important religious icon of the city. Marc√≥ del Pont married Juana √Ångel D√≠az y M√©ndez, with whom he had four sons. Two of them became very famous during their lifetime: Francisco Casimiro was the last Royal Governor of Chile and Buenaventura Miguel represented his father's company in Buenos Aires, and his family became one of the most important and wealthy of the Argentine republic. ==References== Category:1728 births Category:1817 deaths Category:18th-century Spanish businesspeople Category:19th-century Spanish businesspeople ","title":"Buenaventura Marc√≥ del Pont"},{"id":"20479601","text":"The House That Ananda Built is a 1968 Indian short documentary film directed by Fali Bilimoria.

The riot started after members of the council arrived to read out the proclamation of peace, and many in the crowd expressed their disapproval. One issue was veterans not being allowed to hold a drumhead mass in Wardown Park. Tension boiled over into violence, and after a number of clashes, many protesters broke through the police line and forcibly entered the town hall, which was eventually set on fire. Order was eventually restored to the town by midnight on 19 July, but the fire brigade were unable to extinguish the fire, and by the next morning the town hall was little more than a ruin. The remains of the building were demolished in August 1919 and in 1922 the statue \\"Peace\\", designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield, inscribed with the names of more than 280,000 dead servicemen from the Great War, was unveiled. ==Aftermath== Many of those arrested received serious sentences.

Live versions have been released as the second track of KOH–¶EPT, the 11th track of the first disc of 2000 Years: The Millennium Concert, and the opening track on the first disc of 12 Gardens Live and Live at Shea Stadium: The Concert. It is also included in the Broadway show Movin' Out. The instrumental \\"Prelude\\" lasts approximately a minute and 43 seconds, starting with a rapid-fire hammered piano riff on the middle-C piano key, joined by various instruments, swinging through styles such an Aaron Copland-styled ballad to funk to a Southwestern beat. According to Joel in an interview with Howard Stern, the rhythm of the fast-paced piano riff was meant to pay homage to the drum part in the song \\"Wipe Out\\" by The Surfaris.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy1xwXtYVxw When performing live, Joel plays the fast-paced prelude himself, but performs the song early in the setlist, largely because the prelude section was easiest to manage during the adrenaline moments of starting a show, as opposed to being attempted after he had already expended much of his energy for other songs. It is then followed by \\"Angry Young Man\\", which paints a slightly sardonic picture of youthful, militant rebellion that is unflagging, trying to fight life's ills despite constant failure (\\"He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl / And he's always at home with his back to the wall / And he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost / And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on his cross / And he likes to be known as the angry young man\\"). The song contrasts the angry youth's feelings with the maturity of the narrator, who could be interpreted as either the same angry youth at a later age, or somebody who once felt as the angry young man currently does (\\"I believe I've passed the age of consciousness and righteous rage / I found that just surviving was a noble fight / I once believed in causes too / I had my pointless point of view / And life went on no matter who was wrong or right\\".) Despite never having been released as a single, \\"Prelude/Angry Young Man\\" has become a popular song among fans as well as a staple of live shows. \\"Prelude\\" was used as an opening theme for the German television talk show Live (1988-1996); and also used as theme song for Grampian Television's summertime news magazine programme \\"Summer at Six\\" in the early 1980s. It has also been frequently used during stoppages of play at New York Knicks home games in Madison Square Garden. == Rock Band == It was made available to download on March 22, 2011, for use in the Rock Band 3 music gaming platform in both Basic rhythm, and PRO mode which utilizes real guitar/bass guitar, and MIDI compatible electronic drum kits/keyboards in addition to vocals. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1976 songs Category:Billy Joel songs Category:Songs written by Billy Joel ","title":"Prelude/Angry Young Man"},{"id":"20479854","text":"Jenny Is a Good Thing is a 1969 American short documentary film about children and poverty, directed by Joan Horvath.

The simple profile of a short handicapped man with his tractor in downtown Lawrence was produced on a budget of $12,000 and eventually became one of the most popular classroom films of all time, selling an impressive 2300 prints.Geoff Alexander, Academic Films..., p. 75 ==ReferencesExternal links== *Leo Beuerman: A Legacy at Phoenix Media (corporate heir of Centron) *Leo Beuerman Official Website (as archived July 19, 2012) * Category:1969 films Category:1969 short films Category:1960s documentary films Category:American films Category:American documentary films Category:English-language films Category:Short documentary films ","title":"Leo Beuerman"},{"id":"20479904","text":"Dalibor Mitroviƒá (; born 4 November 1977) is a Serbian former football striker who played in the Serbian League, Belgian First Division A, Serbian SuperLiga, Ligue 1, Liga I, V.League 1, Canadian Soccer League, and the Serbian League East. ==Career== Mitroviƒá began his career at Radniƒçki Ni≈° in 1997/98 but joined the then Eerste Klasse champions Club Brugge the following season.

K. Selvamani. It features Vijayakanth in the lead role. It also features Mansoor Ali Khan, Rupini, Livingston and Ramya Krishnan, while R. Sarathkumar appears in a cameo role. It was Vijayakanth's 100th film, after which he earned the sobriquet \\"captain\\". The character of the antagonist Veerabhadran, played by Mansoor Ali Khan, is loosely based on the forest brigand Veerappan. The title of the film was inspired from Velupillai Prabhakaran, the leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Upon its release, the film became a blockbuster at the box office. The film score and soundtrack were composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The film was dubbed and released in Telugu as Captain Prabhakar.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbokyUrVx14 ==Plot== Captain Prabhakaran (Vijayakanth) is an IFS officer (Indian Forest Service) sent to Sathyamangalam to nab Veerabhadran (Mansoor Ali Khan) who tortures the people of that place. Prabhakaran is not only going to nab Veerabhadran, but also avenge the death of his friend Rajaraman IFS (R. Sarathkumar) who was a forest officer killed by Veerabhadran. The police commissioner and the district collector are corrupt and also support Veerabhadran. In the climax, Veerabhadran kidnaps Prabhakaran's wife and son. Prabhakaran arrives at the right time and saves his wife and son. He then nabs Veerabhadran. Poongudi (Ramya Krishnan) was Rajaraman's lover. She dies while giving birth to his child. Veerabhadran is shot dead by the corrupt inspector and collector. Prabhakaran kills both of them. He is then dragged to court for killing the police inspector and the collector. Prabhakaran tells the truth that they were corrupt, and the film ends with Prabhakaran being released from the court. ==Cast== * Vijayakanth as Captain Prabhakaran IFS, District forest officer * Sarath Kumar as Rajaraman IFS * M.N.

The film also was the 100th project of Vijayakanth. The filming was held at Chalakudy for 60 days. The film had Mansoor Ali Khan in his first major role. During the shoot, a rope to which Vijayakanth was bound snapped and his shoulder got dislocated. With both his hands tied he screamed in pain, but this was mistaken for acting, and as a result, there was a delay in getting medical assistance. ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack has only two songs composed by Ilaiyaraaja while the lyrics were written by Gangai Amaran and Piraisoodan. The song \\"Aattama Therottama\\" is set in the Carnatic raga known as Sindhu Bhairavi. It was later remixed by Prasanna Sekhar in Singakutty (2008). ==Reception== The Indian Express wrote \\"The strength of the film is its visual vibrancy and the narrative line too has a great measure of cohesion, despie it being an action film all the way.\\"https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=P9oYG7HA76QC&dat;=19910419&printsec;=frontpage&hl;=en ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:Tamil-language films Category:1991 films Category:Indian films Category:Tamil film scores by Ilaiyaraaja Category:1990s Tamil-language films Category:Films shot in Chalakudy Category:Indian films based on actual events Category:Fictional portrayals of the Tamil Nadu Police Category:Films directed by R.

Srinivas == Laya Madhura Mridanga Yagna == On the divine occasion of the 68th birthday celebrations of Parama Pujya Sri Ganapathi Sachchidananda Swamiji on May, 2010 the first ever of its kind musical presentation ‚Äú Laya Madhura Mridanga Yagna‚Äù led by mridanga maestro Thiruvarur Bakthavathsalam was organized at the Avadhoota Datta Peetham in Mysore. This concept devised by Swamiji had 108 mridangam artists from all over India participating in it. Based on a new raga ‚ÄúSachchidananda‚Äù dedicated to Swamiji, it will explore the concept of four in melody and rhythm. The number four has a special significance ‚Äì we have Brahma, the creator having four faces, the four vedas, the seasons are four, the most common beat in classical music is made of four units and so on. This unique musical offering was also based on the concept of four. The 108 mridangam artists werr divided into four groups, representing the four varieties of rhythm namely ‚Äì Chatusram, Tisram, Khandam and Misram. The raga ‚ÄúSachchidananda‚Äù is woven around the four notes ‚Äì Sa, Ga, Pa and Dha and the mrudangam was also tuned to each of these notes by the four groups. Apart from playing intrinsic patterns, the four groups also presented four Korvais. With the blessings of Ganapathy Sachchidananda Swamiji and ably led by maestro Thiruvarur Bhakthavatsalam, ‚ÄúLaya Madhura Mridanga Yagna‚Äù explored the multihued colours of melody and rhythm in the most exquisite manner and transported the listeners to a totally meditative plane.

Note that the year of birth is given as 1928 in Cummings (1971) p. 94.and 1929 in American Federation of Arts (1959) After serving in the US Navy from 1944 to 1946, he studied art at the University of Idaho, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1949. He then took a master's degree in philosophy at the University of Wisconsin, while continuing to paint and studying with the Magic realist artist, John Wilde.Cozzolino (2006) ==Art career== He had his first solo exhibition in Milwaukee in 1951,Smithsonian American Art Museum and three years later he had his first New York City solo exhibition at the Edwin Hewitt Gallery. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s his realist landscapes, interior scenes, and allegorical paintings were exhibited throughout the United States and in Europe. Although his work tended to become more abstract in the 1960s, he had a major exhibition of nude portraits at the Fischbach Gallery in 1965. The portraits were of New York literary and artistic figures of the time. One of the most famous of these is Poets Dressed and Undressed, two panels portraying Joe Brainard, Frank O'Hara, Joe LeSueur and Frank Lima. The exhibition also included a nude portrait of Allen Ginsberg who wrote the publicity flyer for the exhibition (Chamberlain's \\"Nakeds\\") as well as notes for the catalogue, wherein he equated Chamberlain's nudes with the ecstatic poetry of William Blake.McCarthy (1998) p.31 In the 1960s Chamberlain also became involved in Andy Warhol's circle.Banes (1993) pp. 55-56 and p. 124. Further reading on the relationship between Chamberlain and Warhol can be found in: Watson, Steven, Factory Made: Warhol and the Sixties, Pantheon, 2003. In the latter part of that decade he increasingly turned from painting to film and theatre. In 1967 he produced the premiere of Charles Ludlam's Conquest of the Universe at the Bouwerie Lane Theatre, directed by John Vaccaro and starring several members of Andy Warhol's Factory, including Taylor Mead and Ultra Violet.Smith (30 November 1967) p. 33 Chamberlain also wrote, produced and directed the film Brand X which premiered in 1970. The film, a satire on American television commercials, included Taylor Mead, Candy Darling, Abbie Hoffman, Baby Jane Holzer and Sam Shepard in the cast.

The small size of nanomagnets prevents the formation of magnetic domains (see single domain (magnetic)). The magnetization dynamics of sufficiently small nanomagnets at low temperatures, typically single-molecule magnets, presents quantum phenomena, such as macroscopic spin tunnelling. At larger temperatures, the magnetization undergoes random thermal fluctuations (superparamagnetism) which present a limit for the use of nanomagnets for permanent information storage. Canonical examples of nanomagnets are grains of ferromagnetic metals (iron, cobalt, and nickel) and single-molecule magnets. The vast majority of nanomagnets feature transition metal (titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt or nickel) or rare earth (Gadolinium, Europium, Erbium) magnetic atoms. The ultimate limit in miniaturization of nanomagnets was achieved in 2016: individual Ho atoms present remanence when deposited on a atomically thin layer of MgO coating a silver film was reported by scientists from EPFL and ETH, in Switzerland. Before that, the smallest nanomagnets reported so far, attending to the number of magnetic atoms, were double decker phthalocyanes molecules with only one rare-earth atom. Other systems presenting remanence are nanoengineered Fe chains, deposited on Cu2N/Cu(100) surfaces, showing either Neel or ferromagnetic ground states with in systems with as few as 5 Fe atoms with S=2. Canonical single-molecule magnets are the so-called Mn12 and Fe8 systems, with 12 and 8 transition metal atoms each and both with spin 10 (S = 10) ground states. The phenomenon of zero field magnetization requires three conditions: # A ground state with finite spin # A magnetic anisotropy energy barrier # Long spin relaxation time. Conditions 1 and 2, but not 3, have been demonstrated in a number of nanostructures, such as nanoparticles, nanoislands, and quantum dots with a controlled number of magnetic atoms (between 1 and 10). == References Further reading == * Category:Magnetism ","title":"Nanomagnet"},{"id":"20480368","text":"Vincent Challacombe Watts OBE (born 11 August 1940) is a British academic and businessman.

Extending from the vicinity of the central Ban Jelaƒçiƒá Square to its northern end at the Little Street (), the street flows between the Gornji Grad in the west and Nova Ves in the east. The street is administratively within the Gornji Grad‚ÄìMedve≈°ƒçak city district, constituting the former \\"August Cesarec\\" commune (abolished in 1994). According to the 2001 Croatian census, the street has 1,591 inhabitants. ==History== Centuries before the today's street emerged, the route of Tkalƒçiƒáeva Street was covered by the Medve≈°ƒçak creek. Medve≈°ƒçak (at that time also called Crikvenik or Cirkvenik) had been the center of Zagreb industry since the early days of the city, spawning numerous watermills. The watermills caused the development of Zagreb industry, leading in turn to the construction of Zagreb's first cloth, soap, paper and liquor factories and, later, animal skin industry. The watermills were often the subject of feuds between the twin cities, Kaptol and Gradec. A 1392 peace treaty forbade construction of new watermills along the shared city border, between today's southern end of Medvedgradska Street and Ban Jelaƒçiƒá Square, leaving only two mills within the city. Both mills were owned by a Cistercian monastery. However, they were both razed during the 1898 covering of the creek. Street pianist in the Tkalƒçiƒáeva street. Although both sides of the creek had been inhabited before, the 1898 covering left a full-scale street, which was aptly named Ulica Potok (). Most of the houses were dated to 18th or 19th century and the street was surfaced with gravel from Sava River excavated in Trnje. Around the middle of the 20th century it was modernized and paved with asphalt. The creek-based industry was quickly transformed into small businesses and stores and the skin industry stopped working in 1938. According to several records, the transformation of Medve≈°ƒçak creek valley was orchestrated in 1900 by Milan Lenucci, an architect. In 1908, Viktor Kovaƒçiƒá displayed some of his ideas about Ulica Potok in his studies of Gornji Grad, Kaptol and other city neighborhoods. In 1913, Ulica Potok's name is changed to Tkalƒçiƒáeva Street in honor of the 19th century Zagreb historian Ivan Tkalƒçiƒá, who was from nearby Nova Ves. ==Red- light district== At the turn of the 20th century, prostitution was legal. In Zagreb it was advertised as a tourist attraction and contributed to the city's economy. Tkalƒçiƒáeva Street was the main centre for brothels. At one stage every other building was a bordello. To open a brothel, the owner had to register at the town hall and received a licence. The licence required the brothel to be well run and provide a quality service. The women working in the brothels had to have a twice weekly medical examination. Brothels were not allowed to advertise their presence, but a discrete, uncommonly coloured lantern was allowed to be placed outside. The best known brothel, and most expensive, was the Kod Zelene Lampe (Green Lantern‚Äôs). The street's brothels continued to operate until WW2. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:Gornji Grad‚ÄìMedve≈°ƒçak Category:Streets in Zagreb Category:Shopping districts and streets in Croatia Category:Pedestrian malls Category:Red-light districts in Croatia Category:Pedestrian infrastructure in Croatia ","title":"Tkalƒçiƒáeva Street"},{"id":"20480542","text":"Andrey Krasnov (born 6 July 1981) is a retired Kyrgyzstani footballer who played for various clubs in his country including Dordoi-Dynamo Naryn.

It is the successor to the Audi R10 TDI. Like its predecessor, the R15 TDI uses a turbocharged diesel engine, although the R15's V10 engine is physically smaller than the R10's V12. The smaller engine is pushed further toward the middle of the car than in the R10, resulting in a more neutral weight balance that gives the car better agility around the corners than its predecessor. == History  2009 === The car was tested for the first time in December 2008, and made its competition debut at the 2009 12 Hours of Sebring race, 21 March 2009. The R15 got off to a perfect start by winning the 12 Hours of Sebring, setting a new race record in the process.

The electrical system uses a lithium-ion battery, a first for Audi sports prototypes, as well as LED headlights,AutoBlog.com Audi releases more details on the R15 TDI and a unique system of LED rear lights that are mounted on the rear wing endplate. In the week running up to the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans, rivals Peugeot lodged a protest against the R15, claiming that its bodywork did not comply with regulations stating that parts of the bodywork cannot be fitted with the sole purpose of generating downforce. However, after the Wednesday free practice session, the ACO rejected Peugeot's protest. At the 2009 Le Mans, Audi was unable to continue its winning streak that dated back to 2004. The No. 3 R15 ran off at Indianapolis corner in the beginning of the race but eventually finished 17th. The No. 2, driven by Luhr, crashed and retired. In the evening, the No. 1 Audi lost a lap to the leading Peugeot which was faster, and further technical issues dropped it a full 7 laps down the order. The No. 1 Audi clinched a podium finish, finishing in third place. Audi announced on 25 August 2009 that two R15s would race at the 2009 Petit Le Mans. Both Audis led for approximately 90% of the race but a late spin during the final rain-soaked caution handed the victory to one of the Peugeot 908 HDi FAPs entered by Team Peugeot Total. This loss was Audi's first since competing in Petit Le Mans since their initial attempt at Road Atlanta back in 2000. == R15 TDI Plus (2010) == In response to losing the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Petit Le Mans to the Peugeot 908s, Audi updated their R15 for the 2010 season, creating the R15 plus. 2010 Regulations reduced the size of diesel LMP1 air restrictors and turbocharger boost pressure. However, despite this, Audi's engineering team led by Ulrich Baretzky were able to achieve engine power and performance that was comparable to the 2009 powerplant. Aerodynamic efficiency was also a major area of focus for 2010. The frontal area of the car was redesigned to reveal the raw crash structures. The front fenders were also lowered in an effort to reduce drag while the concept of air running through the car was abandoned for a more conventional design. The air channel that exited to the side of the car was redesigned resulting in a more conventional configuration, and a new headlight concept was introduced. Audi stated that they had improved the fuel tank and cooling system as well. === Racing history === At the 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans, the three Joest Racing-entered R15s finished on the podium. The new vehicle was a success at the 2010 8 Hours of Le Castellet, winning five laps ahead of the next competitor Aston Martin. The Oreca Peugeot, which was supposedly its rival, dropped a full eight laps down the order because the airjacks failed to come off. Audi continue to go flat out and in the end finished ten laps ahead of the Peugeot. Audi had now been able to achieve both the speed and reliability combination that they considered sufficient to match the Peugeot challenge for Le Mans. A full squad of three cars was entered for the next race which was the 2010 Spa 1000 km, finishing third (#7, behind the two Peugeots ‚Äì No. 3 took first, No. 2 took second), fifth (#9) and twelfth (#8) respectively. Audi treated the race as a setup exercise for car configuration at Spa that would then be used for the 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans. The 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans race got off to a tightly contested start with Peugeot occupying the top spots (as they did for qualifying) and for a large part of the race. However, it was apparent throughout the race that Audi were unable to match the pace with the Peugeots, but were working according to a different race strategy. By pushing the French manufacturer to the limit, three of the Peugeot cars experienced engine problems due to connecting rod failure towards the latter part of the race. With engine troubles for three of the Peugeots that forced the cars to retire before the end of the race, and an early exit by the No. 3 due to a suspension failure, the three Audis would finish 1‚Äì2‚Äì3 (the No. 9 took first, No. 8 took second and No. 7 took third), with all cars exceeding the previous distance record of set in the 1971 race by Dr Helmut Marko and Gijs Van Lennep: the winning No. 9 car, led by Mike Rockenfeller and two Porsche factory drivers Timo Bernhard and Romain Dumas, set not only a record-tying number of laps around Le Mans of 397 laps, but eclipsed the distance record outright at a distance of . Audi R15 at Sebring 2011 Post-Le Mans Audi did not collect any more victories and lost all three remaining races to the Peugeot 908, which happened to be part of the ILMC championship. Audi fielded two cars into the Silverstone 1000 km but the No. 7 crashed and retired. The sole remaining No. 8 finished third. At Petit Le Mans two cars were entered but both lost to a Peugeot 1‚Äì2 victory. At the R15's last race, two cars were entered into the Zhuhai 1000 km. Both cars were leading the 908s by thirty seconds after Sebastian Bourdais make contact with a GT2 Porsche. A late safety car session saw the Audi's lead shrink to thirteen seconds. Afterwards a controversial team-work by Peugeot saw the No. 1 908 slowed down the No. 7 Audi enough to let the No. two Peugeot come out of the pits just two seconds ahead. The race ended with Peugeot No. 2 winning four seconds ahead of the Audi. Audi did not win the LMP1 Le Mans Series team championship nor the ILMC LMP1 championship. The R15's final race was at the 2011 Sebring 12 Hours. Both cars ran in 2010 configuration with new restrictors. The No. 1 Audi finished fifth overall after two consecutive tyre punctures and rear bodywork damage in the hands of Mike Rockenfeller. Later in the race the No. 1 had to serve a penalty for speeding in pitlane. The No. 2 ran at the front exchanging the lead with Peugeot until a shunt by one of the Peugeots at turn 17 put Capello out of contention with a suspension failure. The No. 2 finished fourth overall, albeit five laps down from the winning Oreca Peugeot. Throughout its career the R15 won three of the ten races it entered; Sebring in 2009, Paul Ricard and Le Mans in 2010. == Replacement == With a change in Le Mans Prototype engine regulations planned for 2011, Audi developed the closed-top R18 to succeed the R15. Wolfgang Ullrich cited favourable changes to pitstop regulations and aerodynamic efficiency as the reasons for adopting a closed- cockpit design. The R18 was Audi's first-ever coupe since the failed Audi R8C in , although the Bentley Speed 8, which won in with an Audi-developed engine, was also a closed-cockpit car. The R15 TDI's final start came at the 2011 12 Hours of Sebring, where it competed as an upgraded R15++, as the R18 was still being developed at the time. == Technical data == {  eee; text-align:center;\\" - ddd;\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:100px;\\" Audi R15 TDI -  Design  Le Mans Prototype (LMP1) -  Motor type  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" V10-Diesel motor with turbocharger -  Engine displacement  5500 cc -  Power  over 440 kW (590 HP)http://www.audiusa.com Audi Achieves Record Victory at Le Mans with New Technology -  Torque  1050 Nm (774 lb ft) -  Vmax  over 330 km/h (205 mph) -  Drive wheels  Rear wheels -  Gearbox  CFK-gearbox -  Transmission  sequential, pneumatic actuated 5-gear -  Brakes  2-circuit hydraulic braking system, carbon fibre disc brakes front and back -  Length  -  Width  -  Height  -  Fuel tank capacity  -  Weight  min. } == Additional images == File:AudiR15.JPGThe Audi R15 TDI, driven by Tom Kristensen during the 2009 12 Hours of Sebring.

She was the third wife of tsar Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria. She was the mother of tsar Michael Asen I of Bulgaria. == Life == Irene was daughter of despotƒìs Theodore Komnenos Doukas, ruler of Epirus, and Maria Petraliphaina (sister of the sebastokrat≈çr John Petraliphas). In 1230 Irene and her family were captured by the troops of tsar Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria in the battle of Klokotnitsa and they were taken in Tarnovo, where Irene grew up in the Palace. Irene became known for her beauty and the widowed tsar fell in love with her. They married in 1237. According to a Byzantine author, Ivan Asen II loved Irene \\"no less than Antony loved Cleopatra\\", and she may have been his mistress for some years before their marriage in 1237. By marrying Irene, Ivan Asen II would have broken church canons, as his daughter, Maria Asanina Komnena, from his marriage to Anna (Anisia) was married to Irene's uncle, Manuel of Thessalonica. There is some evidence that the Bulgarian church opposed the marriage and that a patriarch (called either Spiridon or Vissarion) was deposed or executed by the irate tsar. Irene and Ivan Asen II had three children: # Anna (or Theodora), who married the sebastokrat≈çr Peter before 1253. # Maria, who married Mitso Asen, who succeeded as emperor of Bulgaria 1256‚Äì1257. # Michael Asen I, who succeeded as emperor of Bulgaria (1246‚Äì1256). In 1241 Ivan Asen II died and he was succeeded by Kaliman I of Bulgaria, his son by his second wife Anna Maria of Hungary. Kaliman I was poisoned in 1246 and the throne went to Michael Asen I, the son of Irene. According to one theory Irene poisoned her stepson in order to secure the throne for Michael II. It is assumed that Irene took over the government as tsarina-regent because her son was still a child when he ascended the throne, but there is little evidence to prove this hypothesis. Irene retired to a monastery under the monastic name Xenia.

If no commonality was found, the wikitext of the dominant wiki engine MediaWiki was usually chosen. On July 4, 2007, the version 1.0 (final) of Creole was released, and a two-year development freeze was implemented to allow time for authors of wiki engines to adopt the new markup. Although development to the standard itself is frozen, discussion in the developer community regarding good practices in wiki markup design and about possible additions and changes for future Creole versions continues. As of 2012, adoption of Creole is limited. Many wiki systems offer it as an option, but few use it by default and few wiki websites enable this optional feature. ==Creole syntax examples== Emphasized text: //emphasized// (e.g., italics) **strongly emphasized** (e.g., bold) Lists: * Bullet list * Second item ** Sub item # Numbered list # Second item ## Sub item Links: Link to wikipage link text Headings: (closing equals signs are optional) = Extra-large heading == Large heading === Medium heading  Small heading Linebreaks: Force\\\\\\\\linebreak Horizontal Line: ---- Images: Tables: = = table = header   a  table  row   b  table  row  No markup: {} ==Support in engines== As of early 2011, wiki engines that have implemented full or partial support for Creole include Liferay, Djiki, DokuWiki, Ikiwiki, MoinMoin, Oddmuse, PhpWiki, PmWiki, TiddlyWiki, and XWiki. However, Creole is not necessarily the default syntax in these wiki engines. Creole 1.0 is the default syntax in Bitbucket wikis, which also support some Creole 1.0 additions.

It was first reported as dehydromucic acid by Rudolph Fittig and Heinzelmann in 1876, who produced it via the action of concentrated hydrobromic acid upon mucic acid. It can be produced from certain carbohydrates and as such is a renewable resource, it was identified by the US Department of Energy as one of 12 priority chemicals for establishing the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù chemistry industry of the future. Furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (FDCA) has been suggested as an important renewable building block because it can substitute for terephthalic acid (PTA) in the production of polyesters and other current polymers containing an aromatic moiety.T.

Green Chem 2010;12:539‚Äì554 ==Synthesis of FDCA== Methods for the synthesis of the FDCA may be divided into four groups: * Dehydration of hexose derivatives * Oxidation of 2,5-disubstituted furans * Catalytic conversions of various furan derivatives * Biological conversion of HMF ===Dehydration of hexose derivatives=== First group is based on the acid-promoted triple dehydration of aldaric (mucic) acids. This reaction requires severe conditions (highly concentrated acids, temp > 120 ¬∞C, React time > 20h) and all the methods were non-selective with yields < 50%.Y. Taguchi, A. Oishi and H. Iida, Chem. Lett., 2008, 37, 50‚Äì 51 The process has also been patented by the French company Agro Industrie Recherches et Developpements.ARD, FR2723945 This is also the process which DuPont and ADM are using according to patent literature. ===Oxidation of 2,5-disubstituted furans=== Oxidation routes of HMF into FDCAThe second class of synthesis routes include the oxidation reactions of various 2,5-disubstituted furans utilizing a variety of inorganic oxidants. Several routes to FDCA via oxidation of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) with air over different catalysts have been reported. Oxidation of HMF under strongly alkaline conditions over noble metal catalysts gives almost quantitative formation of FDCA. HMF and methoxymethylfurfural (MMF) oxidation was also studied with a series of conventional metal bromide catalysts (Co, Mn, Br) used for the oxidation of para-xylene to terephthalic acid.W. Partenheimer and V.V. Grushin, Adv. Synth. Catal., 2001, 343, 102‚Äì111. Also, the direct, one pot dehydration and oxidation of fructose to FDCA via intermediate HMF has been investigated with good selectivities, unfortunately this system does not work in water.C. Carlini, P. Patrono, A.M.R. Galletti, G. Sbrana and V. Zima, Appl. Catal., A, 2005, 289, 197‚Äì204; M.L. Ribeiro and U. Schuchardt, Catal. Commun., 2003, 4, 83‚Äì 86. ===Catalytic conversions of various furan derivatives=== The third class includes reactions describing the synthesis of FDCA from furfural. Furfural can be oxidized to 2-furoic acid with nitric acid and the latter was subsequently converted to its methyl ester. The ester was then converted via chloromethylation at position 5 to give 5-chloromethylfuroate. The latter was oxidized with nitric acid to form dimethyl 2,5-furandicarboxylate, which, after the alkaline hydrolysis gave FDCA in 50% yield. Andrisano reported that potassium 2-furoate, when heated up to 300 ¬∞C in a nitrogen atmosphere, underwent decarboxylation to furan with simultaneous carboxylation at position 5 to di-potassium 2,5-furandicarboxylate.Andrisano, R.; Angeloni, A.S. Ann. Chim. (Rome) 1963, 53, 1658 ===Biological conversion of HMF=== FDCA has also been detected in human urine.Witten, T.A.; S.P. Levine, M. Killan, P. Boyle and S. Harkey. Clin. Chem. 1973, 19, 963 A healthy human produces 3‚Äì5 mg/day. Numerous studies were undertaken to establish the metabolism of this compound and to determine the quantity, which is produced depending on the healthiness of the human. It was demonstrated that the individual quantity of produced FDCA increased after the injection of fructose. FDCA was also detected in blood plasma.Lewkowski J. 2001, Synthesis, chemistry and applications of 5-hydroxymethyl-furfural and its derivatives. ARKIVOC pp. 17-54 Recently, the enzyme furfural/HMF oxidoreductase was isolated from the bacterium Cupriavidus basilensis HMF14.F. Koopman, N. Wierckx, J.H. de Winde and H.J. Ruijssenaars. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010, 107: 4919-4924. This enzyme might be able to convert HMF to FDCA using molecular oxygen, although an aldehyde dehydrogenase might also play a role. A Pseudomonas putida strain that was genetically engineered to express this enzyme can completely and selectively convert HMF to FDCA. This biocatalysis is performed in water, at ambient temperature and pressure, without toxic or polluting chemicals, making it very environmentally friendly.F. Koopman, N. Wierckx, J.H. de Winde and H.J. Ruijssenaars. Bioresource Technology 2010, 101: 6291-6296. Several other enzymes have been described later, including HMFO. This flavin dependent oxidase catalyzes the three consecutive oxidations to form FDCA from HMF.W.P. Dijkman, D.E. Groothuis, M.W. Fraaije. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2014, 53: 6515-6518. ===Industrial production=== DuPont has announced the production of FDCA for use in PTF. In March 2016, Avantium and BASF created the joint venture Synvina to erect a 50,000 t/a plant for the production of FDCA based on fructose at BASF's Verbund-site in Antwerp, Belgium.Press release \\"BASF and Avantium intend to establish Joint Venture\\" from 15.3.2016 ==Properties and conversions== Derivatives of FDCAFDCA is a very stable compound. Its physical properties, such as insolubility in most of common solvents and a very high melting point (it melts at 342 ¬∞C) seem to indicate intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Despite its chemical stability, FDCA undergoes reactions typical for carboxylic acids, such as halogen substitution to give carboxylic dihalides, the di-ester formation and the formation of amides. All these reactions were elaborated at the end of 19th and in the beginning of 20th century. Newer methods have been described by Janda et al., who introduced the synthesis of 2,5-furandicarboxylic dichloride, by the reaction of FDCA with thionyl chlorideJanda, M.; Valenta, H.; Hrdy, I.; Hurkova, J.; Strogl, J.; Stibor, J.; Holy, P.; Bartizal, J. CS Patent, 188,011 (1982); C.A. 1982, 97, p72244h. The synthesis of diethyl ester and dimethyl ester as well as the amidation as well as several other modifications have been reported. The versatility of FDCA is also seen in the number of derivatives available via relatively simple chemical transformations. Selective reduction can lead to partially hydrogenated products, such as 2,5 dihydroxymethylfuran, and fully hydrogenated materials, such as 2,5 bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran. ==Applications== The most important group of FDCA conversions is undoubtedly the polymerization. The potential applications of furan-based building blocks for polymer applications has been extensively reviewed by Gandini.Gandini, A., Belgacem, N.M. Prog. Polym. Sci., 1997, 22, 1203-1379; Gandini, A., Silvestre, A.J.D., Pascoal Neto, C. Sousa, A.F., Gomes, M. J. Pol. Sci.: Part A: Pol. Chem., 2009, 47, 295‚Äì298; Gandini, A. Pol. Chem. 1, 245-251. A notable example is polyethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate, but also other polyesters and various polyamides and polyurethanes have been described in literature. Amongst others like Dupont and Corbion, the company Avantium claims to have developed a cost- effective route to produce FDCA and the derived polyesters. FDCA has also been applied in pharmacology. It was demonstrated that its diethyl ester had a strong anaesthetic action similar to cocaine. Dicalcium 2,5-furandicarboxylate was shown to inhibit the growth of Bacillus megatorium. Screening studies on FDCA-derived anilides showed their important anti-bacterial action. The diacid itself is a strong complexing agent, chelating such ions as: Ca2+, Cu2+ and Pb2+; it is utilized in medicine to remove kidney stones. HMF is metabolized via FDCA in mammals including humans. A very diluted solution of FDCA in tetrahydrofuran is utilized for preparing artificial veins for transplantation. At the beginning of this chapter, it was mentioned that FDCA is a chemically stable compound. This property has been well benefited in industry ‚Äì FDCA as most of polycarboxylic acids can be an ingredient of fire foams. Such foams help to extinguish fires in a short time caused by polar and non-polar solvents. FDCA has a large potential as a replacement for terephthalic acid, a widely used component in various polyesters, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polybutyleneterephthalate (PBT). The versatility of FDCA is also seen in the number of derivatives available via relatively simple chemical transformations. Selective reduction can lead to partially hydrogenated products, such as 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran, and fully hydrogenated materials, such as 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran. Both of these latter materials can serve as alcohol components in the production of new polyester, and their combination with FDCA would lead to a new family of completely biomass-derived products. Extension of these concepts to the production of new nylons, either through reaction of FDCA with diamines, or through the conversion of FDCA to 2,5-bis(aminomethyl)tetrahydrofuran. FDCA can also serve as a starting material for the production of succinic acid, whose utility is elsewhere.2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid CAS 3238-40-2's use Watson International Ltd ==Technical barriers== The primary technical barrier in the production and use of FDCA is the development of an effective and selective dehydration process from sugars. The control of sugar dehydration could be a very powerful technology, leading to a wide range of additional, inexpensive building blocks, but it is not yet well understood. Currently, dehydration processes using hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) as intermediate are generally non-selective, unless, immediately upon their formation, the unstable intermediate products can be transformed into more stable materials such as methoxymethylfurfural (MMF). Necessary R&D; will include development of selective dehydration systems and catalysts. FDCA formation will require development of cost-effective and industrially viable oxidation technology that can operate in concert with the necessary dehydration processes. == References == Category:Dicarboxylic acids Category:Aromatic acids Category:Furans ","title":"2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid"},{"id":"20480840","text":"Gobindsar is a town located in the Punjab province of India. ==References== Category:Populated places in Punjab, India ","title":"Gobindsar"},{"id":"20480847","text":"QF 4.7 inch naval gun, World War II A hydraulic recoil mechanism is a way of limiting the effects of recoil and adding to the accuracy and firepower of an artillery piece. == Description == British 60-pounder gun Mk.I, 1916 The usual recoil system in modern quick-firing guns is the hydro-pneumatic recoil system. In this system, the barrel is mounted on rails on which it can recoil to the rear, and the recoil is taken up by a cylinder which is similar in operation to an automotive gas-charged shock absorber, and is commonly visible as a cylinder mounted parallel to the barrel of the gun, but shorter and smaller than it. The cylinder contains a charge of compressed air, as well as hydraulic oil; in operation, the barrel's energy is taken up in compressing the air as the barrel recoils backward, then is dissipated via hydraulic damping as the barrel returns forward to the firing position. The recoil impulse is thus spread out over the time in which the barrel is compressing the air, rather than over the much narrower interval of time when the projectile is being fired. This greatly reduces the peak force conveyed to the mount (or to the ground on which the gun has been emplaced). ==See also== *Canon de 75 mod√®le 1897#Description of the hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism *List of British ordnance terms#Hydro-pneumatic == References == Category:Artillery components ","title":"Hydraulic recoil mechanism"},{"id":"20480850","text":"Eric Wilfred Balcom, (March 13, 1909 - May 31, 1989) was a businessman, political figure, and Companion of the Order of Canada.Eric W.

Its source is in the mountains of western Argolis, near the village Kaparelli. It flows into the Aegean Sea in Nea Kios. The Inachos was named after Inachus, a mythical king of Argos, who introduced civilization to the area. The Inachus rises, according to Pausanias (ii 25.3, 8.6.6), in Mt. Artemisium, on the borders of Arcadia, or, according to Strabo (viii. p.370), in Mt. Lyrceium, a northern offshoot of Artemisium. Near its sources it receives a tributary called the Cephissus, which rises in Mt. Lyrceium (Strab. ix. p.424; Aelian, Ael. VH 2.33.) It flows in a south-easterly direction, E. of the city of Argos, into the Argolic gulf. This river is often dry in the summer. Between it and the city of Argos is the mountain-torrent named Charadrus, which also rises in Mt. Artemisium, and which, from its proximity to Argos, has been frequently mistaken for the Inachus by modern travellers. It flows over a wide gravelly bed, which is generally dry in the summer, whence its modern name of Xerias, or the Dry River. It flows into the Inachus a little below Argos. It was on the banks of the Charadrus that the armies of Argos, on their return from military expeditions, were obliged to undergo a court of inquiry before they were permitted to enter the city.

It may have originated in the video game industry. The term \\"vertical slice\\" refers to a cross-sectional slice through the layers that form the structure of the software code base. It is mostly used in Scrum terminology where the work is planned in terms of features (or stories). For example, as a very basic approach, a software project may consist of three layers (or components): # Data access layer (bottom) # Business logic layer (middle) # User interface layer (top) In this common approach, a vertical slice means a bit of every layer. Again as an example, a new feature request like \\"showing x information on main screen\\" would contain these work bits: * Work in the UX/UI that will display the information * Work in the service layer to transform the information * Work in the database layer to store / fetch the information. So a vertical slice can be defined as \\"the sum of the work that has to be done in every layer that is involved in getting a specific feature working.\\" A vertical slice doesn't necessarily affect every component in the software. For example, if the solution contains a web service, it would live in the same \\"floor\\" as the UI, and a feature like \\"supporting login/logout in webservice\\" that involves only the web service does not require a change in the UI, but the business and database access layers.

He competed almost exclusively in the Shooto organization, before making his debut at the WEC 37. In 2007, he was the lightweight champion of Shooto. He was once ranked as the #5 Bantamweight in the world by the MMAWeekly Worldwide Ranking System. Tamura is a freestyle fighter. In 2004, Tamura became the first foreigner to beat a Burmese Lethwei fighter in an official match. ==Mixed martial arts career== Tamura made his professional debut in the Shooto organization in a fight against Eiji Murayama, in August 2001, and lost on a technical decision (he later returned to face Murayama in 2004, only for the match to end in a draw). He has made MMA headlines when he defeated Takeshi Inoue in 2007, which won him the title of Shooto lightweight champion. He has also participated in GCM and MARS events, achieving a TKO over Masaomi Saito in the former, and a first round submission over Ian Loveland in the latter. Akitoshi Tamura made his WEC debut at WEC 37. Although Akitoshi had a reputation of being one of the world's best in his weight class, he lost to former IFL featherweight champion Wagnney Fabiano, for whom it was also his WEC debut. For his next fight, Tamura made his 135 lb. debut in the bantamweight division at WEC 40 against former world title challenger Manny Tapia. Tamura defeated Tapia by unanimous decision. On October 10, 2009, he was scheduled to fight Damacio Page at WEC 43, but pulled out with an undisclosed injury. He was replaced in the bout by WEC newcomer Will Campuzano. On January 10, 2010, Tamura was defeated by WEC veteran Charlie Valencia via split decision at WEC 46. ==Lethwei bout== Tamura also competed in a Lethwei tournament on July 10 & 11, 2004 at the Thuwunna National Indoor Stadium in Yangon, Myanmar pitting four Japanese fighters (Tamura, Yoshitaro Niimi, Takaharu Yamamoto and Seiji Wakasugi) against Aye Bo Sein. The other Burmese fighters competing in the tournament were Naing Wan Lay, Win Tun and Shwe Sai. Tamura knocked out local fighter Aya Bo Sein in the fourth round becoming the first foreigner to beat a Lethwei practitioner in an official match and received a challenge fight belt that was created specifically for the event. == Lethwei record == { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"width:100%; clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; font-size:85%; text-align:center;\\" -

Local boat trips from Portrush pass the Skerries en route to the Giant's Causeway. ==Area of Special Scientific Interest== In 1996 the islands were designated as part of the Ramore Head and The Skerries Area of Special Scientific Interest. The islands are a habitat for breeding by a range of seabirds including kittiwake, black guillemot and eider duck. The temperature of the Skerries during the summer months is warmer than other parts of Northern Ireland, and so the rocks are home to particularly interesting fauna; it is the only place many southern species such as the cotton spinner sea cucumber Holothuria forskali are found in Northern Ireland. There are several protected habitats located around the Skerries, notably for seagrass (Zostera marina) and horse mussel (Modiolus modiolus). In addition, recent surveys have found numbers of the spiny spider crab (Maja brachydactyla), which is new to Northern Ireland.http://seasearch.wisshost.net/downloads/skerries%20report.pdf ==Shipwrecks== On 28 December 1879 the sailing vessel, Thomas Graham, owned by John and Thomas Candlish of Palnackie in Scotland, and captained by John Candlish, was stranded at the Skerries and lost. ==References== Category:Landforms of County Antrim Category:Northern Ireland coast Category:Islands of County Antrim Category:Skerries Category:Portrush ","title":"The Skerries, Northern Ireland"},{"id":"20481362","text":"Paola Buonadonna is an Italian journalist and communications consultant based in the United Kingdom.

The edition of 1997 specified an ISO 2022-compliant 94√ó94 two-byte coded character set. Subsequent editions have added additional encoded characters outside of the 94√ó94 plane, in a manner comparable to UHC or GBK. KPS 9566 differs in approach from KS X 1001, its South Korean counterpart, in using a different ordering of chos≈èn'g≈≠l, in encoding explicit vertical presentation forms of punctuation, in not encoding duplicate hanja for multiple readings, and in including several characters specific to the North Korean political system, including special encodings for the names of the country's past and present leaders (Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il and Kim Jong-un). Although KPS 9566 was the original source of several characters added to Unicode, not all KPS 9566 characters have Unicode equivalents. Those which do not are mapped to similar Unicode characters or to the Private Use Area. == Background and other standards == The ASCII character set originated in the United States in 1963, and was revised in 1967 to the form it has today. ASCII also became accepted as an international standard in 1967, becoming ECMA-6, designated ISO/IEC 646 by the International Organisation for Standardization. It is presently designated ANSI X3.4-1986 and ISO 646:1991. ASCII was a 7-bit, single-byte encoding including 94 graphical characters, the space, and 33 control codes, which provided basic support for representing American English text as a series of bytes. The next edition of ISO 646, published in 1972, revised the standard to introduce the concept of national versions of the code, allowing countries to replace a few less commonly used codes with their own required characters. At the same time, work on defining extension mechanisms for ASCII was underway, with the intention of being applicable to both 7-bit and 8-bit environments. This was completed in 1973 and published as JIS X 0202, ECMA-35 and ISO 2022. ISO 2022 specifies mechanisms for using single-byte and multiple-byte character sets with a certain structure in both 7-bit and 8-bit environments, and for declaring and switching between them in a standard fashion using shift codes and escape sequences. Countries in East Asia, due to using large repertoires of Chinese characters, introduced standardised double- byte encodings (DBCS) for their writing systems, since the number of characters representable in a single-byte code was not sufficient. In an ISO 2022 compliant DBCS, every character can be represented with two ASCII printing character bytes; the location of a character can be referenced by these byte values, or by two numbers from 1 to 94 (a kuten), equal to the respective bytes minus 32. The first registered ISO 2022 compliant DBCS, and the first East Asian DBCS to be established as a national standard, was the first edition of JIS X 0208 (Japan), published in 1978. This was followed by GB 2312 (Mainland China) in 1980, and by Wansung code (South Korea; first designated KS C 5601-1987) in 1987. Big5 (Taiwan), defined in 1984, did not follow the ISO 2022 structure. When used in an 8-bit (rather than 7-bit) environment, GB 2312 and Wansung code were usually used with the eighth bit set, with ASCII or a similar SBCS used with the eighth bit unset; these encoding schemes are known as EUC-CN and EUC-KR, respectively. Although the Korean writing system includes individual symbols (jamo) for consonants and vowels, serving as an alphabet, Korean text is properly typeset with these symbols composed into blocks for each syllable. Wansung code included individual Korean syllable blocks separately, treating them as a large set of characters similarly to hanja, and was first defined by the third edition of the South Korean standard KS C 5601. The first edition had defined an encoding of individual jamo which allowed syllable blocks to be encoded as sequences, which was named N-byte Hangul, and had not been adopted as widely as intended. Wansung code did not encode all possible modern Korean syllables, only a selection of the 2350 most common, although it allowed them to be specified using combining sequences, which often were not supported. An alternative encoding, also South Korean, named Johab did, and served as a competitor to Wansung for some time. Unified Hangul Code (UHC), introduced by Microsoft with Windows 95, extended EUC-KR, allowing the use of invalid EUC double-byte codes to represent all other syllables available in Johab. A similar approach was taken by the Mainland Chinese GBK encoding, extending GB 2312 with support for Traditional Chinese and for less common Chinese characters by encoding them to double-byte codes invalid in EUC-CN. South Korea was not the only country developing an ISO 2022 DBCS for Korean: the Mainland Chinese GB 12052 was published in 1989. This was not closely related to Wansung code, although it also included composed syllables. Instead, it corresponded to GB 2312 with Korean syllables (and 94 hanja) replacing the Chinese characters, except for the inclusion of a dollar sign in place of a yuan sign. It may have been developed for use by the Korean minority in north-eastern China. Likewise, North Korea developed KPS 9566. Although North Korea and South Korea both use Korean Chos≈èn'g≈≠l (Hangul) as their primary writing system, they use different lexicographical orders. Hence, character ordering differs between Wansung code and KPS 9566. KPS 9566 has undergone several revisions, including editions of 1997 and 2003, mainly to enhance compatibility with Unicode. These are commonly indicated by specifying the year (e.g. KPS 9566-97, 9566-2003). The current edition as of the release of Red Star OS 3.0 appears to be KPS 9566-2011, which adds Kim Jong-un to the list of leaders. The publicly available code chart for the 1997 edition of KPS 9566 shows a ISO 2022 94√ó94 plane. The more recent editions, from what sources of information are available outside of North Korea itself, appear to define additional allocations outside of the EUC plane (similarly to GBK or UHC). Due to the interoperability issues arising from the use of multiple national standard and platform- or font-specific proprietary character encodings, the Unicode standard was developed with the intent of allowing all representable text to be interchanged in a single, universal format. The first edition of Unicode was published in 1991 and 1992, and ISO/IEC 10646 was established in sync with Unicode in 1993. Unicode formats are preferred for international use on the World Wide Web, where legacy character encodings are treated as partial encodings of Unicode by means of mapping files. == Design == In principle, KPS 9566 is similar to the Wansung character set defined by the South Korean KS X 1001 standard, although the two are not compatible. Both encode a section of punctuation, symbols, jamo, kana and alphabetical characters, followed by a subset of the possible modern chos≈èn'g≈≠l syllables, followed by a section of hanja. However, KPS 9566 uses a different ordering of jamo and syllables to conform with North Korean lexicographical ordering standards. KPS 9566 also includes 28 explicitly rotated punctuation characters for vertical typography, which KS X 1001 does not, and encodes each hanja only once, whereas KS X 1001 encodes several hanja with multiple readings multiple times. KPS 9566-97 encodes a total of 2679 chos≈èn'g≈≠l syllables and 4653 hanja. This provides better coverage than the 2350 syllables encoded by Wansung code: for instance, the Îò† character used in the name of , a noted Korean literary work, does not have an assigned Wansung codepoint, but has one (38-02) in KPS 9566. The hanja section includes 4652 characters from the Unified Repertoire and Ordering and one from CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A. The entirety of row 15, the latter half of row 44 (after the syllables block) and the latter half of row 94 (after the hanja block) may be used for user-defined purposes. KPS 9566 is especially distinguished by its inclusion of several special characters from North Korean political life. Specifically, it includes the hammer, sickle and brush emblem of the Workers' Party of Korea, both uncircled and circled (code points 12-01 and 12-02), and two groups of three special-purpose characters which spell out the names of the North Korean leaders Kim Il-sung (ÍπÄÏùºÏÑ±) and Kim Jong-il (ÍπÄÏ†ïÏùº) in a special decorative font (code points 04-72 to 04-74 and 04-75 to 04-77, respectively). The syllables for Kim and Il, which are identical in the spelling of both names, are encoded twice. KPS 9566-2011 additionally includes the name of Kim Jong-un (ÍπÄÏ†ïÏùÄ) as code points 04-78 to 04-80. Due to these special characters, there is currently no full round-trip compatibility between KPS 9566 and Unicode, unless unsupported characters are mapped to the Private Use Area. === KPS 10721 === North Korea also developed a second character set, KPS 10721 \\"Code of the supplementary Korean Hanja Set for Information Interchange\\", which was published in 2000. KPS 10721 encodes a set of at least 19469 hanja additional to those included in KPS 9566. , these did not all have mappings to Unicode, but included 10358 from the Unified Repertoire and Ordering, 3187 from CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A and 107 from CJK Compatibility Ideographs (all in the Basic Multilingual Plane), as well as 5767 from CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B and 50 from CJK Compatibility Ideographs Supplement (in the Supplementary Ideographic Plane). Besides the mapping of these hanja to Unicode, little is known about the KPS 10721 standard outside of North Korea. North Korean reference glyphs are not provided for these hanja in the Unicode code charts, due to a lack of suitable font data available to the Unicode Consortium. Unicode hanja characters with KPS 9566 or KPS 10721 sources are nonetheless cross-referenced to their KPS codes in the Unihan database with the key \`kIRG_KPSource\`. == Documentation and relationship to Unicode == Unicode's initial coverage of Korean syllables, added in version 1.0, was based on Wansung code. In Unicode version 2.0, a new block of Korean syllables (the present Hangul Syllables block) was added, based on Johab, and the previous block was deleted (it is now occupied by CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A). This was done under the assumption that no Unicode-encoded Korean data existed yet, but became known as the \\"Korean mess\\", and the responsible committees pledged not to make such an incompatible change in the future, a pledge codified by the Unicode Stability Policy. The code chart for KPS 9566-97, published April 1997, was submitted to the ISO International Register of Coded Character Sets for registration for use with ISO/IEC 2022. It was registered in June 1998 with the number ISO-IR-202. This code chart is publicly available from the Information Processing Society of Japan. In August 1999, the North Korean national body submitted a document to WG2 (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2 Working Group 2), the ISO body responsible for ISO/IEC 10646, the international standard corresponding to Unicode. This document requested the addition of the KPS 9566 codes to the existing cross-references from the CJK Unified Ideographs charts, the addition of 80 symbol characters from KPS 9566 which did not have existing Unicode mappings, a resolution to the difference in collation order between KPS 9566 and Unicode (due to the order of the characters in Unicode following the South Korean encodings) and the addition of 8 combining jamo. It also requested for WG2 to edit the existing Unicode character and block names to use the term \\"Korean character\\" rather than \\"Hangul\\". An expanded version of this proposal, broken into several documents, was submitted as a work item in December 1999. A detailed response was submitted by the Swedish representative in March 2000, opposing several of the points and elaborating on Sweden's vote against the proposal. This response stated that changing the encoding of the Korean characters again would cause major disruption, even more so than the first time, which was done when comparatively few implementations existed, but which in retrospect should not have been done. It explained that that few or no languages can be collated correctly by code point value, and that a tailoring for the Unicode Collation Algorithm or ISO/IEC 14651 (then being drafted) should be used for that purpose, and that normative names of characters already assigned cannot be changed, due to the stability policy, although non-normative translations to other languages can be employed. It suggested that a machine-readable mapping file between Unicode and KPS 9566 could be provided by the North Korean body itself, and would be more useful than a printed cross-reference in the standard document. Regarding the proposed additional characters, the response stated that characters which would have compatibility decompositions in Unicode should not be added and that logos, including those of political parties, and special characters for names of particular persons should not be added. In July 2000, the North Korean body wrote to WG2, accusing them of developing both versions of the Unicode encoding for Korean on the basis of South Korean proposals only, without consulting North Korea, accusing them putting the commercial interests of companies and fears of international confusion over respect to North Korea's sovereignty, and stating that North Korea would regard further refusal to change the name and order of the Korean characters in Unicode as an insult to their sovereign dignity and as compromising the ISO's claims to impartiality. They re-iterated their demand for WG2 and Unicode to \\"correct\\" the order of the Korean characters, and to \\"correct\\" the names \\"Hangul Jamo\\" and \\"Hangul Syllable\\" to \\"Korean Alphabet\\" and \\"Korean Syllable\\". In August 2000, the North Korean national body submitted a more detailed version of their requests in a series of five consecutive proposals. These requested the addition of 14 additional jamo characters, the addition of 82 symbol characters, and the use of the term \\"Korean alphabet\\" instead of \\"Hangul\\", provided supporting evidence for the North Korean collation order, and requested addition of the North Korean hanja repertoire. These proposals were discussed in two meetings between North Korean, South Korean, Swedish and other WG2 representatives in September 2000, in which the North Korean body was asked to provide manuscript evidence for the additional jamo characters, to resubmit their symbols proposal with symbols which had already been accepted into Unicode removed, and to consider using ISO/IEC 14651, then at final draft stage, for collation purposes. In September 2001, the North Korean national body submitted a revised series of proposals requesting the addition of several KPS 9566 and KPS 10721 characters, including 70 symbol characters, to Unicode. In this version of the proposal, a section of document excerpts demonstrating use of several characters and short explanations of their purpose was included. The Workers' Party of Korea symbol was named the \\"Hammer and Sickle and Brush\\", renamed from \\"Mark of the Workers' Party of Korea\\" in earlier versions of the proposal, and justified as being used as an identifying symbol on maps. As justification for the proposed characters for leaders' names, they explained that the leaders' names often appear with a different size and font weight in North Korean publications for the purpose of emphasis. A follow-up by South Korean WG2 representatives requested evidence, names in Korean and justifications for adding certain of these characters, and noted that non- emphasised versions of the characters for the leaders' names already existed. A meeting of North and South Korean representatives from WG2 was convened in October 2001, which recommended 47 of the symbol characters for adding to Unicode, and suggested that the leaders' names and WPK symbols be raised for further discussion by WG2. A subsequent feedback document from February 2002 regarding the North Korean proposed additions requested that the \\"tea\\" symbol for a tea house be accepted as a more general \\"hot beverage\\" symbol, equating it with symbols used in guidebooks to denote hot or non-alcoholic beverages. It also recommended that the reference glyph for the existing codepoint for an umbrella without rain be modified to harmonise with the proposed reference glyph for the umbrella with rain, equating them to the \\"keep dry\\" symbols used on packaging, and raised the question of which lightning bolt and high voltage warning symbols in existing symbol collections could be unified with the proposed \\"high voltage\\" character. All three of these characters were accepted into Unicode in version 4.0. It also recommended that the horizontal-barred fractions and the left-up pointing scissors be encoded using a variation selector, since the scissors did not accompany a differently-oriented pair of scissors, and since the existing Unicode fraction codepoints unified the skewed and horizontal forms. In August 2004, a pair of mapping tables between KPS 9566-2003 and Unicode were submitted to the OpenOffice.org project by an individual using the name \\"ooprojlover\\", who stated that they represented the updated version of the KPS 9566 standard and requested that support be added. These files mapped the characters unavailable in Unicode to the Private Use Area, and included additional encoded forms for other syllable blocks outside of the main ISO-IR-202 plane. A mapping table was later published by the Unicode Consortium in 2011, based on this mapping data but with errors corrected with reference to the ISO-IR chart. Copies of Red Star OS 3.0 include fonts for a more recent edition of KPS 9566, appearing to be KPS 9566-2011. The mapping table used by Red Star OS internally has been successfully extracted. Besides adding Kim Jong-un to the list of leaders, KPS 9566-2011 amends the mappings of certain vertical forms compared to the 2003 mappings (taking advantage of the Vertical Forms block added in Unicode 4.1), and also includes several additional hanja and symbols encoded outside of the ISO-IR-202 plane. Several of these additional symbols are also mapped to the Private Use Area; however, their identity is not known, since no names or reference glyphs for those characters are known outside of North Korea. === Impact on Unicode today === Several current Unicode characters were added to Unicode 4.0 as a result of the North Korean proposals, although not always at the original proposed codepoints. These include HOT BEVERAGE (‚òï, proposed as TEA SYMBOL), which was proposed as a map symbol for marking a tea house, and the flag symbols WHITE FLAG (‚öê) and BLACK FLAG (‚öë), which were proposed as map symbols for sites of battles and military victories. These characters were proposed for the provisional code points U+270A, U+268E and U+268F respectively, but encoded at the final code points U+2615, U+2690 and U+2691 respectively. They also include a series of directional bold arrows in the range U+2B05 through U+2B0D, excluding a rightward arrow, which was mapped to an existing character in the Dingbats block, which were added at the same code points they were proposed for, besides the north-east and north-west arrows being swapped compared to the proposal. Other pictographic characters which were included in the North Korean proposal include the umbrella with raindrops (‚òî), the lightning bolt for high voltage (‚ö°) and the warning triangle (‚ö†). Following some discussion about which other high voltage symbol glyphs in use represented the same character as the one from the North Korean proposal, and which glyph would be best to include for it in the Unicode code chart, and following modification of the code chart glyph of the existing umbrella character without rain (U+2602, ‚òÇ) to harmonise with the new umbrella with raindrops from the North Korean proposal, these characters were also added in Unicode 4.0, at the same time as the flags and the beverage symbol. Although proposed for the provisional code points U+2618, U+267F and U+267E, they were given the final code points U+2614, U+26A1 and U+26A0 respectively. Of these characters, the hot beverage, umbrella with raindrops, lightning bolt and warning triangle, and the upward, downward and leftward arrows were subsequently selected as mappings from the Japanese cellular emoji sets, making a total of seven current Unicode emoji which were originally added to Unicode at the request of North Korea. The umbrella with raindrops and the upward, downward and leftward arrows were also unified with characters from the ARIB extensions used in Japanese broadcasting, which include several characters now classified as emoji, and was mapped to Unicode in Unicode 5.2. However, the pair of white and black flags used as emoji or in emoji regional and identity flag sequences is a different, \\"waving\\" set added in Unicode 7.0 (U+1F3F3 üè≥ and U+1F3F4 üè¥), not the North Korean pair. As of 2018, several KPS 9566 characters remained which are not mapped to Unicode. These include the WPK symbol, four triangular marks, a leftward-pointing pair of scissors (excluded on the rationale that contrastive use with the rightward scissors in the Dingbats block had not been demonstrated), an upward-pointing manicule in a circle, vertical presentation forms of punctuation marks, variants of closing brackets incorporating full stops, horizontal-barred variants of vulgar fractions encoded separately from their slanted versions, and the leaders' names. A Japanese postal mark with a downward pointing triangle was included in KPS 9566-97 but removed in KPS 9566-2003 after the North Korean body had withdrawn it from their Unicode proposal for review in response to requests from the South Korean body for evidence of the symbol's use in North Korea. This mark was re-proposed in 2018 on the basis of KPS 9566 compatibility, and identified as an electrical conformity mark used in Japan prior to its replacement by the PSE diamond. It was added to Unicode in version 13.0, published in 2020. == Encoded forms == The 1997 edition of KPS 9566 was registered with the International Register of Coded Character Sets for Use with Escape Sequences as ISO-IR-202, and can therefore be encoded using ISO/IEC 2022. It is a 94n multiple-byte G-set, i.e. if it is used in a 7-bit ISO 2022 code (analogous to ISO-2022-JP or ISO-2022-KR), characters will be encoded with pairs of bytes between 0x21 and 0x7E when in the appropriate mode. The documented mappings between KPS 9566 and Unicode for the 2003 and 2011 editions of KPS 9566 use an encoding resembling an adaptation of Unified Hangul Code (UHC) to encode KPS 9566 rather than Wansung code, with their updated versions of the ISO-IR-202 plane being encoded using pairs of bytes between 0xA1 and 0xFE, and with other two-byte codes used for syllables not present in ISO-IR-202. The order of the extended syllables follows usual KPS 9566 order. Similarly to UHC, they use lead bytes 0x81 and above, and trail bytes from the ranges 0x41-0x5A, 0x61-0x7A and 0x81-0xFE, excluding the range 0xA1-0xFE if the lead byte is 0xA1 or above. The 2011 edition also includes several additional hanja and symbols encoded outside of the ISO-IR-202 plane, after the range used for the extended syllable blocks. This approach is similar to that taken by GBK, but with the trail bytes remaining in the UHC- style ranges: like the extended syllables with lead bytes 0xA1 and above, these all use the trail byte ranges 0x41-0x5A, 0x61-0x7A and 0x81-0xA0. Extended hanja are encoded with lead bytes between 0xC8 and 0xDC, extended symbols are encoded using lead bytes between 0xE0 and 0xEA, and extended codes with lead bytes between 0xEC and 0xFE are mapped, without gaps, to the Private Use Area (compare the user-defined ranges in GBK). Several of the characters in the extended symbols section and three in the hanja section are also mapped to the Unicode Private Use Area; unlike the PUA-mapped symbols in the main ISO-IR-202 plane, the identity of these characters is not documented. == Lead byte == This chart details the overall layout of the main plane of the KPS 9566 character set by lead byte. For lead bytes used for characters other than composed chos≈èn'g≈≠l syllables or hanja, links are provided to charts on this page listing the characters encoded under that lead byte. For lead bytes used for hanja, links are provided to the appropriate section of Wiktionary's hanja index. Where two hexadecimal numbers are given, the value below 0x7F is used in a 7-bit encoding, and the larger value (between 0xA1 and 0xFE) is used in an 8-bit EUC-style encoding. The extended UHC-style 8-bit encodings defined by the 2003 edition onwards likewise use the larger byte values, between 0xA1 and 0xFE inclusive, for the main ISO-IR-202-based plane. { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 } == Non-Hanja, non-composed sets in the main plane  Character set 0x21/0xA1 (row number 1, punctuation and vertical forms) === This set contains common sentence punctuation such as brackets, quotation marks, commas and so forth, as well as presentation forms for use in vertical writing. ASCII punctuation (shown here with a heavy green border) is shown below mapped to Basic Latin codepoints (consistent with articles on other CJK character sets, such as KS X 1001 or JIS X 0208), but is mapped to the Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms block when used in an encoding which combines KPS 9566 with ASCII (as defined by, for example, the 2003 edition). Compared to the 2003 mapping, the 2011 mapping changes the Unicode mappings of three vertical presentation forms to take advantage of the Vertical Forms block introduced with Unicode 4.1. { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 } === Character set 0x22/0xA2 (row number 2, symbols and operators) === This set includes mathematical operators, and some other symbols such as the ampersand, pilcrow, musical note and so forth. ASCII punctuation (shown here with a heavy green border) is shown below mapped to Basic Latin codepoints (consistent with articles on other CJK character sets), but is mapped to the Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms block when used in an encoding which combines KPS 9566 with ASCII. Several triangular \\"road mark\\" symbols denoting upcoming mountains or inclines ahead or to one side are included in this row, but not presently included in Unicode. They are mapped to the Private Use Area. { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 } === Character set 0x23/0xA3 (row number 3, digits and Roman) === This set includes a subset of ASCII, minus punctuation and symbols, comprising western Arabic numerals and both cases of the Basic Latin alphabet. Compare row 3 of JIS X 0208, which this row exactly matches. Compare and contrast row 3 of KS X 1001 and GB 2312, which include their entire national variants of ISO 646 in this row, rather than only the alphanumeric subset. The characters in this row are shown below mapped to Basic Latin codepoints (consistent with articles on the other character sets), but is mapped to the Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms block when used in an encoding which combines KPS 9566 with ASCII. { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 } === Character set 0x24/0xA4 (row number 4, Chos≈èn'g≈≠l jamo and leaders' names) === This set contains Chos≈èn'g≈≠l jamo, as well as special encodings for the names of (as of 2003) the North Korean Leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. The name of Kim Jong-un is also included as of the 2011 edition. Compare with row 4 of KS X 1001. The jamo in this row which exist in the Unicode Hangul Compatibility Jamo block (which contains the position-independent characters mapped from KS X 1001) are mapped to that block. The obsolete jamo distinguishing palatised sibilants map to the position-specific characters in the Hangul Jamo block. Conversely, not all of the obsolete jamo encoded by KS X 1001 are encoded in the main plane of KPS 9566. In the 2011 edition of KPS 9566, the remainder of the historic jamo from KS X 1001 are included outside of the main plane, with the lead byte 0xEA. The special encodings of the leaders' names are not present in Unicode and are mapped to the Private Use Area. They are shown below simulated with markup. { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 } === Character set 0x25/0xA5 (row number 5, Cyrillic) === This set includes both cases of 33 letters from the Cyrillic script, sufficient to write the modern Russian alphabet and Bulgarian alphabet, although other forms of Cyrillic require additional letters. Compare row 12 of KS X 1001 and row 7 of JIS X 0208, which use the same layout (but in a different row). { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 } === Character set 0x26/0xA6 (row number 6, Greek letters and Roman numerals) === This set contains Roman numerals and basic support for the Greek alphabet, without diacritics or the final sigma. Compare and contrast row 5 of KS X 1001 (which uses the same characters but in a different layout and a different row) and row 6 of JIS X 0208 (which uses the same layout for the Greek letters, but without the Roman numerals). { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 } === Character set 0x27/0xA7 (row number 7, encircled, superscript, subscript, fractions) === Several circled numbers in this row were mapped to Unicode incorrectly in the 2003 edition, due to using non-final proposed code points. They were corrected in the 2011 edition. { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 } === Character set 0x28/0xA8 (row number 8, unit, quantity and currency symbols) === This set contains symbols for units of measure and currency. Those present in ASCII (shown here with a heavy green border) are shown below mapped to Basic Latin codepoints (consistent with articles on other CJK character sets), but are mapped to the Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms block when used in an encoding which combines KPS 9566 with ASCII. The Kelvin sign was replaced with a euro sign in the 2003 edition. The 2011 edition includes an alternative encoding of the Kelvin sign at 0xE988. { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 } === Character set 0x29/0xA9 (row number 9, box drawing) === { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 } === Character set 0x2A/0xAA (row number 10, Hiragana) === This row contains Hiragana for use in the Japanese language. Compare row 10 of KS X 1001, which uses the same layout. Compare and contrast row 4 of JIS X 0208, which also uses the same layout, but in a different row. { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 } === Character set 0x2B/0xAB (row number 11, Katakana) === This row contains Katakana for use in the Japanese language. However, the Japanese long vowel mark, which is used in katakana text and included in row 1 of JIS X 0208, is not included (similarly to with GB 2312 and KS X 1001), although it is included by KPS 9566-2011 outside of the main plane, at 0xEA48. Compare row 11 of KS X 1001, which uses the same layout. Compare and contrast row 5 of JIS X 0208, which also uses the same layout, but in a different row. { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 } === Character set 0x2C/0xAC (row number 12, miscellaneous symbols and arrows) === For the purpose of mapping this row to Unicode, the bold rightward arrow was unified with the bold rightward arrow from Zapf Dingbats (U+27A1). Since corresponding arrows in other directions were not included in the Dingbats block, additional arrows were encoded between U+2B05 and U+2B0D for compatibility with KPS 9566. These were incorporated into the Unicode code charts using the reference glyphs proposed by the North Korean national body, while U+27A1 retained its reference glyph based on Zapf Dingbats. These arrows (U+2B05 through U+2B07, plus U+27A1) were chosen in Unicode 6.0 as the mappings for the arrow characters in cellular emoji sets. Subsequently, during the addition of the Wingdings 3 repertoire in Unicode 7.0, the Unicode coverage of arrow characters was reviewed, resulting in an additional rightward arrow being added at U+2B95 with the intent of harmonising with characters U+2B05 through U+2B0D (in text presentation), since changing the reference glyph for the Zapf Dingbats character was not considered appropriate. In earlier editions of KPS 9566, such as the 1997 edition, this row included both the simple Japanese-style postal mark („Äí) and a version in a downward-pointing triangle, which was proposed by the North Korean national body for addition to Unicode alongside the other missing KPS 9566 characters. A response by a South Korean representative, amongst other requests, requested evidence for the symbol's use in North Korea, noting that the Japanese-style postal mark is not used in South Korea, which uses a circled Ïö∞ (i.e. „âæ) for a similar purpose, and enquiring whether a Japanese-style postal mark was in use in North Korea. A subsequent meeting was held to discuss this proposal, attended by North and South Korean WG2 representatives; the meeting report notes that the North Korean body had decided to review the character before discussing it further, and therefore did not recommend it for consideration by WG2 as a whole. The postal mark triangle was subsequently removed from KPS 9566 in 2003, leaving only the unenclosed postal mark. The postal mark triangle was eventually added to Unicode in version 13.0, both for compatibilty with the legacy KPS 9566-97 character, and subsequent to the mark being identified as a symbol which had been used for certification for electrical appliances in Japan (as a predecessor to the PSE diamond). Certain KPS 9566 characters in this row, namely two forms of the emblem of the Workers' Party of Korea, a pair of scissors pointing in a different direction to those in the Dingbats block, and a circled upward-pointing manicule, remain mapped to the Private Use Area. The north-east and north-west white arrows used incorrect swapped Unicode mappings in the 2003 edition. This was corrected in the 2011 edition mappings. { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 } === Character set 0x2D/0xAD (row number 13, empty) === { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 } === Character set 0x2E/0xAE (row number 14, Latin-1 subset) === The characters in this set were not present in the 1997 version of the character set, but were added in the 2003 version. They constitute a subset of the Latin-1 Supplement block of Unicode (equivalent to the upper half of the ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) character set). This includes accented Roman letters and symbols. Some of the symbols which were already included are omitted, while some others are duplicated as halfwidth counterparts to the earlier fullwidth forms: for example, the not sign (¬¨, U+00AC) is represented as 0xAEAC, while its fullwidth form (Ôø¢, U+FFE2) is represented as 0xA2D1 (in row 2). This row is omitted from the mapping for the 2011 edition of the standard, indicating it may have been removed at some point after the 2003 edition. The halfwidth yen sign is instead encoded at 0xE98E in the 2011 edition. The required space would fall outside of the 94-character range, colliding with the area used for extended chos≈èn'g≈≠l syllables when a UHC-style encoding is used (specifically, with the syllable ÏÅ≤), and is omitted. Although the y with trema also falls outside the 94-character range, and the trail byte 0xFF is otherwise unused, the code 0xAEFF is mapped to it in KPS 9566-2003. { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 } == Precomposed Chos≈èn'g≈≠l sets (rows number 16 through 44) == Precomposed Chos≈èn'g≈≠l syllable clusters are allocated code points in a continuous sorted block between code points 16-01 and 44-47 inclusive. Not all possible clusters are allocated code points. Compare the different ordering and availability in KS X 1001. The encoded form documented for KPS 9566-2003 encodes the KPS 9566 plane on GR (0xA1-0xFE) and additionally encodes the remaining syllable clusters using lead bytes in the range 0x80-0xC2 and trail bytes in the ranges 0x41-0x5A, 0x61-0x7A and 0x81-0xFE (where at most one byte is in the range 0xA1-0xFE), similarly to Unified Hangul Code but with the omitted clusters from and sorting order of KPS 9566, not KS X 1001. * Row 16: Í∞Ä Í∞Å Í∞Ñ Í∞á Í∞à Í∞â Í∞ä Í∞ê Í∞ë Í∞í Í∞ì Í∞ï Í∞ñ Í∞ó Í∞ô Í∞ö Í∞õ Í∞î Í∞∏ Í∞π Í∞º Í±Ä Í±à Í±ã Í±ç Í±∞ Í±± Í±¥ Í±∑ Í±∏ Í±π Í±∫ Í≤Ä Í≤Å Í≤É Í≤Ö Í≤Ü Í≤â Í≤ä Í≤ã Í≤Ñ Í≤®

This does not count 1948‚Äì49, when the DGA used a non-calendar award year (unlike the Academy Awards); both 1948 and 1949 DGA winners competed for the 1949 Academy Award for Best Director, which went to the 1948 DGA winner (Joseph L. Mankiewicz for A Letter to Three Wives). Conversely, eighteen times has the representing film directed by the DGA winner not gone on to win Best Picture, as recently as 2019 (for 1917). ==Winners and nominees== * ‚Ä† ‚Äì indicates the winner of the Academy Award for Best Director. * ‚Ä° ‚Äì indicates a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director. * ‚Ä†‚Ä† ‚Äì indicates the winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture. ===1940s=== {  width=\\"95%\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" - ! width=\\"8%\\"  Year ! width=\\"40%\\"  Winners and nominees ! width=\\"40%\\"  Film ! width=\\"2%\\"  -  rowspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1948 (1st)  FAEB86;\\"  Joseph L.

Varieties are developed to intensify specific characteristics of the plant, or to differentiate the strain for the purposes of marketing or to make it more effective as a drug. Variety names are typically chosen by their growers, and often reflect properties of the plant such as taste, color, smell, or the origin of the variety. The Cannabis strains referred to in this article are primarily those varieties with recreational and medicinal use. These varieties have been cultivated to contain a high percentage of cannabinoids. Several varieties of cannabis, known as hemp, have a very low cannabinoid content, and are instead grown for their fiber and seed. == Major variety types Taxonomic paradigm=== The two species of the Cannabis genus that are most commonly grown are Cannabis indica and Cannabis sativa. A third species, Cannabis ruderalis, is very short and produces only trace amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and thus is not commonly grown for industrial, recreational or medicinal use. However, because Cannabis ruderalis flowers independently of the photoperiod and according to age, it has been used to breed autoflowering strains. Pure sativas are relatively tall (reaching as high as 4.5 meters), with long internodes and branches, and large, narrow-bladed leaves. Pure indica varieties are shorter and bushier, with wider leaflets. They are often favored by indoor growers for their size. Sativas bloom later than indicas, often taking a month or two longer to mature. The subjective effects of sativas and indicas are said to differ, but the ratio of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to cannabidiol (CBD) in most named drug varieties of both types is similar (averaging about 200:1). Unlike most commercially developed strains, indica landraces exhibit plants with varying THC/CBD ratios. Avidekel, a medical marijuana strain developed in Israel, has a very low content of THC but a high content of CBD, limiting its recreational value but maximizing medical effect. Sativa is known for being a more of a 'head high', energizing strain where psychoactivity is more common, whereas indica, is known for being more of a 'body high' that helps pain and is also used as a sedative. The informal designation sativa and indica may have various, controversial meanings. Morphologically, the name sativa designates tall plants with narrow leaves, while indica refers to short plants with wide leaves. Among the marijuana community however, sativa rather refers to equatorial varieties producing stimulating psychoactive effects (THC:CBD [almost equal to] 1), whereas indica-type plants from Central Asia are used for relaxing and sedative drugs (THC:CBD > 1) [8]. File:Cannabis_indica.jpgCannabis indica File:Cannabis ruderalis habitus.jpgCannabis ruderalis Image:Cannabis sativa 001.JPGCannabis sativa File:Cannab2 new.pngRelative size of cannabis types ===Alternative classifications=== There is an increasing discussion about whether the differences between species adequately represents the variability found within the genus cannabis. There are five chemotaxonomic types of cannabis: one with high levels of THC, one which is more fibrous and has higher levels of CBD, one that is an intermediate between the two, another one with high levels of cannabigerol (CBG), and the last one almost without cannabinoids. There has also been a recent movement to characterize strains based on their reported subjective effects. For example, WoahStork has used machine learning algorithms to classify strains into six Distinct Activity groups. ==Breeding== White Widow In addition to pure indica, sativa, and ruderalis varieties, hybrid varieties with varying ratios of these three types are common. For example, the White Widow hybrid containing about 60% indica and 40% sativa ancestry. These hybrid varieties exhibit traits from both parental types. There are also commercial crossbred hybrids which contain a mix of both ruderalis, indica or sativa genes, and are usually autoflowering varieties. These varieties are bred mostly for the medicinal cannabis market, since they are not very appreciated by recreational cannabis users because ruderalis varieties are lower in THC and impart a slightly unpleasant taste. \\"Lowryder\\" was an early auto-flowering hybrid that retained the flowering behavior of ruderalis plants, while also producing appreciable amounts of THC and CBD. Autoflowering cannabis varieties have the advantage of being discreet due to their small stature. They also require shorter growing periods, as well as having the additional advantage that they do not rely on a change in the photoperiod to determine when to flower. Breeding requires pollinating a female cannabis plant with male pollen. Although this occurs spontaneously and ubiquitously in nature, the intentional creation of new varieties typically involves selective breeding in a controlled environment. A flowering cannabis plant When cannabis is cultivated for its psychoactive or medicinal properties, male plants will often be separated from females. This prevents fertilization of the female plants, either to facilitate sin semilla flowering or to provide more control over which male is chosen. Pollen produced by the male is caught and stored until it is needed. When a male plant of one strain pollinates a female of another strain, the seeds will be F1 hybrids of the male and female. These offspring will not be identical to their parents. Instead, they will have characteristics of both parents. Repeated breeding results in certain characteristics appearing with greater regularity. It is impossible for a hermaphrodite to create any male-only seeds. A hermaphrodite may create female only seeds and hermaphrodite seeds. Also the female-only seeds may carry the hermaphrodite trait. Hybridization is the process of plants and animals breeding. Natural wind currents help speed up this hybridization process and promotes a positive growth. Some plants produce many seeds while some produce little to none depending on how it is bred. If seeds are produced traits from both the original parents will be expressed. Techniques such as mutation breeding are used to develop new strains using irradiation or chemical mutagens such as colchicine. === THC vs. CBD === During the selective breeding process for medical marijuana, THC:CBD ratios are accounted for and accommodated to the needs of the client's preference/illness. Due to the large genetic diversity and different geographical climates and environments, a wide range of strains and properties exist. THC is associated with the psychoactive high, while CBD is not psychoactive and is purported to have medicinal properties. There is little evidence about the safety or efficacy of cannabinoids in the treatment of epilepsy. === Genetic stability === In order for there to be genetic stability within a marijuana strain the breeder has to go through selection and breeding, pinpointing the dominant and recessive genes within the two strains being crossed. After analyzing offspring with the preferred traits a breeder is looking for, the breeder will select the preferred traits and continue to breed those offspring to create the desired final product. Selection is a crucial process for a breeder to create a strain, especially if a client is looking for something with specific plant traits the breeder has to ensure that the hybrid's genetic traits have been closed in enough so unwanted traits aren't expressed in future harvests. ===Varieties=== In a retail market that is decriminalized such as in The Netherlands, where wholesale production is illegal but prosecutions are not always enforced because of the contradiction of the law that is recognised by the courts, competition puts pressure on breeders to create increasingly attractive varieties to maintain market share. Breeders give their strains distinct and memorable names in order to help differentiate them from their competitors' strains, although they may in fact be very similar. Popular strains are incorporated into new hybrids, which often bear a similar name to their parent. This phenomenon has occurred with Haze and Sour varieties, among others. Acapulco Gold Acapulco Gold is a golden-leafed Cannabis sativa strain originally from the Acapulco area of southwest Mexico. Bedrocan Bedrocan is a medicinal cannabis variety cultivated from a Dutch medical marijuana Cannabis sativa L. strain, having a standardized content of THC (22%) and CBD (1%). It is currently cultivated by Bedrocan Nederland, Bedrocan Canada and Bedrocan ƒåesk√° Republika. It was first introduced in 2003 and is dispensed through pharmacies after prescription from a physician. Blue Dream Blue dream Blue Dream is a hybrid cannabis strain widely used for both medical and recreational purposes first developed in 2003.  Charlotte's Web  Charlotte's Web is a high-cannabidiol (CBD), low-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) cannabis variety and extract marketed as a dietary supplement under federal law of the United States. It is produced by the Stanley brothers in Colorado. It does not induce the psychoactive \\"high\\" typically associated with recreational marijuana strains that are high in THC. In September 2014, the Stanleys announced that they would ensure that the product consistently contained less than 0.3% THC. Charlotte's Web gained national attention when it was used to treat Charlotte Figi's epileptic seizures. See full CNN video. CNN's main page. See full CNN video.

Skunk Skunk refers to cannabis strains that are strong-smelling and have been likened to the smell of the spray from a skunk. These strains of cannabis are believed to have originated during the early 1990s in the United States prior to larger- scale development and popularization by Dutch growers. Just as with other strains of cannabis, skunk is commonly grown in controlled indoor environments under specialized grow lights, or in a greenhouse when full outdoor conditions are not suitable; skunk strains are hybrids of Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica.  Sour Diesel  Sour Diesel Sour Diesel is a hybrid strain of Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica. Tom Cruise Purple Tom Cruise Purple is a strain of cannabis sold in California by select licensed cannabis clubs. The strain is potent, and is packaged with a picture of the actor Tom Cruise laughing. Tom Cruise Purple is sold by cannabis suppliers in Northern California. Cruise sought out legal advice regarding the product, and considered a lawsuit against its manufacturers. ==See also== * Autoflowering cannabis ==References External links == * Category:Cannabis-related lists ","title":"Cannabis strain"},{"id":"20481929","text":"The 1927 Football Association Charity Shield was the 14th FA Charity Shield, an annual English association football match. The match, held at Stamford Bridge on 12 October 1927, was contested by Cardiff City, who beat Arsenal in the final of the 1926‚Äì27 FA Cup, and amateur side Corinthian. This was the first FA Charity Shield appearance for both sides, although Corinthian had previous won the Sheriff of London Charity Shield on three occasions. After a goalless first half, Corinthian went ahead early in the second half with a goal from Gilbert Ashton. There were many attacks from both sides, but it took until the 77th minute before Cardiff equalised with a header by Hughie Ferguson after a series of passing plays. With only a few minutes remaining on the clock, Cardiff won a corner kick and from the cross, and Len Davies tapped the ball into the net to put them ahead. The game finished with the score two goals to one in Cardiff City's favour. Several charities benefited from the proceeds of the match, including the King Edward VII's Hospital for Officers and the National Institute for the Blind. ==Background== The FA Charity Shield was founded in 1908 as a successor to the Sheriff of London Charity Shield. It was a contest between the respective champions of the Football League and Southern League, and then by 1913 teams of amateur and professional players. At a Football Association Council meeting on 22 April 1927, it was decided that the following season's Charity Shield match should be played between the winner of the 1926‚Äì27 FA Cup and the amateur team Corinthians. This would mark the first occasion Corinthians would play in the competition, they had previously won the Sheriff of London Charity Shield on four occasions. Cardiff City qualified for the 1927 FA Charity Shield as winners of the 1926‚Äì27 FA Cup. They defeated Arsenal by one goal to nil, with the only goal of the game coming from Hughie Ferguson. It was the club's first FA Cup victory, and the only time that the trophy had been won by a club outside of England. A few months after Cardiff's victory, the match between them and Corinthians for the FA Charity Shield was set to take place at Stamford Bridge on 12 October. Corinthian announced their team a few days prior to the game, though goalkeeper Benjamin Howard Baker was subsequently replaced by A.M. Russell, who normally played for Cambridge University A.F.C.. Due to an injury to Tom Watson, Billy Hardy was switched to the other wing in defence for Cardiff City. ==MatchSummary=== The Corinthians gained a corner kick early on, and Cardiff cleared. This was followed up by a further attack by the amateurs, but R.G. Jenkins' shot went straight to Tom Farquharson in the Cardiff goal. Cardiff attacked twice in quick succession; both chances were squandered. A.H. Chadder, Frank Hartley and Jenkins moved up-field for Corinthian with some passing movement and played the ball through for Claude Ashton, but he shot wide of the post. Three corners followed for Cardiff, which were each stopped by Russell in goal for Corinthian stopped each chance. A few minutes later Len Davies headed the ball down to the feet of Ferguson, but the Cardiff player fired the ball wide of the goal despite being only a few feet away from the goal line. Just before half time, Cardiff won a direct free kick; Fred Keenor hammered the ball into a wall of Corinthian players. The second half began with a speedy Cardiff attack. Corinthian countered, resulting in shots from both Claude and Gilbert Ashton within 15 seconds of each other. Another Cardiff attack resulted in Ferguson missing the goal from a few feet out once again. After four minutes in the second half, Corinthians attacked once more. Fred Ewer played it down the left wing to Kenneth Hegan, who passed it into the centre towards Gilbert Ashton, who fired it past Farquharson. Shortly after the restart, Billy Thirlaway appeared to be about to score a certain goal for Cardiff, but was charged down by Russell. Further chances came in rapid succession; for Cardiff, Ferguson struck the crossbar with one shot; then for Corinthian, Claude Ashton passed forward to Jenkins, who struck it wide of an open goal mouth. Hegan sent the ball over the bar, and then a further shot by Claude Ashton was charged down. In the 77th minute, Keenor, Ferguson and Davies passed the ball among themselves before playing it wide to Thirlaway. Ferguson ran to the centre and the ball was crossed towards him. Ferguson leapt and headed the ball into the net to equalise for Cardiff. It looked like Cardiff were about to go ahead, however, a last minute tackle by Alfred Bower prevented Ernie Curtis from scoring, giving the Welsh team another corner. The ball was fired towards the goal mouth, and was shot into the goal from close range by Davies putting Cardiff ahead. The final two attacks of the game were both by Cardiff, with Russell saving a header by Ferguson and then Curtis firing the ball over the crossbar. ===Details=== { width=92%  -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"200\\" !! - GK  Tom Farquharson - DF  James Nelson - DF  Billy Hardy - MF  Fred Keenor (c) - MF  George Blackburn - MF  Sam Irving - FW  Ernie Curtis - FW  George McLachlan - FW  Hughie Ferguson - FR  Len Davies - FL  Billy Thirlaway - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\" Fred Stewart } valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=center colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"200\\" - GK  A.M.

King Edward VII's Hospital for Officers received ¬£210; National Institute for the Blind, ¬£52 10s; Newspaper Press Fund, ¬£52 10s; National Institute of Journalist's Orphans, ¬£52 10s; London Lock Hospital, ¬£52 10s; Prince of Wales General Hospital, ¬£52 10s; Sheffield Royal Infirmary, ¬£52 10s; Railway Benevolent Institution, ¬£25; and the Surgical Aid Society received ¬£25. A further sum of ¬£210 was given to several Welsh based charities. Corinthian never played in another FA Charity Shield, although they would later be runner-up in a resurrected Sheriff of London's Charity Shield, first to Arsenal in 1931 and in 1932, and then to Tottenham Hotspur in 1934. The club ceased to exist in 1939, when they merged with fellow amateur team Casuals to form the Corinthian-Casuals, which still plays today. The format of the FA Charity Shield changed several further times over the following decades, and in 1974 it was moved to August to become the opening match of each year's Football League season, and played between the winner of the FA Cup and the most senior league, now the Premier League. Cardiff City is yet to return to the FA Charity Shield, which was renamed the FA Community Shield in 2002. However, between 2001 and 2006, the match was held at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium while the new Wembley Stadium was under construction. The closest Cardiff City has come so far to returning to the match was in 2008 when they reached the FA Cup Final once more, but lost by a goal to nil against Portsmouth. ==See also== *1927‚Äì28 Football League *1927‚Äì28 FA Cup ==References== Category:FA Community Shield Comm Charity Shield 1927 Category:1927‚Äì28 in Welsh football FA Charity Shield Category:October 1927 sports events ","title":"1927 FA Charity Shield"},{"id":"20481940","text":"Adventures in Perception is a 1971 Dutch short documentary film directed by Han Van Gelder.

It was designed and built by British aircraft manufacturer Westland Aircraft for the Air Ministry. Only a single aircraft was built and it crashed on its initial flight, badly injuring the test pilot. ==Design and development== The Dreadnought was distinct for its futuristic design and method of construction, based on the theories of the Russian inventor N. Woyevodsky. After preliminary tests of the idea were tried in a wind tunnel and met with some degree of success, the design was given to Westland Aircraft to construct an aircraft. The design at the time was for a 70 ft wingspan twin-engine aircraft. The design was aerodynamically advanced, featuring a continuous aerofoil section over all parts of the aircraft, including the fuselage and unusually for British aircraft at that time, had no form of wing bracing. Construction was all-metal, comprising drawn channeling with a skin of corrugated sheet panels. The method may be compared to the modern stressed skin construction. Although conceived as a twin-engined type with retractable undercarriage, the design that emerged was fitted with a 450-horsepower Napier Lion II 12 cylinder engine that allowed the Dreadnought speeds of up to 102 miles per hour and fixed undercarriage.\\"Dreadnought.\\" aviationarchive.org.

During her work at the institute for Fiscal Studies she frequently published research with Carl Emmerson, Rowena Crawford, and Gemma Tetlow. Her work with the Institute covered economic reforms to the UK's state pension, the UK Government's fiscal policies, economic analyses of health variations in the UK and US, and a variety of other topics. Throughout her research papers she aimed to tell a story, moving from previous literature into how her work will either change what was previously thought, or expand upon what was previously thought. Her final report with the Institute for Fiscal Studies was published on May 22, 2015. === The Economist === Keynes joined The Economist in June 2015 after receiving an email from the magazine's economics editor asking her to apply for the position. She began by writing the Free Exchange column, which provides a literature review of recent papers in economics. Her first article with the column, Public Debt - How Much is Too Much, was published June 3, 2015. She was promoted to US economics and trade editor in June 2018, and in 2019 became the trade and globalization editor at The Economist. Keynes has worked on multiple projects during her time with The Economist. Her early work had a wide scope and covered a variety of topics, such as the Big Mac Index. Her latest work has mostly focused on the United States Trade War under the Trump Administration.

Much of her work on the podcast is in the same areas as her writing, focused on trade and the Donald Trump presidency. She has also done episodes in a similar vein to her previous work with the Institute for Fiscal Studies, examining the impact of economic research on public policy. During her work with The Economist she has expressed multiple personal opinions on the material she covers. She has repeatedly stated that she feels Trump is damaging the economy through acting in an unpredictable manner. Keynes supports a rules based system for international trade, through bodies like the World Trade Organization, to resolve any discrepancies and disputes between countries. Keynes' work, during her time with The Economist, is not restricted to solely their events and publications. She has written for a variety of newspapers and magazines, such as Prospect magazine.

The big change was a shift from the multi-tier pension system to the single-tier pension system, creating a simpler flat-rate.O'Grady, Sarah. \\"Millions of young workers will lose up to ¬£2,300 a year with new flat-rate pension\\". Express Online, July 11, 2013 Thursday. https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id;=urn:contentItem:58W4-JTD1-DXDT-650R-00000-00&context;=1516831. Accessed November 23, 2019. The pension would pay only one amount, ¬£144, per week, meaning that high income earners, who contribute more, will get the same pension as low income earners.Paterson, Jennifer. \\"Most retirees will receive less than the single-tier pension\\". Employee Benefits, July 11, 2013 Thursday. https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id;=urn:contentItem:58W4-4X21-JDJ4-M1SK-00000-00&context;=1516831. Accessed November 24, 2019. The paper analyzes both the short and long-run impacts of this change as well as the winners and losers of the change. By comparing people's income under the previous system to their income under the new system the paper finds that in the short run there will be some winners. Women who will reach pension age in the first four years of the new system being implemented will receive greater benefit. This benefit is furthered for those who took time out of the workforce to care for children or disabled adults. The biggest winners of the new pension system would be those who spent an extended amount of time away from the workforce, those who did low paying work, and those who have been self employed for an extended period.Selby, Tom. \\"Who are the winners and losers in state pension shake-up?\\". Money Marketing, July 11, 2013. https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id;=urn:contentItem:58W4-4X21-JDJ4-M1VD-00000-00&context;=1516831. Accessed November 24, 2019. Low income earners in the bottom quintile would see an average rise in weekly pension income of ¬£3.97. While there are short- term winners the changes ultimately lead those who are soon reaching retirement age to have mixed results, with 35% of men receiving gains and 61% of women. These findings differ dramatically from the numbers published by the Department for Work and Pensions in 2015, which state that 70% of men and 75% of women will benefit from the single-tier pension. The paper finds, significantly, that only 17% of those closest to retirement will actually receive a pension that is the single tier entitlement. Some 23% of earners will receive pensions worth more than the single tier amount while 61% will receive pensions that are less than the single-tier amount. Keynes stated that despite the system not being entirely a single payout it would allow for greater ease in predicting future pension payments. The report finds that in the long run there are significantly more losers than winners. Firstly, those who have previously claimed the second state pension will receive less. The largest losers, however, are young people and high income earners. A high- income earner who is going to work for 35 years will lose up to ¬£2,300 in pension money under the new system compared to what they would have received under the old system. A low-income earner who plans to work for a further 35 years will experience losses of ¬£1,000. The report finds that the system, while incurring loses for future pensioners in the United Kingdom, does have reason to cut back. The aging population will lead to increased spending on pensions over the next 50 years, public pension expenses as a percentage of national income would rise from 5.4% in 2012 to 9.1% in 2062 if the current two-tiered system is maintained. Switching to the one-tier system reduces the long-run spending to 8.4% of national income in 2062. === Post-election Austerity: Parties' Plans Compared === Much of Keynes' work at the Institute for Fiscal Studies revolved around current political affairs. She published research alongside fellow Institute for Fiscal Studies researchers Rowena Crawford, Carl Emmerson, and Gemma Tetlow in the lead up to the 2015 United Kingdom General Election.Crawford, Rowena, Carl Emmerson, Soumaya Keynes, and Gemma Tetlow. \\"Post-election austerity: Parties‚Äô plans compared.\\" Institute for Fiscal Studies Briefing Note 170 (2015). The research examined the fiscal spending and borrowing plans of each of the United Kingdom's major political parties.Sandilands, Roger, and Fred Harrison. \\"Black Holes & Pots of Gold.\\" SLRG Bulletin 2 (2015). They projected, for the course of the next government's term, what net borrowing and net spending of public funds would be. Overall the researchers faced difficulties in trying to determine the true intentions of the parties, as not all were forthcoming with their full spending and borrowing plans. Ultimately the researchers had to estimate multiple pieces of parties' plans in order to determine the real numbers that would be used by the next government. David Cameron's conservative party had not stated what level of public borrowing they were aiming to achieve, but they had outlined specific plans for public spending. The researchers were able to determine that if a Conservative government was elected the public spending would fall by 5.2% of national income between 2014 and 2019. A surplus of 0.2% of national income would arise in the final year, 2019. They, also, determined that the conservative plan would result in slightly less than a ¬£4 billion tax cut in the UK, when they factor in anti-avoidance measures a net tax increase of ¬£1 billion would occur. Furthermore, they found the Conservatives would rapidly raise the retirement age after getting elected. Ed Miliband's Labour Party had, like the conservative party, released limited information on how much public borrowing they intended to carry out as government. This meant the researchers were forced to make a few key assumptions. They assumed labour would maintain the current government spending plan in place until 2016, and then they would freeze the government's unprotected departments and balance the budget by 2019. Based on Labour's plan and these assumptions they determined a Labour government would have borrowing fall by 3.6% from 2015 to 2019, ultimately reaching 1.4% of national income in 2019. They determined debt would rise in 2016-2017 and labour would have a ¬£6 billion tax rise, that increases to ¬£12 billion when anti-avoidance measures are factored in. Their research also covered the policies of the Scottish National Party (SNP) and Liberal-Democrats. They found the Liberal-Democrats to be the most transparent party and determined their plan would lead to net borrowing dropping by 3.9% of national income until 2018, at which point it would reach 1.1% of national income. When factoring in anti-avoidance measures they would have a ¬£12 billion tax rise. The SNP would have borrowing drop by 3.9% until 2020, ultimately reaching 1.4% of national income that year. The SNP's plan would be revenue neutral on its taxation, and has factored in anti- avoidance measures. When the conservative party won the 2015 general election this research proved valuable for others who sought to examine the impacts of their plans over the course of the coming years. Allowed for research after the election to focus on the personal allowance for income tax, the UK's retirement age, and the effect of reduced spending on public services. === Women and Economics - Inefficient Equilibrium === Keynes has, throughout her years as an economist and especially throughout her time at The Economist, focused on women in economics, and why there are so few of them.NPR Planet Money, May 3, 2019 Friday. https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id;=urn:contentItem:5W1R-PXX1-JBJH-32R0-00000-00&context;=1516831. Accessed November 23, 2019. She has done multiple podcasts on the topic, including a three-part special for the BBC, she has given a TED Talk and a talk at Yale University about the issue, and, most notably, wrote a special in the 2017 Economist's Christmas Specials publication titled Women in Economics - Inefficient Equilibrium. The piece focuses on the disparity between men and women in the field of research economics and why this matters for the profession. The article was influential in encouraging other economists to examine the issue. Keynes highlights that only 20% of European, and 15% of American, senior economists are female. This trend is unique to economics, most other disciplines in the social sciences are closer to gender parity. The issue begins with less women going into economics at the undergraduate level, and women being more skeptical of economics when they do enter the field. There are 2.9 men for every woman in undergraduate economics programs worldwide. Furthermore, women are much more likely to drop out than their male counterparts along the path to a tenure track position. A male student that earns a B in their first undergraduate class is much less likely to drop out than a female student. The issue continues when women are working to achieve tenure positions at universities. Women are promoted to tenure at a much lower rate than men, 29% compared to 56%. This occurs for a variety of reasons. Women need to publish more papers than their male counterparts to have the same chance at tenure promotions. Women are published less often than men, it's argued this is in part due to women going into fields of economics that would be less familiar to the editors of major papers (who are usually men) and therefore less likely to be published. Furthermore, when women are published they face a higher bar than men. Co-authoring a paper leads to an 8% increase in a man's likelihood of promotion, whereas only a 2% increase for a woman. This is partially because the names of authors on economics papers appear in alphabetical order, rather than in order of workload. Another barrier to tenure for women in economics is student evaluations. Student evaluations have been shown to discriminate against women, leading to greater difficulty in achieving tenure. Keynes argues that this is an issue as men and women approach economics differently, so losing one half means that economics cannot operate as well as it should. She highlights that women are more open to programs involving income redistribution than men, meaning that only having men as economists means there is not a representative sample. She argues that the gap between male and female economists, which is currently growing, must shrink in order to solve this issue. Keynes states this won't be easy, economics has an image problem, seen as a mostly male field. Furthermore, women won't feel they belong until more women are in economic faculty positions, but this can't happen until more women join economics; both must precede the other. After Keynes published her work in 2017 further research published in 2019 backed up what she had reported. == Other activities == * Keynes is a soprano with the 18th Street Singers. == References == Category:The Economist people Category:Living people Category:1989 births Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge Category:British women economists Category:English people of Turkish descent Category:English people of Iranian descent Category:English people of Lebanese descent ","title":"Soumaya Keynes"},{"id":"20482048","text":"Peter Roderick Procter (born 16 January 1930 in Bradford, West Yorkshire) is a British former cycling champion, rally driver and racing driver. Shortly after his birth he moved to Harrogate, and then to Alne Hall in the village of Alne, near York. Following the premature death of his parents, he moved back to Bradford, where he took up cycling. Procter competed in all types of cycle racing at home and on the Continent, but excelled in hill climbs, winning the British championship in 1951. After becoming disillusioned with the UK cycling, and after the British Olympic Committee failed to select both him and other top cyclists of the time to represent Great Britain in the Olympics, Procter dropped out of professional cycling to concentrate on his building company in Bradford. He was soon involved in rallying. He competed in events including the RAC Rally, Tulip Rally, Coupe des Alpes (Alpine Rally), Tour de France Automobile and Monte Carlo Rally. Procter also competed in the Le Mans 24 Heures race several times, and raced in many Grands Prix, his highest position second in the Berlin Grand Prix. Procter's racing career ended in 1966 when he was hit from behind in a saloon car race at Goodwood. After several somersaults, the car burst into flames and Procter was left with third degree burns to 65 per cent of his skin. After many months of treatment and operations, he left hospital and returned home to Yorkshire, where he lives with his wife and family. Procter has returned to driving a few times, including racing his original Sunbeam Tiger at the Le Mans Historic in 2002, and is still involved in motorsport, a member of the British Racing Drivers Club at Silverstone. ==References== *Tigers United Category:1930 births Category:Living people Category:Cyclists from Yorkshire Category:English racing drivers Category:English rally drivers Category:British cycling road race champions Category:Sportspeople from Bradford Category:24 Hours of Le Mans drivers Category:World Sportscar Championship drivers ","title":"Peter Procter"},{"id":"20482085","text":"The Numbers Start with the River is a 1971 American short documentary film about smalltown life in Iowa.

Compared to microcode, another popular design technique, random logic offers faster execution of processor opcodes, provided that processor speeds are faster than memory speeds. A disadvantage is that it is difficult to design random logic circuitry for processors with large and complex instruction sets.

It is Grade II* listed. ==History== The new City Hall saw the demolition in Norwich of Tudor, Regency and Victorian buildings on St Peters Street and the Market Place, including many yards and dilapidated municipal buildings. The architects Charles Holloway James and Stephen Rowland Pierce, designed the building after Robert Atkinson had prepared a layout for the whole Civic Centre site at the request of Norwich Corporation (now the City Council). A competition took place in 1931 which attracted 143 entries, with Atkinson as the sole judge. After the winning design was chosen the Depression and a protracted planning process delayed the start of the building, and the foundation stone was not laid until 1936.Architectural Review, November 1938 Norwich City Hall was officially opened by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth on 29 October 1938.Official opening brochure, 29 October 1938 ==Architecture== Alfred Hardiman. The architects designed for Norwich an Art Deco public building of national significance. It was built to the highest standards, using superior materials and methods of its day. Even the bricks were specially made, each one being two inches longer than usual to better reflect the proportions of the finished building. Charles Holloway James and Stephen Rowland Pierce engaged Alfred Hardiman as their consultant sculptor.Eastern Daily Press 21 October 1937 He contributed the iconic lions passant which guard the building, and three figures of Recreation, Wisdom and Education outside the Council Chamber. His colleague James Woodford designed the six main bronze doors, incorporating 18 roundels showing the history and industry of Norwich. Eric Aumonier carved the city arms above the Regalia Room window on Bethel Street, and Margaret Calkin James provided textiles for some of the important rooms. The materials used include Italian marble and English stone, Honduras mahogany and Australian walnut. Seating is upholstered in Moroccan leather, and rooms panelled in elm, oak, teak and birch. The Lord Mayor‚Äôs octagonal parlour is panelled in sycamore with French walnut trim, with the door finished in English walnut.

A first- inning run scored by Willie Mays on a single, an errant pickoff attempt, a wild pitch by Luis Tiant and a double-play ball gave the winning National league the only run they would need. Don Wert's eighth-inning double momentarily gave the AL a threat to tie the game, but Seaver struck out the side.

The company was located near Van Nuys, California and established in 1972. consequently reaching the public eye through studio musicians like Dann Huff, Michael Landau, and Neil Stubenhaus. The company is known for creating custom high end quality guitars, with an unusual headstock, and guitar body finishes with names like \\"psychedelic vomit\\", \\"burning water\\", and \\"caramel cappuccino shmear\\". ==History== During the 1980s the company did primarily repairs and modifications of guitars, but built some custom guitars based on parts from other manufacturers such as Kramer for the Los Angeles studio musicians Dean Parks, Michael Landau and Dann Huff. In 1987 the first production model was released called the \\"Studio Elite\\", a hot-rodded Fender Stratocaster The woodwork was done by hand and it featured a \\"hockey paddle\\" headstock, which was used to ensure that the company does not infringe on Fender Musical Instruments Corporation's trademark headstock design. Additional standard features include a Demeter mid-boost circuit with a gain control and a preset switch and a neck finish designed to look like it has been worn-in through years of use even though it is brand new, similar to what Music Man did with their Eddie Van Halen signature model guitars. The Studio Elite model is featured on Guitarist magazine's list of \\"50 guitars to play before you die\\". Wayne Krantz plays his Studio Elite in Chicago, 2012Their second model, the \\"Ultimate Weapon\\" (available with two or three humbuckers and a Floyd Rose locking tremolo), was introduced in 1993 and was also based on the Fender Stratocaster but with a redesigned appearance. The latest incarnation of the guitar, the \\"Ultimate Weapon HD\\", introduced in 2007, came with a pickguard, an H/S/S pickup layout and a Wilkinson vibrato. Tyler describes this model as \\"a Studio Elite wearing an Ultimate Weapon suit.\\" In 2006 they introduced two models named Mongoose and Mongoose Retro, the former leaning towards Gibson- style design, while the latter is more of a Fender-design, both being \\"a sort of Les Paul-meets-Telecaster\\" and taking over for the Telecaster-styled Tylerbastar line. By now the manufacturing process had also started to utilize a Fadal digital CNC machine for routing the guitar bodies, allowing for additional optional features like a hollow body. The company now also winds their own pickups, while earlier they used standard and custom pickups from manufacturers like Seymour Duncan, DiMarzio, Lindy Fralin, Tom Anderson and John Suhr. The company's first original finish was created in 1991 for Michael Landau as a joke that Tyler has commented \\"unfortunately, the world took it seriously\\". It got named \\"psychedelic vomit\\", and Jordan McLachlan of Guitarist magazine described it as \\"completely mad and random\\". The second finish was created in 1993, again for Michael Landau, and was named \\"burning water\\", and is a combination of different colours which Neville Marten described as \\"a mass of swirls in different metallic colours\\". In 1998 the first \\"shmear\\" finish was created, a paint job that uses layers of different kinds of paint and takes about a week to finish. In 2008 the company released a series of guitars using the brand \\"Joe\\" and only made them available to the Japanese market. These guitars are a more minimal version of the Studio Elite and the Strat-style Classic models. A Tyler-designed series of Line 6's Variax line of guitars was announced in the spring of 2010. The company also produced a limited number of custom-built bass guitars between 1992 and 2006, used for instance by David Hungate and Neil Stubenhaus. In 2011 Tyler Guitars relocated their operation and offices to a new facility in San Fernando Valley. In 2014 James Tyler partnered with Japanese distributor Daisuke Kitahara to manufacture affordable versions of their popular models in Japan before establishing Tyler Guitars Japan two years later. == Models == * Studio Elite * Ultimate Weapon * Mongoose * Tylerbastar * Classic == Artists == Some musicians who use/have used Tyler guitars are:Artists on Tyler website, 15 Oct 2019 * Abraham Laboriel * Dann Huff * David Williams * David Hungate * Dean Parks * Elvis Costello * Glenn Pearce * George Lynch * Jake E.

Date of origin in official game rules from Ravensburger (in German language) It is a non-circular descendant of the ancient Indian board game Pachisi. ==Etymology== The name of the game borrows the obsolete German word Malefiz, meaning \\"misdeed\\" or \\"bad action\\". The word was derived from the Latin word maleficus, meaning \\"mischievous\\" or \\"profane\\". ==Setup== Malefiz requires the following items: * 1 gameboard * 20 pawns (5 in each of 4 player colours) * 11 barricade pieces * 1 die At the outset, each player's pawns are placed in their respective five- space houses, typically located along the bottom of the board. Barricade pieces are placed in each of eleven specially marked spaces on the board. ==Gameplay== First play may be determined by a die-roll or another manner of the players' choosing. At the beginning of each turn, the active player rolls the die. That player selects one of her five pawns and moves it a number of steps equal to the number shown on the die. That pawn may begin traveling in any direction and may turn to continue through corners in the path, but it may not double-back along its course, and it may not forgo any steps. The spaces within the players' houses are not counted against the die-roll; the first space counted by any pawn is the space immediately above the house. During the course of a move, a pawn may pass other pawns (regardless of colour) with no effect. In the event that a pawn finishes its move by landing on a space occupied by another pawn, the pawn occupying that space is captured. Captured pawns are returned to their respective houses and become available to rejoin play upon their owner's next turn. Unlike pawns, barricade pieces may not be passed. In order for play to progress past a barricade, the barricade must be captured by a pawn. A player who captures a barricade must relocate the barrier to an unoccupied space on the board. Barricades may not be placed in the four houses or in any of the 17 spaces in the bottom-most row. A pawn may not be moved if doing so would cause it either to pass a barricade or to overshoot the uppermost space on the board. After the move is complete, play passes to the next player. A player may forgo her move if and only if none of her pawns may be moved. ===Win condition=== The first player to land a pawn in the uppermost space is the winner. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== * Category:Board games introduced in 1960 Category:Abstract strategy games Category:Race games Category:Ravensburger games ","title":"Malefiz"},{"id":"20482515","text":"is a monthly automobile magazine dedicated to drifting and was the first of its kind.

Until 2007, when rival magazine D to D was published, it was the only magazine dedicated to the art of driving sideways. ==History== Drift Tengoku was launched in April 1996 as part of Option2. At that time, printed quarterly, it mainly published drifting related articles such as tuning as well as covering drifting contests, it also covered illegal gatherings that took place on public road, especially at the touge. These features usually led to police visits to the magazine's office. The magazine featured many of the now notable drifting drivers such as Ken Nomura and Nobuteru Taniguchi. At the following year, the magazine went bimonthly and the year following that, it went monthly. It was not until February 1999 that the magazine was published as a standalone magazine. The magazine celebrated its 100th issue on September 2007.

Although it features the likenesses and same voice actors, it is not based on the animated television shows from the 1990s. It was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision using the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game engine for the PlayStation in 2000; the game was later ported by different developers to various systems including the Game Boy Color and Nintendo 64 that same year, as well as the Dreamcast and Microsoft Windows in 2001. The game follows Spider-Man as he is framed by a doppelg√§nger, making him a wanted criminal, and attempts to clear his name, while foiling a symbiote invastion plot orchestrated by Doctor Octopus and Carnage. The game features villains from the comics as bosses, including Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Carnage and Doctor Octopus, as well as a Carnage symbiote-possessed Doctor Octopus, who was created exclusively for the game. The game was followed by three sequels in 2001: Spider-Man 2: The Sinister Six, developed exlusively for the Game Boy Color by Torus Games; the Playstation exlusive Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro, and the Game Boy Advance exlusive Spider-Man: Mysterio's Menace, both developed by Vicarious Visions. The game features narration from co-creator Stan Lee, and is the first Spider-Man game published by Activision following their acquisition of the license, which expired in 2014. ==Gameplay== The game has the player controlling Spider-Man as he goes through each level, either trying to reach the exit or complete a certain objective. The player must retry the current level if Spider-Man runs out of health, falls off a building or fails to complete certain objectives such as rescuing a hostage. Spider-Man is able to utilize his spider powers to traverse the environments, being able to crawl on walls and ceilings, swing short distances and instantly zip between certain points. In combat, Spider-Man can utilize a limited supply of web-cartridges to attack his enemies, either webbing them up to stall or defeat them, increasing the strength of his attacks or forming an explosive barrier. Spider-Man can also find comics, which unlock a Spider-Man comic book issue cover in the menu screen, as well as power-ups such as Spider-Armor which temporarily increases his strength and defense, and Fire Webbing which is effective against symbiotes. ==Plot== A supposedly reformed Dr. Otto Octavius is holding a scientific demonstration at Science Expo 2000, in New York City, but is interrupted when an impostor Spider-Man attacks the crew and steals his equipment. Eddie Brock tries to take pictures for J. Jonah Jameson of the Daily Bugle, but the impostor shatters his camera. In rage, the Venom symbiote resurfaces inside Brock, and he swears revenge on both Jameson and Spider-Man. Meanwhile, Peter Parker (the real Spider-Man, who was in attendance) is framed for the incident and the police ensue a manhunt for him. Elsewhere, two unseen figures release a strange fog into the city, which quickly covers the streets. After meeting with Black Cat and foiling a bank robbery by the Jade Syndicate, Spider-Man is forced to save Jameson from Scorpion. He defeats Scorpion, only for an ungrateful Jameson to call the police on him. While trying to escape, Spider-Man encounters Daredevil, who promises to spread the word about Spider-Man's innocence. After evading a police chopper, Spider-Man reunites with Black Cat, who informs him of two new problems: Rhino is attacking a power plant owned by Omni-Tech, and Venom has kidnapped his wife Mary Jane Parker to lure out Spider-Man. Choosing to aid Black Cat in fighting Rhino first, Spider-Man defeats him and leaves him for the police, but Black Cat, who was severely injured by Rhino, is kidnapped by unknown assailants posing as paramedics. After encouragement from the Human Torch, Spider-Man sets out to find Venom, only for him to appear behind him and lead Spider-Man on a chase through the city and then the sewers, during which Spider-Man has to fight numerous lizard-men. Eventually, he comes across an imprisoned Lizard, who reveals that the lizard-men are his experiments that were stolen by Venom, and points Spider-Man to the location of Venom's lair. There, Spider-Man saves Mary Jane and defeats Venom, to whom he then explains that someone has framed him and, thus, they have deliberately been turned against each other. To make amends, Venom decides to aid Spider-Man in finding the identity of the impostor, and the two arrive at the Daily Bugle to search through Jameson's files for the information. During the search, Venom senses the presence of Carnage nearby and leaves to find him. Now on his own, Spider- Man discovers an infestation of symbiotes in the entire building and clears them out, before coming across the impostor: Mysterio. After defeating him, Spider-Man learns about his boss' plan to infest New York with symbiotes, and that the fog over the city acts as a beacon for the symbiotes, which will prepare the citizens for symbiosis. Mysterio then points Spider-Man to his boss' hideout at Warehouse 65 and, on the way there, Spider-Man encounters the Punisher, who helps him locate and infiltrate the warehouse. Spider-Man discovers a massive undersea base and infiltrates it, where he comes across a symbiote manufacturing operation, as well as an imprisoned Black Cat. After stopping the fog and rescuing Black Cat, Spider-Man finally confronts her kidnappers and the masterminds behind the symbiote invasion: Octavius and Carnage. Taking up his Doctor Octopus persona once again, Octavius explains that he faked his reform and that, with the help of Carnage's symbiote - which all symbiotes are cloned from - plans to create a new world dominated by symbiotes, under his rule. Just then, Venom shows up and fights Carnage, while Spider-Man defeats Doctor Octopus, but Carnage beats Venom, forcing Spider-Man to fight Carnage himself. Spider-Man defeats Carnage by tossing him in a sonic bubble. Later, the symbiote leaves Carnage and fuses with Doc Ock, creating an enormous, out-of-control monster called \\"Monster Ock\\". As the base begins to self-destruct, Spider-Man escapes from Monster Ock, who gets caught in an explosion, removing the symbiote. He and the unconscious Doctor Octopus are then saved by Captain America, who was called by Black Cat and Venom. In the epilogue, at the S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters, Spider-Man is shown playing cards with Captain America, Daredevil, and the Punisher, while Black Cat and the Human Torch are dancing. In prison, Mysterio, Rhino, Scorpion, and a Jade Syndicate thug are also playing cards, while Doctor Octopus is banging his head against the cell bars, lamenting over his plan's failure. ==Development== Spider-Man uses the same game engine as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Spider-Man was a hidden character in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, and a reference is made to this during gameplay. The PlayStation, Dreamcast, and Windows versions have pre-rendered cutscenes, whereas the Nintendo 64 version shows captioned freeze-frames done in the style of a comic book and with fewer voice clips, due to that console's technical limitations for cutscenes. The Lizard was meant to appear in the final cutscene but was not included in the final version of the game's cutscene. The earliest footage of the game was found in a German demo disc entitled PlayDemo Vol. 17, and featured some drastic changes from the final product. These include a different opening sequence, different (most likely placeholder) voices, different music, and an entirely different model for Scorpion and an entirely different Rhino boss stage, as well as a sewer level not found in the final game. ===Audio=== Some of the voice actors from both the 1990s Spider-Man and Spider-Man Unlimited cartoons reprise their respective roles. For instance, Rino Romano reprises his role as Spider-Man/Peter Parker from Spider-Man Unlimited, Jennifer Hale reprises her roles as both Black Cat from the 1990s Spider-Man cartoon and Mary Jane Watson from Spider-Man Unlimited. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. reprises his role as Doctor Octopus from the 1994 Spider-Man TV series. The main song is a remix of the 1960s Spider-Man cartoon theme by the UK electronic music group Apollo 440. Stan Lee narrates key parts of the story. Daran Norris voices Venom/Eddie Brock, Mysterio, Scorpion, Punisher, Human Torch and Captain America, while Dee Bradley Baker voices Carnage, J. Jonah Jameson, the Lizard, Daredevil and Rhino.http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/video-games/Spider-Man/side-by-side/ ===Soundtrack=== The game's soundtrack was composed by Tommy Tallarico. It features a variation of musical loops mostly influenced by popular genres of the time, such as industrial rock and nu metal. The Nintendo 64 version includes a sound test where individual samples of tracks can be listened to. ==Reception== While reviews varied from system to system, Spider-Man received critical acclaim. GameRankings shows aggregate scores of 86.53% for the PlayStation version, 66.91% for the Game Boy Color version, 82.52% for the Nintendo 64 version, 80.23% for the Dreamcast version, and 67.96% for the PC version. Metacritic shows scores of 87 out of 100 for the PlayStation version, 72 out of 100 for the Nintendo 64 version, 80 out of 100 for the Dreamcast version, and 68 out of 100 for the PC version. IGN gave the PlayStation version a 9 out of 10, calling it \\"arguably, the best Spider-Man game\\", giving a 8.4 for the Dreamcast version calling it \\"good fun for anyone with a Dreamcast that hasn't played the PlayStation version\\", while expecting more from a powerful system like the Dreamcasthttps://www.ign.com/articles/2001/04/18/spider-man-22. The PC version, however, got a scathing review for essentially being a port of the Dreamcast with no major changes (6/10)https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/09/21/spider-man-15. GameSpot gave the same version a 7.7, calling it \\"excellent framework on which to base future Spider-Man games ‚Äì and an exceptional game to boot\\". Greg Orlando reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Excelsior! Great web-slinging fun\\". Scott Steinberg reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"A fun but slightly flawed superhero action adventure that'll have you bouncing off the walls. Literally\\". Spider-Mans PlayStation version received a \\"Platinum\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom. ==Sequels== The game has spawned three sequels in 2001: Spider-Man 2: The Sinister Six served as an alternative continuation that followed the events of the Game Boy Color version instead. The game eventually got a true sequel titled Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro released exclusively for the PlayStation, and a standalone sequel Spider-Man: Mysterio's Menace (also serving as a spin-off game to Spider-Man 2: The Sinister Six) for the Game Boy Advance. ==NotesReferencesSpider-Man games on Marvel.com * * Category:2000 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Activision games Category:Beat 'em ups Category:Dreamcast games Category:Game Boy Color games Category:Neversoft games Category:Treyarch games Category:Nintendo 64 games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Superhero video games Category:Video games based on Spider-Man Category:Video games based on Venom Category:Video games scored by Tommy Tallarico Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in New York City Category:Video games with alternate versions Category:Windows games ","title":"Spider-Man (2000 video game)"},{"id":"20482549","text":"Arenig Fach is a mountain in southern Snowdonia, north Wales.

The arboretum is located on the site of a former hunting lodge of Louis XIV of France, acquired in 1815 by Philippe-Andr√© de Vilmorin (1776-1862), who also began today's Arboretum national des Barres in 1821. He transformed the lodge's grounds into a collection of trees and shrubs from around the world as missionaries and explorers sent specimens from the Far East, America, North Africa, Siberia, and the Caucasus. Plans for the arboretum walls are attributed to Andr√© Le N√¥tre. Today's arboretum has been tended by seven generations of the Vilmorin family, assisted in recent years by a scientific committee. At present the arboretum contains some 2,280 identified species, with major collections of Acer, Berberis, Deutzia, Euonymus, Malus, Lonicera, Philadelphus, Quercus, and Rhododendron.

During the late 2nd and early 1st century BC, the area was increasingly dominated by the Han Dynasty and the northern neighbours of the Jushi, the Xiongnu, and became one of the many minor states of the Western Regions of Han dynasty China. The Jushi capital (Jiaohe, later known as Yarkhoto, and Yarghul) was destroyed in a Mongol attack in the 13th century. Contemporary Chinese sources suggest that the Jushi were Caucasoid in appearance. They may have been one of the Tocharian peoples and spoken one of the associated languages. ==Historical accounts== According to J. P. Mallory and Victor H. Mair, the earliest accounts of the Jushi report them to have \\"lived in tents, followed the grasses and waters, and had considerable knowledge of agriculture. They owned cattle, horses, camels, sheep and goats. They were proficient with bows and arrows\\". Jushi and the kingdom of Kror√§n were linked in the account of Zhang Qian (d. 113 BC), in part because both were under the control of the Xiongnu. In or about 60 BC, the Han‚Äîruled at the time by Emperor Xuan‚Äîdefeated Xiongnu forces at the Battle of Jushi, during the Han‚ÄìXiongnu War. Afterwards the main part of the Jushi lands was divided into two states: a southern area controlled by the Han, who referred to it as ‚ÄúNearer Jushi‚Äù (or \\"Anterior Jushi\\"), and a northern area known to the Han as ‚ÄúFurther Jushi\\" (or \\"Posterior Jushi\\") that was dominated by the Xiongnu. Nearer Jushi was administered by the Han from a capital at Jiaohe (16 kilometres west of the site of modern Turpan). The capital of Further Jushi appears to have been called Yuli or Yulai, and was located about 10 km north of Jimasa, 200 km north of Jiaohe.Fan Ye , Chronicle on the 'Western Regions' from the Hou Hanshu.

Hill), 2011] \\"Based on a report by General Ban Yong to Emperor An (107‚Äì125 CE) near the end of his reign, with a few later additions.\\" (20 December 2015) The Jushi never regained their independence. ==Archaeology== A 2,700-year-old grave discovered in 2008 at the Yanghai Tombs, an ancient cemetery (54,000 m2 in area), has been attributed to the Jushi or a precursor culture. The grave contains the remains of a shaman who had blue eyes and light-coloured hair. Near the shaman's head and foot were a large leather basket and wooden bowl filled 789 grams of dried cannabis, superbly preserved by climatic and burial conditions. An international team demonstrated that this material contained tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive component of cannabis. The cannabis was clearly \\"cultivated for psychoactive purposes,\\" rather than as fibre for clothing or as food. It may have been employed as a medicinal agent, or an aid to divination. This is the oldest known use of cannabis as a pharmacological agent. The extremely dry conditions and alkaline soil acted as preservatives, allowing a team of scientists to carefully analyze the stash, which still looked green though it had lost its distinctive odour. ==See also== * Tarim mummies == References  Citations = Sources === * Hill, John E.

Observing his early inclination for drawing and poetry, Aff√≤'s father encouraged him to study in the workshop of the painter and sculptor, Pietro Balestra. After a short time, Aff√≤ began pursuing studies in fine arts, demonstrating abilities in the writing. In his youth, Aff√≤ entered the Franciscan order. He continued to pursue his writing, which included poetry. He began to cultivate the study of learning, conducting extensive historical research of Italy and the surrounding area. Ferdinand, Duke of Parma sent Aff√≤ to serve as a professor of philosophy at Guastalla in 1768, where he oversaw the publication of two ancient codices, including Angelo Poliziano's Orpheus, and the newly discovered archive of the Holy Spirit in Reggio Emilia. He then edited the critical edition of poetic works of St. Francis of Assisi. His major work in the literary field is still represented by the first five volumes of Memoirs of writers and scholars of Parma (1789 ‚Äì 1797). While at Guastalla, Aff√≤ wrote his History of the city and duchy of Guastalla. He wrote also, History of Parma, until 1346, as well as other works connected with the ancient history of Italy. Aff√≤'s writing became highly respected throughout Italy. In 1778, Aff√≤ was recalled to Parma to become deputy librarian for the court. In 1785, he became director of the Palatine Library in that city, and later became historiographer of the Journal of the Duchy and honorary Professor of History at the university. While his writing covered a wide variety of subjects, his research was uncannily accurate and valued at the library. In 1792, Aff√≤ began publishing the four volumes of the History of Parma. He died at the age of 56, in the convent of Busseto, when he contracted typhus fever. He left a manuscript History of Peter Louis Farnese. Girolamo Tiraboschi, an Italian literary critic and historian of Italian literature often quotes his works. His Poetical Dictionary and Memoirs, as well as other pieces are inserted in the Raccolta Ferrarese di Opuscoli. == Writings == Vita di monsignore Bernardino Baldi da Urbino, 1783 * (Biography of the librarian of Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary.) * * (Biography of Bernardino Baldi, first abbott of Guastalla) * * (Biography of Pier Luigi Farnese, Duke of Parma.) * (Cavaliere Bernardino Marliani) * * (Biography of Francesco Mazzola, Parmigianino) * (Live of the Blessed Orlando de Medici, and cult of his relics) * (Biography of Vespasiano I Gonzaga) *Ireneo Aff√≤ (1794) Ragionamento Del Padre, Parma: Dalla Stamperia Carmignani.

Parmasto was born in N√µmme. He became a member of the Estonian Institute of Zoology and Botany in 1950 and served as its director from 1985 to 1990. His establishment of a mushroom herbarium in 1950 has since seen recognition of 160,000 samples, 37,000 of which Parmasto himself collected. Parmasto published more than 150 papers and 200 articles during his academic career and his works are commonly used in popular scientific and academic journals in Estonia. His expertise in the field of mycology has resulted in him being nicknamed \\"Seenevana\\", or the \\"grand old man of mushrooms\\". As a mycologist, the field with which Parmasto was most associated, he was best known for his establishment and enhancement of databases for species of mushrooms within Estonia. He was also the author of the first Estonian-language textbook on biosystematics in history. He was furthermore one of the driving forces behind the establishment of Liiva-Putla Nature Reserve, one of only five areas created for the protection of mushrooms in Europe. He served as the president of the Estonian Naturalists' Society between 1973 and 1976 and was an honorary member of the society from 1988. Between 1973 and 1981 he was also the academic secretary in the Department of Chemical, Geological and Biological Sciences of the Estonian Academy of Sciences. He would later work as a Professor of Botany and Ecology at the University of Tartu from 1987 to 1995. Parmasto worked as the senior researcher in the Mycology Department of the Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences at the Estonian University of Life Sciences. ==Awards== He was a recipient of the Karl Ernst von Baeri medal in 1976. In 1994 he won the National Science Prize from the Yearly Award, Culture and Society, and in 2002, was awarded the honorable Lifetime Achievement Award in Biosciences and the Environment again. In 2008 he was given the Eerik Kumari Award for his contributions to Bioscience.

The tradition originated from teams holding public practices at midnight on the earliest day that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) would allow a practice to be held. In 2013, a new NCAA rule established some flexibility around the opening of a team's practice sessions. As a result, the dates on which teams celebrate Midnight Madness can vary, but most stick with the traditional date of a Friday night closest to October 15. ==History== Maryland coach Lefty Driesell held the first \\"Midnight Madness\\" session in 1971. Prior to the 2013‚Äì14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season men's and women's basketball teams were not permitted to practice prior to the Friday closest to October 15. Maryland Terrapins head coach Lefty Driesell began the Midnight Madness tradition at 12:03 a.m. on October 15, 1971 by inviting the public to a 1.5 mile team run.Sports Whirl, The Virgin Islands Daily News, October 16, 1970. The early practice session was attended by 3,000 fans at the track surrounding Byrd Stadium on the University of Maryland campus. Driesell continued the annual midnight practice session throughout his tenure at Maryland, and brought the tradition with him when he became head coach at Georgia State University. In 2008, that school delayed the event until sunrise for the first time since Driesell established the tradition. Big Blue Madness in 2015, at Rupp Arena in Lexington, Kentucky. In 1982, coach Joe B. Hall and the Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team began to officially promote a celebration dubbed \\"Midnight Madness\\" as a school event with formal entertainment acts and an invited student audience. This event was held in Memorial Coliseum and held 8,500 people in the then-12,500 seat gym. Big Blue Madness is now televised and hosts celebrities including Drake, who performed in 2014. Another of the more famous events is \\"Late Night in the Phog\\" at Kansas, which was started in 1985 by Larry Brown and is now broadcast in live streaming video via the Internet. The event has caught on on most campuses; various programs have given away T-shirts and allowed players do stunt dunks and half court shots. Some schools schedule intrasquad scrimmages, three-point shooting contests and/or slam dunk contests. The event is often a co-ed event, in which both the men's and women's teams participate in the celebration, especially at schools like the University of Connecticut, where the men's and women's teams have a combined 15 championships. Scout.com estimated that in 2007, approximately 160 of the top blue chip high school basketball recruits in the country were attending a Midnight Madness event during the weekend that opens the basketball season. In 2013, the NCAA ruled that men's practices could begin two weeks earlier than the traditional date, so long as teams held no more than 30 days of practice in the six weeks prior to the first regular- season game. This change was made to provide more flexible scheduling that accommodated off days in the preseason practice schedule. However, the women's programs rejected moving the date forward so as not to conflict with recruiting. As a result of practices beginning so early, several teams opted to celebrate Midnight Madness later in the six-week practice window. ==Details== In the 21st century, most basketball programs from large Division I schools have planned a pep rally with MCs, music, dancing and other festivities to encourage support of the program. Celebrity guests and alumni participate in entertaining the students. Often, there is significant publicity surrounding the event, which may include televised broadcasts, published press releases and various new media exposure. Kyle Macy was among the celebrity participants at the 2006 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball opening night celebration Some of the more outlandish occurrences during such events included coach participation, such as Michigan State Spartans men's basketball coach Tom Izzo riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle onto the court and Florida Gators men's basketball coach Billy Donovan rising out of a coffin. Although signing week, when top recruits sign letters of intent that commit them to specific schools, does not occur until November, blue chip high school recruits are sometimes welcomed at these events even in their junior years. Usually a prescribed number of fans (such as the first 1,000) receive a gifts such as t-shirts, posters, autographs, road game vacation packages, and other free paraphernalia. At many such events, a student is chosen for a half- court shot giveaway. Sometimes the events are televised live by sports networks such as the Big Ten Network, and other times highlights are shown on highlight shows such as ESPN's SportsCenter. ESPNU has begun extensive yearly coverage of midnight madness events and in 2008 televised events at Davidson College, the University of Kansas, Georgetown University, Gonzaga University and Indiana University. The events have been reported for years in print media such as newspapers, magazines and the internet. Although Midnight Madness has become a prime time event for many premier basketball programs, some schools have continued the tradition of having their first practice at 12:00 on the first day regular practice is allowed. As of 2006, the University of Kentucky held the record for attendance at this type of sports rally with an attendance of 23,312 at Rupp Arena. Kentucky has sold out Rupp Arena multiple times for what they call \\"Big Blue Madness\\" and in the 2008-09 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball season fans had to camp out in lines for days in advance to obtain tickets. One celebratory function of the evening is often to raise NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament or Final Four banners to the rafters in an official ceremony. In 2008, both 2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament finalists, the Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball and Memphis Tigers men's basketball teams, did so during their respective Midnight Madness event. The October 16, 2009 celebrations occurred on many campuses and a sampling were aired on the ESPN family of networks. Five Big Ten Conference schools celebrated Midnight Madness. ==Exceptions== In 2008, some teams attempted to host Midnight Madness in association with special early restricted practices instead of the first day of regular practices. These universities felt that since their football teams had home games the week before the opening date of formal practices, which had become the traditional Midnight Madness date, they would be better off holding Midnight Madness on the weekend before. In 2008, teams were allowed to practice two hours per week between September 15 and October 17 under what is known as the \\"Offseason Workout Rule,\\" and at least four notable public \\"practice\\" sessions (by Illinois, Kentucky, Marshall and West Virginia) were held during these weekly practices before daily practices were permitted. At the University of Illinois, the Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball and women's basketball teams hosted scrimmages at Memorial Stadium after an October 11 game between the Illinois Fighting Illini football team and the Minnesota Golden Gophers football team. Since the attendance for the football game was 62,870, this event was described as the \\"World's Largest Basketball Practice\\". Charlie Zegers reports that the practice session events occurred both at halftime and after the game. Kentucky was one of the schools that held their public practice event a week early in part because they could lure more recruiting prospects during a week when most other programs were not hosting similar events. The National Association of Basketball Coaches asked the Southeastern Conference to force Kentucky to adhere to the traditionally scheduled practice to no avail. They then belatedly petitioned the NCAA to legislate conformity unsuccessfully. Kentucky coach Billy Gillispie had contacted the Kentucky's compliance office, the SEC and the NCAA to ensure that no rules were being violated. Illinois head coach Bruce Weber had also received permission for the early practice festivities from the NCAA. He had proposed having a September 13 session in association with a home football game against Louisiana‚ÄìLafayette. The date with the Ragin' Cajuns would have in all likelihood been a more favorable day in terms of the climate, but this date preceded even the Offseason Workout Rule dates. It is anticipated that in the future, public basketball practices linked to the Offseason Workout Rule will be banned. Illinois claimed that their date change was not intended to give it a recruiting advantage in terms of scheduling conflicts. ==NotesExternal links== *ESPN 2010 Midnight Madness highlight video *Midnight Madness and the Michigan State University Men's Basketball Team Category:Cheerleading Category:History of college basketball in the United States Category:Maryland Terrapins men's basketball Category:College sports culture in the United States ","title":"Midnight Madness (basketball)"},{"id":"20482759","text":"Haide-Ene Rebassoo (born 25 January 1935 in Tallinn) is an Estonian botanist.

Launched by parliamentarians Jean-Luc M√©lenchon and Marc Dolez on 12 November 2008, after their departure from the Socialist Party (PS) following the Congress of Reims, the PG brings together personalities and groups from different political traditions, and claims a socialist, ecologist and republican orientation. Politically located between the Socialist Party and the French Communist Party, the Left Party intends to federate all the sensitivities of the anti-liberal left ‚Å†‚Äî which he also calls \\"the other left\\" ‚Å†‚Äî within the same alliance. In 2008, the PG joined forces with the Communist Party of the United Left and six other left-wing and far-left organizations in the coalition of the Left Front, of which Jean-Luc M√©lenchon is the candidate for the presidential election. The PG was co-chaired from the Le Mans Congress in November 2010, by Jean-Luc M√©lenchon and Martine Billard. In April 2016, the Left Party had 8,000 members. At the end of August 2014, Jean-Luc M√©lenchon and Martine Billard resigned, and the party leadership was then collectively ensured by the national secretariat. His weekly newspaper, L'Heure du peuple (formerly Left) is sent to all members but also to simple subscribers. It is printed at more than 15,000 copies a week.

However, Yeltsin declined his request and in October fired Lebed from his position. Eventually, Kulikov was dismissed in March 1998 along with the entire second cabinet of Viktor Chernomyrdin. While most of the ministers of the old cabinet were reappointed to Sergei Kiriyenko's Cabinet, Kulikov wasn't and Sergei Stepashin became the next interior minister.

Through her marriage with the Welf duke Henry the Lion, she was Duchess consort of Saxony and Bavaria from 1168 until her husband's deposition in 1180. She was named after her grandmother Matilda of England. ==Marriage== Upon the disputed Papal election of 1159 and the succeeding schism, King Henry II established closer ties to the Holy Roman Empire; particularly when he himself came into conflict with the English clergy led by Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. Sent by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, the Cologne archbishop Rainald of Dassel arrived at the court of King Henry II at Rouen in 1165 to negotiate an English‚ÄìGerman matrimonial alliance and the Welf duke Henry the Lion was chosen as a match for Matilda. There was conflict during the negotiations, however, when Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester refused to greet the German archbishop, alleging him to be a schismatic and a supporter of the anti-pope, Victor IV. The original plan to match the second daughter of King Henry II, Eleanor Plantagenet, with a son of Emperor Frederick, was abandoned, and instead, Matilda left England with a large dowry in September 1167. Coronation of Henry the Lion and Matilda, from the Gospels of Henry the Lion () Matilda married Henry the Lion, then Duke of Saxony and Bavaria, on 1 February 1168 at Minden Cathedral in Saxony. The Welf duke had divorced from his first wife, Clementia of Z√§hringen, in 1162. He and Matilda had four sons and one daughter: *Matilda (or Richenza) of Saxony (1172‚Äì1209/10), married Geoffrey III Count of Perche (see counts of Perche) and Enguerrand III, Lord of Coucy *Henry V, Count Palatine of the Rhine (1173/1174 ‚Äì 28 April 1227) *Lothar of Bavaria (1174/1175 ‚Äì 16 October 1190). *Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor and Duke of Swabia (1175/1176 ‚Äì 19 May 1218). *William, Lord of L√ºneburg (11 April 1184 ‚Äì 12 December 1213). Three other children are listed, by some sources, as having belonged to Henry and Matilda: *Eleanor (born 1178); died young *Ingibiorg (born 1180); died young *Son (stillborn 1182) ==Regency and exile== At the time of their marriage, Duke Henry the Lion was one of the most powerful allies of the Hohenstaufen emperor, and his royal consort added to his dominant position. Matilda governed her husband's vast estates during his pilgrimage to the Holy Land from 1172 to 1173. Back in Germany, Henry built up his residence in Brunswick, where he and Matilda held a magnificent court at Dankwarderode Castle. They had Brunswick Cathedral erected from 1173 onwards and initiated the Lucidarius, the first original German language work in prose, as well as the Gospels of Henry the Lion, a masterpiece of Romanesque book illumination. Soon after, however, Henry the Lion became involved in a fierce conflict with Emperor Frederick. Allegedly, both men fell out with each other, when they met in Chiavenna in 1176, and Henry refused to support the emperor in his fight against the Italian Lombard League. Frederick's forces were defeated in the Battle of Legnano and the emperor had to make peace with the hostile Pope Alexander III. A number of rivaling princes intrigued against Henry and the duke was finally declared deposed in 1180. Henry submitted to the emperor in November 1181; nevertheless, he and his family were forced to flee Germany and take refuge in Normandy at the court of Matilda's father in 1182. During this time at the royal court at Argentan, Matilda became acquainted with the troubadour Bertran de Born, who, calling her \\"Elena\\" or \\"Lana\\", made her the object of his desire in two of his poems of \\"courtly love\\". Matilda, her husband, and their family remained under the protection and financial support of King Henry II until 1185, when, by the mediation of the English monarch, they were allowed to return to Saxony. Any hopes to regain the Saxon and Bavarian duchies were disappointed. Early in 1189, the emperor gave Henry the Lion a choice to accompany him on the Third Crusade or go into exile. Henry returned to England, while this time Matilda remained at Brunswick to defend the interests of her husband. However, she died three months later at the age of 33, 8 days before her father. After her death, her husband again entered Germany and finally reconciled with Emperor Frederick's son Henry VI. In 1194, his first-born son Henry the Elder was enfeoffed with the County Palatine of the Rhine. ==AncestryNotesSources== *Wheeler, Bonnie.

The \\"crosshairs\\" in the image mark the quadrant divisions of Washington, with the United States Capitol at the center of the dividing lines. To the west of the Capitol extends the National Mall, visible as a slight green band in the image. The Northwest quadrant is the largest, located north of the Mall and west of North Capitol Street. Washington, D.C., is administratively divided into four geographical quadrants of unequal size, each delineated by their ordinal directions from the medallion located in the Crypt under the Rotunda of the Capitol. Street and number addressing, centered on the Capitol, radiates out into each of the quadrants, producing a number of intersections of identically named cross-streets in each quadrant. Originally, the District of Columbia was a near-perfect square. However, even then the Capitol was never located at the geographic center of the territory (the geographic center was located near the present-day intersection of 17th Street, NW and Constitution Ave.). As a result, the quadrants are of greatly varying size. Northwest is quite large, encompassing over a third of the city's geographical area, while Southwest is little more than a neighborhood and military base. The boundaries of the quadrants are not straight lines radiating from the medallion, but follow the paths of the boundary streets (which in some cases curve around topographical features): North Capitol Street, South Capitol Street, and East Capitol Street. The axis of the National Mall through the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial forms the imaginary boundary running west of the medallion. ==Northwest== \\"Northwest\\" (also written as NW or N.W.) is located north of the National Mall and west of North Capitol Street. It is the largest of the four quadrants of the city, both in area--it contains more than 42% of the entire city --and population--it has more than half the city's population--and it includes the central business district, Federal Triangle, The Smithsonian National Zoo, and the museums along the northern side of the National Mall, as well as such prestigious neighborhoods as Foggy Bottom, West End, Columbia Heights, Petworth, Dupont Circle, Logan Circle, LeDroit Park, Georgetown, Adams Morgan, Embassy Row, Glover Park, Tenleytown, Piney Branch, Emergy, Shepherd Park, Crestwood, Bloomingdale, and Friendship Heights. The large Rock Creek Park divides the northwest quadrant in two. ==Northeast== \\"Northeast\\" (NE or N.E.) is located north of East Capitol Street and east of North Capitol Street. Northeast neighborhoods include Brentwood, Brookland, Ivy City, Marshall Heights, NoMa, Pleasant Hill, Stanton Park, Trinidad, Michigan Park, Riggs Park, Fort Totten, Fort Lincoln, Edgewood, and Woodridge, as well as much of Capitol Hill. Notable landmarks include the Supreme Court, Union Station, Catholic University of America, Trinity University, National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, Franciscan Monastery, Providence Hospital, Gallaudet University, the National Arboretum, Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens, and the Benning Road Power Plant. ==Southeast== \\"Southeast\\" (SE or S.E.) is located south of East Capitol Street and east of South Capitol Street. It has a rich cultural history, including the historic Capitol Hill and Anacostia neighborhoods, the Navy Yard, the Marine Barracks, the Anacostia River waterfront, historic Eastern Market, the remains of several Civil War-era forts, historic St. Elizabeths Hospital, RFK Stadium, Nationals Park, and the Congressional Cemetery. The quadrant is divided by the Anacostia River, with the portion that is west of the river sometimes referred to as \\"Near Southeast\\" and the portion east of the river is known as \\"River East\\". Many people falsely call the entire eastern portion of the quadrant Anacostia, although the name refers only to a small area along Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. ==Southwest== \\"Southwest\\" (SW or S.W.) is located south of the National Mall and west of South Capitol Street and is the smallest quadrant of the city. Although roughly half of the quadrant is located south of the Anacostia River in Anacostia, references to \\"Southwest\\" generally allude to the area near downtown, within about a mile of the Capitol, much of which was demolished and redeveloped in the 1960s with modern Federal office and apartment buildings. Fort McNair and the National War College are also there. The section south of the River, except for the Bellevue neighborhood, is almost entirely devoted to Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, and the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant. ==See also== *District of Columbia retrocession ==References== Category:Geography of Washington, D.C.

From this processing, from the creation of electronic textures and from loop recordings, it overlaps sound layers and folds to create a uniform mass of texts and sounds. In his plays are noted influences from noisy music, minimalist music and Eastern music, especially by the use of Tibetan chants and modes of Noh theater.

Salina Jr. The school board is currently composed of President Catherine Flanagan, Vice President Raymond Paris and trustees Jennifer Maggio, Dr. Lynnda Nadien, Dr. Joseph Netto, Sonny Spagnuolo and Sisi Townson. The principals of the elementary schools are Emily O'Brien (Eastplain), Joseph A. Maisano (John H. West), and Jennifer Thearle (Schwarting), with Sara Azizollahoff serving as assistant principal at all elementary schools. The principal of the middle school is Anthony DeRiso and assistant principals Jennifer Wiesman and Vito Mannino. The deans of the middle school are Casey Kornharens and Brian Wipperman. The principal of the high school is Robert Amster and the assistant principals are Jennifer Vitale and Kevin Burgoyne. == History and organization == A kindergarten class' picture, taken in 1959 at the Temple Annex School. The first Plainedge school was housed in a two-room, wood-frame schoolhouse that became known as the \\"Annex.\\" It served the district until about 1952 when the John H. West elementary school was built. It was then updated and used as the school district's administration office. On February 19, 1985, the Plainedge School Union's Board of Education was sued by Carl McCall for a refusal to promote her based on her gender. The school district is composed of 3 elementary schools, John H. West elementary, Eastplain elementary and Charles E. Schwarting elementary. The middle school is Plainedge Middle School and the high school is Plainedge High School. Former schools include Robert E. Picken elementary, which was sold to the Town of Oyster Bay to serve as a smaller town hall for the southern part of the town; Northedge Elementary (then Kindergarten), which was knocked down to make room for the new Middle School; Baldwin Drive Elementary and Southedge Junior High, which were demolished and the land sold for housing; and Sylvia Packard Middle School, which was shut down after the school, at 40 years of age, was deemed inefficient to serve the continuing needs of the community. Since Plainedge is not an official town, its students come from parts of Massapequa, North Massapequa, Bethpage, Seaford and Farmingdale. As a result of school closures caused by the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, the Plainedge school district arranged a community effort to turn on stadium and porch lights between 8:20 and 8:40PM on May 1, 2020 to honor the graduating senior class. ==Notable alumni== * Manjul BhargavaBhargava, M.

It served as an operational training unit with various aircraft, providing cadres to \\"satellite groups\\" and as a replacement training unit, training individual pilots.See Craven & Cate, Introduction, p. xxxvi However, the AAF was finding that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization, were not proving well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, it adopted a more functional system in which each AAF base was organized into a separate numbered unit.Goss, p. 75 In this reorganization the squadron was disbanded in 1944 as the AAF converted to the AAF Base Unit system. It was replaced, along with other units at Woodward Army Air Field, by the 267th AAF Base Unit (Combat Crew Training Station, Fighter) in a reorganization of the AAF in which all units not programmed for deployment overseas were replaced by AAF Base Units to free up manpower for assignment overseas. ==Cold War air defense== During the Cold War the squadron was reconstituted, redesignated as the 518th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and activated at George Air Force Base, California in January 1955, where it was assigned to the 27th Air Division.

The ghetto was created in 1941, although the first transports of Jews from the German Reich started arriving there as early as 1940. Izbica was the largest transit ghetto in the Lublin reservation, with death rate almost equal to that of the Warsaw ghetto. SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Kurt Engels, known for his exceptional cruelty, served as its only commandant. ==Ghetto operation== The Jews who lived in Izbica were kept separate from the new arrivals. They were housed on the other side of the railroad tracks. Also, the Jews shipped in from Germany and Austria were differentiated from Polish Jews by the color of the obligatory star of David signs, yellow for German, and blue for the Polish Jews. In order to make space for the incoming transports, 2,200 local Jews were sent to the Belzec death camp on March 24, 1942. Between March and May 1942, approximately 12,000 to 15,000 new Jews were transported to Izbica from across Europe as part of secretive Operation Reinhard; among them engineers, doctors, economists, army generals and professors from Vienna, Hague, Heidelberg and Breslau, including the vice- president of Prague.Izbica - a story of a place by Foundation for the Preservation of Jewish Heritage in Poland.

The rest were forced to subsist outdoors. Jews stayed in the barracks usually for no more than four days, with almost nothing to eat. Many victims succumbed to typhus due to poor sanitary conditions in the ghetto. The foreigners, many of whom were proficient in German, had an easier time identifying with their Nazi oppressors than the Polish Jews from inside the ghetto. Denunciations were commonplace. ===Mass killings=== In the early stage of the ghetto existence, the Nazis destroyed the local Jewish cemetery. The tombstones were desecrated and used to build walls of a new prison. The entire ghetto in Izbica was liquidated beginning November 2, 1942, which led to a week of horrific killings at the cemetery. Several thousand Jews (estimated at 4,500) were massacred by the Sonderdienst battalion of Ukrainian Trawnikis in an assembly- line-style, and dumped into hastily dug mass graves.Hanan Lipszyc, Jewish Community of Izbica. Page 4 of 5. Museum of the History of Polish Jews. The murders were committed by trained killers who drank heavily, but the soldiers of German Reserve Police Battalion 101 who rounded up the condemned prisoners drank also, especially at night.Browning 1998, p. 80. A second, smaller ghetto was set up in its place for about 1,000 local Jews. It was dismantled on April 28, 1943 with all remaining inmates sent to Sobibor death camp.

It became a National Bestseller, a New York Times and San Francisco Chronicle Notable Book, and a Chicago Tribune, Kansas City Star, and Rocky Mountain News Best Book of the Year. The Keep is a story about two cousins involved in a haunting business venture that evokes a horrifying tale from their past. ==Plot== Danny is an aging hipster in New York City who has fallen on hard times. He does not have a real career, and he has a habit of burning bridges with old friends. His cousin Howard presents him with an opportunity to come to Eastern Europe and help convert an old castle into an alternative resort. Danny has a troubled relationship with Howard. Many years before, when they were children, he cruelly left Howard stranded deep in a cave for days, traumatizing him badly, and ruining much of his childhood. But Danny is desperate for money, so he decides to work for Howard and travels to the castle, severing his relationships with his New York world. He plunges himself into the strange environment of the castle and puts himself at the mercy of the cousin whom he betrayed many years before. It soon becomes clear that this castle is a deeply strange place with a dark history that is not entirely finished. It has secret passages, bizarre inhabitants, and seems to operate by different rules from the outside world. Danny, cut off from his familiar New York world, is unsure whether the castle is haunted or his own perceptions are becoming increasingly distorted. He thinks that his cousin may be out to get him and that the castle may be a giant trap. When Danny attempts to escape from the castle, he encounters a series of mysterious roadblocks. No matter what he does, fate seems to be directing Danny back to the castle and towards a final confrontation with his cousin Howard. Together, they end up being trapped deep within the bowels of the castle, where they are forced to re-enact the traumas of childhood. Together, they must figure out a way to escape and survive. ==Characters== *Danny, the protagonist *Howard/Howie, Danny's cousin *Ann, Howard's wife *Benjy, Howard and Ann's son *Mick, Howard's right-hand man *Nora, a student helper *Martha, Danny's ex-girlfriend *Steve, a hired helper and friend *Baroness von Ausblinker, woman refusing to leave the family castle *Ray, the man writing this story from jail *Holly, writing teacher for the inmates *Tom-Tom, Quince, Hamsam, Mel, Cherry, Allan Beard, Sanchez, inmates in the writing class *Davis, Ray's cell mate ==Film== An adaptation of the novel is in development at CBS Films.

Maria Palaiologina Kantakouzene (, ) was the most powerful empress of Bulgaria, ruling as a regent from 1271 to 1279. She was a niece of Michael VIII Palaiologos and wife of two Bulgarian emperors, Constantine Tikh and Ivaylo. ==Family== Maria was the second daughter of John Kantakouzenos and Irene Komnene Palaiologina, sister of Michael VIII Palaiologos. According to George Pachymeres, Maria was unusually perfidious and sly and she had a strong influence over the people and the clergy. He would have it that Maria supported her uncle's military coup d'etat and she prompted him to blind the legitimate emperor John IV Laskaris, who was brother of Bulgarian empress Irene, second wife of tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria. ==Empress consort of BulgariaWife of Constantine Tikh=== The deposition and blinding of the minor Nicaean emperor John IV Laskaris by Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261 pitted Constantine Tikh, as the brother-in-law of the deposed emperor, against Michael VIII. After the death of tsarina Irene Laskarina in 1268 Constantine Tikh sought a reconciliation with Michael VIII by proposing to marry a Byzantine princess related to Palaiologos, and Michael VIII offered his niece Maria. Maria had one previous marriage, to Alexios Philes, and Constantine Tikh had two. As a condition for the marriage alliance, the Black Sea ports of Mesembria and Anchialos were to be handed over as her dowry. Maria and Constantine Tikh married in 1269. However, quarrels over the surrender of Maria's promised dowry soured the improved relationship. Maria realized that the behaviour of her uncle would undermine her position in the Bulgarian court, so she openly put up her husband to attack Michael VIII. The Bulgarian government entered into an alliance with King Charles I of Sicily who was planning a campaign against Michael VIII with the object of restoring the Latin Empire. Michael VIII responded by marrying his illegitimate daughter Euphrosyne Palaiologina to Nogai Khan of the Golden Horde, who, as a Byzantine ally, pillaged Bulgaria in 1274. In the last years of his reign, Constantine Tikh was partly paralyzed from a fall off his horse, and suffered from unspecified ailments. The government was firmly in the hands of Maria Kantakouzene, who crowned their son Michael Asen II co-emperor soon after his birth, in about 1272. Maria presided over relations with the Byzantine Empire in the 1270s, and engineered first the submission and then the murder (by poison) of the despotƒìs Yakov Svetoslav of Vidin, a strong pretender for the Bulgarian crown, in 1275. The tsarina invited Yakov Svetoslav to Tarnovo, promising to adopt him and to allow him to participate in the governing of the country. In 1275 Yakov Svetoslav arrived at Tarnovo and he indeed proclaimed as the second son of Maria in an official ceremony, officiated by patriarch Ignatiy of Bulgaria. Yakov died soon after his return to Vidin. George Pachymeres accused Maria for his death. ===Wife of Ivaylo=== Due to the expensive and unsuccessful wars, repeated Mongol raids, and economic instability, Maria's government was faced with a revolt in 1277. What is clear is that a swineherd or swine-owner named Ivaylo became a leader of the discontented and attracted many (presumably mostly lower-class) followers, asserting his control over a significant area. Tsar Constantine set out against Ivaylo with his guard, but was decisively defeated and slain in his chariot. Ivaylo himself is credited with the killing. Although he was able to extend his authority across much of the country, he also met with resistance, and the capital Tarnovo remained under the control of the legitimate emperor Michael Asen II and his mother Maria Kantakouzene. Ivaylo's successes troubled the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos, who married his eldest daughter Irene to Ivan Asen III, a descendant of Bulgaria's ruling dynasty living at the Byzantine court, and dispatched troops to place him on the throne. This caused an alliance between Ivaylo and Maria Kantakouzena, and the widowed empress married Ivaylo, who was recognized as Bulgarian emperor in 1278, without deposing or disinheriting the minor Michael Asen II. Maria's decision was defined by Byzantines as \\"indecent\\" and \\"impure\\", because she, a descendant of the noble Palaiologos and Kantakouzenos families, had married a swineherd, who had moreover killed her husband. In this connection Michael VIII declared openly that Maria \\"had brought disgrace on her family\\" and she \\"had destroyed her kingdom\\". The marriage of Ivaylo and Maria was unhappy. Pachymeres says that Ivaylo hated her endearments and he even had beaten Maria. Although Ivaylo proved to be an abusive husband, he led a successful defense of the Balkan passes against the Byzantine campaigns to establish Ivan Asen III on the Bulgarian throne. Ivaylo had also met with success against casual Mongol raids, but in 1279 a major Mongol army blockaded him in the fortress of Dorostolon (Silistra) on the Danube for three months. A rumor of Ivaylo's death caused panic in Tarnovo, where the nobility surrendered to a new Byzantine army and accepted Ivan Asen III as emperor. Ivan Asen III was enthroned, while Michael Asen II and Maria Kantakouzena, who was pregnant by Ivaylo, were sent into exile to Constantinople. Maria Kantakouzene and Ivaylo had an unnamed daughter. ==Ancestors== { width=\\"100%\\" style=\\"border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" -  width=\\"8.333%\\"   width=\\"8.333%\\"   width=\\"8.333%\\"   width=\\"8.333%\\"   width=\\"8.333%\\"   width=\\"8.333%\\"   width=\\"8.333%\\"   width=\\"8.333%\\"   width=\\"8.333%\\"   width=\\"8.333%\\"   width=\\"8.333%\\"   width=\\"8.333%\\"  - style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"  colspan=\\"5\\"   colspan=\\"2\\"  Andronikos Doukas Komnenos Palaiologos  colspan=\\"2\\"  Theodora Angelina Palaiologina -  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"border-right: solid black 1px;\\"   colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"border-right: solid black 1px;\\"   colspan=\\"4\\"  -  colspan=\\"6\\"   colspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"border-right: solid black 1px; border-top: solid black 1px;\\"   colspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"border-top: solid black 1px;\\"   colspan=\\"5\\"  - style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"  colspan=\\"4\\"   colspan=\\"2\\"  Joannes Komnenos Angelos Kantakouzenos  colspan=\\"2\\"  Eulogia (Irene) Palaiologina -  colspan=\\"5\\" style=\\"border-right: solid black 1px;\\"   colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"border-right: solid black 1px;\\"   colspan=\\"5\\"  -  colspan=\\"5\\"   colspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"border-right: solid black 1px; border- top: solid black 1px;\\"   colspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"border-top: solid black 1px;\\"   colspan=\\"6\\"  - style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"  colspan=\\"3\\"   colspan=\\"2\\"  1 Constantine Tikh  colspan=\\"2\\"  Maria Palaiologina Kantakouzene  colspan=\\"2\\"  2 Ivaylo  colspan=\\"5\\"  -  colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"border-right: solid black 1px;\\"   colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"border-right: solid black 1px;\\"   colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"border-right: solid black 1px;\\"  -  colspan=\\"4\\"   colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"border-right: solid black 1px; border-top: solid black 1px;\\"   colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"border-top: solid black 1px;\\"   colspan=\\"4\\"  - style=\\"height: 2ex; text-align: left;\\"  colspan=\\"5\\" style=\\"border- right: solid black 1px;\\"   colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"border-right: solid black 1px; border-top: solid black 1px;\\"  1  colspan=\\"5\\"  2 - style=\\"vertical- align: top\\"  colspan=\\"4\\"   colspan=\\"2\\"  Michael Asen II  colspan=\\"2\\"  daughter  colspan=\\"4\\"  } ==NotesSources== * Vasil Zlatarski, \\"–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –Ω–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –¥—ä—Ä–∂–∞–≤–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–∑ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –≤–µ–∫–æ–≤–µ. –¢–æ–º III. –í—Ç–æ—Ä–æ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ —Ü–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–æ. –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—è –ø—Ä–∏ –ê—Å–µ–Ω–µ–≤—Ü–∏ (1187‚Äî1280)\\" –∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—Å—Ç–≤–æ \\"–ù–∞—É–∫–∞ –∏ –∏–∑–∫—É—Å—Ç–≤–æ\\", –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è 1972 –≥. * Yordan Andreev, Ivan Lazarov, Plamen Pavlov, \\"–ö–æ–π –∫–æ–π –µ –≤ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–æ–≤–µ–∫–æ–≤–Ω–∞ –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—è\\", –∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—Å—Ç–≤–æ \\"–ü–µ—Ç—ä—Ä –ë–µ—Ä–æ–Ω\\", 1999 –≥.

It sits at the border between the two Rotterdam municipalities Noord and Hillegersberg-Schiebroek. ==History== In 1899, the railway station Hillegersberg was opened on the new connecting line (Ceintuurbaan) between the railway from Rotterdam Delftsche Poort to Leiden, and the railway from Rotterdam Maasstation to Utrecht. In 1953 the railway from Rotterdam to Utrecht was rerouted to the new Rotterdam Centraal railway station through Hillegersberg. A new station building was constructed, and the station was renamed Rotterdam Noord. Rotterdam Noord is designed by architect Sybold van Ravesteyn who has also designed the stations Rotterdam Centraal, Eindhoven, and many other railway stations and buildings in the Netherlands. The station was opened on 4 October 1953. ==The building== The platform that leads to Utrecht is connected to a building, where there used to be an NS office that sold tickets. When this office disappeared and the tickets could only be bought at a ticket machine, the building was closed down. Since a few years back the building is used for an art-exposition. ==Train services== Rotterdam Noord is a station for local trains (Stoptrein and Sprinter in Dutch).

The lecithin‚Äìsphingomyelin ratio (a.k.a. L-S or L/S ratio) is a test of fetal amniotic fluid to assess for fetal lung immaturity. Lungs require surfactant, a soap-like substance, to lower the surface pressure of the alveoli in the lungs. This is especially important for premature babies trying to expand their lungs after birth. Surfactant is a mixture of lipids, proteins, and glycoproteins, lecithin and sphingomyelin being two of them. Lecithin makes the surfactant mixture more effective. ==Evaluation== The lecithin‚Äìsphingomyelin ratio is a marker of fetal lung maturity. The outward flow of pulmonary secretions from the fetal lungs into the amniotic fluid maintains the level of lecithin and sphingomyelin equally until 32‚Äì33 weeks gestation, when the lecithin concentration begins to increase significantly while sphingomyelin remains nearly the same. As such, if a sample of amniotic fluid has a higher ratio, it indicates that there is more surfactant in the lungs and the baby will have less difficulty breathing at birth. An L‚ÄìS ratio of 2.4 or more indicates fetal lung maturity and a relatively low risk of infant respiratory distress syndrome, and an L/S ratio of less than 1.5 is associated with a high risk of infant respiratory distress syndrome. If preterm delivery is necessary (as evaluated by a biophysical profile or other tests) and the L‚ÄìS ratio is low, the mother may need to receive steroids such as betamethasone to hasten the fetus' surfactant production in the lungs. ==Procedure== An amniotic fluid sample is collected via amniocentesis and the sample is spun down in a centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 3‚Äì5 minutes. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is performed on the supernatant, which separates out the components. Lecithin and sphingomyelin are relatively easy to identify on TLC and the predictive value of the test is good. ==See also== * Phosphatidylglycerol ‚Äì another amniotic fluid marker of fetal lung maturity * Surfactant-albumin ratio * Lamellar body count ==References== Category:Tests during pregnancy ","title":"Lecithin‚Äìsphingomyelin ratio"},{"id":"20483566","text":"Greenville Technical Charter High School (GTCHS) is a small school located on the Barton Campus of Greenville Technical College in Greenville, South Carolina, United States.

The book follows the adventures of Hollyleaf, Lionblaze, and Jayfeather. The book has sold over 250,000 copies. ==Plot summary== When Sol persuades almost all of ShadowClan to give up belief in StarClan, Tawnypelt takes her kits Flamepaw, Tigerpaw, and Dawnpaw to ThunderClan, hoping to find refuge there, stating that she and her kits did not want to be part of a Clan that does not believe in StarClan. In hope of helping ShadowClan, Jaypaw, along with Tigerpaw, Flamepaw, Dawnpaw, Hollyleaf and Lionblaze, create a fake sign from StarClan to show Blackstar StarClan is real. Blackstar is not convinced until the fake sign turns real when Raggedstar and Runningnose come to tell Blackstar to get rid of Sol and to still believe in StarClan. A greencough outbreak begins in ThunderClan, but the Clan is short of the remedy, catmint: in the previous battle with WindClan, cats trampled and killed the supply. Jaypaw has a dream telling him there is a fresh supply in WindClan territory. Jaypaw asks Lionblaze to fetch the catmint. Lionblaze initially refuses because of dreams where he kills Heatherpaw in the tunnels, but as the outbreak gets worse, he finally goes. Lionblaze gets the catmint and gives it to Jaypaw, but not without a tension-filled encounter with Heatherpaw, now called Heathertail. Soon the Clan is healed and Jaypaw finally receives his full medicine cat name, Jayfeather. At the same time, Jaypaw falls asleep with the scratched stick he had found previously; in his dream, he has travelled back to a time before the Clans. The lake territories are inhabited by a group of cats who loosely resemble a Clan, with sharpclaws being the equivalent of a Clan warrior. Jaypaw awakes as a young sharpclaw (warrior) called Jay's Wing. The Tribe is being threatened by human expansion and holds a vote to move to the mountains. Jaypaw realizes that this group of cats becomes the Tribe of Rushing Water, so he casts the deciding vote to send the group to the mountains eventually inhabited by the Tribe, before he awakes in the present time again. Then, during a storm, the camp catches fire. Jayfeather, Lionblaze, Hollyleaf, and Squirrelflight are trapped. Squirrelflight makes it through the flames and drags a stick through in an attempt to save her kits, but needs some help. Ashfur leaps in and drags it all the way through. Just as Lionblaze leaps on, though, Ashfur blocks the way. Squirrelflight begs him to let them through, but Ashfur tells her and the other three that he never forgave her for choosing Brambleclaw over him. He also reveals that he was the one who helped Hawkfrost set the trap for Firestar to show her the pain of losing a loved one as he had lost her. He says that he will now kill her kits in another attempt to hurt her. Squirrelflight then reveals a crucial secret: that he cannot hurt her that way because they are not her kits. She explains how she kept the secret from Brambleclaw and the whole of ThunderClan. Ashfur lets them live, but he threatens to tell her secret, and she is shocked that Ashfur would betray her. Knowing this, Jayfeather, Hollyleaf and Lionblaze no longer believe they are the Three. The fire burns out and all the cats help get the camp set up again. Three days before the Gathering, Ashfur asks Firestar if he can go. Hollyleaf, Lionblaze, Jayfeather, and Squirrelflight are worried that he is going to publicly announce their secret. Between then and the day of the Gathering, the three warn Ashfur that he will regret it if he reveals the secret. Although he is frightened, he refuses to listen to them. Right before the Gathering, the patrol of warriors going notices that both Ashfur and Squirrelflight are missing. On the way to the Gathering, they see Ashfur's body lying in the WindClan stream as if he had drowned. They take him back to camp and set him for vigil. Leafpool notices a slit in his neck, suggesting he was murdered. After the Gathering, Firestar announces that Ashfur's death was unknown and suspects a cat from ThunderClan may have killed him, and the three see Squirrelflight looking scared and holding her breath. The three vow to keep the recent events involving them, Squirrelflight, and Ashfur a secret. ==Reception== Horn Book Review said that Long Shadows moves very slowly, but that fans who have read the previous books would still enjoy it. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Warriors - The official Warriors website.

While this idea is quite common and often taprooted plants are used for this reason in companion planting, there is no scientific data supporting it, and the definition itself varies quite depending on the author. The closest thing with a proven scientific base are hyperaccumulators. The first to use the term dynamic accumulator in the above definition was probably Robert Kourik in his book Designing and Maintaining Your Edible Landscape‚ÄîNaturally (1986). After him many important permaculturists have used dynamic accumulators in their design systems and methods, such as Eric Toensmeier, Dave Jake and Toby Hemenway. ==See also== * Hyperaccumulator * List of hyperaccumulators * Permaculture ==References== Jake, Dave (2005).

Raymond Carver uses ambiguity in the story to describe the situation that is going on between the married couple. Although the problems they are having are not stated specifically, it is clear that the couple is moving apart from each other. The narrator shows us the husband getting ready to leave his wife, which turns into a yelling match. The man is packing a suitcase, getting ready to leave, when he demands to take their child with him. However, the couple then argues about the child as well. The wife holds the child, and they begin to argue about who should take care of the baby. The wife does not want him to have the baby, but the husband thinks he should have it. The couple begins grasping the baby by the arms. The wife has one arm and the husband has hold of the other. Then, the baby begins crying because it is apparently in some pain, due to the actions of the couple. The husband begins forcing his wife‚Äôs hands off of the baby, her grip slips off, but she grabs the baby again harder. The wife does the same thing, and the husband grabs the child by the top of his arm underneath the shoulder. The baby was slipping from both people, but they held on harder and pulled in the opposite directions. As the couple pulled on the child from its arms, it is apparent that they harmed the baby in some way, hence the last line of the story: ==ReferencesSources== *Oates, Joyce Carrol.

Over the next three years he would fight 13 more times without defeat against a series of journeymen opponents before earning the right to fight for the English title in May 2007. His opponent for the vacant English belt was fellow unbeaten prospect Stuart Elwell. The fight ended with a 10 round points victory for O'Donnell. Following his win over Elwell, O'Donnell next travelled to Las Vegas in May 2007 to fight Mexican Christian Solano on the undercard of Floyd Mayweather's fight with Oscar De La Hoya.Livefight  O'Donnell & Murray on Oscar undercard The bout ended with disappointment for the 15-0 prospect after the fight was stopped in the 2nd round giving victory to the Mexican. Such was the devastating nature of the defeat, O'Donnell took a year off from boxing and only returned in May 2008 with a win over journeyman Billy Smith. Four more victories followed in 2008 before being given the chance to fight for the Commonwealth title in 2009. ===Commonwealth champion=== O'Donnell's shot at a first major title came on 11 April 2009. In the opposite corner, the champion Craig Watson, had himself claimed the title with a win over Namibian Ali Nuumbembe and made one defence against Matthew Hatton, the brother of Ricky. It was a step up in class for O'Donnell and he signaled his entry into the top tier of domestic boxing with victory over Watson via a split decision in what was described as a close and scintillating contest. O'Donnell had been due to make the first defence of his newly won title on 5 September 2009 but due to problems making the weight had to settle for a non-title contest over 12 rounds against Tom Glover. The fight, shown live on ITV4, was too much of a step-up for Glover who was stopped in the 6th round with O'Donnell having taken full control.Boxing Scene  O'Donnell stops and overmatched Glover O'Donnell gave up the belt after coming under pressure from the Commonwealth council after a mandatory defence scheduled for 5 March 2010 against the Ghanaian boxer Philip Kotey fell through.Boxing News  Mark Thompson and Thomas McDonagh handed title chances On 7 May 2010 he stepped back into the ring to defeat Hungarian boxer Laszlo Balogh in the 5th round of an 8 round contest stating after the fight that he would like to meet Paul McCloskey in an all Irish contest for the European title.Boxing Scene  O'Donnell stops Balogh On 10 September 2010 O'Donnell fought the American former Olympic bronze medal winner Terrance Cauthen in an international contest at the York Hall. Winning the fight over 12 rounds O'Donnell claimed that Cauthen was the best boxer he had ever faced and that the reason why he gave up his Commonwealth belt was \\"because my team did not want that belt to hold me back, so I could go onto the next level\\". ===British title challenge=== On 19 February 2011 O'Donnell met former victim Craig Watson at the Wembley Arena to challenge for the vacant British title only for Watson to gain revenge by winning over 12 rounds.Sporting Life  Watson gains revenge on O'Donnell ==Professional record== - style=\\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:95%;\\" align=\\"center\\" colspan=832 Wins (11 knockouts, 21 decisions), 2 Losses (1 knockout, 1 decision)''' - style=\\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:95%;\\" align=center style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Res. align=center style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Record align=center style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Opponent align=center style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Type align=center style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Rd., Time align=center style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Date align=center style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Location align=center style=\\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\\"Notes -align=center -align=center Win 32-2 align=left Erick Ochieng    align=left align=left -align=center -align=center Win 31-2 align=left Tommy Tear    align=left align=left -align=center Win 30-2 align=left Jan Balog    align=left align=left -align=center Win 29-2 align=left Laszlo Fazekas    align=left align=left -align=center Win 28-2 align=left Jay Morris    align=left align=left -align=center Win 27-2 align=left Stephen Haughian    align=left align=left -align=center Win 26-2 align=left Thomas Mendez    align=left align=left -align=center Win 25-2 align=left Martin Welsh    align=left align=left -align=center Loss 24-2 align=left Craig Watson    align=left align=left -align=center Win 24-1 align=left Terrance Cauthen    align=left align=left -align=center Win 23-1 align=left Laszlo Robert Balogh    align=left align=left -align=center Win 22-1 align=left Tom Glover    align=left align=left -align=center Win 21-1 align=left Craig Watson    align=left align=left -align=center Win 20-1 align=left Suleyman Dag    align=left align=left -align=center Win 19-1 align=left Sergejs Sayrinovics    align=left align=left -align=center Win 18-1 align=left Sergejs Volodins    align=left align=left -align=center Win 17-1 align=left Jay Morris    align=left align=left -align=center Win 16-1 align=left Billy Smith    align=left align=left -align=center Loss 15-1 align=left Christian Solano    align=left align=left -align=center Win 15-0 align=left Stuart Elwell    align=left align=left -align=center Win 14-0 align=left Ernie Smith    align=left align=left -align=center Win 13-0 align=left Silence Saheed    align=left align=left -align=center Win 12-0 align=left Darren Gethin    align=left align=left -align=center Win 11-0 align=left Duncan Cottier    align=left align=left -align=center Win 10-0 align=left Karl Taylor    align=left align=left -align=center Win 9-0 align=left Zaid Bediouri    align=left align=left -align=center Win 8-0 align=left Matt Scriven    align=left align=left -align=center Win 7-0 align=left Ben Hudson    align=left align=left -align=center Win 6-0 align=left Ben Hudson    align=left align=left -align=center Win 5-0 align=left Duncan Cottier    align=left align=left -align=center Win 4-0 align=left Ernie Smith    align=left align=left -align=center Win 3-0 align=left Chris Long    align=left align=left -align=center Win 2-0 align=left Dave Hinds    align=left align=left -align=center Win 1-0 align=left Jason Nesbitt    align=left align=left ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1985 births Category:20th-century Irish people Category:21st-century Irish people Category:Living people Category:People from County Galway Category:English male boxers Category:Sportspeople from County Galway Category:Irish male boxers Category:Welterweight boxers ","title":"John O'Donnell (boxer)"},{"id":"20483895","text":"Jos√© Olallo Vald√©s (12 February 1820 - 7 March 1889) was a Cuban professed religious and a professed member from the Brothers Hospitallers of Saint John of God. Olallo was dubbed as the \\"Poor People's Priest\\" even though Olallo was not an ordained priest - he was even encouraged to become one but refused. Olallo served as a nurse for his entire life and dedicated himself to the care of the ill and the poor and remained a pivotal figure in the hospital that he worked at. Pope Benedict XVI approved his beatification and delegated Cardinal Jos√© Saraiva Martins to preside over it in Cuba on 29 November 2008. ==Life== Jos√© Olallo was born in 1820 and found abandoned on 13 March 1820 at the Saint Joseph orphanage in Havana where he was then raised until 1827. The infant was left in a small bundle with his birthdate attached and a note explaining he had not been baptized. He was then transferred to the Benefencia orphanage in Havana. He was baptized on 15 March 1820. In 1834 he applied for admission to the Brothers Hospitallers of Saint John of God who managed the Hospital of Saints Philip and James in Havana and was soon received into the order. He finished his novitiate in April 1835 and was assigned to serve at the order's Hospital of Saint John of God in Puerto Pr√≠ncipe (now modern Camag√ºey). He would spend the rest of his life there nursing the sick and the poor and in 1845 was made the head nurse of the hospital. In 1856 he was named as the prior of the group. Olallo was often dubbed the \\"Poor People's Priest\\" despite not being an ordained priest and even refused an offer to become one from the Archbishop of Santiago de Cuba upon the belief that he would no longer be able to work in the hospital that he came to love. He tended to victims of a cholera epidemic in 1833. Olallo faced major challenges in his pastoral mission of healthcare during Cuba's Ten Years' War (1868-1878) and gave aid to people on both sides; the Spanish forces commandeered the hospital for their own uses. He continued to minister to the neediest from among the civilian population despite this Spanish commandeering of the hospital and was able to intercede with the armed forces in order to prevent a massacre under the draconian treatment that the Spanish had decreed during that conflict. Olallo was faced with the suppression of all religious orders from the liberal Spanish government in 1869 and the expulsion of all religious from peninsular Spain. The death of the sole other remaining member of his order in 1876 saw him live alone for the remainder of his life. He died on 7 March 1889 and his remains were later relocated on 16 February 2008 to the chapel of the hospital where he served in. ==Beatification== The beatification process opened under Pope John Paul II on 7 February 1990 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" to the cause and titled him as a Servant of God; the diocesan process opened in the Archdiocese of Camag√ºey under the direction of Archbishop Adolfo Rodr√≠guez-Herrera from March to April 1990; the C.C.S. validated the cause on 1 February 1991. The historians approved the cause on 23 February 1999 before the C.C.S. received the Positio dossier from the postulation in 1999. Theologians approved the cause on 22 November 2005 as did the C.C.S. on 20 June 2006 before Pope Benedict XVI confirmed Olallo's heroic virtue and named him as Venerable on 16 December 2006. The process for a miracle opened in Camag√ºey under the direction of Archbishop Juan Garc√≠a Rodr√≠guez who oversaw the diocesan process from 9 February to 8 March 2004 prior to the C.C.S. validating the process on 18 June 2004. The medical board assented to this miracle on 24 May 2007 as did theologians on 30 October 2007 and the C.C.S. on 8 January 2008; Pope Benedict XVI approved this miracle - and Olallo's beatification - on 15 March 2008. Cardinal Jos√© Saraiva Martins presided over the beatification in Cuba on 29 November 2008 on the pope's behalf. The President of Cuba Raul Castro attended the beatification. Cardinal Jamie Lucas Ortega y Alamino and papal nuncio Luigi Nonazzi were also in attendance. Archbishop Juan Garc√≠a Rodr√≠guez was also in attendance. The beatification miracle was the cure of the three-year- old Daniela Cabrera Ramos. The current postulator for this cause is Fra Elia Tripaldi. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Hagiography Circle Category:1820 births Category:1889 deaths Category:19th-century Roman Catholics Category:19th-century venerated Christians Category:19th-century Cuban people Category:Beatified Roman Catholic religious brothers Category:Beatifications by Pope Benedict XVI Category:Brothers Hospitallers of Saint John of God Order Category:Burials in Cuba Category:Cuban nurses Category:Cuban beatified people Category:Cuban Roman Catholics Category:Male nurses Category:People from Havana Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope Benedict XVI ","title":"Jos√© Olallo"},{"id":"20483914","text":"The Fitzwilliam Strait () is a natural waterway through the central Canadian Arctic Archipelago in the Northwest Territories of Canada.

The area is now known as Buffalo Point. The new state park was developed with Civilian Conservation Corps labor in 1939 with the construction of park structures to plans from the National Park Service Branch of Plans and Designs. The CCC structures now comprise a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. One park highlight is a 3-mile trail. The Indian Rockhouse Trail is wonderfully scenic with many great points of interest including sculpted bedrock, a waterfall, a former zinc mine, and the Indian Rockhouse Cave. ==See also== *Big Buffalo Valley Historic District *Rush Historic District *Parker-Hickman Farm Historic District *National Register of Historic Places listings in Marion County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Parks on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:State parks of Arkansas Category:1939 establishments in Arkansas Category:Rustic architecture in Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures in Marion County, Arkansas Category:Civilian Conservation Corps in Arkansas Category:Geography of Marion County, Arkansas Category:State parks of the U.S. Interior Highlands Category:National Register of Historic Places in Marion County, Arkansas ","title":"Buffalo River State Park (Arkansas)"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:F}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function L(s,a,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâLife Quotesü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",R,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const I=d(B,[["render",L]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/34.md","filePath":"people/34.md"}'),E={name:"people/34.md"},D=Object.assign(E,{setup(s){return(a,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[C(I)]))}});export{H as __pageData,D as default};
