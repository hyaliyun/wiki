Walter Isaacson called the project the \\"biggest idea\\" to come out of the Aspen Ideas Festival during his tenure as CEO of the Aspen Institute. In January 2016, the project merged with ServiceNation and the Service Year Exchange project of the National Conference on Citizenship to form Service Year Alliance (a new 501c3 non-profit operating as a joint venture of the Aspen Institute and Be The Change, Inc.). ==History== In 2012, Stanley McChrystal was interviewed by Bob Schieffer at the Aspen Ideas Festival. As part of that interview, McChrystal was asked whether or not he believed in the draft. He responded that he thought every young person should serve, but the military does not need every young person, so we need to create more opportunities for all young Americans to serve. McChrystal's remarks generated a lot of enthusiasm within the Aspen Institute community and several leaders within the United States national service community, along with Aspen Institute CEO Walter Isaacson, approached him to see if he would be interested in helping to form a new initiative around the concept that every young person should do a year or more of national service. He agreed and the Franklin Project was created in October 2012 as a policy program of the Aspen Institute. The project built out a five-person team and a variety of councils of prominent Americans to advance the concept that a year or more of national service should become a common opportunity and expectation for young Americans. The project primarily relied on summits, convenings, initiatives, and writing by thought leaders associated with the project to make progress on its mission. Over time, the project began to explore how it might work more closely together with its partners ServiceNation, the Service Year Exchange project of the National Conference on Citizenship, and Voices for National Service. With support from the Einhorn Family Charitable Trust, the four organizations worked together to develop a joint operating plan to ensure their collective efforts were adding up to impact greater than the sum of their individual efforts. At the end of a year-long planning process, three of the organizations (the Franklin Project, Service Nation, the Service Year Exchange project of the National Conference on Citizenship) decided the best way to achieve the new plan was to merge. The new 501c3 non-profit organization is called Service Year Alliance, and operates as a joint venture between the Aspen Institute and Be The Change, Inc. Voices for National Service decided to remain independent, but is a close partner of the new organization. ==Summits21st Century National Service Summit=== From June 24‚Äì25, 2013, the project hosted the 21st Century National Service Summit in Aspen, Colorado, as the first ever signature lead-in event to the Aspen Ideas Festival.

The summit was sponsored by Mike and Jackie Bezos, the Resnick Family Foundation, JPMorgan Chase & Co., the MacArthur Foundation, Laura & Gary Lauder, the Tisch Illumination Fund, Julie Fisher Cummings, and Mike Gridley. The program collaborated with Democracy Journal to release an issue coinciding with the summit that featured a symposium on national service. ==InitiativesHuffington Post Series=== From June 2013 to November 2016, the project collaborated with the Huffington Post to tell stories of support for national service from a variety of perspectives, resulting in twenty-seven stories. The majority of these posts were a series of twenty-posts written by members of the Ambassadors Program in November 2016. ===Enlisting America Pledge=== In June 2014, the project released Enlisting America: A Call to National Service From Those Who Have Served. Top leaders and organizations representing the United States military endorsed two ideas by signing their name to the pledge: # There should be an opportunity - and expectation - that every young American serves their country for a year. # There are many ways to serve your country; military and civilian national service are two sides of the same coin. ===Employers of National Service=== On September 12, 2014, President Barack Obama launched the Employers of National Service initiative at the 20th Anniversary of AmeriCorps event on the South Lawn of the White House.Archive of Obama White House Blog https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/03/09/employers-national- service-and-americorps-vista-champions-change Accessed 6 March 2018. Employers participating in the initiative connect to the talent pipeline of AmeriCorps, Peace Corps, and other service year alumni, by indicating in their hiring processes that they view national service experience as a plus. The initiative is a collaboration between the program with the Corporation for National and Community Service, the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps Alums, and the National Peace Corps Association. To date, over 500 employers have joined the initiative.Employers of National Service Website. https://www.nationalservice.gov/special-initiatives/employers-national-service Accessed 6 March 2018. ===Service Year + Higher Education Innovation Challenge=== In Spring 2015, in partnership with the Lumina Foundation, the National Conference on Citizenship, and the Corporation for National and Community Service, the project ran a Service Year + Higher Education Innovation Challenge that \\"challenged higher education institutions to create innovative new service year opportunities connected to academic credit for their students.\\" Over 200 universities engaged in the challenge and 32 ultimately submitted detailed proposals for consideration. The top three proposals from each category (community college, public, and private categories) were invited to the Aspen Institute in Washington, DC to compete for $100,000 in prizes at an in-person pitch day on April 15, 2015. Finalists and winners of the challenge were: * Community College: Alamo Colleges; Miami Dade College (winner); and Salt Lake Community College * Public University: San Jose State; University of Kentucky; University of Massachusetts Dartmouth (winner) * Private University: Drake University (winner); Mount St. Joseph University; Saint Peter's University The challenge was run again in 2016 by the project's successor organization, Service Year Alliance. ===Ambassadors Program=== In May 2015, the project launched their Ambassadors Program, a twelve-month \\"leadership development program and local engagement strategy\\" with the aim of increasing support for national service in communities across the country. The program had three priorities: # Make national service part of the 2016 election conversation. # Increase the number of service year positions available in communities across the United States. # Steward the next generation of national service leaders. Forty-five ambassadors from twenty-five states were selected and began their term with a three-day training Alexandria, Virginia. ==Programs Inspired== A variety of programs and initiatives were created by participants inspired by the projects‚Äô programming. ===ArtistYear=== Margo Drakos and Elizabeth Warshawer founded ArtistYear after attending the 21st Century National Service Summit and were inspired to create the first national service program specifically for artists. ArtistYear brings the power of the arts to underserved schools with limited arts instruction and access by providing exceptional artists with a dedicated service year that goes beyond traditional community service outreach. Today, ArtistYear has corps members in three cities: Philadelphia, New York City, and Roaring Fork Valley, Colorado. ===NYC Service=== In July 2014, the project collaborated with NYC Service and United Way of New York City to help them launch their effort to double the number of service year opportunities in New York City. The effort was launched at a summit on the effort at the Roosevelt House, attended by over 100 heads of major institutions, academic centers, nonprofits and corporations. Speakers at the summit included: Bill DeBlasio, Mayor of New York City; Paula Gavin, Chief Service Officer of New York City; Sheena Wright, CEO of United Way of New York City; Jennifer Raab, President of Hunter College; Joel Berg, Executive Director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger; Felix V. Matos Rodriguez, President of Queens College; Tim McClimon, President of the American Express Foundation; and Laurie Tisch, President of the Laurie M. Tisch Illumination Fund. ===Tufts 1+4=== In collaboration with the project, Tufts University launched Tufts 1+4, in February 2014. The 1+4 program provides applicants to Tufts the opportunity to check off on their application that they would be interested in doing a year of service to begin their college experience. If admitted, Tufts places those interested students in selected service organizations to engage in a year of full-time national or international service before beginning the traditional college experience (hence 1 year of service + 4 years of traditional college experience). ===Baltimore Corps=== Fagan Harris was an early advisor to the project and went on to created Baltimore Corps, a service year program that seeks to \\"enlist talent to accelerate social innovation in Baltimore and advance a citywide agenda for equity and racial justice.\\" The Aspen Institute served as Baltimore Corps' fiscal sponsor as it got off the ground. ==LeadershipDirector=== The project was led by Marine Corps veteran Jason Mangone. Mangone shepherded the project's merger into its successor organization, Service Year Alliance, where he served as its founding Chief Operating Officer. ===Leadership Council=== The project was advised by a Leadership Council of prominent Americans. Retired U.S. Army General Stanley McChrystal served as Chair and former White House Domestic Policy Council Director John Bridgeland and City Year Co-Founder Alan Khazei served as Vice-Chairs. Examples of other notable members included Madeleine Albright, Barbara Bush, and Chelsea Clinton. ===Young Leaders Council=== The program ran a Young Leaders Council consisting of a bipartisan group of emerging millennial leaders from a variety of sectors. The council hoped to develop and steward future leaders who view universal national service as their generation's legacy and would be willing to work together across party lines to eventually foster bipartisan legislation in support of it. Examples of council members included: Steven Olikara, Founder and President of the Millennial Action Project; Joshua Marcuse, Chairman of the Young Professionals in Foreign Policy; John McCarthy, Executive Director of Future Civic Leaders; and Anastasia Dellaccio, Senior Officer at the UN Foundation. Featured speakers at council meetings included: Oliver Knox of Yahoo News, Representative Joe Kennedy, and Representative Seth Moulton. ==Publications21st Century National Service Action Plan=== At the 21st Century National Service Summit in June 2013, the project released its 21st Century National Service Action Plan, a 39-page plan that outlines how the United States could create a system of that engages at least one million young adults annually in a year of full-time national service as \\"civic rite of passage\\". The plan includes signatures by fifty-eight prominent Americans as endorsers. ===Voters for National Service=== The projected collaborated with Voices for National Service, Civic Enterprises, and Hart Research Associates to research voter perspectives on national service (1,000 voter sample size). In June 2013 they released the results in Voters for National Service: Perspectives of American Voters on Large-Scale National Service. The key findings of the study were: # American voters have a positive view of national service and a broad understanding of what the term national service means. # When asked what goals they have for our country, voters see many pressing needs and think the country could do more. # Voters overwhelmingly favor a system of voluntary national service, but oppose mandatory service. # Voters say the country and national service participants would benefit greatly‚Äîand in a variety of ways‚Äîfrom a national service program. # Despite voters' concerns with government spending, more than three in four say that increased funding for national service would be worth it. # Voters express real interest in participating in a national service program. # Voters favor a range of policy ideas to expand national service opportunities to more Americans, including many ideas currently being explored by the national service field. ===The Economic Value of National Service=== The project collaborated with Voices for National Service, Civic Enterprises, and the Center for Benefit-Cost Studies in Education at Columbia University to study the economic value of national service and published a report in September 2013 by the same name. The primary finding was that \\"the benefit-cost ratio is 3.9: for every dollar invested in the network of national service programs currently operating, there is a social return of almost four dollars.\\" Clive Belfield of Columbia University was the author of the study. ==References== Category:Nonprofit youth organizations based in the United States ","title":"Franklin Project"},{"id":"56789416","text":"The Belle Fourche Experiment Farm, located northwest of Newell, South Dakota off Highway 79, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

She was born and raised in New Orleans and her work reflected the influences of her youth, particularly the African American and Creole culture of New Orleans. ==Early history== Born Miriam Dorothy Newman, Newman was the daughter of Rebecca (Kiefer) and Isidore Newman, a New Orleans banker and businessman who later became known for his philanthropy. The Isidore Newman School in New Orleans was named for him in 1913. He was active in the New Orleans Jewish community, where he was also a founding member of B'nai B'rith. Miriam Newman was educated largely by governesses. She married Edwin A. Neugass at age 23. They moved to New York, where Neugass had a seat in the Stock Exchange. The couple had three children: Bessie, James, and Edwin. She was primarily a homemaker during this time. With the children grown, Newman enrolled in classes at Columbia University. After Neugass died in October 1921, she began her career as an artist. ==Career== She began telling stories and folk tales at the University Settlement in New York City and local schools. She published her first collection, Fairy Flowers, in 1926, under the name Isadora Newman, which became her nom de plume. The book was praised both in the U.S. and in translation abroad, and was followed by a poetry collection, Shades of Blue, in 1927, two books of folk tales in German in 1930, and a play, Granny‚Äôs Garden, first produced in 1931. She painted, primarily watercolors, and studied sculpture in France. She received a degree from La Horde Society. Her work was regularly exhibited at galleries in New York, Louisiana, as well as in European galleries. Apart from her artistic endeavors, Newman was recognized for her philanthropy. In 1926, the Serbian government recognized her efforts on behalf of war orphans. ==References== Category:1878 births Category:1955 deaths Category:American women poets Category:American women writers Category:American poets Category:Jewish writers Category:People from New Orleans ","title":"Isadora Newman"},{"id":"56789488","text":"The 1990 Cal State Hayward Pioneers football team represented California State University, HaywardCalifornia State University, East Bay was known as California State University, Hayward from 1972 to 2004. in the 1990 NCAA Division II football season.

D‚ÄôAmico explored the essence of the art experience as spiritual involvement, and the ability to communicate one's most profound ideas and emotions through aesthetic expression. He considered that the individual's personality had to be respected and developed by providing opportunities for creative experimentation. D'Amico's philosophy was based on the fundamental faith in the creative potential in every man, woman and child. He believed \\"that the arts are a humanizing force and their major function is to vitalize the living.\\" Recognizing learning as a process that is unique in each individual, D'Amico embraced the different ways in which each person's experience, ability and perception require a different approach to teaching. Teaching by this informal process, according to D'Amico, meant that the teacher must be constantly sensitive to the needs of each individual so as to stimulate and satisfy emerging interests. Victor D'Amico was not only a remarkable artist and teacher, but also a visionary and pioneer of modern art education. == Life and works == Victor D‚ÄôAmico was born on May 19, 1904 in New York City. D‚ÄôAmico was one of the eleven children (seven boys and four girls) born to Concetta Paula (Jennie) Vitale and Domenico Emilio D‚ÄôAmico. Victor D‚ÄôAmico's mother and father were born in Italy. Concetta arrived to the United States when she was one year old while Domenico emigrated to the United States when he was nineteen. Victor D‚ÄôAmico spent his childhood in Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx (New York City); and Cuyahoga in Cleveland (Ohio). Victor attended the Cooper Union, studying fine arts, illustration, and costume design (1920‚Äì1922); Pratt Institute, studying art education (1924‚Äì1926) and Teachers College Columbia University (1926‚Äì1930) where he earned his B. S. and M.S. D‚ÄôAmico also studied and worked with Norman Bel Geddes (1928‚Äì29). While studying at Teachers‚Äô College, D‚ÄôAmico was hired as art teacher and Head of the Art Department of the Fieldston Schools, Riverdale, NYC from 1926 to 1948. While working at Fieldston, D‚ÄôAmico joined MoMA part-time as director of the Educational Project in 1937. In 1948 D‚ÄôAmico started working full-time at MoMA as Director of the Education Department and remained in the post until he retired in 1969. At MoMA, D‚ÄôAmico created and directed the Young People's Gallery, the Children's Art Carnival (in New York, Italy, Spain, Belgium, India and Harlem), the Committee on Art Education,the Veterans Art Center, The People's Art Center and the Napeague Institute of Art best known as the Art Barge. D‚ÄôAmico also produced Through the Enchanted Gate, a NBC television program presented in 1952 and 1953. D‚ÄôAmico's most significant writings include Theatre Arts, Visual Arts in General Education, Creative Teaching in Art, How to Make Pottery and Ceramic Sculpture, How to Make Modern Jewelry, How to Make Objects of Wood, Art for the Family, Experiments in Creative Art Teaching, Found Objects, Collage Kit, and The Art of Assemblage. D‚ÄôAmico authored many research papers published in different journals and lectured widely in the US and abroad. Following D'Amico's retirement from MoMA, he taught classes for New York City Grade Teachers at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC and remained as Director of the Napeague Institute of Art, later renamed the Victor D‚ÄôAmico Institute of Art, a non-profit art education organization on eastern Long Island. D'Amico was granted the Medal of Honor by The National Gallery of Art, Washington, D. C. for Outstanding Service in the Field of Art Education on March 17, 1966. He received the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Fine Arts by the Philadelphia Museum College of Art on June 8, 1964 and received a Citation of Merit by the State University of New York at Buffalo, April 13, 1964. Victor D‚ÄôAmico combined his museum and school work with university and college teaching. He taught art education at Teachers College, Columbia University (1932, 1934‚Äì42), Black Mountain College (1944), the New York University (1965‚Äì72) and Southampton College (1969). While teaching art education at Teachers College Columbia University in the 1930s, D‚ÄôAmico met Mabel Birckhead, a bright student and a fine artist teacher. In 1945 they got married. Victor and Mabel D‚ÄôAmico lived in the house they built in Lazy Point, Amagansett. Victor D‚ÄôAmico died on April 1, 1987, in Amagansett, New York, at the age of 82. == Art, a Human Necessity == D‚ÄôAmico believed that developing an aesthetic vision and art practice was both personally and collectively enriching, as it allows for a greater appreciation of the natural and built world. Regardless of artistic talent, D‚ÄôAmico considered that creativity is intrinsic to every individual and should be fostered through art education D‚ÄôAmico stressed the importance of discouraging imitation and supporting individual expression. By challenging accepted norms and encouraging unconventional perspectives, D‚ÄôAmico argued that the value of art making far surpassed that of the final product. It was the process and experience of interacting with art itself that inspired new thought. D‚ÄôAmico therefore dedicated his life to the creation of programs that allowed children and adults to explore their creative potential and heighten their sensitivity to the artistic potential in everyday life. The study of modern art was central to D‚ÄôAmico's educational philosophy. He believed that lived experience was intrinsically linked to modern art. A student's physical environment therefore held an important role in their educational development. D‚ÄôAmico stressed that through art making, a student would be introduced to elements of design: color, shape and composition that would emerge in everyday objects. The use of motivational toys became integral to his practice. As he notes, ‚Äútoys have an important place is creative growth of the child...They are his first possessions and the objects of profound interest and affection. Through them he is introduced to the elements of design, texture, pattern, form, color and rhythms as they become the tools of his activity and his imagination.‚Äù D‚ÄôAmico also explored the role of parents as teachers. In his thirteen-week television series Through the Enchanted Gate (1952‚Äì53) and subsequent publication Art for the Family, D‚ÄôAmico stressed that ‚Äúall people have creative ability and that anyone at any age can enjoy and develop his aptitudes in art.‚Äù Developing the creative interests of his student's parents would help ensure the presence of art in the home and promote a student's individualized tactile development, artistic collaboration, and aesthetic sensitivity. D‚ÄôAmico was influenced by John Dewey‚Äôs experience-based pedagogy and utilized environment to stimulate creativity. In turn, he often took a laboratory style approach to learning. D‚ÄôAmico promoted engagement and interactivity in many of his museum programs and exhibitions. From the Children‚Äôs Art Carnival, which promoted play as a form of motivation, to the Young People‚Äôs Gallery, which gave high school students the rare experience of curating an exhibition, D‚ÄôAmico expanded the boundaries of the classroom. == MoMA Education == For more than three decades (1937‚Äì1969), D‚ÄôAmico served as the Director of MoMA‚Äôs Education Department. D‚ÄôAmico's programs included: the Young People‚Äôs Gallery, the National Committee on Art Education, The War Veterans‚Äô Art Center, the People's Art Center, the Children's Art Carnival, and Classes for Parents and Children. === The New York City High School Program === The program for the New York City High Schools began at the Museum of Modern Art in 1937 as a privately financed experiment involving the participation of twelve schools and The Museum of Modern Art. It included exhibitions sent to schools and a Young People's Gallery at the Museum containing exhibitions designed for and by young people. After the first two- year pilot, this program expanded through the funding of the Museum and the Board of Education. Schools were supplied with more than 100 visual aids, including exhibitions, slide talks, teaching models, teaching portfolios and films, which were seen by more than 350,000 school children each year. Exhibits, libraries of color reproductions, museum books which students could borrow and take home, teaching portfolios designed for classroom use and art films were among the materials that circulated. \\"The record of this program,\\" Victor D'Amico said, \\"and the exhibitions are a tribute to the Board of Education teachers whose interest sustained the program and whose cooperation with the Museum over the years has been an adventure.\\" Olive Reilly, Director of Art of the Board of Education, called the program \\"an outstanding example of the fine contribution that a museum, through its educational department, can make to public school education.\\" === The Young People's Gallery === The Young People's Gallery was opened under the direction of Victor D‚ÄôAmico on December 1, 1937. The Young People's Gallery was an ‚Äúeducational experiment‚Äù with the intent of making the Museum's collection more accessible to New York public and private schools. All exhibitions shown in the Young People's Gallery were selected for, or by, pupils in the art classes of secondary schools. Student juries composed of delegates from all the schools selected and hung the exhibitions. The project sought to give students a hands-on experience curating and producing art exhibitions. Victor D'Amico designed special equipment in the Young People's gallery so that it served both as gallery and art studio. This included community easels, a continuous chain of desks folded flat against two of the walls and a large screen that covered an entire wall of the gallery that could be opened to form narrow drop shelves on which paintings may be stood and easily removed to make way for more paintings during demonstrations and lectures to classes. === The Children's Art Carnival === In 1942, D‚ÄôAmico founded the widely acclaimed Children's Art Carnival program at the Museum of Modern Art, where it would be presented periodically for over twenty years. D‚ÄôAmico initially conceived of the Children's Art Carnival as an experiment in art education that would be offered to children throughout New York City. In line with his seminal belief that art education should focus on individual experimentation as opposed to the practice of rote techniques, The Children's Art Carnival fostered an environment in which children were encouraged to make creative decisions. As D‚ÄôAmico writes in his book, Experiments in Creative Art Teaching, the directive of the Children's Art Carnival was ‚Äú...to free the child of his clich√©s or imitative mannerisms and to help him discover his own way of seeing and expressing.‚Äù Within each hour-long session, children ranging in age from three to twelve engaged in a series of motivational activities. Aside from the trained teachers, adults were not permitted. The first half of the workshop was for children to interact with a series of motivational toys that encouraged the exploration of line, color, and form that would be stimulate their art making. They were then brought to a studio where they had open access to a variety of mediums and materials. While The Children's Art Carnival encouraged individual expression and exploration, D‚ÄôAmico stressed the import role of the teacher. As he noted, it is the teacher's responsibility to be sensitive to the needs of their students and create an open environment that both motivates and informs. The Children's Art Carnival went on to receive international recognition. In 1957, the Museum of Modern Art presented the program at the International Trade Fairs in Milan and Barcelona. The program was then featured in the United States Pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair in Belgium. In 1962, on behalf of the International Council of The Museum of Modern Art and The Asia Society, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy presented The Children's Art Carnival to Indira Gandhi as a gift for the National Children's Museum in New Delhi, India. In 1963 the program toured major cities throughout India. In 1969, the Museum of Modern Art sponsored the incorporation of the Children's Art Carnival at The Harlem School of the Arts, where it was free to Harlem residents in Head Start programs, day care centers, public schools and numerous neighborhood organizations. The Children's Art Carnival was initially financed by the Museum of Modern Art, with subsequent contributions from individuals and foundations, including The Ford Foundation, The New York Times Foundation, The New York Fund for Children, the Van Amerigen Fund, and the Heckscher Foundation for Children. Betty Blayton Taylor served as the Carnival's Executive Director, with the aid of Consulting and Advisory Boards composed of Harlem residents. === The National Committee on Art Education === The National Committee on Art Education was started in 1942 as an attempt to rebel against the business interests of larger national arts organizations. Chaired by D‚ÄôAmico and funded by the Museum of Modern Art the committee grew during the first few years to over a thousand members, most of them art professionals. The committee, which met annually, sought to question and transform art education practices of the time (contests, copy books and paint- by-number kits, and teacher training). The Committee on Art Education gathered a range of thinkers, artists and educators including Walter Gropius, Waldo Frank, Hale Woodruff, Viktor Lowenfeld, Belle Boas, Marcel Breuer, Herbert Read, Margaret Mead, Archibald Macleish, Meyer Schapiro, Robert Motherwell and Ben Shahn amongst others as keynote speakers. The committee also organized meetings with artists like Buckminster Fuller, Joan Mir√≥, Martha Graham, Edward Hopper, Georgia O‚ÄôKeeffe, Alexander Calder, Marc Chagall, William Zorach, Jacques Lipchitz, Jos√© De Creeft and Henri Cartier-Bresson amongst others. Labelling itself as ‚Äúan avant-garde group,‚Äù the committee became prestigious for its noted affiliates and associations with MoMA. === The War Veteran's Art Center === The Museum of Modern Art's Armed Services Program, established during World War II, supplied art materials to men and women in uniform through the United Service Organization. With the end of the war, the program expanded its offerings at the MoMA. The War Veteran Art Center opened in the summer of 1944 on West Fifty-sixth Street, with additional studio spaces at 681 Fifth Avenue. From 1944 to 1948, the center was devoted exclusively to veterans ‚Äúto discover the best and the most effective ways of bringing about, through the arts, the readjustment of the veteran to civilian life.‚Äù D‚ÄôAmico insisted on distinguishing the work of the War Veterans‚Äô Art Center from art therapy, with the expectation that veterans would develop their own individual aptitude. The program eventually expanded into the People's Art Center, which accepted non-veterans. === The People's Art Center === The People's Art Center grew out of the structure and success of the War Veteran's Art Center. It opened in 1948 and offered classes in painting, ceramics, collage, and assemblage. Approximately 800 children and 500 adults attended the classes weekly. === Through the Enchanted Gate === In 1952 and 1953, MoMA and WNBC-WNBT co-produced a television series called Through the Enchanted Gate created by Victor D‚ÄôAmico and NBC vice president Ted Cott. Hosted by Ben Grauer and D‚ÄôAmico himself, the series broadcast art projects and activities that took place at the People's Art Center to a national audience. Instructional pamphlets were available to families to try the exercises at home. Rene d'Harnoncourt, Director of the Museum during the 1950s, felt that \\"Through the Enchanted Gate points the way to far-reaching possibilities in the Museum's constant aim to extend all its educational opportunities to wider and wider audiences.\\" === The Children's Art Caravan === Victor D‚ÄôAmico was intent on expanding the Children's Art Carnival, and in 1969, created The Children's Art Caravan. Financed by a grant from The John D. Rockefeller 3rd Fund, the Caravan consisted of two trailers that were designed as mobile art stations for children whose schools lacked art programs or proper facilities. Continuing in his vision of The Children's Art Carnival as a workshop for teachers as well as children, The Children's Art Caravan included visual aids and texts that would guide the teachers in D‚ÄôAmico's educational philosophy. In 1972, the New York Board of Education's Learning Cooperative proposed the prototype of the two-car caravan, created by Victor D‚ÄôAmico and his wife Mabel, to various school districts, but it was ultimately unable to receive adequate funding. === The Kearsarge Art Center, \\"The Art Barge\\" === In 1955, D‚ÄôAmico sought to find a permanent location for the art classes that were initially offered by the MoMA at Ashawagh Hall in Springs, New York. In March 1960, with the help of local baymen, D‚ÄôAmico anchored a WWII Navy barge in Napeague Harbor. A second story was added, creating additional studio space with panoramic views of both Napeague Harbor and the Atlantic Ocean. Originally named Kearsarge, a Native American word meaning ‚Äúplace of heaven,‚Äù it was affectionately known as The Art Barge. == The Victor D'Amico Institute of Art == In 1982, The Art Barge was renamed as The Victor D'Amico Institute of Art. It was Directed by Victor D'Amico until he passed away in 1987. Christopher Kohan is the current President of the Victor D'Amico Institute of Art. The Institution applies D'Amico's ideas to face current challenges in art education. The Institute recognizes the artistic potential within every man, woman, and child. Through weekend workshops, open studio sessions, and evening events, The Art Barge is an accessible art center that prides itself on furthering arts education and reflecting the rich art history of Long Island. The Victor D'Amico Institute of Modern Art === Mabel & Victor D'Amico Studio & Archive === Adding to the integrity of The Barge, The Mabel & Victor D‚ÄôAmico Studio & Archive located in the house that Victor and Mabel D'Amico built comprises an extensive collection of research materials that relate to their teaching and art practice: photos, films, articles, books, motivational materials and artwork. From early modernist architecture and furnishings to found object sculptures and collected items, The House contains many treasures from the private world of D'Amico and his wife Mabel and is open to the public for tours and private functions throughout the winter by appointment only. == References == Category:Black Mountain College faculty Category:New York University faculty Category:1904 births Category:1987 deaths Category:Artists from New York City Category:American people of Italian descent Category:Teachers College, Columbia University alumni Category:Cooper Union alumni Category:Pratt Institute alumni Category:Teachers College, Columbia University faculty ","title":"Victor D'Amico"},{"id":"56789514","text":"Nicol√°s S√°nchez may refer to: * Nicol√°s S√°nchez (footballer, born 1986), Argentine defender * Nicol√°s S√°nchez (footballer, born 1992), Argentine midfielder * Nicol√°s S√°nchez (footballer, born 1997), Argentine midfielder * Nicol√°s S√°nchez (rugby union), Argentine fly-half ","title":"Nicol√°s S√°nchez"},{"id":"56789542","text":"Congregation Beth Israel in Portland, Oregon, 2008 The Orthodox Jewish population in Portland has increased since 2005. ==Synagogues== Congregation Beth Israel representation at Portland's 2014 pride parade Synagogues in Oregon include: Congregation Beth Israel, Congregation Neveh Shalom, Congregation Shaarie Torah, and Temple Beth Israel (Eugene). ==People== * Ernest Bloch * Ben Boloff * Michael Dembrow * Neil Goldschmidt * Bernard Goldsmith * Henry Heppner * Solomon Hirsch * Marshall Holman * Vera Katz * Bernard Malamud * Julius Meier * Harry Mittleman * Rose Naftalin * Richard L.

Before she was ten her mother died in childbirth. She spent her childhood in Toledo until moving with her father to Arguedas. In 1973 she married Miguel Galarret and they soon had three children. Much later she gave birth to another child. At times Fern√°ndez experienced emotional agitation, including an episode which led to her youngest child being taken into care by social services and housed elsewhere, resulting in a situation in which Fern√°ndez could not determine her child's location. Villagers mockingly called her La Pinturitas because of the extravagant makeup she often covered her face with. At 50 ‚Äúpara olvidar las penas‚Äù, to forget her pains, she began to paint. This activity became central to her existence, and a decade later she felt that ‚ÄúMe he ganado el respeto de los j√≥venes‚Äù, she had gained the respect of the young people. She continues to paint as of 2018. ==Work== Mar√≠a √Ångeles Fern√°ndez Cuesta began creating works which blended image: people, animals and faces, with text, as a means to express and ease troubling emotions, in 2000 when she was 50 years old. She chose to make her paintings on the exterior walls of a derelict building in Arguedas that was near a busy roadway. Her paintings came to completely cover the walls of the building in bright primary colored paintings that stretch fifty meters. ==Recognition== Photographer Herv√© Couton discovered Maria Angeles Fernandez Cuesta's paintings in 2009 and has returned yearly to create photographs of her work, which have been published internationally in periodicals such as Raw Vision and on the internet. In 2015 the society \\"Les Amis de La Pinturitas D'Arguedas\\", Friends of La Pinturitas of Arguedas, was established in Montauban, France. ==References *La Pinturitas work Category:1950 births Category:Spanish women artists Category:People from Toledo, Spain Category:Outsider artists Category:Women outsider artists Category:Visionary artists Category:Visionary environments Category:21st-century Spanish painters Category:Living people Category:21st- century women artists ","title":"Mar√≠a √Ångeles Fern√°ndez Cuesta"},{"id":"56789579","text":"LAstronomie () is a monthly astronomy magazine published by the Soci√©t√© astronomique de France (French Astronomical Society).

Rudd had been living in the D.C. General Shelter with her mother, when she was befriended by janitor Khalil Tatum, a former felon. Rudd stopped attending school, but it was a month before her absence was reported to police. Investigation revealed that the last sighting of her had been weeks prior when she was caught on camera with Tatum at an area hotel. Tatum's wife was found shot dead in a hotel in Prince George's County, Maryland in mid-March, and at the end of March, searchers found Tatum's body in a shed in the Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens, shot in an apparent suicide. The case of Relisha Rudd received little coverage outside of the Washington D.C. area, leading to criticism that her case receives little attention due to her marginalization as a Black girl and from an impoverished family. ==Disappearance== In 2014, Rudd was living with her mother Shamika Young at the D.C. General Shelter. Khalil Tatum was a 51-year- old janitor at the shelter, and had a felony record for burglary, larceny, and breaking-and-entering. Tatum was imprisoned from 1993 to 2003, and again from 2004 to 2011. He was hired as a shelter janitor by the Community Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness, a contractor which operated the D.C. General Shelter and reportedly \\"other city homeless programs\\". Tatum was known for inappropriately fraternizing with shelter residents, and for paying particular attention to young girls. Tatum befriended Young, bought her daughter a tablet computer, and took her to see Disney on Ice. Eventually Young allowed Tatum to take the girl away overnight, allegedly to stay with him and his grandmother. Rudd suddenly stopped attending school in February, but her mother provided a note saying she was having health problems and was in the care of a \\"Dr. Tatum\\". The school contacted Tatum at the number provided, but when he failed to show up for a meeting with them, a counselor contacted the police to report Rudd missing. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia launched a missing-persons probe on 19 March, by which point Rudd had not been in school for a month. The investigation revealed that Tatum and Rudd had been caught on camera walking down a hallway in a Holiday Inn Express in Northeast, Washington, D.C. on 26 February, and footage on 1 March showed her walking with Tatum to a room in a Days Inn on New York Avenue in D.C. The March 1st footage proved to be the last proof that Rudd was still alive. ==Tatums' wife's death== Tatum's wife Andrea was found shot in the head in a motel in Prince George's County, Maryland on the same day Rudd was reported missing (March 20). Surveillance tapes showed Kahlil and Andrea Tatum entering the hotel room the night before. Kahlil Tatum was last seen 2 March, the day after Rudd was last seen, while buying a shovel, lime, and 42-gallon trash bags. DC police obtained an arrest warrant for Kahlil Tatum in his wife's murder, but on 31 March, Tatum's body was found in a shed in Kenilworth Park, dead of apparent suicide, from the same gun that killed his wife. ==Steve Wilkos TV show== In October, 2017, Relisha's mother, Shamika Young; her stepfather, Antonio Wheeler; and her grandmother, Melissa Young appear on The Steve Wilkos TV show. In polygraph tests, they are asked \\"Did you participate in any way in the disappearance of Relisha?\\". Both the stepfather Antonio & the grandmother Melissa answer \\"No\\", and the polygraph results confirm that they were telling the truth. Relisha's mother Shamika refuses to take the polygraph test. ==Theories== There are a limited number of theories for what happened to Rudd, given Tatum's predatory behavior and violent murder-suicide shortly after her disappearance. Authorities generally believe that Rudd was either murdered by Tatum, or was sold to sex-traffickers. But the sex trafficking theory has been ruled out by DC Metropolitan Police Detectives. In an interview with The Washington Post, a senior law-enforcement official suspected that Tatum had been sexually exploiting Rudd, and possibly pimping her to others, and may have killed his wife due to her finding out about his activities. Other theories are that Ricky Sheridan Lyles Sr. who is Tatum's brother in law may be a part of this and could have killed Tatum. Shamika Young (Relisha's Mother) stated on The Steve Wilkos Show that Tatum was shot twice. Lyles was questioned but they ruled him out as not being a P.O.I.

He lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. ==Background== Logan Hicks was born in 1971 and grew up south of Baltimore, Maryland. In 1993 he left Maryland Institute College of Art a couple of classes short of a degree to start a screen printing business in Baltimore where printed t-shirts, stickers and posters. In 1999 he moved to San Diego after befriending Shepard Fairey. Leaving his screen printing press behind in Baltimore he began to use stencils for his own art. In 2001 he moved to Los Angeles. In 2007 he moved back to the East Coast, relocating to Brooklyn, New York where he continues to exhibit his work. In 2008 Hicks was one of two artists selected by Banksy to represent the United States in the Cans Festival in London. In 2010 he was selected to paint at Wynwood Walls In Miami by real estate visionary Tony Goldman. In 2016 he paint a mural at the home of the Miami Dolphins - Hard Rock Stadium. ==Artwork== Called a painter with a photographer's eye, Hicks‚Äô work has largely focused on the perception of the environment, at times humanizing its architectural angles and structures, and at others using its vastness to explore self identity. With an old masters approach to lighting, Hicks sculpts ordinary architectural scenes into deeply metaphorical and contemplative imagery through stenciled aerosol. Over the years, Hicks has developed his impeccable photorealistic style using stencils, sometimes using up to 15 layers of stencil to achieve this precision. Working from his own photographs, subjects are translated to multiple layers of stencils, brought to bold dimensionality by blending colors through aerosol. ==Bowery wall== ‚ÄúStory of My Life‚Äù is the title of a mural made by Hicks at the intersection of Houston Street and the Bowery in New York City. Made of 1,050 stencils and measuring 70-feet by 20-feet, this mural is composed of images of 150 people. The mural ‚Äúcontains friends, family and people that the artist personally knows around New York. ==References *https://streetartnews.net/2017/01/artist-interview-logan- hicks-and-the-bowery-wall-print-release-012617-at-taglialatella-gallery- nyc.html Category:Street artists Category:Living people Category:Artists from New York City Category:1971 births Category:American contemporary artists Category:Maryland Institute College of Art alumni Category:Artists from Baltimore ","title":"Logan Hicks"},{"id":"56789734","text":"The Battle of In-Delimane was a series of armed clashes in the area of In- Delimane in the Gao Region of Mali. == Timeline == On 12 January 2018, a suicide bomber blew himself up near a patrol of French soldiers in In- Delimane, wounding three soldiers. No group claimed responsibility, but ISIL was suspected. About a month later on 21 February 2018, two French soldiers were killed, and a third wounded, after an IED exploded during their patrol. The Al-Qaeda affiliate JNIM claimed responsibility afterwards. Two days later on 23 February 2018, the Imghad Tuareg Self-Defense Group and Allies (GATIA) and the Movement for the Salvation of Azawad (MSA), in collaboration with France, launched an operation to capture or kill Abu Walid al-Sahrawi, the ISIL commander in Mali. Six jihadists were killed or captured while one vehicle originally belonging to the Nigerien military was recovered; however Sahrawi managed to evade capture. On 6 March 2018, a combined group of GATIA and MSA fighters fought ISIL forces in the Tinzouragan area, close to Delimane, resulting in the deaths of five jihadists, including one high level commander named Djibo Hamma. Ten other militants and vehicles were captured.

Her work relates performance, control, and freedom to the embodied experience of architectonic and computational life. Her early installations and collaborative work explored performance in relation to the built environment. Using the music recording studio, film production set, industrial factory, data centers, and office work environment as production sites, Tajima examined how these spaces shape our activities and bodies. In each project, the performing subject confronts determined situations and seeks new possibilities through modes of non-performance and autonomy. Her other work draws on technologies used to control and affect the human body and mind. This includes techniques that shape psychological desires and our experience of space and time. ‚ÄúFrom architectural systems to ergonomic design to psychographic data, her works operate in the space between the transient and the tangible, and highlight the complex networks of power and submission that we experience in relationship to our physical bodies and virtual selves.‚Äù Through a residency at the Fabric Workshop, Tajima developed her Negative Entropy woven portrait series in which she focused on mechanical textile production, in particular the development of the Jacquard loom, as a technology linked to these early modes of industry, but also one that developed into our current age of computing and information management. Meridian (2016), was developed using sentiment analysis and prediction technology, where the light sculpture responds in real time to the collective mood of a population expressed on live Twitter feeds from a particular geographic region, such as Istanbul. Her exhibitions include Disassociate (2007), The Double (2008), and Negative Entropy (2014). == Collaboration == In 2003, she co-founded New Humans, a collaborative group including artists Eric Tsai and Howie Chen to make works involving sound, installation, and performance actions. New Humans is a moniker for Mika Tajima's projects with other musicians, artists and designers. New Humans performances and projects include Vito Acconci, Charles Atlas, Judith Butler, John Smith, C. Spencer Yeh, among others. == Biography == Tajima earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Fine Arts and East Asian Studies from Bryn Mawr College in 1997, and a Master of Fine Arts graduate degree from the Columbia University School of the Arts in 2003. That year she was also a Post-Graduate Apprentice at The Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia. ==Awards== In 2007 she received an Artadia Award. == References  External links == * *New Humans Category:Artists from Los Angeles Category:Bryn Mawr College alumni Category:Columbia University School of the Arts alumni Category:1975 births Category:Living people ","title":"Mika Tajima"},{"id":"56789926","text":"The Belle Fourche Band Shell is a band shell in Herrmann Park in Belle Fourche, South Dakota.

Chassell was \\"a well-respected doctor and very active in community activities\\", including in the Belle Fourche Commercial Club and the local Masonic lodge. Three of the children participated in band and performed \\"in park concerts with the Cowboy Band\\", which was a municipal band formed in 1922; there were previous bands as far back as 1897. Only one firm, Carl Anderson & Son, bid on constructing the complete band shell. The bid, for 5,210, was covered by Chassell's donation plus funds from a park trust account. Reportedly \\"Most builders in the area refused to bid on the project because they didn‚Äôt think the curved ceiling and roof could be built. Bud [Anderson] later joked that he and his dad were 'too dumb to know that, so we just did it.' The Andersons set up an on-site ‚Äúshop‚Äù to fabricate the trusses by laminating six-foot lengths of 2 x 6 fir lumber and then sawing them into the needed shapes. Covering the outside of the dome with shiplap and slate roofing wasn't difficult, but covering the inside of the dome proved to be a challenge. They chose to use six-inch tongue-and-groove flooring material that had to be bent inward and downward at the same time. This required true ingenuity and the Andersons, with local blacksmith Ray Oliver, designed and fabricated a tool that made this bending process not only possible, but easy to use. This tool is apparently still in Bud's collection at hishome.\\" Dr. Chassell also suggested the city should install permanent seating in front of the band shell, but this was not ever done. ==References== Category:Band shells Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1954 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Butte County, South Dakota ","title":"Belle Fourche Band Shell"},{"id":"56789940","text":"The eighth series of banknotes of the Canadian dollar was first released by the Bank of Canada in 2018. Like the preceding 2011 Frontier series, the 2018 series consists of polymer banknotes designed for increased durability and to incorporate more security features. It is the first series issued by the Bank of Canada printed in a vertical configuration. The banknotes were designed by the Canadian Bank Note Company, which also prints the banknotes. The first note, the $10 bill featuring Viola Desmond, was revealed on International Women's Day, March 8, 2018, and was released to the public on November 19, 2018.https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/a-giant-step-forward-new-10-bill-featuring- viola-desmond-to-enter-circulation-1.4182073 Future notes will come at a slower pace than previous series to allow technological innovations to be worked into their design as time goes on. In January 2020, the Bank of Canada confirmed it would begin soliciting suggestions for the historic Canadian who would replace Wilfrid Laurier on the $5 note. ==$10 note== The $10 note is purple, and the obverse features a portrait of Viola Desmond, a Black Nova Scotian businesswoman who challenged racial segregation at a film theatre in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, in 1946. The background of the portrait is a colourful rendition of the street grid of Halifax, Nova Scotia, including the waterfront, Citadel, and Street, where Desmond's Studio of Beauty Culture was located. Foil features on the note face include both the Flag and Coat of Arms of Canada. This is the first Canadian banknote to feature neither a prime minister nor a member of the royal family in its solo portrait, and the first to feature a solo female Canadian other than the Queen. The reverse features the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Part of the background pattern mirrors the museum's interior architecture and its ramps connecting multiple levels. A foil eagle feather is prominent, symbolizing ideals such as truth, power and freedom. A quotation from section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms appears in both English and French. The foil window at the base of the note includes an iridescent rendering of the Library of Parliament's vaulted dome ceiling, which can be seen from both sides of the note. In 2019, the International Bank Note Society awarded the design the top prize in its annual banknote design competition. It won against new currency designs from Switzerland, Norway, Russia and the Solomon Islands. ==References== * * Category:Banknotes of Canada Category:2018 in Canada Category:Portraits on banknotes ","title":"2018 Canadian banknote series"},{"id":"56789948","text":"Alicia Jo Rabins is a performer, musician, singer, composer, poet, writer, and Jewish scholar.

The video projection Fields (2001) presented this archive as an aesthetic experience unfurling in staccato fashion, while the \\"Index\\" print series (2001) translated it into fractured compositions and meditative fields organized by time and color. Critics suggest that the structuring of the work outside human aesthetic judgments and hierarchies enabled surprising forms of beauty reminiscent of the rhythms and randomness of John Cage compositions. Bollinger's \\"Straight Photos\\"‚Äîtitled for their lack of digital manipulation‚Äîblurred distinctions between photography and painting, foreground and background, familiar and foreign by mixing painterly abstraction, wavering perspectives, clear representation, and unconventionally produced random, unfocused fields of refracted light. Captured with a telephoto lens, the banal, abstracted landscapes, which sometimes include sharp-focused, unwitting passersby, include an element of voyeurism that Bollinger relates to the street photography of Cartier-Bresson. In Here to There (2007), she extended this work into sculptural space, projecting sequences of multiple images onto a freestanding wall with raised wood boxes to form collage-like wholes that combined Cubist-like fragmentation with cinematic duration and dissolves.

Using photography as a structural base to extract shapes and abstractions, she produced works such as Color Study (2010), which combined an unfocused photograph with glazed ceramic elements, recalling early Cubist collage while suggesting the implied space of an abstract painting come to life.

Trained as a sculptor and theater designer, she began creating autobiographical solo performances in the late 1970s. She moved on to examine diverse social and political themes using a wide variety of puppets, of all sizes. She has created 26 original works featuring various forms of puppetry, original commissioned music, video, and documentary texts. Skipitares is Associate Professor of Art and Design Education at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, and has taught workshops in various U.S. universities as well as abroad, influencing many emerging artists. She has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, New York Foundation for the Arts, New York State Council on the Arts, and UNIMA (the International Puppetry Association), as well as a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Rockefeller Fellowship and a McKnight Playwriting Fellowship, among other honors. She won the American Theatre Wing's Henry Hewes Design Award in 1999, and her productions garnered two New York Innovative Theatre Awards in 2005. Her visual work has been exhibited widely in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. In 2014 her work was on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art in Rituals of Rented Island: Object Theater, Loft Performance, and the New Psychodrama. == Early Life in Bay Area == Skipitares was born in San Francisco to Greek parents. From an early age, she made objects, usually sewn objects that were worn. As a teenager she began performing in the streets or in public parks, usually for a political cause. When she went to UC Berkeley, she continued sewing and gluing together body coverings for her street performances. These objects included a robe of 3,000 walnut shells, a jump suit of 1,000 baby-bottle nipples, and a 12-foot tall construction of tree branches and bark. == Move to New York == In 1969 Skipitares arrived in New York City to attend New York University's School of the Arts. After completing her MFA in theater design, Skipitares worked briefly as a costume designer for Richard Schechner's Performance Group, Omar Shapli's Section Ten and Carl Weber. She then began creating solo performances, highlighting some of the conflicts between Greek and American culture she had experienced as a young woman. Using masks or costume extensions of her body, she focused on the female body as the source of storytelling and ritual in such works as Mask Performance (1975), The Venus Cafe (1977), The Mother and the Maid (1979), and Skysaver (1980). == The First Puppets == Skipitares introduced 30-inch self-portrait figures into her performances in 1981, initially in supporting roles but eventually taking over the stage. She saw these \\"puppets\\" as having an innocence and a purity that make them especially effective in illuminating and critiquing social and political issues. She has explained that \\"the puppet is an empty shell, and the puppeteer's job is to breathe life into the empty vessel. And if the intention of the puppeteer is pure, then the soul of the puppet is pure. And so you can ask the puppet to be a person, and it will be that person with a lightness and innocence and authenticity.\\" Her first play for puppet figures was Micropolis (1982), a collection of miniature scenes based on actual events taking place in New York and other cities. Marrying documentary material (from historical accounts to breaking news) with puppets of all sizes, Skipitares began creating large-scale puppet performances on a variety of topics. The Age of Invention (1984), with a cast of 300 puppets and 5 live performers, traced the saga of American invention from Benjamin Franklin through Thomas Edison to a twentieth-century salesman/surgeon. Defenders of the Code: A Musical History of Genetics (1987) was described by New York Times critic Mel Gussow as ‚Äúan illuminating exploration into the laboratories of life.\\" Empires and Appetites (1989) presented a history of food and famine, and The Radiant City (1991) exposed how New York City was shaped by power broker Robert Moses. == Works at La MaMa == In 1992 Skipitares became a resident artist at La MaMa, an experimental theater in New York City. She has presented 25 productions at La MaMa, including Under the Knife (1994), a site-specific history of medicine that took an audience to 12 different environments, and Body of Crime (1996/1999), a history of women in prison. Reviewing Underground (1992), New York Times critic David Richards noted, \\"Ms. Skipitares is a social critic‚Ä¶. At the same time, she is something of a metaphysician and a disquieting sense of dread and dislocation attend her endeavors‚Ä¶. She wants you to look hard and close into dark nooks and spooky crannies.\\" From 1995 to 2005 Skipitares traveled frequently with La MaMa's founder, Ellen Stewart, to create projects in Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Albania, and South Africa. In 1999 Skipitares went to India on the first of three Fulbright fellowships there. Its impressive traditions of storytelling and puppetry led her into a reexamination of her own roots and the dramatic literature of ancient Greece. Beginning in 2003, she created three works connecting the Trojan War with the Iraq War: Helen: Queen of Sparta, Odyssey: The Homecoming, and Iphigenia. In 2009 she premiered The Travelling Players Present the Women of Troy, a play in which giant 13-foot-high puppets representing contemporary real-life female activists from Africa and Afghanistan \\"gave birth\\" to Euripides' characters in the play Trojan Women. Skipitares continued to explore Greek texts with a production of Lysistrata in 2010 and Prometheus Within in 2011. Skipitares then shifted to an exploration of absurdist plays of the twentieth century. Her The Chairs (2014) was a \\"puppet theater response\\" to Eugene Ionesco's play. She created 29 \\"performing\\" chairs and let each chair tell the story of a real-life person, in contrast to the invisibility of Ionesco's \\"guests.\\" Judith Malina, a founder of the Living Theater, was the voice of the Old Woman, the host for all the guests. In 2016 Skipitares staged Six Characters (A Family Album), a reimagination of Luigi Pirandello's classic play. == References  External links == * Category:American puppeteers Category:Artists from Brooklyn Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Interdisciplinary artists Category:New York University alumni Category:Pratt Institute faculty Category:Puppet designers Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:Living people ","title":"Theodora Skipitares"},{"id":"56790249","text":"The Melody Lingers On is an album by saxophonist Houston Person which was recorded in 2014 and released on the HighNote label.Jazz Depot: HighNote discography accessed March 9, 2018 ==Reception== In his review on Allmusic, Matt Collar states \\"A journeyman artist with a bent toward swinging soul-jazz, Person has developed into something of an American treasure over the past 30 years.

In 1995, she created a 34-foot-long wall of fruitcake bricks and installed it at Yerba Buena Gardens in San Francisco. She embraces the transformations that occur with these time sensitive mediums, challenging people's expectations of sculpture being stable. Outlaw's recent work includes assemblages with her photographs and cast glass sculptures she calls \\"puddles\\". When asked the meaning of her work, Outlaw said, \\"The message is no message. I call it formal free association\\". Outlaw continually explores duality in her work, for example, interior and exterior, or solids and voids.

However, while using his solar-powered smartphone to take a picture of himself next to the shrine's divine mirror, he gets mysteriously transported to another world called Yggdrasil. This new world he arrives in is heavily steeped in Norse mythology. He also finds that many people fight each other over land domination. Yuuto is later taken in by the so-called Wolf Clan, who have inferior military tactics. Using the knowledge of military tactics he learned from school and his smartphone, he gradually makes the Wolf Clan rise to prominence as its patriarch. In turn, he also gains the affection of a group of magic-wielding warrior maidens known as the Einherjar. ==Characters Main characters === ; : :A high school student turned warlord who accidentally transported himself to Yggdrasil when he took a selfie in front of a divine mirror.

Her books include South of Market (2013) and Public Matters (2018). == Life and work == Born in 1952 in Compton, California, Delaney relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1971. She received a BFA with honors from San Francisco State University (1975), and an MFA from the San Francisco Art Institute (1981). ===Teaching=== Delaney was a professor at the College of San Mateo from 1980 to 1991. She was a guest professor at Santa Clara University during 1986, 1989, and 1995. She taught at the San Francisco Art Institute in 1991, 1994, 1997, 2014, and 2015. From 1998 to 2015, she was an Adjunct Professor in the Visual Studies department at the University of California, Berkeley. === South of Market === Delaney is best known for her series, South of Market, which she began in 1978 when she moved to the South of Market neighborhood of San Francisco, an area undergoing transition due to gentrification and urban renewal. Using a large format camera and color film, Delaney photographed her neighbors in their places of work, businesses, apartments, and out on the street. She also conducted oral interviews with many of her subjects and produced 35 mm slides, which she showed alongside her photographs in the exhibition Form Follows Finance: A Survey of the South of Market at SF Camerawork (1982) and the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design (1983). In 2013, Mack published the photographs with excerpts from the recorded interviews in South of Market 1978-1986, Delaney's first book. Two years later, the work was featured in the exhibition Janet Delaney: South of Market, at the de Young Museum, San Francisco from January to July, 2015. Delaney returned to the South of Market area to photograph the radical changes that had occurred in the decades since she first lived there, several examples of which were published in the catalogue that accompanied the show at the de Young. === Public Matters === Following her original work on South of Market, Delaney began her series titled Public Matters in 1982. Public Matters centers primarily around the Latino community and Mission District during the 1980s, a rather tumultuous political period. Once again using a large format camera and color film, Delaney took to the streets with San Francisco natives to capture them during community gatherings, like the annual Cinco de Mayo parade, during political rallies, like the Peace, Jobs, and Justice marches, or simply while lounging in front of their homes and businesses. Public Matters captures the spirit of San Francisco during a period of high immigration and political strife, documenting the resilience and energy of the city's communities. In 2018, Mack published the photographs in a photo book with the same name as the series. That year, Delaney featured the work in a solo exhibit at the Euqinom Gallery in San Francisco, from November to December, 2018. ==Publications== *South of Market. London: Mack, 2013. .

It was first discovered during a Museum Koenig expedition to the Bamenda Highlands of Cameroon in 1974, but was not recorded again until 2001, when partial skull remnants were located in the pellets of the endemic African grass owl. == Description == A relatively small species, the Bamenda pygmy shrew measures 5.2 centimetres in body length, with a tail length of around 4.4 centimetres. The shrew is primarily dark brown in colour, with a slightly lighter patch on the stomach. The species is distinguishable from other endemic varieties due to its comparatively reduced proportions and diminutive cranial size. It is possible that the shrew is sister taxa with the Volcano shrew, found in the Albertine Rift, as the pair share numerous characteristics and features. == Distribution and habitat == The species are known to be endemic to a pair of caldera craters found near Bamenda, known as the Bafut Ngemba Forest Reserve. The lower crater contains the remnants of a past lake, while the previously flooded upper crater contains a wet grassland. The montane forests surrounding the former appears to be the primary habitat, in addition to adjacent bamboo enclaves and grasslands. The holotype of the shrew was located in dense undergrowth near a stream, suggesting that the population nearby is likely to greater in prevalence in this specific locality. == References == Bamenda pygmy shrew Category:Mammals of Cameroon Bamenda pygmy shrew ","title":"Bamenda pygmy shrew"},{"id":"56790500","text":"Lynne Avadenka is an American artist, specializing in multimedia pieces influenced by the Jewish experience.

Her work is characterized by her use of wool in the form of handcrafted felt. Much of the wool she uses is from Drenthe Heath sheep, which she raises herself in the Northern Netherlands. She often colors the wool with vegetable dyes made from vegetables grown in her own garden. She is known, in particular, for the unique kinds of hybrid or nuno felts she creates through combining a variety of materials with wool. These combined fibers include silk, linen, and chiffons, as well as fibers from animals such as yak or camel. Her felting process is also distinguished by the multiple stages of reworking required for achieving certain effects. One of her early major assignments involved working on the fabrics for the Jedi costumes in Star Wars Episode 1. She also produced fabrics for fashion and furniture designers, including Alexander van Slobbe, Maarten Baas, Hella Jongerius, John Galliano, Christian Lacroix and Donna Karan. Later in her career, Jongstra started creating large-scale works of art, displayed at museums such as the Fries Museum, the Provinciehuis in Leeuwarden, the Amsterdam Public Library and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. In 2009, her work was selected for inclusion in \\"Fashioning Felt\\", an international show on felt sponsored by the Smithsonian, which was exhibited at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York City.

It had two shows, the first being Batang Ama and the second being Bagong Yugto. The series starred JM de Guzman and Charee Pineda, the former playing the titular character. ==Conception== Due to the rise of teenage pregnancy in the Philippines, ABS-CBN made drama shows based on lives of young parents to warn and lecture the public of the dangers of such incidents. While most of the shows presented the subject matter from the perspective of a young mother, ABS-CBN then made a plan to present a show tackling the same subject matter, but from the perspective of the father, as little was known about young fathers and their struggles. This was when ideas for Angelito were born. JM De Guzman and Charee Pineda, who were starring in the 2011 remake of Mula sa Puso, were chosen for the roles of the main characters, Angelito and Rosalie, respectively. Also, three of their fellow cast members from the same show, Devon Seron, Sue Ramirez, and Beauty Gonzalez, joined the cast, with Gonzales appearing later. Felix Roco and Goin' Bulilit alumnus Carl John Barrameda were cast as Angelito's friends. To prepare for the roles, De Guzman and Pineda attended a workshop exercise known as \\"immersion\\" which helped them research about teenage pregnancy and parenthood. During the exercise, the two bonded with teenage parents, who shared their stories and struggles with the actors. After more extensive research, the two began to take their roles. Veteran actors like Al Tantay, Snooky Serna, and Elizabeth Oropesa also joined the cast. The three veterans mentored the younger cast about their roles and how they should be taken seriously. Oropesa, who had experiences being a teen parent herself. mentored De Guzman and Pineda about their roles as young parents and narrated how she raised her own child like a best friend. Oropesa also told the other young casts who take on the story that they should not only view it as \\"just a job\\" but also a \\"mission\\" to spread the word about implications and dangers of teenage pregnancy. ==ShowsBatang Ama (2011)=== The countryside town of San Vicente is home to high school lovers, 18-year-old Angelito Santos and Rosalie Dimaano. A sudden turn of events would change the lives of the two when Rosalie is suddenly pregnant. Dismayed by the unexpected pregnancy, both the Santoses and the Dimaanos forbade them from ever seeing each other. Angelito takes his child with him and runs away to Manila. He strives to become a good father to his child, Jun-jun. But when one is a teenager, raising a child proves to be such a hard task, especially since Angelito is doing it on his own. Since he knows the pains and ordeals of having a dysfunctional family, Angelito vows to do everything to raise Jun-jun well and find a way to reunite with Rosalie. One day, the ex-lovers' paths meet; Jun- jun is now five years old and Rosalie is bound to marry her rich fianc√©. Will Angelito's dream of having a complete family ever come true? ===Bagong Yugto (2011)=== Angelito and Rosalie are now happily married and live a happy family life with their son Junjun. Meanwhile, Jenny starts a new life in Singapore only to discover that she is pregnant with Angelito's child during their relationship. Pledging not to reappear in Angelito's life again, she turns to her childhood friend Raffy for comfort, but circumstances prompt her to return to the Philippines and cross paths with the Santos family once more. ==CharactersReferences== Category:Philippine telenovelas Category:ABS-CBN original programming Category:2011 Philippine television series debuts Category:2012 Philippine television series endings ","title":"Angelito (TV series)"},{"id":"56790604","text":"The 1990 Giro del Trentino was the 14th edition of the Tour of the Alps cycle race and was held on 7 May to 10 May 1990.

Today, this cemetery (reduced in size to a single acre in 1976) forms a tiny oasis of calm in the heart of Mexico City.\\" (See: Butler, Steven R.

An additional $1734.34 funding to add walls and ditching to the property was appropriated by U.S. Congress on July 21, 1852. A white stone monument's inscription recognizes approximately 750 Americans there who died in the war, mostly nearby, whose bones were reinterred to there. Also in the cemetery are graves of veterans who died and were buried there later, up to 1923. Dead were reinterred from shallow battlefield graves in the region. The cemetery remains under responsibility of the American Battle Monuments Commission. *Obelisco a los Ni√±os H√©roes, a monument to the Ni√±os H√©roes This or another Mexico City monument to the Ni√±os H√©roes was visited by Harry S.

The tax is unique in two primary aspects. First, the tax is experience rated which means that tax rates are firm-specific and the rate a firm faces updates each year to reflect the cost of the benefits that firm's former employees have received recently. Because it is primarily firms in stress that generate layoffs, these tax increases target firms that are already under strain. For this reason, states limit how high they allow taxes to rise, but these limits vary by almost an order of magnitude from state to state. The second unique feature of UI taxes under SUTA is that the taxable base is ~$10,000 (on average, varies by state) per employee, much less than the average yearly earnings of a given worker. Because of this feature, firms pay a fixed \\"lump sum\\" tax per worker they employ. This provides a modest incentive for firms to reduce unskilled and part-time work in favor of skilled and full-time work. One interesting feature of the UI tax is that it targets firms that have recently had layoffs, potentially hitting distressed firms. Recent work shows that UI tax increases significantly reduce hiring and employment in affected firms, potentially eroding the macroeconomics stabilizing influence of the UI program. ==References== Category:Taxation in the United States Category:Welfare economics ","title":"State unemployment tax act"},{"id":"56790729","text":"The 2018 Georgia State Panthers softball team represented Georgia State University in the 2018 NCAA Division I softball season.

Netanyahu was born in 1991 to Benjamin and Sara Netanyahu. He served in the IDF Spokesperson's Unit. In January 2018, a scandal erupted when a recording of Netanyahu's visit to a Tel Aviv strip club was leaked. In the tape, Netanyahu discussed strippers and referred to a controversial gas deal signed by his father. He filed a lawsuit for 1 million NIS ($272,000) against his driver, who allegedly recorded the tape. He previously worked as social media director for Shurat HaDin, an Israeli NGO that provides legal services to victims of terrorist attacks. Netanyahu was put on leave in March 2019 after deriding President Reuven Rivlin for his work on Arab-Israeli coexistence. In December 2018, he was suspended from Facebook for 24 hours after posting anti-Muslim content. Among the comments was that \\"There will never be peace with those monsters in the form of men that have called themselves ‚ÄòPalestinians‚Äô since 1964\\". Some observers have hypothesized that Netanyahu is looking for a job in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, although Netanyahu denies that he is looking for a political career. In June 2019, it was reported that Netanyahu met with Katrina Pierson, a senior advisor for the Trump 2020 campaign. He has published op-eds, for instance at Breitbart. Netanyahu lives at Beit Aghion, the prime minister's official residence in Jerusalem. In May 2019, Netanyahu expressed support for right-wing nationalist figures Viktor Orb√°n, Matteo Salvini, Nigel Farage and Geert Wilders in the 2019 European Parliament election. On 7 July 2019, he won a libel suit against Israeli Labor Party activist Abie Binyamin for the claim that Netanyahu was hiding millions in offshore accounts. In September 2019, Netanyahu accused the assassinated former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of having \\"murdered Holocaust survivors on the Altalena\\". The comments were disavowed by his father. He has compared Roni Alsheikh, the Israel Police chief who played a role in the Netanyahu corruption investigations, to the fictional mobster Tony Soprano. While being questioned by police during the investigations, Netanyahu called the police \\"Stasi\\" and \\"Gestapo\\" and said they were worse than the mafia. He also accused Nir Hafetz and Gideon Saar of various crimes. In November 2019 Netanyahu was sued for slander after sharing a Facebook post claiming that former Walla news site editor, Avi Alkalay, was a plant for the Wexner Foundation. https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/yair-netanyahu-to-pay-nis-250k-to- journalist-following-court-ruling-619325 In February 2020, he was ordered to pay damages and legal costs totalling $81,000. https://www.timesofisrael.com/yair-netanyahu-ordered-to-pay-81000-to- journalist-in-libel-suit/ https://www.haaretz.com/israel- news/elections/.premium-yair-netanyahu-ordered-to-pay-damages-to-journalist- in-libel-suit-1.8614254 The neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer once described itself as \\"The World‚Äôs #1 Yair Netanyahu fansite\\" after he posted a meme portraying his father's political opponents as puppets controlled by George Soros.

The bandits looted the train and killed a number of Chinese passengers as well as a British subject, Joseph Rothman after he refused to surrender his valuables. They took 300 passengers hostage, including 25 westerners, most of whom were Americans. British, French, Italian, German, and Danish nationals were also among those captured. The hostages were forced on a 10-day march to the bandits' mountain base at Paotzeku. Some of the more prominent hostages included Lucy Aldrich, eldest daughter of U.S. Senator Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island and sister- in-law of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. J. B. Powell, editor of China Weekly Review, and Commodore Guiseppe Musso, a wealthy and influential Italian who was the chief attorney in the Shanghai French Concession. The women were released within a couple of days of the kidnapping, while the remaining male hostages were held for over a month as negotiations led by the U.S. Minister to China Dr. Jacob Gould Schurman and American China hand Roy Scott Anderson took place. The bandits demanded as ransom the removal of Chinese government troops from Shandong, an official pardon for the kidnappers, reinstatement or enrollment into the army for those among the bandits who wished it, and guarantees by six foreign powers that the demands would be met. Ultimately the Shanghai Green Gang leader Du Yuesheng secured the release of the remaining hostages on June 12, 1923 with an $85,000 ransom ($1.2 million in today's prices). ==Aftermath== Many of the bandits were accepted into the military and Sun Meiyao and other leaders received military commissions. Within six months, most of the bandits inducted into the military were machine-gunned and their chief, Sun Meiyao, was executed for suspected ongoing ties to local bandits. The capture of the \\"Blue Express\\" created an international sensation and symbolized for many the collapse of legitimacy of the Chinese government. Following the incident, foreign governments pressured the Chinese to increase security along railway lines. Expatriate communities in China feared the episode signaled a new \\"Boxer Rebellion\\" and put into question the stability of the Chinese government. As a result, foreign powers urged that railway security be placed under foreign control. The Chinese government resisted, instead placing the railway system under military control and creating a special railway guard under the command of General Tang Zaili. Armed guards were placed on every train. Foreign powers also used the incident to place financial pressure on the fragile Chinese government, demanding indemnities and compensation for medical expenses for foreign hostages and repayment of lost earnings. ==Popular media== The Lincheng Outrage provided the inspiration for the 1932 Marlene Dietrich film Shanghai Express. == References == Category:1923 in China Category:Warlordism in Republican China Category:Lincheng County Category:History of Hebei Category:Railway accidents and incidents in China Category:Train robberies Category:Hostage taking in China ","title":"Lincheng Outrage"},{"id":"56790945","text":"Amar Akbar Anthony is a 2018 Indian Telugu-language action film co-written and directed by Sreenu Vaitla which features Ravi Teja in his first triple role and Ileana D'Cruz playing the female lead in her comeback in Telugu cinema after six years. Also marking the fourth collaboration between Teja and Vaitla after Nee Kosam, Venky and Dubai Seenu, the film was produced by Naveen Yerneni, Y. Ravi Shankar and Mohan Cherukuri under their banner Mythri Movie Makers. Pre-production of the film began in June 2017, and the film's principal photography commenced at New York in April 2018. The narrative centers around Amar, a man suffering from multiple personality disorder, who is on a vengeful killing spree but is often hindered by the emergence of two more personalities he is unaware of. The film, released worldwide on 16 November 2018, was panned by critics and audiences, becoming a box office bomb. == Plot == Set in New York, the film revolves around Amar (Ravi Teja), who once freed from the prison, kills a businessman before extracting from him a \\"Fedo\\" ring. However, Amar is unaware of the fact that he has multiple personality disorder that causes him to assume two more identities in addition to his own. Each identity has a trigger that results in its emergence. Whenever something breaks, he transforms into Akbar, a muslim man who keeps helping the needy. Whenever he sees someone acting abnormally, he transforms into Marc Anthony, a calm doctor. Whenever something explodes, he becomes himself. While as Akbar, he meets Pooja (Ileana D'Cruz), a young woman who also has MPD. In a gym, a few men try to flirt with her and them telling her to \\"trust them\\" triggers the alternate personality which violently beats them up. Pooja is surprised to meet Akbar as Dr. Anthony who soon starts her therapy. In the meanwhile, FBI officer Balwant Kharge (Abhimanyu Singh) investigates the murder of the first businessman and being a partner, he keeps informing the remaining three businessmen who might be the next targets. Evidences bring him closer to the realization that Amar might be involved in the murder. Pooja's uncle Jalal Akbar (Sayaji Shinde) unites with her. Her real name is revealed to be Aishwarya. With time, Amar ends up realizing that something is wrong with him. He visits the grave of his parents with flowers but is chased by Kharge and his fellow officers. He tries to kill the next target but somehow fails. He hires Bobby (Sunil), a random stranger, to find out what's wrong with him. He realizes that he has MPD, while the flashback is revealed in the words of Jalal Akbar to Aishwarya and Dr. Marc Anthony (Subhalekha Sudhakar)'s words to Kharge. It is revealed that Amar and Aishwarya's families were betrayed by four businessmen whom they trust and awarded \\"Fedo\\" rings. The explosion of their house triggered the disorder in Amar and the menace created by the businessmen triggered it in Aishwarya. The businessmen tried to kill Amar, Aishwarya and Jalal in a subsequent chase but failed. Aishwarya and Amar were admitted to Dr. Anthony's school where they got separated by circumstances. Back in the present, Amar manages to kill the second businessman by strangulating him while also leaving behind clues that alert Kharge. However, this disorder causes Amar to miss Saboo Menon (Adhitya), the target he earlier failed to kill. He then manipulates the members of WATA, an association for Telugu people, into killing Menon. They're taken in and end up leading Kharge to the truth. Karan Arora (Tarun Arora), the fourth businessman, calls Amar for a meeting in exchange for Jalal and Aishwarya's freedom. Realizing his loved ones are still alive, Amar arrives for the exchange and in the presence of Kharge and his assistant, breaks into a fight that leaves the henchmen wounded and Arora dead. He extracts the last Fedo ring and then leaves the scene. Kharge is disappointed to realize he kidnapped someone else instead of Aishwarya. Amar then visits his long-left house where he unites with Aishwarya, with Dr. Anthony explaining to Jalal that their mental condition will now start returning to normal.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Dechaine has filed a number of appeals, maintaining that he is innocent. However, he remains incarcerated at Maine State Prison in Warren, Maine. This case is considered by many to be the most infamous crime in the state of Maine. ==Murder== On July 6, 1988, twelve-year-old Sarah Cherry was abducted while babysitting at a home in a rural part of Bowdoin, Maine. A couple of items were left in the driveway of the house (the abduction scene) that linked Dennis Dechaine, a thirty-one-year-old farmer, to the crime, such as an estimate with his name on it. Several days later, Cherry's body was found hidden in a wooded area. She had been bound with rope, assaulted sexually with birch sticks, stabbed, and then strangled with a scarf. Both the rope and scarf, as well as the items in the driveway, came from Dechaine's truck. However, Dechaine claims that the items from his truck were taken from the actual perpetrator, and were used to implicate him. Dechaine's account of that day was that he left his farm and drove to the woods to do drugs, getting lost in the process. After which, he came across an elderly couple and flagged down a police car. During questioning from the authorities, Dechaine lied about going fishing, his employment, and residence. According to Dechaine, he lied due to his use of illegal drugs. Dechaine's red Toyota pickup truck was found approximately 450 feet from where Cherry's body was found. Forensic analysis did not recover any evidence that Cherry had been in the truck, nor did a tracking dog. ==Conviction and appeals== The case went to trial in March 1989. On March 18, Dechaine was convicted of her murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Since his conviction, Dechaine has filed numerous appeals for a new trial, citing that male DNA under Sarah Cherry's fingernails did not match him. In April 2014, another appeal for a new trial was denied. It argued that the DNA evidence, which was not available at Dechaine's trial, implicated someone else. In July 2015, Dechaine's appeal to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court for a new trial was denied, concluding that the DNA evidence was insufficient. In October 2016, Dechaine's final appeal for a new trial was denied by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston. ==Coverage== Dechaine's case was featured on the television program, The Investigators, in 2005. A documentary entitled Murder in America: The Sarah Cherry Story was released about this case. A book entitled Human Sacrifice was released by James P. Moore on Dechaine's case in 2002. This case helped inspire the novel Death at Breakfast that was released by Beth Gutcheon in 2016. ==References== Category:1988 murders in the United States Category:Crimes in Maine Category:1988 in Maine Category:Deaths by person in the United States ","title":"Dennis Dechaine case"},{"id":"56791184","text":"Nathayil Muthu (; also spelt Nathaiyil Muthu) is a 1973 Tamil-language drama film directed, produced and written by K.

He is the founder of the Northeast Ohio Basketball Association, star of the documentary More than a Game author of the book ‚ÄúBeyond Championships: A Playbook for Winning at Life,‚Äù and the National Championship winning coach for the 2003 St. Vincent St. Mary boys basketball team, led by LeBron James and the ‚ÄúFab Four.‚Äù == Background == Dru Joyce II was born in East Liverpool, Ohio on July 26, 1955. In 1978, he graduated from Ohio University with a degree in Business Administration, and began a career in sales for Hunt-Wesson Foods in Pittsburgh, PA. In 1984, Joyce and his family relocated to Akron, Ohio. He began coaching his son Dru Joyce III (‚ÄúLittle Dru‚Äù) in 1995, and had a knack for finding promising young basketball talent in his community. One of the young talents that caught Coach Dru's eye at the Summit Lake Recreation Center was a 10-year-old boy named LeBron James. Coach Dru convinced LeBron's mother, Gloria, to let him join an AAU basketball team called the Shooting Stars. Little Dru and LeBron, soon joined by Sian Cotton and Willie McGee, continued to play together under coach Dru's leadership and developed into remarkable basketball players. In 1999, Coach Dru was named assistant coach of the St. Vincent-St. Mary boys basketball team under NCAA coach Keith Dambrot. That fall, Dru Joyce III, LeBron James, Sian Cotton, and Willie McGee all entered their freshman year at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School, determined to fulfill their dream of a National Championship. They won the 2000 Division III State Basketball Championship, which they would repeat in 2001, joined by sophomore transfer Romeo Travis, who would become the fifth member of what would be known as the ‚ÄúFab Five.‚Äù In the fall of 2001, Coach Dru was named the head basketball coach for St. Vincent-St. Mary. After a rough 2001-2002 season, Coach Dru and the Fab Five regrouped and came back stronger than ever in 2003. Not only did they clinch the Division II Ohio State Boys Basketball Championship, they were also declared Nation Champions by USA Today. Coach Dru began hosting an annual AAU basketball tournament in 2005. Originally called the King James Shooting Stars, the tournament was later renamed the Dru Joyce Classic. Today, Coach Dru continues to serve as head basketball coach at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in Akron, OH, as well as the head of the Northeast Ohio Basketball Association. He is also the founder of the Dru Joyce Classic, one of the top 5 youth AAU basketball tournaments in the United States. Dru Joyce II published his first book, ‚ÄúBeyond Championships: A Playbook for Winning at Life,‚Äù in April 2015. The foreword is written by his former player, LeBron James. == References == Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Basketball coaches from Ohio Category:Ohio University alumni Category:21st-century American writers Category:High school basketball coaches in Ohio Category:People from Akron, Ohio ","title":"Dru Joyce II"},{"id":"56791234","text":"The 1981 UK Athletics Championships was the national championship in outdoor track and field for the United Kingdom held at Antrim Stadium, Antrim. It was the first time that a national track and field championship was held in Northern Ireland. It was the fifth edition of the competition limited to British athletes only, launched as an alternative to the AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors. However, due to the fact that the calibre of national competition remained greater at the AAA event, the UK Championships this year were not considered the principal national championship event by some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS). Many of the athletes below also competed at the 1981 AAA Championships.UK Championships. GBR Athletics. Retrieved 2018-02-25.AAA WAAA and National Championships Medalists. NUTS. Retrieved 2018-02-25. David Ottley won his fourth straight title in the men's javelin throw. Among the athletes to defend their 1980 UK titles were Cameron Sharp (men's 100 metres), Carol Tyson (race walk) and Louise Miller (high jump). Three athletes won UK title doubles, all of them women: Linsey MacDonald won the short sprint double, Gillian Dainty took both middle-distance titles, while Venissa Head was both shot put and discus throw champion. The main international track and field competition for the United Kingdom that year was the 1981 European Cup. Reflecting the secondary status of the UK event at national level, none of the British individual medallists there were present at UK Championships, though all members of the medal-winning women's 4 √ó 400 metres relay reached the podium in Antrim (Linda Forsyth, Michelle Scutt, Verona Elder and Joslyn Hoyte-Smith).European Cup (Men).

The ship was named after a sheep station near Cassilis in the Hunter Valley, Australia. It was launched in 1853 in Birkenhead, England. The ship's name is now the location of the present day suburb of Collaroy. The stranded SS Collaroy == Stranding at Collaroy == Four months after extensive repairs, the ship became beached close to Pittwater Road at Collaroy on 20 January 1881. A navigational error was given as a cause, when the ship attempted to avoid Long Reef near Sydney in heavy fog, without the captain's order. A report in the Sydney Evening News suggests the Collaroy was in an unofficial race with another coastal steamer, the Morpeth. And that a further westerly course would assist in reaching port in a faster time. Ship's mate Richard Drew stated that he did not see the Broken Bay light, several miles to the north of Long Reef. Another report said he also lost sight of the light at south head.The Daily Telegraph Sun Pictorial of 23 October l927 At 3.55 am, ship's mate Richard Drew allegedly advised the captain of dense fog. A land form was noticed, incorrectly assumed to be Long Reef. After being on deck for twenty minutes, breaking waves were noticed on the starboard bow. The Collaroy was proceeding to the beach at ten knots. Orders were given to reverse engines. However, the ship breached the sand without great impact, and was unable to be shifted by the ship's reversing motor. Initial attempts to drag the ship from the beach were unsuccessful. When Captain Thompson and five other men were attempting to connect the hawser in a smaller boat. All were all thrown overboard by a wave. One of the crew members from the Shetland Islands known as \\"Hercules\\" was drowned, reports said he was tangled in nearby seaweed. On another attempt, the hawser became detached from the rescue tugs. The ship was beached for over three years. The stranded ship became a tourist attraction. The master Captain Martin Thompson and mate Mr Richard Drew had their licenses suspended for three months. === recovery from the beach === The new owner, John Robertson of Botany paid ¬£200 for the wreckage before the ship was recovered. The Collaroy was described as so deep in the sand that the workmen could \\"step on her sponsons\\", while its hull was described as \\"full of water\\". With considerable labour the vessel was raised off the sand and turned head to sea. A purpose-built cradle was made around the hull which was then swung so that the bow pointed seaward. A ‚Äòway‚Äô or launching ramp was then built ahead of the recovered steamer towards the water. Three additional ‚Äòkedge‚Äô anchors was placed out in the water adjacent to the steamer and attached to the bows. The steam tug Commodore again assisted in pulling Collaroy down the purpose-built ramp when the cable snapped. A second attempt also saw the line parting. On the third attempt, hydraulic power was employed at the stern of the ship and with the assistance of the tug \\"Leveret\\", the Collaroy was freed, and hauled from the beach at high tide, 7:30 pm on 9 September 1884. This was met with much celebration from local residents and tourists. And then towed to Darling Harbour in Sydney. After a week's maintenance on the slipway at Sydney, it was reported that \\"her engines worked splendidly\\". A Rodger's small palm anchor was found at the wreck site in 1963 and an admiralty type anchor was also discovered at Collaroy in 2001. === cargo and passengers === At the time of the beaching, the ship's cargo consisted of 7 bales of wool, 170 bags of potatoes, 200 hides, 40 casks of tallow, 40 pigs and 30 sheep. The livestock was successfully landed and driven into a paddock close to the wreck. All twenty-four passengers (including 14 saloon and ten in steerage) were successfully brought ashore with their luggage in the starboard lifeboat, in three or four trips. The ladies and children were either carried through the breakers or waded ashore themselves. All but one of the forty aboard were safely landed, many being taken to Manly by a fleet of horse-drawn coaches. == Fate == In February 1888, the Collaroy was sold to its final owner, Alexander Burns. The ship was refitted as a schooner or barkentine rigged sailing ship, with the engine and paddles removed. The Collaroy sailed from Sydney on or about the 24th day of April 1889, bound for Eureka, Humboldt County, California. The cargo was 500 tons of coal, and a crew of ten hands all told. The ship encountered fog five miles north of the entrance to Eureka Harbour on 7 July and was wrecked. No loss of life was recorded. The actions of Captain Alfred Ball were judged as professional, competent and without blame.Wreck report for the SS Collaroy 1889. plimsoll.org.

He was suffect consul in one of the nundinia that fell in the last half of AD 117 as the colleague of Publius Afranius Flavianus.Werner Eck, \\"Konsuln des Jahres 117 in Milit√§rdiplomen Traians mit Tribunicia Potestas XX\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 185 (2013), pp. 235‚Äì238 His full name is Lucius Cossonius Gallus Vecillius Crispinus Mansuanius Marcellinus Numisius Sabinus. He is known entirely from inscriptions. == Career == An inscription set up at Antioch of Pisidia has been assumed to refer to Gallus, although the name is incomplete: \\"[...]nius Gallus Vecillius Crispinus Mansuanius Marcellinus Numisius Sabinus\\". Some authorities, such as L. Petersen and Hans-Georg Pflaum, have denied this identification; however, others, such as Ronald Syme, advocate for it.A more complete list at Bernard R√©my, Les carri√®res s√©natoriales dans les provinces romaines d'Anatolie au Haut-Empire (31 av. J.-C. - 284 ap. J.-C.) (Pont- Bithynie, Galatie, Cappadoce, Lycie-Pamphylie et Cilicie) Pr√©face d'Andr√© Chastagnol (Istanbul: Institut Fran√ßais d'√âtudes Anatoliennes-Georges Dum√©zil, 1989), p. 84 His first known office was as a military tribune with the Legio XXI Rapax. This legion disappeared in the 90s: one theory is that it was disbanded as a result of its participation in the revolt of Lucius Antonius Saturninus in January 89; another theory holds that it was destroyed during Domitian's campaign against the Sarmatians in the 90s; a third theory is that the legion mutinied at the time of the uprising of the Praetorians against Nerva in the year 97, and was disbanded afterwards. Bernard R√©my prefers the first possibility, that the legion had dishonored itself, noting that the name of the legion has been excised from several inscriptions at Vindonissa, a common indication of damnatio memoriae.R√©my, Les carri√®res s√©natoriales, p. 85 Following his military commission, Gallus then was appointed one of the tresviri capitalis, one of the four boards that form the vigintiviri; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward gaining entry into the Roman Senate. This particular board, which supervised prisons and the execution of criminals, was the least prestigious of the vigintiviri. Since he is one of the few senators of that time to have fulfilled his military duties before entering the vigintiviri, R√©my suggests Gallus might have been commissioned an angusticlave tribune and received the laticlave soon after. His next post, as legate to the proconsular governor of Asia, supports this hypothesis; in any case it demonstrates that Gallus had powerful mentors assisting his career, for only five other examples are known of men serving as legates to proconsuls prior to holding the office of quaestor, which he served in the public province of Bithynia and Pontus. The traditional Republican magistracies of plebeian tribune and praetor followed. Once he completed his term as praetor, Gallus was appointed to a series of imperial posts. First was curator of a network of Etruscan roads, which comprised the Trajanae novae: the Viae Clodia, Cassia, Annia, and the Ciminia. This was followed by an appointment as praefectus frumenti dandi (the prefect responsible for the distribution of Rome's free grain dole). Then Gallus was commissioned as legatus or commander of two Roman legions. The first was Legio I Italica, stationed at Novae on the Danube in the imperial province of Moesia Inferior. Next was Legio II Traiana Fortis, which was raised in the year 105 on the eve of Trajan's Dacian Wars. Senators rarely commanded more than one legion in their career; in compiling a list of all men known to have commanded two or more, Anthony Birley identified only thirty-three men.Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), pp. 18-20 After completing his military service, the sortition awarded Gallus the province of Corsica and Sardinia; although R√©my dates his tenure in that province to either 114/115 or 115/116, Werner Eck dates it to the period 112/113.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 12 (1982), pp. 353f Upon returning to Rome, Gallus was admitted to the sodales Flaviales, which at the time was still an important honor. Following this he was appointed governor to the imperial province of Galatia. It is clear Gallus followed Lucius Caesennius Sospes in this office, and thus held this office after the year 114, yet before he acceded to the consulate; R√©my suggests he was governor from 117 to 119,R√©my, Les carri√®res s√©natoriales, p. 86 while Eck proposes from 116 to 119.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten\\", pp. 361f Gallus' life after he stepped down from the consulate was long considered a blank until the discovery in 2003 of a statue base at Caesarea Maritima that attests that he was governor of Judea, an office reserved for senators of the consular rank. His presence in Judea is noteworthy, for he would have reunited with his old unit, Legio II Traiana Fortis, which had been stationed in that province in the year 117. == References == Category:1st-century Romans Category:2nd- century Romans Category:Roman governors of Sardinia Category:Roman governors of Galatia Category:Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Category:Roman governors of Judea ","title":"Lucius Cossonius Gallus"},{"id":"56791603","text":"Mukund Parikh is a Gujarati novelist, poet and playwright from Gujarat, India. ==Life== Mukund Parikh was born on 26 January 1934 in Nadisar village (now in Panchmahal district, Gujarat) to Bhailal Parikh.

He worked in a Provident Fund Commissioner Office from 1954 to 1980. He studied LL.B. from Ahmedabad in 1980 from Gujarat University. Since 1981, he is working as a lawyer. ==Works== His Mahabhinishkraman (1968) was an experimental novel. The story follows a love triangle of a character named Amit Dalal and it explores his relationship with three ladies: Chandan, his mother; Rama, his wife and Saroj, his lover. Parikh employs the stream of consciousness in his narration. He has used motifs such as pipal tree and darkness. He has explored Oedipus complex in his character's relationships. The novel was particularly praised for its language. He was associated with the experimental literary circles such as Re Math and Akanth Sabarmati. His one-act play Choras Inda Ane Gol Kabaro was included in a collection of five one-act plays Make Believe (1968) published by Re Math. This play is considered as an example of an absurd play from the early period of modern Gujarati literature. It is a psychological play flipping the places of an actor and the viewers in the theatre.

It is built in remembrance of the girls and women that were sexually enslaved by the Imperial Japanese Army through deceit, coercion, and brutal force. The site is located near the Saint Mary's Square, at the crossroads of San Francisco Chinatown and the Financial District. The statue \\"Comfort Women\\" Column of Strength, by sculptor Steven Whyte, is one of nine and the first sculpture placed in a major U.S. city to commemorate the comfort women. In protest of the memorial, Hirofumi Yoshimura‚Äîthe mayor of Osaka, Japan‚Äîdissolved the sister-city relationship between Osaka and San Francisco that was established in 1957. == Column of Strength statue == The San Francisco Comfort Women memorial and its bronze, 10-foot-tall \\"Comfort Women\\" Column of Strength statue were unveiled on September 22nd, 2017. The memorial statue was designed by the Carmel-based sculptor Steven Whyte. It depicts three teen-age girls, with each being of a specific nationality‚ÄîChinese, Korean, and Philippine‚Äîand altogether representing the estimated 200,000 \\"comfort women\\" from countries across East and Southeast Asia that were occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army before and during World War II. These three girls are cast in bronze, standing in a circle atop a pedestal and holding hands in a back-to-back posture. Standing next to the pedestal and gazing up at them is another bronze figure of a halmoni (Korean for grandmother). It bears a resemblance to the Korean human rights activist Kim Hak-Sun, who was a victim of the forced enslavement to the Imperial Japanese Army during WWII and the first woman in Korea to come forward publicly about her experiences as a comfort woman. == Steven Whyte == Steven Whyte, the sculptor of the \\"Comfort Women\\" Column of Strength statue, is a British-American artist living in Carmel, California. His works also include a life-sized Jumbo the Elephant at Tufts University and a multi- sculptures monument entitled National Salute to Bob Hope and the Military. Whyte describes himself as \\"a figurative sculptor,\\" with a strong emphasis on the creation of characters in his works. He has a preference in human form as the sculpture subject, and often works with live models when designing sculptures. For \\"Comfort Women\\" Column of Strength, he found models from the Central Coast and designed the figures of the teen-age Chinese, Korean, and Philippine girls partially based on the models. Whyte also describes himself as a \\"sculptor of people\\" who prioritizes \\"the emotional quality and impact of the sculpture\\" and intends for his work to become catalysts for public responses, interactions, and conversations. To make \\"Comfort Women\\" Column of Strength resonate with its audience emotionally, Whyte puts an emphasis on the girls‚Äô strength and solidarity through their posture, and makes them look at viewers directly \\"in an almost accusatory way\\" and with \\"post-traumatic\\" stress and shock. Whyte reflects on the Column of Strength statue that \\"this is a story that has been hidden for so long that if it serves a purpose ‚Äîto make people look into history and learn from history a little more‚Äî then my work is done.\\" == Development == In 2015, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed the resolution to build a memorial dedicated to comfort women, under the push led by retired judges Lillian Sing and Julie Tang. According to District 1 Supervisor Eric Mar, the memorial is expected to serve as the starting point for education and healing process, with an aim to \\"keep the issue alive when some in Japan are trying to silence the issue.\\" The memorial is privately funded by the Comfort Women Justice Coalition and was established in cooperation with other community organizations and city agencies. The organization raised $205,000 to make and install the statue. In a double-blind competition, British-American artist Steven Whyte‚Äôs design was chosen from more than 30 submissions from all over the world by an expert jury of arts professionals, community organizers and citizens. Whyte was then tasked with sculpting the memorial piece. The sculpture was installed on September 22, 2017. During the design process, the sensitivity of the controversial issue was taken into consideration and the statue was designed not to display any violence or brutality. The memorial statue was given the name Women's Column of Strength, and represents the young girls and women taken from China, Korea, and the Philippines, as well as to bring awareness to the sex trafficking of women during wartime. == Controversy == Despite the signing of the December 28, 2015 Agreement between Japan and Korea, in which Japan made an apology to the wartime sex trafficking of women and $8.3 million compensating payment, the dispute over comfort women remains unresolved. In 2017, after the unveiling ceremony of \\"Comfort Women\\" Column of Strength, and in light of San Francisco's recognition of the memorial and its statue, Hirofumi Yoshimura‚Äîthe mayor of Osaka, Japan‚Äîprotested and threatened to end the sisterhood between the two cities of Osaka and San Francisco. According to the Japanese national newspaper Asahi Shimbun, Yoshimura contended that the relationship between Osaka and San Francisco of trust was \\"completely destroyed\\" by the placement of the statue. He argued that the memorial was unnecessary because Japan has already made amends regarding the issue of comfort women. Yoshimura also made the objection that the comfort women statue unfairly singles out Japan for wartime atrocities. He said that \\"I am in favor of activities to protect the dignity and human rights of women. However, if the purpose is to protect the human rights of women, I would suggest that some of the special attention currently being given to Japan‚Äôs ‚Äòcomfort women‚Äô issue should be broadened to memorialize all the women who have been sexually assaulted and abused by soldiers of countries in the world.\\" Yoshimura formally withdrew sister city status from San Francisco in October, 2018. The installation of the San Francisco statue worried some Japanese-Americans who felt it stigmatized the community and offered only a one-sided account to the comfort women story. Retired California judge and current chairman of the Comfort Women Justice Coalition, Julie Tang, refuted this claim by stating the memorial statue tackles the issue of women's freedom from sexual violence, such as through rape and assault during wartime. ==See also == * Filipina Comfort Women Statue == References == Category:Outdoor sculptures in San Francisco Category:Monuments and memorials in California Category:Comfort women Category:Works about comfort women Category:Japanese-American culture in San Francisco Category:Monuments and memorials to women Category:2017 sculptures ","title":"San Francisco Comfort Women Memorial"},{"id":"56791617","text":"Martins Pond is a lake in Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of Massachusetts.

He linked the interests of Muslim Filipinos in the UNIDO platform and facilitated the defection of Filipino Muslim politicians who were part of Kilusang Bagong Lipunan, the ruling party, to UNIDO. Marcos contested win over the 1986 elections later led to his ouster in the People Power Revolution of February 1986 which saw Corazon Aquino installed as President of the Philippines. ===Magundanao governor (1986‚Äì1990)=== After the People Power Revolution, Candao was appointed as acting governor of Maguindanao on April 5, 1986 by then President Corazon Aquino.

Cars were sold in USA, Australia and a very few to Europe. Designed and built by Rollin H. White, formerly chief engineer of the White Motor Company. The car was planned as an economical automobile to capture a share of the low price market. Its engine was similar to that of the Cletrac tractor, a White subsidiary. The chairman was Rollin Henry White. His father, Thomas White, was owner of The White Sewing Machine Company , White Steamer and the White Motor Company. The Rollin was too high-priced for the market for which it had been intended. In its most successful year, 1924, approximately 6,500 units were produced. By the end of 1925 the factory was closed due to bankruptcy. As of 2018, there are several Rollin automobiles in the USA and in Australia, as well as a few in Europe, at least one in the Netherlands and two in Sweden.

A large portion of the regiment was made up of German mercenaries, who were a common phenomenon on both sides. The regiment's name is derived from the blue colored uniforms worn by the soldiers. The regiment was raised around 1624 during the Polish‚ÄìSwedish War of 1621‚Äì25, originally recruited from Swedish provinces. Following the landing of Gustavus Adolphus and his army in Pomerania, new recruits came from local German inhabitants to fill the ranks. From 1630 onward, the Blue regiment took part in almost every battle of the Swedish intervention in the Thirty Years' War, such as the battle of Breitenfeld (1631), L√ºtzen (1632) and N√∂rdlingen (1634). Battle of L√ºtzen in particular, where it is referred to as the \\"Old Blue\\" regiment, though this name was official from 1634 only, was disastrous to the regiment as it lost more than half of its veteran soldiers from the recurring attacks of the Imperial cavalry and the heavy enemy volleys. Term brigade is derived from a Swedish infantry formation called the \\"Swedish Brigade\\", which was developed by Gustavus Adolphus during his military reforms. Normally, a brigade would be composed of 2 regiments divided into 4 or 3 squadrons of c. 400 men each, though in some cases, a double sized regiment of around 16 or more companies was able to form a brigade on its own, as it was later with the Blue and Yellow regiments. The regiment was dissolved around 1650 with other colored regiments dissolved around 1638 or before.

Originally a small hamlet in the parish of Llandaff, separate from Cardiff, Canton had seen drastic urbanisation and expansion as Cardiff industrialised during the 19th Century. The church of St John the Evangelist had already been established in the 1850s, but as the area continued to grow, further places of worship were needed, even after St Johns had been enlarged in 1870. The first rector of St John's, the Reverend Vincent Saulez, founded St Catherine's in the early 1880s and later also founded St Paul's in Grangetown. The founding stone of St Catherine's was laid by Catherine Vaughan, the wife of the Dean of Llandaff. She also contributed ¬£1000 towards the building. It has been speculated that the church's name was influenced by this generosity. The plans of diocesan architect John Prichard had intended a cruciform design, but this proved overambitious, and Prichard built only three bays of the nave. The church opened in 1885 before Prichard had finished the project, and his death in 1886 caused the work to pause. It was later completed in two stages: first by Kempson & Fowler in 1892-3, who added the chancel, south chapel and north vestry. In 1897, G.E. Halliday added two bays at the west end. The church has a marble reredos and stained glass windows by Ninian Comper. St Catherine's became a separate parish in 1895, but in the 20th Century, this was merged with St John's. It is now in the Rectorial Benefice of Canton, together with St John's and St Luke's. The church has been listed since 1975. ==References== Category:Churches completed in 1897 Category:Grade II listed churches in Cardiff Canton Canton ","title":"St Catherine's Church, Canton"},{"id":"56792212","text":"is a former Japanese football player.

First discovered on the slopes of Mount Nimba, it is now believed that the species is extant within Guinea, Liberia and Cote d‚ÄôIvoire. == Description == The Lachaise's climbing mouse measures between 5.5 and 7.7 centimetres in body length, with a tail length of between 7.9 and 9.8 centimetres. The upper section of the body is light brown, while the chest and stomach are whitish in colour. The species are distinguished from close relatives through the absence of a black stripe on the back, a lack of white spot on the muzzle, the presence of an additional toe, and cranial differences. == Distribution and habitat == Specimens caught to date have been located within the boundaries of the Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve, which overlaps the borders of Guinea, Liberia and Cote d‚ÄôIvoire. The mouse tends to frequent montane savannah plains, lowland and montane tropical forest and cultivated banana and quinine plantations. == Threats == The species may be under direct threat from mining activity and human movement. Due to the location in regard to the border of Guinea, Liberia and Cote d‚ÄôIvoire, the locality is prone to extensive refugee movement. The area is additionally mined on the basis of iron ore concessions, posing a threat to the habitat of the mouse. These prevalent risks have relatively recently seen the area added to the List of World Heritage in Danger. The former countries place protections upon the reserve, but the status of conservation regarding Cote d‚ÄôIvoire remains unknown. ==References== Lachaise's climbing mouse Category:Mammals of West Africa Lachaise's climbing mouse ","title":"Lachaise's climbing mouse"},{"id":"56792230","text":"is a former Japanese football player.

Both sides faced each other in the final match of the round, both winning their previous three matches. Kerala came away as the 1‚Äì0 winners to win the group. West Bengal entered the match as the defending champions after winning the Santosh Trophy the previous year in 2017. ==Road to the final== The Santosh Trophy is an association football knock-out competition contested by the regional state associations and government institutions under the All India Football Federation (AIFF), the sport's governing body in India. Started in 1941, the competition was considered the top domestic football championship in India, prior to the start of the National Football League in 1996. The 2017‚Äì18 competition is the 72nd edition of the Santosh Trophy. In order to enter the competition proper, teams had to go through a qualification round based on their region. Kerala were placed in Group B of the South Zone qualifiers while West Bengal were placed in Group B of the East Zone qualifiers. Kerala topped their group consisting of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to qualify. West Bengal would also top their group consisting of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. ===Kerala=== Prior to reaching the 2018 final, Kerala had played the final of the Santosh Trophy 13 times, winning on five occasions, most recently in 2004. For this edition of the tournament, Kerala were placed in Group A with Chandigarh, Maharashtra, Manipur, and eventually final opponent West Bengal. Kerala's first match of the competition occurred on 19 March against Chandigarh. A brace from Jithin M.S. and three goals from Sajith Poulose, Afdal V.K. and Sreekuttan V.S. respectively earned Kerala an opening 5‚Äì1 victory. Four days later, Kerala defeated Manipur 6‚Äì0. Jithin Gopalan scored a brace while Afdal V.K., Rahul K.P., and Jithin M.S. scored the other three goals. The sixth goal came from an own goal by Roshan Singh. Two days later, on 25 March, Kerala would earn another major victory, 3‚Äì0 over Maharashtra. Rahul Raj opened the scoring in the 24th minute before Jithin M.S. scored his fourth goal of the tournament in the 39th. Rahul K.P. scored Kerala's third in the 58th minute. Finally, on 27 March, Kerala played their final match of the group stage against eventually final opponent West Bengal. Rahul K.P. scored his third goal of the tournament in the 90th minute to give Kerala the victory and top of the group. With the group stage finished, Kerala would take on Mizoram in the knockout semi-final match at the Mohun Bagan Ground. An Afdal V.K. goal in the 54th minute was enough to give Kerala the victory and a spot in their 14th final. ===West Bengal=== West Bengal is entering this final as the most winningest team in competition history, winning the competition 32 times, including the final from the previous year. As well as their 32 championships, West Bengal were runners-up in the tournament 12 times. The second most winningest side in the competition is Punjab, with eight championships. For this edition of the Santosh Trophy, West Bengal were placed in Group A alongside Chandigarh, Maharashtra, Manipur, and their finals opponent, Kerala. Their match was against Manipur on 19 March at the Sailen Manna Stadium. A Sumit Das brace and a goal from Bidyasagar Singh gave West Bengal a comfortable 3‚Äì0 opening victory. Two days later, West Bengal took on Maharashtra and won 5‚Äì1. Maharashtra took the lead early in the 8th minute through Leander Dharmai. West Bengal came back in the second half and equalized through Manotosh Chakladar in the 55th minute. Jiten Mumru then gave West Bengal the lead in the 62nd minute before Bidyashagar Singh scored their third in the 79th minute. The scoring was rounded off by a Bidyashagar Singh goal for a brace and Rajon Barman. Then, on 25 March, Bidyashagar Singh scored his third goal of the tournament as West Bengal defeated Chandigarh 1‚Äì0. Despite the victory, West Bengal head coach, Ranjan Chowdhury, was displeased with his team's performance: \\"I‚Äôm not at all happy with the team‚Äôs performance. We probably played the worst match of the tournament today.\\" Two days later, West Bengal succumbed to their first defeat of the tournament, a 1‚Äì0 defeat against their finals opponent Kerala. After the group stage, with West Bengal finishing second in Group A, the side were to play Group B winners Karnataka on 30 March.

Before the final, during the tournament, three different stadiums were used in and around Kolkata. The Rabindra Sarobar Stadium and the Sailen Manna Stadium were extensively used throughout the group stage before the Mohun Bagan Ground hosted some matches towards the end of the group stage and during the semi-finals. For the final of the competition, the match will be played at the Salt Lake Stadium. ===Analysis=== Despite taking the victory in their prior match during the group stage, Kerala will not come into this match as favorites. Due to being hosts in the final and history, West Bengal are favorites. Previously, both Kerala and West Bengal have met in the final of the Santosh Trophy twice, back in 1989 and 1994. On both occasions, West Bengal came out as the winners in penalty shootouts. However, even with history not on Kerala's side, their head coach, Satheevan Balan, was optimistic before the final: \\"We know the statistics. But that is not something we are concerned about. Stats have been against us since the start of the tournament. We were not fancied when we started the campaign and many doubted us to even make it past the qualifiers. But now we are in the final. We have considered every game as a final since arriving here and on Sunday, it will be the same.\\" For West Bengal, the hosts will be looking to reverse their defeat to Kerala from the group stage. \\"There is no pressure. The team has confidence in its ability to win the final,‚Äù said Bengal head coach Ranjan Chowdhury. ‚ÄúThey are organised and strong defensively. Whoever wins needs to earn the trophy by playing well.\\" West Bengal will also enter the match still as reigning champions, after they won in the final the previous season against Goa 1‚Äì0. For Kerala, this will be their first final appearance since 2013 and their first attempt to win the trophy since 2004. \\"We can create history as it was 14 years ago that Kerala last won the prestigious trophy, but we will play without pressure,\\" said head coach, Satheevan Balan. Coming into the match, West Bengal had the league's best defense, only conceding twice throughout the tournament while Kerala have scored the most goals during the competition. ==MatchReferences * Santosh Trophy at All India Football Federation website.

Her formal introduction to children's literature began when her husband urged her to take a class at Kent State University, where he taught. == Career == Apseloff became a teaching assistant for the Children's Literature class at Kent State, then a part-time instructor in 1969. After promotions to Assistant and Associate Professor in the English department, she became a full Professor in 1992. Apseloff was among the early leadership of the Children's Literature Association (ChLA), founded in 1973 to provide a professional hub for scholarly study and criticism of children's literature, a field at that time in its infancy. She served on the association's board of directors from 1976 to 1985, as treasurer from 1976 to 1977, and president from 1979 to 1980.\\"EDUCATION; GROWTH OF 'KIDDIE LIT'\\".

She taught and presented her work both nationally and internationally, including in Greece, Poland, and Lithuania. She also contributed her time to the Kent Free Public Library and local schools. Much of Apseloff's scholarly writing concerned absurdist and nonsense literature for children. With Celia Catlett Anderson, she wrote Nonsense Literature for Children: Aesop to Seuss, which was chosen as a Book Award Honorable Mention by the Children's Literature Association in 1991. The book received positive reviews in both The School Library Journal, and the journal Emergency Librarian, and along with related articles continues to be cited by scholars who are extending knowledge in the field of children's literary criticism and those studying the works of Theodor Geisel, Lewis Carroll, and Edward Gorey.Tulloch, B.

In about 1848 he arrived in Oakland County, Michigan and constructed a sawmill very near this location. In 1852, he constructed a gristmill nearby to make the location more attractive to potential settlers. In 1856, he replaced the gristmill with the current structure. The small community of Ortonville grew up around the milling center, with Amos Orton working as the miller, blacksmith, and keeping a general store. Orton gave up his mill in 1860, but it continued to thrive under a variety of owners well into the twentieth century. In 1889, the mill was converted to the roller process, and for a time during the 1920s also generated electric power for the community. The mill continued in use until 1960 In 1968, Emiline and Jack Hamilton donated the Mill to the Ortonville Community Historical Society for use as a museum of local history.

She was also a member of the central committee of the Marxist-Leninist Egyptian Communist Workers Party (ECWP). Much of her writing appeared in the ECWP paper, circulated underground due to state repression of communists. She also published several translations of Marxist literature in Arabic, including Tony Cliff's Class Struggle and Women's Liberation (1984). She has two published essay collections‚Äîal-Mubtasarun (or The Premature Ones/The Stillborn) and another, posthumously published, titled Saratan al-Rawh (Cancer of the Soul). She committed suicide in 1997. == Early life and education == Arwa Saleh was born in 1951 in Cairo, and studied English literature at Cairo University. Upon graduating, she worked as a school teacher for a short time, and then as a translator for the state-owned Middle East News Agency and the Saudi-funded economic newspaper al-'Alam al-Yawm (The World Today). She wrote socio- political essays under pseudonyms, and her translations of Marxist literature appeared in internal and secret pamphlets and newsletters of the Egyptian Communist Workers Party (Hizb al-'Ummal al-Shuyu'i al-Misri), which functioned as an underground organization. == Involvement in radical politics == Saleh was a prominent figure in the radical student movement of the early 1970s, which arose in response to the defeat of Egypt in the Arab-Israeli War of 1967 and opposition to al-Sadat's regime. An earlier wave of radical student politics in Egypt broke out in 1968, demanding harsher punishment for those responsible for the defeat in the Arab-Israeli war. Many leaders of this wave were co-opted by the regime or successfully intimidated and arrested. This wave of student activism facilitated the mobilization and recruitment of more students in political life. In late 1971 and early 1972, a new wave of demonstrations and strikes led by students erupted, with popular support. Anwar al-Sadat's cuts to public spending and suppression of freedom of speech provoked anger and fear, and the stalemate with Israel meant that many students spent a prolonged period in mandatory military service with no hope of entering the job market. Student movements, as a result, became more organized and militant‚Äîthey circulated leaflets, pamphlets and organized meetings criticizing the regime. Students occupied campuses for weeks, employing the machines and print supplies of the official Cairo University Press to print their statements. Arwa Saleh and Siham Sabri led sit-in strikes in Cairo University, and alongside many others, composed essays for wall posters, slogans, read poetry and performed plays. When the police stormed the campus on 29 December 1972, both student leaders were arrested and spent time in jail. In late December 1972 and early January 1973, students occupied Tahrir Square in Cairo (a scene remembered and replicated in January 2011). Despite state repression and the lack of an independent press, the students gained support from the public who joined the call to liberate Sinai from Israel and end authoritarianism. Saleh's deep engagement and involvement in these protests would inform her later work. al-Mubtasarun [The Stillborn] would reflect on the legacy of the 1960s student leaders‚Äîwho she termed as 'the melancholy generation'‚Äîand the frustrated hopes of the student movement of the 1970s who failed to translate mass nationalist support into support for an agenda tackling class inequity, wealth redistribution and other social issues‚Äîas such, to her this generation is 'premature'. Salih became a member of the central committee of the Egyptian Communist Workers Party, a large organization that grew out of the student movement of 1972 and was also involved in the 1977 uprisings against Sadat's economic liberalization policies. But many Marxist and other leftist organizations were small circles of intellectuals, with a limited base among workers, and riven with minor theoretical differences. Many activists and intellectuals in these circles drifted away from the movement in the 1980s‚Äîthey quit political activism and joined non-governmental organizations, international humanitarian agencies, or Islamist movements. == Later life and published writing == Salih's depression at the failure of the revolutionary Left's promise and the reality of Egypt in the 1980s led her to break away from the party. She later left for Spain. She wrote in this period, reflecting on her bitterness with the organizations she was once involved with, the sexual exploitation that women suffered within communist organizations and the behaviour of male intellectuals within the party and movement. In work later published posthumously, she wrote that she had received psychiatric treatment while she was away. Her first manuscript (which was lost and never published) and a posthumously published autobiographical text 'Strolling: Daydream of a Lonely Rover' was dedicated to patients in psychiatric clinics. She later also published an Arabic translation of Tony Cliff's 1984 book Class Struggle and Women's Liberation. Her most prominent work al-Mubtasarun [The Premature or The Stillborn] was a memoir of her experience in the student movement of the 1970s, with the stated goal of the 1990s generation perhaps learning from the mistakes of the 1960s and 70s. The book was published five years after she wrote it, and was issued with a new introduction. The book takes aim at hierarchical structures within communist organizations based on age, seniority and frequently, gender, accusing male activists of 'consuming' women in the movement, preying on young women and sexually defaming them if they resisted male advances. She also criticizes the pretence of intellectualism among communist leaders, prioritizing publication over effectively organizing resistance to the regime or attempting to gain public support for their goals. Sana' al-Masri stated that Salih had to secure a job when her supervisor at al-'Alam al-Yawm, a former Marxist activist, persecuted her for the publication of al-Mubtasarun, to prove to the newspaper's management that he disavowed his Marxist past. But Salih's sharp criticism of her former comrades in al-Mubtasarun, many of whom now headed Western-funded organizations, meant that many of them refused to hire her too. Throughout her adult life, she suffered from clinical depression and episodes of schizophrenia. After a number of unsuccessful attempts, she committed suicide in 1997, a few months after the publication of al- Mubtasarun. == Personal life == Salih married three times‚Äîtwice to communist intellectuals, and one brief marriage to a much younger poet of the 1990s generation. She was involved romantically with several comrades in the movement over her life, and wrote in al-Mubtasarun of the treatment of women and sexual liberation by male intellectuals in leftist circles, though without referring directly to her own experiences. Her first real lover, to whom she dedicated the book, was the young intellectual Baha' al-Naqqash. == Death and posthumous publications == In 1997 Arwa Saleh committed suicide by jumping from a tenth floor apartment.The most famous people who committed suicide in Egypt, The Cairo Post, Jan 11, 2014. The event is referred to in Ahdaf Soueif's 1999 novel The Map of Love, and Soueif and Salih had studied together in the English Department at Cairo University in the early 1970s. Her death has also been given fictional treatment in Radwa Ashour's 2008 novel Release as well as Youssef Rakha's 2014 novel The Crocodiles.Ibrahim Farghali, The Undeveloped Intellectual in Zombie-land, March 19, 2015 In Fathi Imbabi's al- Sab'iyyun (The 1970s Generation), Imbabi published a long eulogy for Salih without mentioning her name apart from in the dedication, holding her comrades (including himself) as responsible for her depression and suicide. A short and hastily edited selection of her papers was published in 1998‚Äîthese included an excerpt from her memoirs, a long poem and an essay on the novelist Son'allah Ibrahim's fiction ‚Äîand was titled Saratan al-Rawh (Cancer of the Soul). al- Mubtasarun was later reissued in 2016, by the Egyptian General Book Organization, a Ministry of Culture organ, as part of its 'family library' series. ==Works== * al-Mubtasarun [The Premature Ones], 1996.

Police did not believe the first victim, an 18-year-old woman known as Marie, who reported being raped at her home in Lynnwood, Washington. Detectives' bullying and hounding of her, according to a later report, led Marie to recant her statement, allowing her to be charged with making a false report of rape. O'Leary went on to rape five more women in a similar manner, one in Washington and four in Colorado. O'Leary was arrested in Lakewood, Colorado in February 2011, following 40 days of investigation by a team of detectives collaborating across several departments. The investigators used similarities in the attacker's methods, along with photos found on O'Leary's computer, to link O'Leary to the five rapes in both states. He pleaded guilty to multiple counts of rape and was sentenced to the maximum 327¬Ω years in prison in Colorado and a total of 68¬Ω years in Washington. O'Leary is currently imprisoned in the Sterling Correctional Facility. Between 2008 and 2012, Lynnwood police labeled 21 percent of rape cases as \\"unfounded\\", five times the national average for similarly sized municipalities. An outside review of Marie's case by the Snohomish County Sheriff‚Äôs Office found that she had been \\"coerced into admitting that she lied\\", and that the police had ignored strong evidence of the crime to focus on \\"minor inconsistencies\\" in her account. As a result, Lynnwood police have since adopted new training methods for sexual assault investigations, and must have \\"definitive proof\\" of lying before questioning a rape report. Despite the critical review, no Lynnwood police officers were professionally disciplined. T. Christian Miller of ProPublica and Ken Armstrong of The Marshall Project were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting for their \\"examination and expos√© of law enforcement's enduring failures\\" in the rape investigations. Their work, titled \\"An Unbelievable Story of Rape\\", was used as the basis for an episode of This American Life, narrated in part by Armstrong, and the Netflix series Unbelievable. ==See also== * Post-assault treatment of sexual assault victims ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * Category:Rape in the United States Category:Crimes in Colorado Category:Crimes in Washington (state) ","title":"Washington and Colorado serial rape cases"},{"id":"56793108","text":"Bor, M√°mor, B√©nye Festival (Wine, Shine...B√©nye) - festival in the gardens of Erd≈ëb√©nye was born in 2009 from an ideas session of six wineries in Hungary, Tokaj Wine Region, Erd≈ëb√©nye. The local wine makers, who later formed an association ‚Äì have staged this gastro-cultural event every year since. == History  The Beginnings === The event was born in 2009 from an ideas session and cooperation between six local wineries. The first festival was a one-day event on 15 th August 2009 where, as well as the local wineries, Hungarian gastrobloggers and regional restaurants created dishes founded on Zempl√©n flavours and raw ingredients, thus developing a distinct gastro- thread. Due to great interest, in 2010 the participants founded the Bor, M√°mor, B√©nye Association to be able to continue the work more professionally and since then it has been the Festival organizer. Two years later, in 2011, the festival expanded with a Friday night opening concert and joint tasting of all where the participating wineries came together to present their wines at a guided tasting. === Expansion === By 2013 the festival ran Friday-Saturday- Sunday with more events. By then over 12 wineries had joined the initiative and the event had become known throughout Hungary and popular with wine lovers from Poland and the Carpathian Basin. The festival also offered a campsite and parking area by then. That is when the entry system was introduced. === Today === In 2016 the event was a four-day event, to be more precise three days+zero day. The opening concert which had been on Friday moved with the joint tasting to Thursday evening. In 2017 the date of the festival changed to early July. The event will return to the original August time in 2019. == Venue == The event is held in Hungary, in the Tokaj Wine Region village of Erd≈ëb√©nye, where the venues for the wide range of events are the local gardens and cellars of the wineries, churches, village house museum and nearby vineyards. Current participants: √Åbrah√°m Wine, Bardon Winery, B√©res Vineyards and Winery, Budah√°zy-Fekete K√∫ria Winery, Csite Family Estate, Ill√©s Cellar, Jakab Winery, Kar√°di-Berger Winery, Ker√©kgy√°rt√≥ Cellar, Pr√©sel≈ë Winery, Pro Vinum Winery, Sanzon Tokaj, Vayi Winery. == Gastronomy == It was primarily gastro-bloggers who created the dishes at the beginning. Over the years top restaurants from the region and Hungary came to the forefront. The organizers aim to show local ingredients and recipes in the long term. The Tokaj Wine Region produces white wines and the wines that can be tasted in the wineries‚Äô cellars are mainly white wines: The main varieties are Furmint, H√°rslevel≈± and Muscat Lunel along with cuv√©es hereof. == Events == The long weekend starts with Thursday evening joint tasting in which all the wineries participate followed by a concert. The other days of the festival see the wineries‚Äô gardens become the venues for events. Music ranges through jazz, folk music and world music. Artists have performed here including Muzsik√°s, Viktor T√≥th, Vilmos Gryllus, Mih√°ly Dresch, but the organizers place great emphasis on bringing less well-known talents to the festival too. From 2018 the event also provides a home for the coopers‚Äô dance, unique to this barrel-making village, and showing the traditions of barrel making. In addition there are exhibitions, literary readings and interviews, plus handcrafts, children‚Äôs events, round table discussions, thematic tastings, bicycle tours and other events. == References  More information == * Wine, Shine...

Compiled by journalist Bob Stanley, it contains a string of singles recorded between 1969 and 1984 that the band recorded in their home studio and released on various record labels. The band, primarily consisting of Rod Woodward and Nigel Fletcher, were influenced by Joe Meek, and started the band in order to explore experimental and disparate ideas within pop music, describing their musical style as the \\"scrap iron sound\\" in reference to their incorporation of unusual instruments. Their singles were commercially unsuccessful, though the band would find major success with \\"Mouldy Old Dough\\" (1972) under the extended line-up of Lieutenant Pigeon. Though Lieutenant Pigeon were subject to a \\"best of\\" compilation in 2001, The Scrap Iron Rhythm Revue marked the first time that Stavely Makepeace released a compilation of their material, following the appearance of their 1972 single \\"Slippery Rock '70s\\" on the compilation Velvet Tinmine (2003), which compiled obscure glam rock singles. The Scrap Iron Rhythm Revue received critical acclaim, with praise given to the idiosyncratic songs and production. The producers of Hot Fuzz used \\"Sloppy Rock '70s\\" in the film after hearing it on the compilation, somewhat rising the band's profile. ==Background and releaseBand career=== Rob Woodward (born in Coventry in 1945) became a professional musician in 1963 and released two unsuccessful singles under the name Shel Naylor on Decca Records between 1963‚Äì64 before the label dropped him, which resulted in him returning to performing on the nightclub circuit. It was at this stage that he began collaboration with Nigel Fletcher. The music that the pair made together was eccentric pop, reflecting their obsession with producer Joe Meek. The pair were separated while Fletcher served in the British Merchant Navy, but their creative partnership was resumed in late 1968 after Fletcher was discharged. They moved into the Coventry home of Woodward's mother Hilda, and set up their own makeshift recording studio in her living room. They dubbed their project Stavely Makepeace and added Pete Fisher on bass and Don Ker on drums to flesh out their initial sessions. The duo experimented with disparate musical ideas in the studio, allegedly taking influence from Elvis Presley and Gene Vincent, despite Stavely Makepeace's music bearing little to no resemblance to either performer. Stavely Makepeace referred to the style of music they created as the \\"scrap iron sound,\\" the name referring to how they relied on experimentation as much as they did musicianship. This followed Joe Meek's ideas of sound creation in that, for as long as a sound is considered great, it does not matter how it is produced. The duo became confident enough to record a number of songs to take to different record labels. Pyramid Records took interest in the band and released their debut single, \\"(I Want to Love You Like a) Mad Dog\\", in mid-1969. Before Pyramid could release the band's projected second single, \\"Reggae Denny\\", the label went bankrupt. They added guitarist Steve Tayton on guitar and woodwinds in early 1970 and, following the departure of Fisher, Steve Johnson joined the band as the replacement bassist. The band signed to Concord Records and scored a minor hit with \\"Edna,\\" which was performed by the band on Top of the Pops. It was first released by Concorde in the UK in 1970 and was then released by EMI in France on 14 August and by Deutsche Grammophon in Germany two weeks later, an example of Concorde's continental distribution deal with the two latter labels. The single was followed by 1971's \\"Smokey Mountain Rhythm Revue\\", whose tongue-in-cheek instrumental B-side, \\"Rampant on the Rage,\\" inspired the creation of a side-project band named Lieutenant Pigeon, who had the same line-up as Stavely Makepeace but with the addition of Woodward's mother Hilda on piano. This single was in turn followed by \\"Give Me That Pistol\\" later on in 1971. Despite Woodward and Fletcher being so productive in the early 1970s that they would write at least a song a week for the Stavely Makepeace project, none of Stavely Makepeace's singles had been successful so far, and this pattern continued when they left Concorde and released a trio of singles on Spark Records. Their first single for Spark, \\"Slippery Rock '70s\\" (1972), nonetheless received airplay on BBC Radio 1 by Dave Lee Travis. Meanwhile, as Lieutenant Pigeon, the members had found success when \\"Mouldy Old Dough\\", a novelty instrumental that unfaithfully replicated vintage pub music in an \\"odd and off\\" fashion with growled vocals, reached number 1 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming one of the best-selling singles of 1972 and also allowing its 1973 follow-up \\"Desperate Dan\\" to reach number 17. After the release of Stavely Makepeace' final Spark singles \\"Walking Through the Blue Glass\\" (1972) and \\"Prima Donna\\" (1973), the band released \\"Cajun Band\\" on Deram Records to further public indifference. When 1974's \\"Runaround Sue\\" also flopped, the band focused their attention on Lieutenant Pigeon. The Stavely Makepeace outtakes \\"Baby Blue Eyes\\" and \\"No Regrets\\" were released to no success by Unigram Records in 1977 and Barn Records in 1978 respectively, but convinced the band to reunite. Nonetheless, when the 1980 Hammer Records single \\"Songs of Yesterday\\" and 1983's self- released \\"Just Tell Her Fred Said Goodbye\\" both flopped, the pair permanently discontinued Stavely Makepeace and once again focused on the long-lived Lieutenant Pigeon. Woodward and Fletcher also continued their partnership in other ventures, including voice-overs and radio jingles and the 2001 joint autobiography When Show Business Is No Business. ===Compilation=== For a lengthy period of time, Stavely Makepeace's material was left uncompiled. This was in contrast to Lieutenant Pigeon, who were subject to the Cherry Red Records compilation The Best of Lieutenant Pigeon (2001), which combined the band's 1970s singles alongside album tracks and unreleased songs. In February 2003, Stavely Makepeace's 1972 single \\"Slippery Rock '70s\\" appeared on the various artists compilation Velvet Tinmine, which compiled 20 obscure glam rock singles from the 1970s. Interest in the group had picked up, which allowed the band to release a compilation of their material. Named The Scrap Iron Rhythm Revue after the band's description of their musical style, the album compiles most of the band's singles, recorded between 1969 and 1984, and is their first overall album. The BBC noted that, with the compilation, \\"it took thirty-six years for Stavely Makepeace to release their first album.\\" It features 22 tracks and was compiled by journalist and musician Bob Stanley with help from Mark Stratford, whose reissue label, RPM Records, released the compilation on 24 May 2004. The album's lengthy liner notes are written by the band themselves. Lora Findlay designed the album artwork. ==Musical style== borough in Pennsylvania. In their reviews of The Scrap Iron Rhythm Revue, critics highlighted the unusual, disparate sound to the songs. Uncut felt that the band fused 1970s MOR music with DIY avant-garde, and wrote: \\"Speeding up and multi-tracking home recordings in their mum's front room, they concocted phased, clunking West Midlands exotica and spliced whole new genres: radiophonic cajun reggae, yodelling steam-punk, Joe Meek boogie.\\" AllMusic made note that, as was the case with Lieutenant Pigeon's output, Stavely Makepeace's home productions focused on applying quirky, moderately lo-fi production to simplistic pop songs with strong echoes of both British novelty music and 1950s rock and roll, with songs boasting fiddle lines, horns, old- fashioned piano and \\"anachronistic\\" use of echo. Unlike the largely instrumental Lieutenant Pigeon, the music on The Scrap Iron Rhythm Revue is generally more focused on songs with vocals. Bob Stanley made note of the band's \\"Dada\\" sound. Their 1969 debut single \\"(I Wanna Love You Like a) Mad Dog\\" opens the compilation. According to Stanley, the song \\"sounds like a one- man oompah band\\" that has been phased to \\"simulate a psychedelic experience.\\" It features tongue-in-cheek sexual lyrics that Stanley compared to the controversial lyrics of Marie Lloyd. \\"Edna\\" is a pop song with the high pitched refrain ‚Äì sung by either Woodward or Fletcher ‚Äì of \\"Ed-ed, Ed-ed, Ed- ed-ed-ed-Edna, let me sing my beautiful song.\\" The BBC described the song's vocals as \\"quirky\\" yodelling. In comparing the band's eclectic array of styles, they also felt it contrasted with the rock and roll-styled \\"Runaround Sue\\". Their 1972 single \\"Slippery Rock '70s\\" was recorded as the \\"slightly rocky\\" backing to a track named \\"Fan It\\". When Woodward and Fletcher attempted to add vocals to the track, they agreed it would sound better without singing, thus erased the vocals and shelved the remaining track. A chance meeting with Spark Records' Bob Kingston, who heard the backing track by accident when listening to a tape of the band's material, believed it to be a completed instrumental and told the band it was impressive enough to release as a single, although a name was needed. Fletcher named it \\"Slippery Rock\\" after the borough in Pennsylvania where he had recently stayed. The \\"70s\\" suffix was added by Spark. Uncut felt the song \\"glimmered with authentic strangeness.\\" ==Reception and legacy== The Scrap Iron Rhythm Revue received positive reviews from critics. As was the case with The Best of Lieutenant Pigeon, The Scrap Iron Rhythm Revue received four and a half stars out of five from AllMusic and was named an \\"Album Pick\\". Writing for the website, Richie Unterberger felt that even though the singles compiled on the album \\"aimed for the pop charts,\\" they had been unsuccessful because Woodward and Nigel were \\"just a little too strange for their own good.\\" He felt the \\"idiosyncratic production\\" was more interesting than the songs, but felt that the compilation does \\"justice\\" to the band's legacy. Uncut felt that the compilation proved that the band consistently created genuinely unusual songs, and wrote that: \\"Their destiny was as a novelty footnote, but this exemplary reissue excavates a weirdly potent homebrew 10cc.\\" The producers of the 2007 comedy film Hot Fuzz decided to use \\"Slippery Rock 70s\\" in the film's soundtrack after hearing it on the compilation. Fletcher paid to see the film to see if the instrumental was used and was pleased to hear it used in its entirety. It was the first time that Fletcher had been enquired by others to use a Stavely Makepeace track in a project, and helped rise the band's profile, with the Coventry Telegraph calling it the band's \\"big break.\\" Jamie Hewlett of Gorillaz became a fan of the band. \\"(I Wanna Love You Like a) Mad Dog\\" features on the protopunk compilation Punk 45: Sick On You! One Way Spit! After The Love & Before The Revolution - Proto-Punk 1970-77 Vol. 3, released in 2014 by Soul Jazz Records. In 2015, Stavely Makepeace reunited to release the one-off comeback single \\"Time Marches On,\\" a song which was described by the Coventry Telegraph as \\"as quirky\\" as the band's other material and as tracking the advent of pop music since the 1950s. ==Track listing== # \\"(I Wanna Love You Like a) Mad Dog\\" ‚Äì 3:45 # \\"Edna\\" ‚Äì 2:22 # \\"Smokey Mountain Rhythm Revue\\" ‚Äì 2:53 # \\"Walking Through the Blue Grass\\" ‚Äì 2:46 # \\"The Sundance\\" ‚Äì 2:51 # \\"Give Me That Pistol\\" ‚Äì 2:15 # \\"Slippery Rock ‚Äô70s\\" ‚Äì 2:51 # \\"Cajun Band\\" ‚Äì 2:51 # \\"Memories of Your Love\\" ‚Äì 2:43 # \\"Prima Donna\\" ‚Äì 2:43 # \\"Swings and Roundabouts\\" ‚Äì 2:14 # \\"There's a Wall Between Us\\" ‚Äì 4:20 # \\"Summer Weekends\\" ‚Äì 3:11 # \\"Baby Blue Eyes\\" ‚Äì 3:26 # \\"Big Bad Baby Blondie\\" ‚Äì 2:03 # \\"No Regrets\\" ‚Äì 3:39 # \\"Cradle of Love\\" ‚Äì 3:04 # \\"Hell Bent on Rock'n'Roll\\" ‚Äì 3:16 # \\"Songs of Yesterday\\" ‚Äì 2:55 # \\"Gillie's Bar Is Empty\\" ‚Äì 2:44 # \\"Mr Pleasant\\" ‚Äì 2:52 # \\"Just Tell Her Fred Said Goodbye\\" ‚Äì 3:49 ==PersonnelStavely Makepeace=== *Rob Woodward *Nigel Fletcher ===Production=== *Bob Stanley ‚Äì compiling, producing *Lora Findlay ‚Äì design, artwork *Nigel Fletcher ‚Äì production *Rob Woodward ‚Äì production *Mark Stratford ‚Äì production ==References== Category:2004 compilation albums Category:RPM Records (United Kingdom) albums Category:Avant-pop albums Category:Albums recorded in a home studio Category:Pop albums by English artists Category:Experimental music albums by English artists Category:Lo-fi music albums ","title":"The Scrap Iron Rhythm Revue"},{"id":"56793125","text":"Ibn Al‚ÄêRaqqam Mu·∏•ammad Ibn Ibrahim Al‚ÄêMursi Al‚ÄêAndalusi Al‚ÄêTunisi Al‚ÄêAwsi () also known as Ibn Al‚ÄêRaqqam was a 13th century Andalusian-Arab astronomer, mathematician and physician; but also a Sunni Muslim theologian and jurist. == Biography == Abu Abdullah Ibn Al-Raqam was born in Murcia in 1250, in an family with the nisba al-Awsi, probably from the Banu Aws tribe, and grew up and learned there until the city was annexed by Castile in 1266.

As a result of the non-aromatic carbon-carbon double bond, cinnamyl acetate can exist in a Z and an E configuration: Cinnamyl acetate naturally occurs in fresh bark of cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume and other Cinnamomum species), with concentrations of 2,800‚Äì51,000 ppm. Cinnamyl acetate is used as a flavour ester in for example bread and animal feed and has a sweet floral-fruity fragrance. Moreover, it is used in several cosmetics, some toiletries but also in non-cosmetic products, for example detergents. == Legislation and control == Cinnamyl acetate, used in fragrances and as flavour ingredient, has been discussed by several institutions. In 1965, the compound was annotated as 'Generally Recognized as Safe as a flavor ingredient‚Äô by the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers\\" Association (FEMA). The association determined the average maximum use levels in several products that were considered to be safe: {  !Beverages !Ice cream, ices, etc. !Candy !Baked goods !Chewing gum - 2.7 ppm 6.5 ppm 16 ppm 11 ppm 8.7 ppm } The European Parliament registered cinnamyl acetate as both a flavouring substance and a cosmetic compound in 1996.COMMISSION DECISION of 23 February 1999 adopting a register of flavouring substances used in or on foodstuffs drawn up in application of Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 October 1996COMMISSION DECISION of 8 May 1996 establishing an inventory and a common nomenclature of ingredients employed in cosmetic products The Joint (FAO/WHO) Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) described in 2000 that ‚Äúthe substance does not present a safety concern at current levels of intake when used as a flavouring agent‚Äù. In 2009, the EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzyme, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) concluded that cinnamyl acetate does not give rise to safety concerns when used as flavour ingredient in food. Cinnamyl acetate is also permitted by the U.S. Food & Drug administration for use as flavouring agent in food if the minimum quantity needed for its effect is used. == Production and intake == Estimates of the average annual production and daily intake of cinnamyl acetate as flavouring agent are reported by the WHO. According to this report, the annual volume of production in Europe is 1498 kg, and in the USA 2255 kg. The daily intake per person in Europe is estimated to be 210 Œºg, and in the USA 300 Œºg. Per kg body weight the daily intake is estimated for Europeans to be 4 Œºg/kg and for Americans to be 5 Œºg/kg. == Synthesis == Since cinnamyl acetate is naturally occurring in plants, it can be extracted and purified to obtain the compound. However, this has a low yield and therefore the production costs are high. The use of chemical methods can offer more efficient strategies to produce cinnamyl acetate. There are multiple ways to synthesize cinnamyl acetate 2. One way is the synthesis from cinnamyl alcohol 1 and vinyl acetate. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme triacylglycerol ester hydrolase, which is a lipase that is very specific towards the ester bond. The byproduct of this reaction is acetaldehyde. The reaction equation for this reaction is: :: 490x490px Since acetaldehyde has an unfavourable deactivating effect on the lipase used in the synthesis, ethyl acetate can be used as reactant instead of vinyl acetate. In this transesterification reaction cinnamyl alcohol 1 reacts with ethyl acetate to form cinnamyl acetate 2 and ethanol. This synthesis requires the lipase Novozym 435, and is performed in a solvent-free system. The reaction is as follows: :: 490x490px Cinnamyl acetate 2 can also be synthesized via a non- enzymatic reaction. An example of such a reaction is one with the use of cinnamyl bromide 3 and sodium acetate as reactants. Since these compounds are immiscible substrates, solid-liquid phase transfer catalysis (PTC) can be used, using quaternary ammonium bromide as a phase transfer catalyst. This is shown in the following reaction: :: 490x490px Besides these three examples, there are many more ways to synthesize cinnamyl acetate. The addition reaction of dinitrogen trioxide to cinnamyl acetate produces an intermediate in the synthesis of chloramphenicol. == Metabolism == Cinnamyl acetate belongs to the group of cinnamyl derivatives. In general, these cinnamyl derivatives are absorbed from the gut very quickly, after which they are metabolized and excreted as polar metabolites in the urine or feces within 24 hours. Within the cinnamyl derivatives, cinnamyl acetate belongs to the group of cinnamyl esters. After absorption from the gut, this group of compounds is first hydrolyzed to cinnamyl alcohol by carboxylesterases. Carboxylesterases are a group of enzymes. The most important enzymes within this group are the A-esterases. These are present in most body tissues, but they are prevalent in the hepatocytes. Subsequently, the cinnamyl alcohol is oxidized which leads to the formation of cinnamaldehyde. This reaction is catalyzed by human NAD+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase. Now, there are two routes for the further biotransformation of cinnamaldehyde. The minor route of biotransformation is the S-glutathionylation. The major route, however, is the conversion of cinnamaldehyde into cinnamic acid by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase. Next, the cinnamic acid is transformed into cinnamoyl CoA which is again converted to either cinnamoylglycine by N-acyl transferase or to benzoyl CoA through Œ≤-oxidation, the latter being the major route. Intermediate metabolites in the Œ≤-oxidation pathway can be converted to 3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionic acid and acetophenone, which can be excreted via the urine. However, the conversions of these intermediate metabolites are minor routes. Finally, the benzoyl CoA is conjugated with glycine under formation of hippuric acid or it is hydrolyzed generating free benzoic acid. This can be excreted via the urine directly or after glucuronidation. Hippuric acid, which is the major metabolite, is also excreted via the urine. ::thumb == Toxicity == Since cinnamyl acetate is used as both a fragrance material and a food flavouring ingredient, dermal and oral exposure are considered to be the major routes of absorption. The dermal systematic exposure of cinnamyl acetate via cosmetic products is estimated to be 0.0115 mg/kg body weight/day. Several experiments using animals were conducted in the past to assess the toxicity of cinnamyl acetate. In one experiment, the oral toxicity was tested in rats. The rats received oral doses of cinnamyl acetate and the LD50 was found to be 3.3 g/kg. During the experiment, symptoms as slow respiration and coarse tremors were observed for high doses. Other experiments showed LD50 values of 4.750 g/kg for oral administration in mice and guinea pigs. Also, the LD50 value for intraperitoneal administration was investigated and found to be 1.200 g/kg. Furthermore, studies on the dermal toxicity were performed. Experiments on rabbits resulted in an LD50 of more than 5.0 g/kg, but no clinical effects were observed. Moreover, the level of skin irritation in swines was tested via a 48-h patch test. In this study, 0.05 g of cinnamyl acetate was applied and no irritation was observed. Another two experiments examined the skin irritation caused by 0.1 mL cinnamyl acetate on guinea pigs and rabbits via a direct application on the skin (open application). Mild to moderate irritation was observed in these experiments. A NOAEL for oral administration of 275 mg/kg body weight/day was determined from toxicological data by the EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP). Besides these experiments on animals, some human studies were executed. A 48-h closed patch test on five healthy, male volunteers was performed using 5% cinnamyl acetate in petrolatum. In this study, no irritation was observed. Mild irritation was observed in another 48-h patch test on fifty male volunteers using 32% cinnamyl acetate in acetone. Finally, a human study on skin sensitization was executed on 25 healthy, male volunteers. In this experiment a maximization test (48-h patch) was done using 5% cinnamyl acetate in petrolatum. Skin sensitization reactions were not observed. Moreover, standard Draize tests were used to assess the dermal toxicity in humans, guinea pigs and rabbits. This resulted in mild skin irritation for doses of 16 mg per 48 hours for humans and for doses of 100 mg per 24 hours for guinea pigs. Moderate skin irritation was observed for rabbits exposed to doses of 100 mg per 24 hours. Lastly, the potential of cinnamyl acetate to cause sister chromatid exchanges was tested using Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells. This was done because it was found that another component of plant essence and cinnamyl derivative, cinnamaldehyde, increased the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges induced by mitomycin C. However, the result of this test proved that cinnamyl acetate does not cause sister chromatid exchange due to the absence of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl group. == Effects on animals == Cinnamyl acetate is found in the leaf oils of the Cinnamomum osmophloeum tree, which grows in central and northern Taiwan. It is found that these oils have antibacterial, antimildew, antitermite, antimite, antifungal and anti-inflammatory activities. Furthermore, the oils show mosquito larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus larvae. However, cinnamyl acetate serves only a minor role in these activities. Moreover, cinnamyl acetate has a repellent effect on Anopheles gambiae, and is therefore useful to protect against these insects. == References == Category:Food additives Category:Methyl esters Category:Cinnamomum Category:Acetate esters ","title":"Cinnamyl acetate"},{"id":"56793197","text":"Mount Crawford is a locality in the Mount Lofty Ranges of South Australia.

It was published under the male pseudonym Graham Travers. == Plot summary == The novel opens with Mona - an orphan and student at the London School of Medicine for Women - failing her Intermediate Examinations. Taking an extended break from her studies, she stays with her distant cousin, Rachel, a shopkeeper in rural Scotland. Rachel asks Mona to conceal her identity as a medical student from the local community and start working with her in the shop. Mona complies but finds the ruse difficult to sustain after she falls for a male medical student, Ralph Dudley, who is staying nearby. By the close of the novel, Mona and Dudley have successfully passed their medical examinations. They get married and set up a joint practice. == Themes == The novel's key themes include women's education and work, female friendships, and marriage. Drawing on Todd's own experiences, the story explores women's roles in the medical profession. Charles Ferrall and Anna Jackson suggest that Mona's story is \\"largely about the negotiation of class\\" rather than romance. Mona's middle-class status becomes temporarily strained not only by her choice to pursue a medical vocation, but also by her decision to live with her poor relations. == Reception == The novel was well- received upon its publication and reached fifteen editions by 1900.

Her parents were Jane Catharine Tost, an English taxidermist and museum worker, and Charles Gottleibe Tost, a Prussian pianoforte-maker. The family migrated from England to Tasmania when Ada was seven years old, arriving in Hobart Town in January 1856. In 1860 they moved to Sydney, where Jane Tost worked as a taxidermist at the Australian Museum. ===Career=== As a young woman Ada acted at the Queen Victoria Theatre in Sydney. She married James Richardson Coates in 1868 and they had three children. After James' death in 1872 Ada and her mother Jane opened a taxidermy shop, Tost & Coates (later Tost & Rohu), at 60 William Street, Sydney. Their customers included museums and scientific collectors as well as middle-class households shopping for interior decor. Known as \\"the queerest shop in Australia\\", their business supplied the Australian Museum with many important specimens. In 1891, Ada helped to prepare the Australian exhibit for the Chicago World‚Äôs Fair. Ada and Jane exhibited their taxidermy work at many international exhibitions, and between 1860 and 1900 won more than 20 medals. Their work was valued for its skill and for its innovative treatment of Australian fauna. One known example of Ada Rohu's taxidermy work survives: a squirrel held by the Australian Museum. ===Marriage and children=== Ada married James Richardson Coates on 8 October 1868 in Woolloomooloo, Sydney. They had three children. James Coates died fighting a fire at the Prince of Wales Theatre, Sydney, in 1872. On 12 September 1878 she married Henry Steward Boventure Rohu, with whom she had six children. ===Death and afterward=== Ada Jane Rohu died on 28 July 1928 at Newtown and was buried in Rookwood Cemetery. ==References/Notes and references== Category:Australian businesspeople Category:19th-century Australian women Category:1848 births Category:1928 deaths Category:20th-century Australian women ","title":"Ada Jane Rohu"},{"id":"56793394","text":"Mihali√ß can refer to: * Old name of Karacabey, a town in northwestern Turkey * Mihali√ß Peyniri, an aged sheep's milk cheese from Turkey * Mihalƒ±√ß√ßƒ±k, town in central Turkey ==See also== * Mihali√ß (disambiguation) ","title":"Mihali√ß"},{"id":"56793409","text":"James Brook is a stream in Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of Massachusetts.

Born in Warrington, Greening grew up in Bedford, Lancashire and then Manchester, as his father's wire-drawing business moved location. He was educated at a Quaker school on Mount Street in Manchester, but left when he was thirteen years old, to become an apprentice wire-drawer. Three years later, he was promoted to an office position, and he began taking evening classes. Greening's father emigrated to Canada in 1855, and Greening took the opportunity to start his own wire-drawing business with a brother. This proved successful.Joyce Bellamy, Edmund Frow and John Saville, \\"Greening, Edward Owen\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.I, pp.136-141 From an early age, Greening became involved in local radical causes, including the Anti-Slavery Society, the United Kingdom Alliance, and the Union and Emancipation Society. In particular, he became joint honorary secretary of the last of these, and lectured around the country in support of its aim, supporting the north in the American Civil War. He was a founder of the Manchester and Salford Manhood Suffrage League - the local section of the Reform League - and also became interested in co-operation, beginning to incorporate the ideas into his own business. He also helped fund a significant number of co-operative ventures, most of which proved unsuccessful. The key exception was the Agricultural and Horticultural Association, also known as the \\"One and All Association\\", which provided agricultural tools, seeds, and related items. In 1867, Greening became the founder and editor of Industrial Partnership Record, which the following year became Social Economist, Greening then sharing editing duties with G. J. Holyoake. That year, he also organised a national conference of co-operative activists, in Manchester, the immediate predecessor of the modern Co-operative Congress. Greening stood in Halifax at the 1868 UK general election, with the backing of a local committee of radical workers. Although he did not receive the backing of the Reform League, its local branch did support his candidacy. However, he was easily defeated by two official Liberal Party candidates. Later in 1868, Greening moved to London, to become managing director of the One and All. His wire-drawing business collapsed in 1870, and he thereafter remained focused on his co-operative interests. He founded the Co-operative Institute and the annual National Co- operative Festival. He was a founder of the International Co-operative Alliance, chairing its first conference, and was its secretary from 1895 until 1902.William P. Watkins, The International Co-operative Alliance, 1895-1970, p.272 He was also a founder of the Co-operative Productive Federation, and the Labour Association. The One and All closed in 1915, its business affected by World War I, and this left Greening short of money. Co-operative societies twice organised testimonial funds for him, and he remained active in the movement. In 1917, he moved the motion opposing the formation of the Co- operative Party, as he believed that the movement should be represented through existing political parties. By the autumn of 1917 he had changed his mind and at the party's emergency conference he said that \\"after the great vote at Swansea he recognised that it was necessary that the experiment should be made in direct representation\\".Co-operative Congress report of the November 1917 Co-operative ==References== Category:1836 births Category:1923 deaths Category:Cooperative organizers Category:Liberal-Labour (UK) politicians Category:People from Warrington ","title":"Edward Owen Greening"},{"id":"56793528","text":"Joseph \\"Joe\\" Efford (born August 29, 1996) is an American professional soccer player who plays as a left winger for Belgian side Waasland-Beveren. == Club career  Early career === Efford graduated from Dacula High School in 2014. After he finished freshman orientation at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, he passed up a college soccer scholarship and opted for a professional career in Europe. === Boto»ôani === He went through several trials in Romania, before landing a contract with Liga I side FC Boto»ôani in June 2014. His contract, however, was terminated in July 2014. === Mallorca === He left Romania to undergo a new series of tryouts in Spain, eventually ending up training with Segunda Divisi√≥n side RCD Mallorca. After convincing Los Bermellones of his worth during two-week trial, he signed a contract with the club in September 2014. However, problems with his visa kept him effectively out of the team for 7 months before he was eventually cleared to play. In his two seasons with the club, he only managed to appear in one match. === Ergotelis === In September 2017, Efford went on trial with Greek Football League side Ergotelis and earned a contract. He received the no. 9 jersey and scored on his debut on October 25, 2017, in a 2‚àí4 home loss to Superleague club Xanthi in the Greek Cup. On March 5, 2018, in his twelfth league appearance for the club, Efford scored his first two goals in a 0‚àí3 away win against AO Chania‚àíKissamikos. He also provided the assist for teammate Hugo Cuypers' goal in the 13th minute. Efford followed this with an early goal against Panachaiki on March 8. He scored a second brace on April 1, 2018, in a 5‚àí1 victory over Panegialios. Efford quickly became the focal point of Ergotelis' attack in the 2018‚Äì19 season, finishing as top-scorer for the club with 11 goals. During the following season, Efford scored his first professional hat trick on January 13, 2020, and moved up to second place on Ergotelis's list of all-time top scorers in professional competitions with 31 goals. === Waasland-Beveren === After Efford's contract with Ergotelis expired in the summer of 2020, Efford signed a three-year contract with Belgian First Division side Waasland-Beveren on July 20, 2020. ==Career statistics== {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Continental !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals -  rowspan=\\"2\\" Boto»ôani 2014‚Äì15 Liga I 0 0 0 0  colspan=\\"4\\" ‚Äî 0 0 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total !0 !0 !0 !0 ! colspan=\\"4\\" ‚Äî !0 !0 -  rowspan=\\"3\\" Mallorca 2014‚Äì15  rowspan=\\"2\\" Segunda Divisi√≥n 1000  colspan=\\"4\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî10 - 2015‚Äì16 000000 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total !1!!0!!0!!0!! colspan=\\"4\\" ‚Äî!!1!!0 -  rowspan=\\"4\\" Ergotelis 2017‚Äì18  rowspan=\\"2\\" Football League 24721 colspan=\\"4\\" rowspan=\\"3\\" ‚Äî268 - 2018‚Äì19 2711823513 - 2019‚Äì20 Superleague 2 1911202111 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total !70!!29!!12!!3!! colspan=\\"4\\" ‚Äî!!82!!32 -  rowspan=\\"2\\" Waasland-Beveren 2020‚Äì21 Belgian First Division A 6200 colspan=\\"4\\" ‚Äî62 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total !6!!2!!0!!0!! colspan=\\"4\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî!!6!!2 - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Career total !77!!31!!12!!3!!89!!34 } ==References * Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:American soccer players Category:American expatriate sportspeople in Spain Category:American expatriate sportspeople in Greece Category:American expatriate sportspeople in Belgium Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Expatriate footballers in Greece Category:Expatriate footballers in Belgium Category:RCD Mallorca players Category:Ergotelis F.C. players Category:Waasland-Beveren players Category:Super League Greece 2 players Category:Belgian Second Division/Belgian First Division B players Category:Association football midfielders ","title":"Joseph Efford"},{"id":"56793529","text":"HD Media Co., LLC is a Huntington, West Virginia based publisher of daily and weekly newspapers and magazines. It was established by Doug Reynolds in 2013 to purchase the Herald-Dispatch from Champion Industries. == Newspapers  The Herald-Dispatch === In 2013, HD Media purchased the Herald-Dispatch from Champion Industries.Champion to sell Herald-Dispatch for $10 Million http://www.statejournal.com/story/22682907/champion-to-sell-herald-dispatch- for-10-million The Herald-Dispatch was founded in 1909 when two Huntington newspapers, the Herald and the Dispatch, merged.[3] In 1927, the newspaper became a part of the Huntington Publishing Company, operated by Joseph Harvey Long, the owner of the Huntington Advertiser. The company was operated by the Long family until 1971, when it was sold to the Honolulu Star Bulletin and then to the Gannett Company ten months later.[3] Its companion afternoon paper, the Huntington Advertiser, ceased as a separate publication in 1979. Prior to the Huntington Advertiser's demise, the combined Sunday newspaper was referred to as the Herald-Advertiser, correctly depicted in the movie We Are Marshall. Today, it also publishes the Putnam Herald and the Lawrence Herald, more localized editions of The Herald-Dispatch serving Putnam County, West Virginia and Lawrence County, Ohio, respectively. === Charleston Gazette-Mail === On March 8, 2018, HD Media, the Herald-Dispatch's holding company, was declared the successful bid in the auction for the Charleston Gazette-Mail after the paper had declared bankruptcy. The Charleston Gazette-Mail is the only daily morning newspaper in Charleston, West Virginia. It is the product of a July 2015 merger between the Charleston Gazette and the Charleston Daily Mail. The Gazette traces its roots to 1873. At the time, it was a weekly newspaper known as the Kanawha Chronicle. It was later renamed The Kanawha Gazette and the Daily Gazette‚Äîbefore its name was officially changed to The Charleston Gazette in 1907. In 1912 it came under the control of the Chilton family, who have owned it until its bankruptcy in 2018. William E. Chilton, a U.S. senator, was publisher of The Gazette, as were his son, William E. Chilton II, and grandson, W.E. \\"Ned\\" Chilton III, Yale graduate and classmate/prot√©g√© of conservative columnist William F. Buckley, Jr.. Ironically, the paper's opinion page, usually on the left, carried Buckley's column until Buckley's death. Ned Chilton used to claim that the job of a newspaper was to \\"comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.\\" The newspaper's liberal reputation was enhanced by principal editorial writer and columnist L.T. Anderson, associate editor and two-time runner-up for the Pulitzer Prize. Anderson later moved to the rival Daily Mail as a columnist after he was passed over for an editorial position at the Gazette, and often used his Daily Mail column to snipe at his former employer. The Daily Mail was founded in 1914 by former Alaska Governor Walter Eli Clark and remained the property of his heirs until 1987. Governor Clark described the newspaper as an \\"independent Republican\\" publication. In 1987, the Clark heirs sold the paper to the Toronto-based Thomson Newspapers. The new owners moderated the political views of the paper to some degree. In 1998, Thomson sold the Daily Mail to the Denver-based MediaNews Group. The newspaper published in the afternoons, Monday-Saturday, with a Sunday morning edition, until 1961; Monday ‚Äì Saturday afternoons from 1961‚Äì2005, Monday ‚Äì Friday afternoons from 2005‚Äì2009, and Monday ‚Äì Friday mornings from 2009‚Äì2015. === Other papers === In 2014, The Herald-Dispatch parent company HD Media acquired the Wayne County News in Wayne, West Virginia.

He kept a diary while being held at the Berga concentration camp that was instrumental in documenting Nazi atrocities against American prisoners of war. In civilian life, Acevedo worked as an engineer. ==Early life== Acevedo was born in San Bernardino, California, on July 31, 1924, to Francisco Guillermo Acevedo, an engineer from Mexico, and Maria Louisa Contreras (n√©e Limantur) Acevedo.Whitlock p. 7 His early education was in San Bernardino, where he attended a local school for non- white students. Anthony's mother died when he was two years of age. Four years after his first wife's death, his father remarried to a woman with an identical name, Maria Louisa Morgan. Acevedo's step-mother was deported to Mexico sometime later; as a result his father moved the family to Durango, Mexico in 1937, In addition, the Great Depression had made finding employment difficult in the United States. Acevedo's father found employment as an engineer in Mexico City with the Pan-American Highway, and eventually became an official for the Federal Mexican Government. As a teenager, Acevedo and a friend intercepted radio messages sent in Morse code from German agents operating in Mexico to a German submarine in coastal waters. As a result, the agents were captured and tried in court. ==Education and draft== From an early age Acevedo desired to become a physician. Acevedo graduated from Durango Institute of Technology.Whitlock p. 8 An American citizen by birthplace, he was summoned by the draft in 1942. Acevedo left Mexico to report for the draft, partly out of American patriotism awakened by the Pearl Harbor bombing, and partly to distance himself from his father. Reporting to an induction center in Pasadena, California, he was informed his Durango schooling was insufficient, so he completed an additional semester. He was first assigned to Fort MacArthur in California. The Governor of Durango had sent papers informing the U.S. Armed Forces of Acevedo's desire to become a doctor.Whitlock pp. 8‚Äì9 He was therefore sent to O'Reilly General Hospital to receive medical training.Whitlock p. 9 After training he was sent to Camp Adair in Oregon and attached to the 91st Infantry Division. When this unit shipped out to Italy, Acevedo was not amongst them, as he had acquired a case of the measles. Instead, he was reassigned to Company B of the 70th Infantry Division, which was also at Camp Adair. This division was deployed to Marseilles in December 1944, crossing the ocean on the USS West Point. At this time Acevedo held the rank of Corporal. ==Capture and incarceration== Acevedo was captured during the Battle of the Bulge on January 6, 1945. Initially, Acevedo was sent to the Stalag IX-B prison camp, and he spent a few weeks there. Eventually a Nazi commander arrived and declared that all Jews should step forward. Few did so, and therefore those who \\"looked like Jews\\" or appeared otherwise \\"undesirable\\" were selected. The Nazis were unfamiliar with Latin Americans, and he was summarily classified as Jewish and sent to the death camp at Berga, designed for American soldiers of Jewish descent. He was shipped by railcar, arriving at Berga on February 8, 1945. At Berga, he kept a diary which listed in detail the death of each soldier, along with the medical details of the soldiers he looked after, as he felt it was his \\"moral obligation\\" as a medic. This diary also recorded notes on every detail of the camp and camp life that Acevedo saw, and he came to view this diary as his \\"lifeline\\". He kept the diary secret from the Nazi guards by hiding it variously in his pants or in the barracks. To make his pen last he would mix snow or urine with the ink. Berga was designed to work the prisoners to death through a program the Nazis called \\"Vernichtung Durch Arbeit,\\" but Acevedo attempted to keep his fellows alive insofar as possible. He did this by \\"cooking\\", adding cats, grass, rats, sand, wood shavings and other material to the of bread they received on some days. He also kept up morale with his genial attitude, mixed with jokes. Acevedo himself was subject to abuses at the hands of the Gestapo, including being raped as part of his torture. Part of the reason for Acevedo's torture was the role he had played in the capture of German espionage agents when he lived in Mexico as a teenager. On April 23, 1945, the camp was evacuated in the face of the approaching Allied armies. The prisoners were subjected to a death march. Between the camp and the march, fewer than half of the Berga prisoners survived. Acevedo was rescued later that month, weighing only . In camp, Acevedo received correspondence and care packages from a woman named Maria Dolores. He established a romantic relationship with her, and they became engaged to be married, having never met in person. Acevedo and other survivors of Berga were instructed to sign a document that swore them to secrecy regarding their experiences at the Nazi camp. The U.S. Army maintains it was to protect escapees and the local populace who helped POWs, but it deeply hurt Acevedo that he was unable to share his experiences. ==Postwar== After the war, Acevedo traveled back to Mexico. On the train ride there he made the acquaintance of Amparo \\"Chita\\" Martinez, a young woman who was a neighbor of an army buddy.Whitlock p. 208 When he arrived home, Acevedo's father confronted him regarding his relationship with Martinez, in view of Anthony's engagement to Maria Dolores. The argument further escalated when his father accused him of cowardice because he \\"let himself be captured\\", and his father further stated that Acevedo should have \\"killed himself\\". Acevedo was infuriated and immediately left home, taking his few unpacked belongings, moved back to the United States, and married Martinez. He did not see or speak to his parents for several years. Dolores was deeply hurt by the dissolution of the engagement. After the war Acevedo worked for a time as a surgical technician, and wished to continue his medical studies with the goal of becoming a medical doctor. This never came to fruition; instead he made a career as a design engineer for McDonnell Douglas, North American Aviation, and the Hughes Aircraft Company. Acevedo eventually divorced Martinez, and was re-introduced to Dolores through a mutual friend. Acevedo and Dolores married in the 1980s. Acevedo retired in 1987 and until 2017 he lived in Yucaipa, California. After retirement posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affected him considerably; he would wake up sweating and screaming in the middle of the night among other effects. The bulk of his retirement was spent volunteering at Veterans Affairs hospitals to assist patients with PTSD, in part to help himself cope with the same issues. Dolores Acevedo died in 2014. The last year of Acevedo's life was spent living with family members in Rancho Cucamonga, California. Acevedo died on February 11, 2018 at the Loma Linda Veterans Affairs Medical Center of congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. ==Personal life and beliefs== Acevedo had two sisters and three brothers between his father's two marriages. He recalled his childhood as abusive, having received abuse from his father and from his nanny, but believed this experience gave him the strength to survive the Nazi death-camp. He and his first wife Chita had three boys and one girl. Acevedo practiced the Roman Catholic faith. His main interests included barbecuing, reading books about World War II, and spending time with his family. He believed that the US Government intentionally covered up the abuse of Americans at Berga, and that this action significantly added to the affected soldiers' suffering. When the government finally did give official recognition, Acevedo refused to attend as it was held in Orlando instead of Washington D.C. Although his treatment by the United States was often less than optimal, throughout his life he was highly patriotic towards the country he had served. He identified with US conservative politics, but felt betrayed by later conservative stances on immigration, stating, \\"They don't know shit from Shinola\\". When one of his sons discovered his Armed Forces psychiatric evaluation a few months before his death, he also found out that his father had been raped by the Nazis. Acevedo was glad about the discovery, saying, \\"I'm glad you found it... I want you to tell everyone what I went through and how I struggled with the nightmares\\" so mankind could see \\"this is how low man can get\\". In truth, this horrific event was disclosed years earlier to his eldest son Anthony F Acevedo but did not reveal it to anyone until recently. The subject matter was too sensitive to discuss openly and preferred to keep it concealed. This included family members. Despite all, Acevedo advocated forgiveness, peace, and love towards humanity. ==Legacy== On June 1, 2004, Acevedo was recognized in the United States House of Representatives by Joe Baca, who cited Acevedo's patriotism and forbearance, calling him a \\"symbol of all that we, as Americans, strive to be\\".Congressional Record, V. 150, Pt. 8, May 18, 2004 to June 1, 2004 page 11135 In 2008, an investigative report by CNN based on interviews with Acevedo was the catalyst for the U.S. government to finally acknowledge the experiences of the American soldiers held in the Berga concentration camp. Accordingly, Maj. Gen. Vincent E. Boles met with some of the Berga survivors to honor them with flags flown over The Pentagon a few months later. Acevedo's Berga diary is housed at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the first such document created by an American captive to be included. The museum also took oral history from Acevedo in both English and Spanish. He became the first Mexican-American to be registered, in 2010, as a survivor at the museum's database. His personal experiences enhanced Mexican-American understanding of the Holocaust. ==ReferencesBibliography== * ==External links== *The Anthony Acevedo Papers at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum * Category:1924 births Category:2018 deaths Category:United States Army soldiers Category:People from San Bernardino, California Category:Military personnel from California Category:Holocaust survivors Category:American people of Mexican descent Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:Catholics from California Category:Deaths from emphysema Category:Durango Institute of Technology alumni ","title":"Anthony Acevedo"},{"id":"56793555","text":"Cao Naiqian (; born February 1949) is a Chinese novelist and essayist.

Two examples of the three-seat cabin monoplane were built together, starting in the summer of 1929 and completed the following year with a first flight in July 1930 flown by Jozef Zuromski. The second airframe was destroyed by fire during its first take-off attempt. The LKL II was a high, cantilever wing aircraft of mixed construction which had a one-piece, two spar wooden wing with plywood covering, elliptical in plan and bolted directly on the top of the welded steel tube fuselage structure. It was powered by a Walter Vega five-cylinder radial engine, mounted with its cylinders exposed for cooling. Behind the engine the fuselage was fabric covered. Its large, enclosed cabin had a bench seat for two passengers behind the pilot and a luggage compartment at the rear. Entry was via a starboard side door. Its empenage was a steel tube structure with fabric covering. The fin was triangular and carried a deep semi-circular rudder which worked between the elevators. Its tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and was adjustable. The LKL II had a fixed, conventional undercarriage with mainwheeels on streamlined struts hinged on the lower longerons. These joined rubber shock absorbers placed within the fuselage. ==Operational history== The loss of the second airframe slowed the development of the first, preventing it from participating in the Challenge but it was later much used by the LKL, taking part in several later contests. It came fifth in the first Lublinian-Podlasian competition early in 1931 and seventh out of twenty-two in the Fourth National Lightplane Contest in September 1931, on both occasions flown by Zuromski. It continued to take part in local events through 1932 until it was retired in 1934. Bartolewski and Teisseyre considered an ambulance development of the LKL II and also studied and perhaps began to build the LKL III, which would have had a cleaned-up fuselage and a more powerful engine, but neither proposal generated sufficient funding to complete them. ==SpecificationsReferences== Category:Single- engined tractor aircraft Category:1930s Polish civil utility aircraft ","title":"LKL II"},{"id":"56793699","text":"Seedsman Seeds is a company based in Spain, which markets cannabis seeds online.

Born in Salford, Jones left school at the age of nine to work for a cabinet maker. While working as an errand boy, he studied at Owens College and the Manchester Mechanics' Institute, and managed to gain promotion to become a book-keeper. In 1866 was appointed as assistant book- keeper to the Manchester Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS). In his spare time, he sat on the committee of the Mechanics Institute, and was a Sunday school teacher in Harpurhey.Joyce Bellamy, \\"Jones, Benjamin\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.I, pp.197-199 Jones was again promoted in 1871, becoming an assistant buyer for the CWS, and in 1874 he was made the founding general manager of the CWS's first London branch, based on Minories. At the same time, he was made honorary secretary of the Co-operative Union's southern board. Under his leadership, the shop proved successful, and in 1887 moved to larger premises on Leman Street. From a turnover of ¬£130,000 in 1875, business grew to ¬£3.25 million in 1902. Jones remained interested in education, working with Arthur Dyke Acland to produce Working Men Co-operators, a textbook which remained in print until the 1940s. He was also the first chair of the London branch of the Co-operative Printing Society, founder of the Tenant Co- operators' Association, first secretary of the Co-operative Guild, and president of the Co-operative Congress in 1896, and for one day in 1889. In 1894, Jones stood down from his southern Co-operative Union post. He remained very active in the movement, and in 1896 embarked on a world tour on behalf of the CWS, along with J. Clay and W. Stoker. A supporter of co-operative production, he was a leading figure in the establishment of a CWS flour mill in Silvertown, cocoa works in Luton and depots around the country. Jones was also interested in the Parliamentary representation of the co-operative movement. He was the first secretary of the parliamentary committee of the Co- operative Union, and was also active in the Labour Representation League. He stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal-Labour candidate in Woolwich at the 1892 and 1895 UK general elections, with the backing of the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society. At the 1900 UK general election, he instead stood in Deptford, but was again unsuccessful. Jones retired to Bournemouth in 1902, purchasing the Queen Hotel, a bakery and some cafes. He wrote an autobiography, Life According to Jones, which was published in 1918, and various press articles on co-operative matters.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. ==History== In 1823, Lemuel Taylor moved from New York state to settle on a 400-acre parcel of land at this location on Stony Creek. He built a dam and gristmill, which opened in 1824 and provided a base for a small community. By 1825, the village had a blacksmith, distillery, store, and post office. A hotel was built in the 1830s. A woolen mill was built just after the Civil War, but the industrial and commercial growth of the village was limited, in large part due to the proximity of the much larger city of Rochester. One of the important families in Stony Creek were the Van Hoosens, who arrived in the 1830s, with then-six- year old Joshua Van Hoosen. In 1851, Joshua purchased part of the farm, then wet to California to make his fortune during the gold rush. He returned in 1853, purchased the remaining interest in the farm, and married Sarah Taylor, Lumuel Taylor's daughter. By 1880, Joshua Van Hoosen owned nearly 300 acres of land in the vicinity. Joshua's granddaughter, Sarah Van Hoosen Jones, was born in 1881; Joshua died three years later and the family farm was eventually passed on to Sarah. She continued farming the area, and in 1921 received a Ph.D. in animal genetics, which led her to raise herds of prize dairy cattle. Jones donated the farm to Michigan State University upon her death in 1972. The University donated the Van Hoosen Farmhouse and three acres to Avon Township, and in 1989, the City of Rochester Hills acquired the Van Hoosen Farm buildings and 13 surrounding acres. It is now a museum operated by the city. ==Description== The Stony Creek Village Historic District consists of 17 houses with their associated outbuildings. Probably all of the residences are of pre-Civil War construction, and most are originally of a Greek Revival style. The houses are arranged on and around a center plat with streets on all sides. Probably the most notable among the farm buildings are the large dairy barns and silos of Sarah Van Hoosen Jones, who also owned most of the land in the village. ==Gallery== File:House Stony Creek Village MI.jpgHouse File:Inn Stony Creek Village MI.jpgInn File:Red House Stony Creek Village MI.jpgRed House File:School Stony Creek Village MI.jpgSchool File:VanHeusen House Stony Creek Village MI.jpgVan Hoosen House File:VanHeusen BarnStony Creek Village MI.jpgVan Hoosen Barn ==External links== * Rochester Hills Museum (with descriptions of the Van Hoosen farm and some surrounding buildings) ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Oakland County, Michigan Category:Greek Revival architecture in Michigan ","title":"Stony Creek Village Historic District"},{"id":"56793746","text":"Semi-detached workers' house in Kerkhofweg, Overdinkel, in 1982 Overdinkel is a village in the Twente region of the eastern Netherlands, in the municipality of Losser.

On 15 July 1922 he inherited the leadership of the Shandong Autonomous Army after his older brother Sun Meizhu (1883-1922) was captured in combat with government troops and shot. Sun Meizhu, a renowned scholar in the Shandong area, founded the group in 1920 to protect against constant persecution from warlord generals and China's central government as well as the general lawlessness that prevailed at the time. The army was one of many such bandit groups made up of itinerant discharged and expelled soldiers, in this case mostly former soldiers under Zhang Jingyao, that operated in areas outside of the control of China's central republican government. They supported themselves by plundering the local countryside, robbery, and hostage taking. Explaining his motives Sun said \\"...we have hitherto been law abiding citizens, and that we have no desire to become robbers; but in this troubled era of unreliable government we find ourselves compelled to take risks in order to obtain redress for our grievances\\" == Lincheng Outrage == In the early hours of 6 May 1923, Sun's twelve hundred bandits attacked and then derailed the \\"Blue Express\\" near the town of Lincheng (Xuecheng) on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway in Hebei Province close to the Jiangsu-Shandong border. The bandits looted the train and killed a number of Chinese passengers as well as a British subject, Joseph Rothman after he refused to surrender his valuables. They took 300 passengers hostage, including 30 westerners, most of whom were Americans, but also included British, French, Italian, German, and Danish nationals, and forced them on a 10-day march to their mountain base at Baodugu. Some of the more prominent hostages included Lucy Aldrich, eldest daughter of U.S. Senator Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island and sister-in-law of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. J. B. Powell, editor of China Weekly Review, and Commodore Guiseppe Musso, a wealthy and influential Italian who was the chief attorney in the Shanghai French Concession. Sun led negotiations with intermediaries that included he U.S. Minister to China Dr. Jacob Gould Schurman and American China hand Roy Scott Anderson. Sun's demand included the removal of government troops from Shandong, an official pardon for the kidnappers, reinstatement or enrollment into the army for those among the bandits who wished it, and guarantees by six foreign powers that the demands would be met. As a gesture of good faith, the women were released within a couple of days of the kidnapping, while the remaining male hostages were held for over a month as negotiations dragged on. Ultimately the Shanghai Green Gang leader Du Yuesheng secured the release of the remaining hostages on June 12, 1923 with an $85,000 ransom along with the Chinese government's agreement to accept bandits who wanted it into the military. Many bandits understood the dangers of joining the military and declined. Sun Meiyao and other leaders even received military commissions. == Death == Over the next six months, the bandits who were inducted into the military were refused weapons and pay, and encouraged to live off the surrounding countryside. Most were killed before the end of the year. Sun was executed six months later on December 19, 1923 at the Zhongxing coal mine by General Zhang Peiyuan, on orders of the new Shandong governor Zheng Shiqi, who had accused Sun of failing to turn over guns and ammunition captured from bandits and of illicitly communicating with the bandit Lao Yangren with the intention of returning to banditry. == Notes == Category:1898 births Category:1923 deaths Category:People from Zaozhuang Category:Train robbers Category:Republic of China people born during Qing Category:Executed Republic of China people Category:People executed by the Republic of China by firing squad Category:20th-century executions by China Category:Executed people from Shandong ","title":"Sun Meiyao"},{"id":"56793761","text":"The Fanatic is a 2019 American psychological horror-thriller film directed and co-written by Fred Durst. It stars John Travolta as an autistic man obsessed with meeting his favorite actor (Devon Sawa). The film was given a limited theatrical and a VOD release, on August 30, 2019 by Quiver Distribution and Redbox Entertainment, and received mainly negative reviews. == Plot == Moose is an autistic man and works as a street performer on Hollywood Boulevard. Moose is also an avid movie fan, especially of the action film actor Hunter Dunbar. When Moose finally gets an opportunity to meet him and get an autograph, he is rejected when Dunbar's ex-wife abruptly comes to see him. Moose is friends with a young paparazzi photographer, Leah, who shows Moose an app that publishes home addresses of famous celebrities, including his hero. Moose goes to Dunbar's house and tries to give him a letter in search of an autograph. Dunbar confronts Moose and tells him to stay out of his neighborhood. Moose comes back again and climbs a fence, but is scared off by Dunbar's housekeeper. Moose keeps returning and eventually gains entry to the house after accidentally pushing the housekeeper into a stone fountain, killing her. Moose is again rejected by Dunbar, who calls Moose a stalker and threatens to shoot Moose if he sees him in the neighborhood again. Moose returns and ties up Dunbar while he sleeps. When Dunbar awakens he sees Moose lying on the floor, appearing to have killed himself, only for Moose to start laughing and get up. Next, Moose dresses up in a Jason Voorhees mask and pretends to stab Dunbar, but his blade is revealed to be a retractable prop knife, again fooling Dunbar. Dunbar pleads for Moose to untie him with promises of autographs and friendship, and he does. Dunbar attacks and nearly kills Moose, shooting off his fingers with a hidden rifle and stabbing him in the eye. Moose starts to cry and after a seeming change of heart, Dunbar spares Moose and lets him leave. Moose wanders the streets of Hollywood, sobbing and passing tourists who request to take photos with him, believing his wounds to be a part of a realistic costume, before Leah takes him to the hospital. As the movie ends, Dunbar is seen being arrested for the murder of his housekeeper and for the attack on Moose. == Cast == * John Travolta as Moose * Devon Sawa as Hunter Dunbar * Ana Golja as Leah * Jacob Grodnik as Todd * James Paxton as Slim == Production == Pretzel Fang produced the film with VMI Worldwide, Wonderfilm Media, Media Finance Capital, Primal Film LLC and Quiver Distribution Inc. funded the film. In March 2018, principal photography began in Birmingham, Alabama. Redbox Entertainment also funded the film in exchange for release via the Redbox kiosks and streaming services. ==ReceptionBox office=== The Fanatic earned $3,153 from 52 theaters in the U.S. on its opening day, making it a US box-office failure. ===Critical response=== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 16% based on 67 reviews, with an average score of 3.75/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"John Travolta gives it his oddly coiffed all, but The Fanatic rings hollow as an examination of the way fan appreciation can curdle into toxic obsession.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 18 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\". NPR's Simon Abrams gave the film a negative review, calling it a noticeable downgrade from The Education of Charlie Banks and The Longshots, and labeling the work a \\"miserable psychodrama\\". Specific elements attracting criticism included the \\"clich√©-filled voiceover narration\\" and \\"a bunch of scenes where Travolta zealously overacts\\". Glenn Kenny of The New York Times also wrote a negative review of the film, arguing that it \\"delineates the border that separates the merely stale from the genuinely rancid.\\" In a positive review, Josh Millican of Dread Central called the film \\"a riveting indie with genuine suspense\\", and he praised both Travolta's and Sawa's performances. ===Accolades=== The film was nominated for three Golden Raspberry Awards, Worst Picture, Worst Director (Fred Durst), and Worst Actor which John Travolta won (also for his performance in Trading Paint). ==References* Category:2019 films Category:2019 horror thriller films Category:2019 psychological thriller films Category:American films Category:American horror thriller films Category:American psychological thriller films Category:English-language films Category:Films about autism Category:Films about fandom Category:Films about stalking Category:Films directed by Fred Durst Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in Alabama Category:Films shot in Los Angeles ","title":"The Fanatic (2019 film)"},{"id":"56793770","text":"Innu Takuaikan Uashat Mak Mani-Utenam is an Innu First Nations band government in Quebec, Canada.

For PRhyme 2, Royce described the process of receiving compositions to work off of directly from AntMan Wonder as being \\"like sampling from Mozart but Mozart is actually giving you the music\\".

Not much is known of Bathurst's family, and what is known is due to her two-volume manuscript diary covering the period 1679 to 1696. This diary is held at the Bodleian Library, Oxford.MSS Rawl. D. 1262 and Rawl. D. 1263 It appears that Bathurst came from a religious background, and her diary begins with an autobiographical account that describes family prayer and Bible reading. By 1697, the Philadelphians met at Bathurst's house in Baldwin Gardens, London every Sunday, where she lived with Joanna Openbridge. This group are known to have held millennialist views, and Bathurst produced prophetic visions that resulted in a 'lyrical, woman- inclusive representation of mystical theology'. She was considered as a possible successor to Jane Leade who led the group until her death in 1704. This was prevented by Bathurst's own death at around the same time. == References == Category:Prophets in Christianity ","title":"Ann Bathurst"},{"id":"56793989","text":"Payne Lindsey is an American director, documentary filmmaker, and podcast host. He is best known for co-creating and hosting the hit investigative journalist and true crime podcasts Up and Vanished and Atlanta Monster. ==Early life== Lindsey was born and raised in Kennesaw, Georgia. He obtained his first video camera at age 10 and later directed local television commercials and music videos. As a child, he wanted to direct feature films. Lindsey made a 13-minute documentary film about people that he met on a cross- country road trip and entered it into festivals. He attended college on and off for a few years, but hated school. At age 23, his dad cut him off and he began focusing on creating and directing videos. ==CareerUp and Vanished=== In December 2015, Netflix released Making a Murderer. Lindsey watched the show and realized that he wanted to do something similar. With an early interest in investigative journalism, Lindsey was inspired to investigate the disappearance of beauty queen and school teacher Tara Grinstead, a well-known cold case in Georgia. At the time, Lindsey's intentions were to develop Grinstead's story into a documentary film, but he realized he did not have the funds to film interviews on location. Lindsey realized that he \\"could produce a podcast at home in my boxers,\\" and created Up and Vanished. Lindsey did not have access to police files, so instead scoured through old news articles and online forums to hunt out possible leads. Lindsey's grandmother lived in Tifton, Georgia, near Ocilla, where Grinstead had gone missing. Lindsey broadcast in real-time, week by week, in audio form. Within a 12-month period the podcast received over 50 million downloads, which propelled Grinstead's case into the mainstream media. This helped uncover previously unnoticed evidence which lead to the decade-old case being cracked and two arrests made. Lindsey began podcasting full time once Up and Vanished increased in popularity. A second season of Up and Vanished covered the disappearance of Kristal Reisinger. ===Tenderfoot TV=== After Up and Vanished, together with his business partner Donald Albright, Lindsey launched the content creation company Tenderfoot TV which is based in Atlanta. Together with Tenderfoot TV and Oxygen Lindsey and Albright developed a TV docu-series from Up and Vanished. As of January 2020, Oxygen and Tenderfoot TV are working to develop a television special about Kristal Reisinger which will be produced by Lindsey. In addition to Up and Vanished and Atlanta Monster, Tenderfoot TV also produced the podcasts To Live and Die in L.A., Culpable, and Somebody. Meredith Stedman is the Creative Producer at the company. As of June 2019, the company had over 400 million total downloads for its podcasts. Tenderfoot TV is represented by United Talent Agency. === Atlanta Monster === In early 2018, in partnership with HowStuffWorks, Lindsey launched Atlanta Monster, a new podcast about the infamous Atlanta Child Murders, which occurred between 1979 - 1981 with over 25 victims murdered in Atlanta. Lindsey had never heard of the case until his business partner, Donald Albright, told him about the murders. Lindsey hosted the podcast and conducted the interviews featured on the podcast. The podcast had over 70 million downloads. === Radio Rental === In fall 2019, Payne Lindsey announced and released the first episode of a new podcast that features true stories with a fictional backdrop, Radio Rental. Lindsey asked Atlanta citizens to reach out and share the paranormal and scary stories to share on the podcast. The podcast is hosted by a fictional character, a 1980s-era video store employee named Terry Carnation. Carnation is played by Rainn Wilson. Lindsey and Wilson connected after Wilson tweeted that he loved Lindsey's podcast, Atlanta Monster. ==Personal life== Lindsey is from Georgia and resides in Atlanta. In September 2016, Lindsey married Cassie House. According to the Up and Vanished website, Lindsey has a brother, Mason Lindsey, who works as a producer for Tenderfoot TV. ==Filmography== * Just Like You (2014) * Our People (2015) * Thank Yo Mamma (2015) * Up and Vanished: The TV Show (2018) ==References* Category:Living people Category:American documentary filmmakers Category:American male journalists Category:American podcasters Category:1987 births ","title":"Payne Lindsey"},{"id":"56794002","text":"Essipit Innue Essipit is an Innu First Nation in Quebec, Canada.

He finished unplaced on his only start as a juvenile but made rapid improvement over the winter and won the 2000 Guineas in April 1922. He finished fourth when favourite for the Epsom Derby and then won a minor race at Wolverhampton Racecourse but was withdrawn from the St Leger after running poorly in a trial race. After failing to win on his only run as a four-year-old he was retired to stud, but had no success as a breeding stallion. ==Background== St Louis was a \\"grand\\" bay horse with a white blaze bred at the Confey Stud in County Dublin by J J Maher. As a yearling he was offered for sale and bought for 2,600 guineas by the trainer Peter Gilpin on behalf of Almeric Paget, 1st Baron Queenborough. Gilpin trained the horse at his Clarehaven stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. He was one of the best horses sired by Louvois who won the 2000 Guineas and was awarded second place in the Derby in 1913. St Louis's dam Princess Sterling was an influential broodmare whose female-line descendants included Noblesse who was in turn the ancestor of Rainbow Quest, Warning and Commander in Chief. ==Racing career1921: two-year-old season=== St Louis made only one appearance on the track as a two-year-old and made little impression as he finished unplaced in a minor race. ===1922: three-year-old season=== Ridden by the American jockey George Archibald, St Louis stated at odds of 6/1 in a 22-runner field for the 114th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 26 April. Racing on soft ground he took the lead from Captain Cuttle in the final furlong and drew away to win easily by three lengths from Solomon Joel's Pondoland with the fading Captain Cuttle four lengths back in third. Lord Queenborough donated ¬£200 of the prize money to two racing charities, namely the Rous Memorial Fund and the Bentinck Benevolent Fund. St Louis's success saw him elevated to favouritism for the Epsom Derby. On 29 May St Louis started favourite for the Derby over one and a half miles put appeared to be unsuited by the firmer ground and finished fourth behind Captain Cuttle, Tamar and Craigangower. St Louis was off the course until August, when he started at odds of 1/9 against four moderate opponents in the Wolverhampton Breeder's Foal Plate over ten furlongs. With Archibald in the saddle he won very easily by five lengths from Clincher, to whom he was conceding 20 pounds in weight. The colt was strongly fancied for the St Leger Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse in September, but in his final prep race he came home last of the three runners behind Express Delivery in the Great Yorkshire Stakes over one and a half mile at York, and was withdrawn from the Leger a few days later. St Louis's earnings of ¬£11,084 for the year made him the fifth most successful racehorse of the season. ===1923: four-year-old season=== St Louis remained in training but was beaten on his only start. When he was put up for auction at the end of the year he failed to reach his reserve price of 4,200 guineas and was retained by his owner. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated St Louis a \\"poor\\" winner of the 2000 Guineas. ==Stud record== St Louis was retired to become a breeding stallion at Lord Queenborough's Snarehill Stud in Norfolk. He sired no major winners and his last reported foals were born in 1933. ==Pedigree== * St Louis was inbred 3 √ó 4 to St Simon, meaning that this stallion appeare in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

It is intended to be the first installment in a series of films set within a Valiant Comics shared cinematic universe. Directed by David S. F. Wilson (in his feature directorial debut) from a screenplay by Jeff Wadlow and Eric Heisserer and a story by Wadlow, the film stars Vin Diesel, Eiza Gonz√°lez, Sam Heughan, Toby Kebbell, and Guy Pearce. It follows a Marine who was killed in action, only to be brought back to life with superpowers by an organization that wants to use him as a weapon. Bloodshot was theatrically released in the United States on March 13, 2020, by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film grossed $37 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic closing theaters across the globe, Sony made the film available digitally on-demand less than two weeks after it was released theatrically. ==Plot== After leading a successful rescue operation of hostages in Mombasa, U.S. Marine Ray Garrison and his wife Gina travel for a holiday at an Italian beachside town in the Amalfi Coast. They are kidnapped by a group of mercenaries led by Martin Axe, who demands to know how the US military learned about the hostages and their location. Ray explains he is not privy to this information and threatens revenge. Axe kills him and Gina. An amnesiac Ray awakens in the labs of Rising Spirit Tech (RST), a company in Kuala Lumpur specializing in cybernetic enhancements for disabled US military personnel. CEO and lead scientist Dr. Emil Harting tells Ray he is the first successful human subject of the \\"Bloodshot\\" program, resurrecting and healing him through the injection of experimental nanite technology now occupying his entire bloodstream. This technology increases his strength and heals his injuries, but the nanites need to be regularly replaced and recharged or he will eventually succumb to damage and die again. When the nanites work at extreme power, they create a red glowing circle of light on Ray's chest. Ray is introduced to Dr. Harting's other patients including former US Navy diver \\"KT\\", with whom he strikes up a friendship, former service member Marcus Tibbs and Jimmy Darlton who overtly dislikes Garrison. After experiencing flashbacks of Gina and Axe, he leaves to avenge Gina's death. Using the nanites and RST servers to hack into databases, Ray tracks down Axe to Budapest and kills him along with his bodyguards. Back at RST, Ray is put to sleep as his nanites are rebooted. As he has done many times before, Harting then replaces Ray's memories with a new scenario of how Gina died, this time with Axe's associate Nick Baris as the culprit. KT objects to Harting repeatedly manipulating Ray's memories so he will go after different targets without question or remorse, but she is ignored and reminded that RST can kill her by deactivating her enhancements. Ray awakens, once again amnesiac, and is reintroduced to RST, then experiences flashbacks of Baris kidnapping and killing him and Gina. Driven by revenge, he tracks Baris to East Sussex and kills him, despite the man pleading that RST is lying. Wilfred Wigans, a programmer forced to work for Baris, activates an EMP bomb that incapacitates Ray and severs his link with RST. Ray awakens in Wigans's office and experiences contradicting memories of who killed Gina. Wigans helps him realize RST has been manipulating him so he would kill the company's enemies and rivals. Ray tracks down Gina, learning she is still alive but that their relationship ended five years ago and since then she has started a family in London. Harting sends KT after Wigans. After asking Wigans for help in freeing herself from RST control and taking down the corporation, she tells Harting she failed to capture the programmer. Meanwhile, Ray is recaptured by Dalton and Tibbs and brought back to the laboratory. KT and Wigans sabotage the reprogramming process and destroy the RST computers. Ray awakens and Dalton and Tibbs try to subdue him. After a lengthy battle, he kills them as the RST building is destroyed. Harting confronts Ray, confident that the Marine will surrender now that his nanites have been exhausted. To his surprise, Ray is willing to die to achieve victory and activates an explosive, destroying them both. Ray later awakes with his full memories, revived by Wigans who has updated his technology so his nanites are self-sufficient. The two men and KT then leave in search of a new life. ==Cast== * Vin Diesel as Ray Garrison / Bloodshot * Sam Heughan as Jimmy Dalton * Eiza Gonz√°lez as KT * Toby Kebbell as Martin Axe * Guy Pearce as Dr. Emil Harting * Lamorne Morris as Wilfred Wigans * Talulah Riley as Gina Garrison * J√≥hannes Haukur J√≥hannesson as Nick Baris * Alex Hernandez as Marcus Tibbs * Siddharth Dhananjay as Eric * Tamer Burjaq as Mombasa Gunman == Production  Development === In March 2015, it was announced that Columbia Pictures had acquired the film rights to the Valiant Comics character Bloodshot, which would be produced by Original Film and Valiant Entertainment. Jeff Wadlow was hired to write the screenplay.

Chad Stahelski and David Leitch were hired to direct the film, from a screenplay by Wadlow and Eric Heisserer. Stahelski and Leitch eventually passed on the project. In March 2017, Dave Wilson was announced as the director of the film. Screenwriter Adam Cozad later contributed to the script. === Casting === In July 2017, it was reported that Jared Leto was in early negotiations to star in the film as Bloodshot, but in March 2018, it was announced that Vin Diesel would portray the main character. By May, additional cast members were announced, with Sam Heughan, Michael Sheen, and Eiza Gonz√°lez. In June of the same year, Talulah Riley and Alex Hernandez were cast in the film to play the titular characters' wife named Gina, and member of a scientist team named Tibbs, respectively. Later, Toby Kebbell and Johannes Haukur Johannesson were both cast in villainous roles, with the former playing Axe. In August 2018, Lamorne Morris was hired to play a young scientist named Wilfred Wigans. In the same month, it was reported that Guy Pearce was in talks to replace Sheen, who had to exit the movie due to scheduling and family conflicts. === Filming === Principal photography began on August 6, 2018 in Cape Town, South Africa, and in Prague, Czech Republic, with some filming taking place in Budapest, Hungary in that same month. Filming officially wrapped on October 25, 2018. == Release == Bloodshot was released in the United States on March 13, 2020, by Sony Pictures Releasing, after previously being scheduled to release on February 21, 2020.

As the pandemic receded, the film was released in three Santikos Theatres locations in San Antonio, Texas on May 1, 2020. In China, the film was released on July 24, 2020. In August 2020, AMC Theatres announced that the film would resume showing in theaters upon their reopening that month. ==ReceptionBox office=== Bloodshot grossed $10 million in the United States and Canada, and $27.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $37.1 million, against a production budget of $45 million. In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside The Hunt and I Still Believe, and was projected to gross around $10 million from 2,861 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $3.8 million on its first day, including $1.2 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $9.3 million, finishing third. The weekend was also noteworthy for being the lowest combined-grossing since October 1998, with all films totaling just $55.3 million, in large part from societal restrictions and regulations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the film's second weekend, due to the mass theater closures around the country, the film made $52,000 from 79 locations, mostly drive-in theaters. After months of delays, the film was released in China on July 24, and made $2.8 million in its opening weekend. ===Critical response=== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 30% based on 159 reviews, with an average rating of 4.56/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"Bloodshot gives Vin Diesel a solid opportunity to indulge in old-school action that should satisfy fans, even if the end result is disappointingly mediocre\\". On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 44 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Audiences polled by PostTrak gave the film an average 3 out of 5 stars, with 45% saying they would definitely recommend it. Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote: \\"Bloodshot is a trash compactor of a comic-book film, but it's smart trash, an action matrix that‚Äôs fun to plug into.\\" Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a mixed reviews but was positive about the director saying \\"Wilson acquits himself adequately enough, emphasizing pacing over character development, but delivering a series of kinetically propelled scenes that clearly benefit from his extensive visual effects experience.\\" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun- Times gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, calling it ambitious but \\"intermittently entertaining\\" and \\"frantically overcooked, bursting with headache-inducing, rapid-cut action sequences\\". Angelica Jade Bastien at Vulture.com was critical of Diesels performance: \\"At this point, what could have been a passably entertaining diversion, the kind of film best enjoyed overcoming a hangover or while folding laundry, falls flat on Diesel's lips. He lacks the gravitas of delivery, disinterested in his lines even before he finishes saying them.\\" Joshua Rivera of The Verge wrote: \\"As an action movie, Bloodshot is the worst kind of uninspiring: not bad enough to circle back around toward fun, not good enough at action to be even momentarily impressed by a fight scene.\\" Odie Henderson at RogerEbert.com called it a \\"Universal Soldier\\" rip-off, and hoped there would not be any sequels. == Future == Intended to be the launch of a new shared cinematic universe of Valiant Comics superheroes, Bloodshot was conceived to be followed by: a sequel, two films based on the comic book series Harbinger, and then a crossover film entitled Harbinger Wars. Though a Harbinger movie was initially scheduled to be the first installment in the franchise, development was delayed in favor of Bloodshot. In September 2019, it was announced that Harbinger would be distributed by Paramount Pictures. Director David S. F. Wilson stated that even though different film studios have distribution rights, Valiant still plans to build a franchise from Bloodshot, while acknowledging that Diesel will play a large role in the future of the planned film series. During the home video bonus features, Bloodshot producer Dinesh Shamdasani states that the film \\"plants the seeds\\" for the future franchise. == References  External links == * * Category:2020 films Category:2020 science fiction films Category:2020s science fiction action films Category:2020s superhero films Category:2020s vigilante films Category:American films Category:American science fiction action films Category:American superhero films Category:American films about revenge Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:English-language films Category:Films about amnesia Category:Films based on American comics Category:Films produced by Neal H.

It is found in India and Sri Lanka. ==Description== The wingspan of the female is about 38 mm. Antennae are bipectinate (comb like on both sides). Forewings are bright orange yellow and covered with slightly powdered black scales. The head, thorax and abdomen are hairy. Anal tufts are orange yellow. A rusty coloured band runs from near the base of the forewing. A black spot is present at the end of the cell. There are long black hairs on the inner margin. the palpi are porrect (extending forward) and reach beyond the frons. The hindwing and cilia are pale orange yellow. The caterpillar is dull black with yellow longitudinal bands and is marbled with brown. The ventral side is jet black. Pupation occurs within a woven, silken cocoon. The caterpillar is known to feed on Dendrophthoe glabrescens, Loranthus and Mallotus paniculatus. ==References== Category:Moths of Asia Category:Moths described in 1790 ","title":"Nygmia icilia"},{"id":"56794264","text":" The Robin DR500 Pr√©sident is a wooden low wing monoplane, manufactured by Robin Aircraft and marketed as a top-of-the-range DR400. It has a tricycle undercarriage, 4+1 seating configuration, is powered by a more powerful 200CV fuel-injected Lycoming engine and is larger and better-equipped than the standard DR.400. ==Development== The Robin DR500 concept first originated in the 1980s as the DR.400 NGL or Nouvelle G√©n√©ration Large, but the idea was not resurrected until the late 1990s by the new owners of Robin Aircraft. It took its name from the HR.100/250TR Pr√©sident of 1974. Known and marketed as the DR.500, it is actually an extension of the DR.400's type certificate, so is sometimes referenced in official documents as the DR400/500. It was intended to fill the niche between 180hp fixed undercarriage and 250hp retractable undercarriage aircraft, with 1500km range at cruise speeds of 260km/h (143kt). The maiden flight of prototype F-WZZY was on 29 May 1997 with Daniel M√ºller as test pilot. 18 were produced in 1999 and 9 in 2000. ==Design== Compared to the original DR.400, the DR.500 has a larger engine cowling and a larger bubble- like canopy like that on the R3000 or X4, making the cabin 40cm longer, 10cm wider at the shoulders and providing 5cm more headroom. Like the Jodel D140, it has five seatbelts. The DR.500 has a new instrument panel, finished in grey and beige, and leather seats as standard; electric trim and electrically- operated flaps are also standard. The wing is slightly thicker than that on the DR.400, and it benefits from new, more streamlined wheel fairings. The DR.500 is powered by a fuel-injected 200hp Lycoming driving a two-blade Hartzell variable-pitch propeller. There is a gas strut to keep the externally-accessible luggage compartment door open. Total fuel capacity is 275 litres: two 40l wing tanks, 105l under the floor, and an optional 90l tank under the baggage compartment. ==Variants== ;DR.500-200I Pr√©sident :powered by a Lycoming IO-360-A1B6 engine ==Specifications References  Bibliography == * Besse, Francois La Saga Robin (de 1957 √† nos jours).

Greatest Hits from Around the World. The tour consisted of six legs that alternated between indoor and outdoor shows in the US, along with arenas and festivals in Europe. Much like their recent tours, the Tonnage Tour featured a stripped-down, intimate stage design. The band played a mixture of older and newer material during their set, which included songs from their latest studio album La Futura (2012). Kevin Kinder from the Fayetteville Flyer thought the concert was \\"a highly choreographed concert, both subtly in the way Gibbons and bassist Dusty Hill swayed in unison during several moments, and more overtly in the way the show was paced.\\" The last eighteen dates in 2017 were cancelled to due Dusty Hill having an ailment. After 90 concerts in 2017, the Tonnage Tour grossed US$11.2 million, making it one of the top 200 grossing tours of the year. For the first two legs alone, the tour grossed $6.3 million with 166,943 tickets sold. After the fourth leg in the US, the tour's schedule was expanded to feature a co-headlining leg with John Fogerty, which was branded as \\"Blues & Bayous\\", and grossed $9 million with 359,553 tickets sold. At its conclusion, the Tonnage Tour had sold 1,083,675 tickets ‚Äì with 154 shows ‚Äì for a total gross of $26.2 million. ==Personnel== *Billy Gibbons - Guitar, Vocals *Dusty Hill - Bass, Vocals *Frank Beard - Drums, Percussion ==Setlist== *setlist from the Salt Lake City, Utah concert 1\\\\.

It is the 5th Zoids anime. It is part of a crossmedia relaunch of the franchise encompassing a new toy line, manga series, and video game for Nintendo Switch predominantly aimed at boys aged 10‚Äì12. ==CharactersZoids Wild=== ; : : Arashi was a novice Zoid pilot. Although he can ride the Liger, a legendary Zoid, he starts off weaker than those around him using much more inferior Zoids. At the start of the series, he is briefly mentored by Quade, and gains considerable skill in a short period of time. By bonding with the Liger he quickly becomes able to use the Wild Blast effortlessly. As time goes on, his skills plateau. Using his \\"King Claw\\" (King of the Claw in Japanese) attack, he proves to be strong, but is defeated on occasion by powerful opponents such as Drake and Gigaboss. In the middle of the series, he is seen facing overwhelming defeat, and enters a raging Berserk mode. This mode is strong, but uncontrollable, even attacking teammates. It's not until he meets Quade's old master that he grows considerably in strength. Learning the \\"Ultra King Claw\\" (King of Claw Spiral in Japanese) attack, he manages to reach a potency consistently at or above the Four Dark Warriors. After the fall of the Dark Metal Empire, Arashi and Liger continue to travel alone. ;Quade / : : Quade leads Team Supreme. He is well known as a famous, powerful, Zoid Seeker. Initially he seeks the Liger, before meeting Arashi. While not strictly a part of the resistance force, he and Team Supreme oppose the Dark Metal Empire. His goal was to search for the \\"Ancient Treasure Z\\". He is shown to have a deep bond with his Zoid, the Zaber Fang, as well as having met Arashi's Father in the past. In the past, Quade was shown to have met many of the major characters in the series. He trained under Master Bug, alongside Gigaboss. He proved to be the stronger of the two, constantly besting Gigaboss. This defeat caused Gigaboss to seek stronger and stronger Zoids, eventually reaching up to Demise. Quade's defiance of Gigaboss caused him to steal part of a Zoid Key from him. He entrusted the key fragment to Arashi before his death at the hands of Gigaboss and Demise. Quade had also met Arashi's father, Salt, and Mitsuba before the events of the series took place. ;Battalia / : : Battalia has a sordid background. Her parents were killed when she was young by a group of bandits. This forced her to flee into an orphanage with her Zoid Needle. She looks after the other orphans like a big sister and provides them with funds. Being able to ride Zoids, she took up bounty hunting. She was quite successful, even capturing the Bandits that had attacked her parents. Eventually, she encounters Numb-lock, one of the Four Dark Warriors of the Dark Metal Empire. Impressed with her skill, he tasks her with taking down 100 bounties for the Empire in exchange for a fortune capable of looking after her orphanage. Due to the Numb-lock's overwhelming power, she had no choice but to take up the offer. After befriending Arashi, she is told her that he and Liger were to be her 100th bounty. She tried using her friendship to betray him, but Arashi's influence moved her to double-cross Numb-Lock. After turning on NUmb- lock, Needle bestows her with its Zoid Key. ;Analog / : : Member of the Freedom Team and pilot of the Tortoise Zoid: Tanks. Analog's fanaticism is often used to introduce Zoids during the series. When a new Zoid appears, Analog explains its name, type and abilities. This can happen even when Analog is nowhere near the Zoid in question. Analog was initially a slave of the Dark Metal Empire: he was forced to perform Hacker Key experiments. For his own survival, he performed many of those experiments on Tanks, which filled him with guilt for a long time. After meeting Arashi, Analog summons the courage to revolt against his captors, which moves Tanks to give him its Zoid Key. ;Bastion / : : Member of the Freedom Team and pilot of the Triceratops Zoid: Tryke. Bastion is a powerful pilot who uses his affinity for rap and dance to boost Tryke's fighting ability. His Zoid is relatively slow compared to the rest of the cast, but very effective at close range. Bastion started as a stingy pilot motivated only by money, which put him at odds with Arashi. It's later revealed that his desire for money is to buy expensive medicine from the Dark Metal Empire for his ailing sister. When he tries to steal medicine from Haxile of Dark Warriors, Bastion learns that he was being conned by the Empire. This makes him change his stingy ways, which earns him Tryke's Zoid Key and a place on Team Freedom. ;Apex / : :Member of the Freedom Team and pilot of the Wolf Zoid: Alpha Shadow. After being accidentally abandoned as a child, Apex was found and raised by Alpha Shadow. He became determined to prove he was the best Zoid pilot in the world. Apex initally believed the friends were unnecessary, but his rivalry with Arashi slowly changed his views. Apex is a powerful pilot, and is the only one in the series to use the \\"Second Gear\\" ability of Wild Blast. ; : : One of the Four Dark Warriors of the Dark Metal Empire and pilot of the Deinonychus Zoid: Ruin. Drake was the child of two archeologists who taught him to love and respect Zoids. Seeking funding for their work, the couple took Drake, Ruin, and another Deinonychus Zoid with them to the Dark Metal Empire. When they realized their sponsors were evil, they sacrificed themselves so Drake could flee, but his escape failed. Gigaboss fed one of his Zoids to Demise, and then trained Drake to be a Dark Warrior. After numerous failures to capture Arashi, Drake acknowledges his bond with Ruin, earning a Zoid Key. After learning Wild Blast, he decides to abandon the Empire, but refuses to accept a spot on Team Freedom until after the Empire's defeat. ;Dyna / : : Member of the Supreme Team and pilot of Winghorn. ;Shad / : : Member of the Supreme Team and pilot of Flyhorn. ;Scrapes / : : Member of the Supreme Team and pilot of Ankylosaurus Zoid: Knockz. ;Pach / : : Member of the Supreme Team and pilot of the Pachycephhlosaurus Zoid: Rash. ; : : Arashi's Father. ;Gaffer / : : Arashi's Grandfather. ;Malware / : : One of the Four Dark Warriors of the Dark Metal Empire and pilot of the Sarcosuchus Zoid: Overbyte. ;Numb-Lock / : : One of the Four Dark Warriors of the Dark Metal Empire and pilot of the Gorilla Zoid: Dragz. ;Haxile / : : One of the Four Dark Warriors of the Dark Metal Empire, pilot of the Stegosaurus Zoid: Bonesaw, and the Dimetrodon Zoid: Dimomite. ;Gigaboss / : : Emperor of the Dark Metal Empire and pilot of the Tyrannosaurus Rex Zoid: Demise. ;Greta / : : Greta is a transporter, so does not participate in battle. However, she has an extremely strong bond with her Silkworm Zoid: Spineless. ;Master Bug / : : Master Bug is a strange man, who makes up stories in his spare time. Due to his lack of contact with the outside world, he is largely oblivious to current events happening around him, and has an intense desire for books to fill the time. Master Bug is a master Zoid pilot. His skills are second to none. He is easily able to take on many Zoids at once, even fighting the three members of Team Freedom simultaneously, without any effort. ===Zoids Wild Zero=== ; :Voiced by: Sh≈ç Nogami : ; :Voiced by: Hazuki Senda : ; :Voiced by: Makoto Yasumura : ; :Voiced by: Y≈çko Hikasa : ; :Voiced by: Toshiki Masuda : ; :Voiced by: Daisuke Kishio : ; :Voiced by: Satoshi Mikami : ; :Voiced by: Yoshito Yasuhara : == Media  Manga === A manga series by Moricha began monthly serialization in Shogakukan's CoroCoro Comic magazine from April 2018 to May 2019.

Mullen Professor of Flute and Chair of Woodwinds at Rice University's Shepherd School of Music. Prior to a full-time career teaching, Buyse spent over 22 years as an orchestral flutist, including a decade from 1983-1993 as Principal Flute of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Boston Pops Orchestra. Other orchestral positions include Rochester Philharmonic as solo piccolo and second flute, and assistant principal of San Francisco Symphony. In addition to the Shepherd School, she has held faculty positions at the New England Conservatory, Boston University, University of Michigan, as visiting professor at the Eastman School of Music and numerous summer festivals including the Tanglewood Institute. Her primary teachers include Marcel Moyse, Jean-Pierre Rampal, Michel Debost and Joseph Mariano. == Biography == Leone Karena Buyse was born in 1947 into a musical family and grew up in Ithaca, New York. Her mother received two degrees from the Eastman School of Music, which Buyse later attended. Ithaca is home to Cornell University, where she along with her family often attended concerts and heard many of the important musicians of the time, including flutists Julius Baker and Albert Tipton, and composer Nadia Boulanger. This musical upbringing and exposure to world class musicians from an early age contributed greatly to her musical development. Buyse first began playing the violin and piano, then switched to the flute at age nine. When she was 12, she began studying with David Berman of Ithaca College before attending the Eastman School of Music to study with Joseph Mariano in 1965. In 1968 during her time at Eastman, she received a Fulbright Scholarship to study in France with Jean- Pierre Rampal, Marcel Moyse and Michel Debost, three internationally distinguished flutists and pedagogues. Buyse graduated with Distinction and a Performer's Certificate from Eastman in 1968. In 1969, she was selected as the only American finalist in that year's Geneva International Flute Competition. Subsequently, she received a Master of Music Degree in Flute Performance from Emporia State University (then Kansas State Teacher's College), while teaching undergraduate flute students and studying flute repertoire with the woodwind faculty. Her Master's Thesis titled \\"The French Rococo Style Exemplified in Selected Chamber Works of Joseph Bodin Boismortier (1689-1755)\\", was published in The Emporia State Research Studies in 1979. Her first professional orchestral position was with the Rochester Philharmonic as solo piccolo and second flute. She credits this position as giving her confidence to grow as an orchestral player and preparing her for positions in the San Francisco Symphony and later, the Boston Symphony. Buyse was invited by Seiji Ozawa to join the Boston Symphony as assistant principal of the Symphony and principal of the Boston Pops in 1983. During her career as a part of the Boston Symphony, she appeared as a soloist numerous times with the orchestra and with the Boston Symphony Chamber Players. She also appeared with the l'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, San Francisco Symphony, Utah Symphony and the New Hampshire Music Festival, where she acted as principal flute for over a decade. During her time in Boston, she collaborated and recorded with many artists, including her colleague and Eastman classmate Fenwick Smith. She has appeared in recital with international soloists Jessye Norman and cellist Yo-Yo Ma, in addition to chamber ensembles from the Juilliard School of Music and Muir String Quartets, the Boston Musica Viva, and Da Camera of Houston. In 1992, she received the Distinguished Alumna Award from Emporia State University. In 1993, she decided to pursue a more active career as a teacher. Since that time, she has held faculty positions at the New England Conservatory, Boston University, University of Michigan, and numerous summer festivals including the Tanglewood Institute. She was awarded the National Flute Association's Lifetime Achievement Award for significant and outstanding contributions to the global flute community in 2010. Buyse is recognized as one of the foremost flute pedagogues in America, and the international community. Her students hold positions in major US and North American orchestras, as well as teaching positions at universities such as the University of Texas at Austin, University of Colorado at Boulder, and St. Olaf College, in addition to many others.

She currently holds positions at Rice's Shepherd School of Music and the Youth Orchestra of the Americas. She travels throughout the US and internationally for recitals and masterclasses, including Mexico, Brazil, Panama, Chile, Italy, France, The Netherlands, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. == Personal life == Buyse married clarinetist and conductor Michael Webster in 1988.

The Pyecombe hook was perfectly balanced with a twist that allowed shepherds to easily catch the hind leg of a sheep without injuring the sheep. Its use is described by Charles Mitchell: ‚Äúthe curve is made so that the shepherd can hook it around the sheep‚Äôs leg, slide it up, give it a slight twist, and the sheep is caught fast without being in the least hurt.‚Äù It was often made out of old gun barrels. Tapsel Gate,Pyecombe Church The old forge,Pyecombe Pyecombe Hook at the Priest House, West Hoathly Pyecombe village stands on an ancient drove road on the South Downs and has a long shepherding history. The Pyecombe hook was very popular amongst shepherds in Sussex for about 200 years. A surviving Pyecombe hook is integrated into the Tapsel gate at the entrance to the Churchyard of Pyecombe church. It is illustrated on the Pyecombe village sign. There is an example in the Sussex Archaeological Society's Museum at Lewes. It was made in the first half of the 19th century by Mr Berry, the blacksmith, in the old forge, now a private house, just opposite the entrance to the church. It continued to be made there by his successor, Mr Charles Mitchell, who owned the forge from 1872 to 1946. The church has a ceremonial Pyecombe hook made in 1946 by Mr Sean Black, the last blacksmith at the forge. The hook is celebrated in song:- == References == Category:Farming tools Category:Livestock herding equipment Category:History of agriculture in England Category:English inventions Category:Mid Sussex District Category:19th century in Sussex ","title":"Pyecombe hook"},{"id":"56794673","text":"The 2013-14 season was the Manitoba Junior Hockey League's (MJHL) 97th season of operation.

Yuille holds appointments in the Department of Cognitive Science in the Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts and Sciences and in the Department of Computer Science in the Whiting School of Engineering. == Research == Yuille develops mathematical models of vision and cognition that enable computers to reconstruct three-dimensional structures based on images or videos. His research interests include computational models of vision, mathematical models of cognition, medical image analysis, and artificial intelligence and neural networks. He directs the Computational Cognition, Vision, and Learning (CCVL) research group at Johns Hopkins University. Yuille and the CCVL develop models for designing artificial vision systems to provide assistance for people with vision impairments; computational models of biological vision; computational models of cognition to study how humans and animals perform tasks such as learning and reasoning; and models for machine learning to interpret medical images. Yuille is currently working on The Felix Project (named after the fictional potion Felix Felicis, which, in the world of Harry Potter, brings drinkers unusually good luck). The project aims to use deep learning to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer by training computers to recognize it in CT scans and magnetic resonance images. Yuille and collaborators are attempting to develop algorithms to interpret CT and MR images of the pancreas and distinguish between a normal pancreas and a pancreas with a range of pathologies including tumors. ==Awards== * Helmholtz Test of Time Award, 2013 *IEEE Fellow, 2009 *Marr Prize, ICCV 2003 * Honorary mention Marr Prize, ICCV 1988 * Rayleigh Research Prize, 1979 * Rouse Ball Prizes, 1974, 75, 76, and 77 ==Publications== Yuille has over 300 publications including three books (one co-edited). ===Books=== * Two- and Three- Dimensional Patterns of the Face, P.W.

Her own creations include textiles for churches as well as flags and banners. ==Biography== Born on 13 October 1889 in Copenhagen, Margrete Tora Drejer was the daughter of the timber merchant Jens Nielsen Drejer (1845‚Äì1914) and Marie Hansen (1859‚Äì1943). She was brought up in a home on Amager, where both her mother and her grandmother were skilled embroiderers. Her elder sister, Valborg, was trained by Kristiane Konstantin-Hansen and Johanne Bindesb√∏ll. In 1921, she moved with her mother and sister to Br√∏nsh√∏j where she lived for the rest of her life. From 1904, Drejer spent four years at the Tegne- og Kunstindustriskolen for Kvinder (Women's School for Drawing and Craftmanship) where she learned both painting and embroidery, including goldwork, hedebo and fiber work. After matriculating from highschool, she was admitted to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1910 where she studied painting and decorative art under Joakim Skovgaard, graduating in 1914. She then taught embroidery in Clara W√¶ver's studio, also undertaking embroidery work on commission, especially flags and banners. From 1921 she taught both embroidery and painting at the Tegne- og Kunstindustriskolen for Kvinder. Together with the architect Gunnar Biilmann Petersen (1897‚Äì1968), she headed the school from 1924 to 1929. Drejer was a major contributor to the three-volume needlework lexicon Berlingske Haandarbejds-Bog in which she naturally covered goldwork and hedebo but also, rather surprisingly, crochet. Together with Johanne Arnbech-Jensen, she also published Sting og M√∏nstre for Skole og Hjem (Stitches and Patterns for School and Home).

Very little is known about Ibn al-A'lam's life, and even his birth date has not been established by historians. Despite this fact, he seems to have been one of the most prominent astronomers of the 10th century, demonstrated by the big impact he seems to have had on both Islamic and Byzantine astronomy. From the little that is known about him, he appears to have been active in Baghdad, working under the patronage of its Buyid ruler, 'Adud al-Dawla (978‚Äì983). His Nisba \\"al-Alawi al-Sharif\\" indicates that he was a Sharif and a descendant of Ja‚Äôfar al- Tayyar. Ibn al-A'lam's main work, a Zƒ´j, was named after his patron \\"al-Zƒ´j al-'A·∏çudƒ´\\", and was alternatively known as \\"al-Zƒ´j al-Sharƒ´fi\\" , or \\"al-Zƒ´j al-BaghdƒÅdi\\". While the work itself is now lost, scholars were able to somehow reconstruct most of it based on later citations and references in Arabic, Persian, and even Greek sources. Ibn Yunus, the renowned Egyptian astronomer of the 10th century was also a contemporary to Ibn al-A'lam, whose work he praised and regularly cited. Even after Ibn al-A'lam death, his influence remained for at least three centuries as evidenced by the tables of Maragheh observatory which were largely based on his work and that of Ibn Yunus. ==See also== *Islamic astronomy *Ibn Yunus *Zƒ´j ==References== Category:985 deaths Category:10th-century Arabs Category:Astronomers of medieval Islam Category:Medieval Arab astronomers Category:Medieval Iraqi astronomers Category:Medieval Arab astrologers Category:Medieval Iraqi people Category:10th-century astronomers Category:Buyid scholars Category:10th- century people of the Abbasid Caliphate ","title":"Ibn al-A'lam"},{"id":"56795178","text":"The 2018 Abilene Christian Wildcats football team represented Abilene Christian University in the 2018 NCAA Division I FCS football season.

It is a remake of Tamil movie Aasai (1995). Starring Ashima Bhalla, Vikas Kalantri and Mohnish Bahl in the lead role. The film produced by K.C. Bokadia, under the banner of BMB Pictures. ==Plot== After the marriage of his daughter, Geeta, with army Major Pratap Singh, widower Hridaynath lives a simple middle-class existence with his unmarried daughter, Priya, in Dehra Dun. Geeta, Pratap and their new-born son, Munna, pay them a visit and live with them for a few days. They find out that Hridaynath is under constant threat from a loan shark he had borrowed money from to get Geeta married. Shortly after that Geeta and Pratap leave back home for Ranikhet, and it then that Hridaynath finds out that his loan has been repaid and that they also have a telephone now - thanks to Pratap. Quite unknown to Hridaynath, Pratap has set his eyes on Priya and wants her for himself, so much so that he is willing to kill Geeta and get re-married to Priya on the pretext that Munna needs looking after. So to get the ball rolling, he kills Geeta by drugging and then suffocating her with a polythene bag. He then informs her dad and sister that she has died of a heart attack, and convinces them to leave Dehra Dun and live with him in Ranikhet. This is where he plans to seduce Priya in order to marry her and vows no one can dare to come in his way. Unfortunately for him, Priya has a fiance Amit that she loves very much and she introduces him to Pratap. Frustrated, Pratap sets out to destroy Amit's character. First, he takes advantage of a careless Sikh man in their way and deliberately arranges for them to bump into him and steals Amit's wallet in the ensuing melee. Predictably when Amit notices his wallet missing, he confronts the Sikh man and makes a fool of himself, as it is Pratap who has the wallet. When he suspects and attempts to frisk Pratap, Hridaynath chastises him and Pratap escapes. Pratap also tries various means to defame Amit like getting his thugs to beat up Amit and forcibly pouring liquor in his mouth and leaving him looking drunk on the road. Pratap even kills Priya's dog that Amit has gifted. Finally Amit complains to Pratap's army boss, Lt. Col. Jagat Khanna, who then subsequently catches Pratap nuzzling against Priya's photo lovingly, and realizes that Amit is speaking the truth. He chastises Pratap and asks him to watch it and also casually inquires about Geeta's death. It is clear that Lt. Col Khanna no longer holds Major Pratap in esteem. Pratap fearing exposure, kills Lt. Col. Jagat Khanna with his car during one of his early morning jogs. Finally Pratap decides to implement his final move‚Äîhe frames Amit for drug trafficking and gets him arrested. He then consoles the sad Hridaynath and smoothly weaves in his request to marry Priya to care for his child. Disappointed with Amit and impressed with what he sees as a loving son-in-law, Hridaynath readily agrees, to Pratap's glee! Pratap then visits Amit in prison and boasts about his dastardly plan to destroy Amit, seduce and marry Priya and its successful conclusion culminating in Hridaynath's blessing. Simultaneously, Hridaynath and Priya discover the dead Geeta's letter warning about Pratap's lust for Priya and fear of her life. Hridaynath also discovers Pratap's diary which lays out the plot entirely. They try to leave, but Pratap returns, notices the letter and diary in open view and knocks Hridaynath unconscious when he confronts him. He tries to sexually assault Priya, but Amit who escaped from prison rescues her and beats Pratap unconscious. When Pratap awakes, Hridaynath has filled the room with explosive propane gas and threatens to blow them both up with a match, unless Pratap suffocates himself to death exactly as he did to Geeeta, with a polythene bag and string that Hridaynath has provided. Pratap pleading pathetically fails to move Hridaynath and puts the bag over his own head and ties the string around his neck tight. Unable to bear the suffocation, he rips the bag off, when Hridaynath lights the match and detonates a deadly blast, killing them both. The movie ends with police releasing and apologizing to Amit and him reuniting with Priya after this horrific family tragedy. ==Cast== * Ashima Bhalla as Priya * Vikas Kalantri as Amit * Mohnish Bahl as Major Pratap Singh * Rajesh Khanna as Hridaynath * Asawari Joshi as Geeta P.

Boyd subsequently developed it as a screenplay and it was released as a film in 1988. The book tells the tragicomic story of attempts by visiting British art appraiser Henderson Dore, in New York City and the Deep South, to negotiate the cultural differences between British and American approaches to conducting business. Reviewing the novel for The New York Times, Caroline Seebohm said: \\"Mr. Boyd has some funny and perceptive things to say about English shyness as opposed to American spontaneity... But the author seems also to latch on to what are now fairly well aired differences between the English and Americans ‚Äì pronunciation, for instance, and that old cliche about Americans ruining whiskey with ice... The major scenes in Stars and Bars take place in Luxora Beach, a place of unremitting bleakness and despair. Mr. Boyd's talent in evoking a place, which worked for him so well in his earlier two novels, serves him brilliantly here. In fact, the reader is forced to ask why on earth Henderson, wimpish though he is, does not get out when he can... The point about Henderson's liberation from his roots is well taken, and his adventures through the jungle are amusingly narrated, but the 'new clarity' with which he views the world at the end remains, for the reader, a lingering fog\\". ==References * Official website Category:1984 British novels Category:British novels adapted into films Category:Novels by William Boyd (writer) Category:Novels set in New York City Category:Tragicomedy ","title":"Stars and Bars (novel)"},{"id":"56795422","text":"The list of shipwrecks in May 1840 includes ships sunk, foundered, wrecked, grounded, or otherwise lost during May 1840. ==1 May2 May3 May4 May5 May6 May7 May8 May9 May10 May11 May12 May13 May15 May16 May17 May18 May19 May20 May21 May22 May23 May24 May25 May26 May27 May28 May29 May30 May31 MayUnknown dateReferences== 1840-05 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in May 1840"},{"id":"56795423","text":"Augusta Lynn Bolles (born 1949) is an anthropologist, professor of women's studies at the University of Maryland, and co-chair of The Cottagers' African American Cultural Festival.

He died in prison in √ñrbyhus Castle: according to a tradition starting with Johannes Messenius, his final meal was a poisoned bowl of pea soup. A document signed by his brother, John III of Sweden, and a nobleman, Bengt Bengtsson Gylta (1514‚Äì74), gave Eric's guards in his last prison authorization to poison him if anyone tried to release him. His body was exhumed in 1958 and modern forensic analysis revealed evidence of lethal arsenic poisoning. ; George III of Great Britain : George III's (1738‚Äì1820) personal health was a concern throughout his long reign. He suffered from periodic episodes of physical and mental illness, five of them disabling enough to require the King to withdraw from his duties. In 1969, researchers asserted that the episodes of madness and other physical symptoms were characteristic of the disease porphyria, which was also identified in members of his immediate and extended family. In addition, a 2004 study of samples of the King's hair revealed extremely high levels of arsenic, which is a possible trigger of disease symptoms. A 2005 article in the medical journal The Lancet suggested the source of the arsenic could be the antimony used as a consistent element of the King's medical treatment. The two minerals are often found in the same ground, and mineral extraction at the time was not precise enough to eliminate arsenic from compounds containing antimony. ; Theodor Ursinus : Theodor Gottlieb Ursinus (1749‚Äì1800), a high-ranking Prussian civil servant and justice official, was poisoned by his wife Charlotte Ursinus (1760‚Äì1836). At the time, his death was ruled a stroke, but soon after the widow was found to have poisoned, between 1797 and 1801, not only her husband, but also her aunt and her lover, as well as to have attempted to poison her servant in 1803. Her sensational trial led to the first reliable method of identifying arsenic poisoning. ; Napoleon Bonaparte : It has been suggested that Napoleon Bonaparte (1769‚Äì1821) suffered and died from arsenic poisoning during his imprisonment on the island of Saint Helena. Forensic samples of his hair did show high levels, 13 times the normal amount, of the element. This, however, does not prove deliberate poisoning by Napoleon's enemies: copper arsenite has been used as a pigment in some wallpapers, and microbiological liberation of the arsenic into the immediate environment would be possible. The case is equivocal in the absence of clearly authenticated samples of the wallpaper. Samples of hair taken during Napoleon's lifetime also show levels of arsenic, so that arsenic from the soil could not have polluted the post-mortem sample. Even without contaminated wallpaper or soil, commercial use of arsenic at the time provided many other routes by which Napoleon could have consumed enough arsenic to leave this forensic trace. ; Sim√≥n Bol√≠var : South American independence leader Sim√≥n Bol√≠var (1783‚Äì1830), according to Paul Auwaerter from the Division of Infectious Diseases in the Department of Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, may have died due to chronic arsenic poisoning further complicated by bronchiectasis and lung cancer.Simon Bolivar died of arsenic poisoning 7 May 2010. Nick Allen, The Telegraph. Retrieved on 17 July 2010. Auwaerter has considered murder and acute arsenic poisoning unlikely, arguing that gradual \\"environmental contact with arsenic would have been entirely possible\\" as a result of drinking contaminated water in Peru or through the medicinal use of arsenic (which was common at the time) as Bol√≠var had reportedly resorted to it during the treatment for some of his illnesses. Charles Francis Hall ; Charles Francis Hall : American explorer Charles Francis Hall (1821‚Äì1871) died unexpectedly during his third journey to the Arctic, the Polaris expedition. After returning to the ship from a sledging expedition Hall drank a cup of coffee and fell violently ill. : He collapsed in what was described as a fit. He suffered from vomiting and delirium for the next week, then seemed to improve for a few days. He accused several of the ship's company, including the ship's physician Emil Bessels‚Äîwith whom he had longstanding disagreements‚Äîof having poisoned him. Shortly thereafter, Hall again began suffering the same symptoms, died, and was taken ashore for burial. Following the expedition's return a U.S. Navy investigation ruled that Hall had died from apoplexy. : In 1968, however, Hall's biographer Chauncey C. Loomis, a professor at Dartmouth College, traveled to Greenland to exhume Hall's body. Due to the permafrost, Hall's body, flag shroud, clothing, and coffin were remarkably well preserved. Tissue samples of bone, fingernails, and hair showed that Hall died of poisoning from large doses of arsenic in the last two weeks of his life, consistent with the symptoms party members reported. It is possible that he was murdered by Bessels or one of the other members of the expedition. ; Clare Boothe Luce : Clare Boothe Luce (1903‚Äì1987), the American ambassador to Italy from 1953 to 1956, did not die from arsenic poisoning, but suffered an increasing variety of physical and psychological symptoms until arsenic was implicated. Its source was traced to the flaking arsenic-laden paint on the ceiling of her bedroom. She may also have eaten food contaminated by arsenic in flaking ceiling paint in the embassy dining room. ; Guangxu Emperor : In 2008, testing in the People's Republic of China confirmed that the Guangxu Emperor (1871‚Äì1908) was poisoned with a massive dose of arsenic; suspects include his dying aunt, Empress Dowager Cixi, and her strongman, Yuan Shikai.\\"Forensic scientists: China's reformist second-to-last emperor was murdered,\\" Xinhua, November 3, 2008.\\"Arsenic killed Qing emperor, experts find,\\" The New York Times, October 4, 2008. ; Phar Lap : The famous and largely successful New Zealand-bred racehorse Phar Lap died suddenly in 1932. Poisoning was considered as a cause of death and several forensic examinations were completed at the time of death. In a recent examination, 75 years after his death, forensic scientists determined that the horse had ingested a massive dose of arsenic shortly before his death. ; King Faisal I of Iraq : According to his British nurse, Lady Badget, King Faisal I of Iraq suffered from symptoms similar to those of arsenic poisoning during his last visit to Switzerland for treatment in 1933, at the age of 48. His Swiss doctors found him in a very healthy situation a day before. ; Anderson Mazoka : The popular opposition leader in Zambia, Anderson Mazoka, whose health deteriorated after the 2001 presidential elections, repeatedly accused government agents of poisoning him. His daughter, Mutinta, confirmed after his death on 24 May 2006 that arsenic was found in his body after he died from kidney complications. ; Munir Said Thalib : Munir Said Thalib, an Indonesian human right and anti-corruption activist, was poisoned with arsenic onboard Garuda Indonesia flight from Jakarta to Amsterdam on September 7, 2004. The Netherlands Forensic Institute revealed that Munir's body contained a level of arsenic almost three times the lethal dose. Pollycarpus Budihari Priyanto, an active pilot at the time of the assassination, was found guilty of murder. Despite the guilty verdict, the circumstances surrounding the case remained unclear. ; Emmerson Mnangagwa : Robert Mugabe's successor as President of Zimbabwe, Emmerson Mnangagwa has claimed he was poisoned with arsenic at a rally. His entourage has suggested that supporters of Grace Mugabe were responsible. ; Moriku Joyce : State minister for primary health care, Dr. Moriku Joyce, revealed to the Daily Monitor that unknown people had poisoned her. This was after toxicological investigations in Ugandan and South African laboratories confirmed the presence of arsenic poison in her body. == References == Category:Arsenic Category:Poisoning by drugs, medicaments and biological substances ","title":"Arsenic poisoning cases"},{"id":"56795455","text":"Suisuim√´n√´ or Xuixuim√´n√´ is an Apala√≠-Wayana village on the Eastern Paru River in the state of Par√° in Brazil.

The oldest tombs are from the Bronze Age, the youngest from the early Christian period. Smaller tumuli have been eroded over the centuries and are now no longer visible. Most excavations have had to be carried out as rescue excavations. The finds, both in ancient Pydna and in the necropolises, show a shrinking population during the period of the second Greek colonization. ==Location== Numerous tombs from different periods have been discovered around the ancient city. There is an extensive northern necropolis and smaller necropolises in the west and south (), as well as individual graves and burial mounds. According to ancient customs, cemeteries were located beside access roads and near city gates. ==Graves== Pydna, square grave Among the necropolises, changes in style and funeral rites can be observed over centuries; different types of burials can be seen among the collection of graves. In a few cases, bodies were cremated, while the majority were buried in the ground. Toddlers were often buried in common clay pots, which were broken up and, after embedding the body, rejoined. In some cases, cremated bodies were also buried in copper kettles or clay pots. The dead were either burned directly in the grave or a wooden platform was built for this purpose. During the 5th century BC, male corpses were buried head-west, female bodies head-east. In the skulls of many deceased, the so-called Charon's obol was found; it was put under the tongue of the dead and served to pay the ferryman Charon for the transfer to Hades. During the Hellenistic period and the Roman period, burials were the rule, cremations were even rarer than at the time of the Classical period. Remains of wooden coffins sometimes were painted in blue and red. The graves from the middle of the 4th century BC are smaller than the graves that were created before or after; archaeologists attribute this fact back to economically difficult times. The form of the graves goes from a simple pit over enclosed graves to Macedonian and Thracian tombs with dromos and several chambers. In part, the patterns of the arrangement of graves suggest their use as family tombs. The most elaborate design embodies the monumental Macedonian tombs, the two most significant of which are located in Korinos. The soils of the simple graves were sprinkled with gravel or sand. Stone slabs or, more often - as stones are rare in the environs of Pydna - wooden boards covered the graves. Single square tombs testify that the remains of the deceased were reburied later. Six of the discovered tombs were built in the Mycenaean style, which was unusual in Pieria.Besios, Matheos.

In children's graves, clay figures have often been found. The pieces of jewelry are usually made of bronze, iron, or silver; less often, they are made of bone or gold. In the graves of the male deceased, weapons have been found only in rare cases. The small vessels of glass or alabaster, which are attached to the corpses of women, are usually in good condition.

Since the graves are mainly in agricultural areas, they were mapped, photographed, and after the grave goods were removed, filled with soil again. The vast part of the northern necropolis still remains uncovered and the land is currently used by farmers to grow crops. Only monumental individual graves are still open, protected against weather by roofs. The simple graves were mostly untouched when archaeologists found them, in contrast to the Macedonian burial mounds, which were often already looted during antiquity. A burial mound some 500 meters north of the ramparts of ancient Pydna contained tombs from the 5th and 4th centuries BC. Most of them were spared by grave robbers. Within the graves were rich grave goods; the women had been given valuable glass vessels and gold and silver jewelry; in the men's graves were swords, lances, helmets, and drinking vessels.Besios, Matheos.

Located on Conant and Weeden Streets, the complex was developed between 1883 and 1919, and was home to the city's largest employer in the 1910s, producing cotton fabric and fabric for use in automotive tires until 1933. The factory complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. ==Description and history== The Jenckes Spinning Company factory is located about west of downtown Pawtucket, on in the shape of a rectangle with one corner cut off. It is bounded by Conant, Pine, and Weeden Streets, and includes nine buildings, seven of which are historically significant. All are of brick construction typical of late 19th and early 20th century textile mills, and range in height from one to six stories. Notable architectural features include the sawtooth roof on the facility's former weaving sheds, which front on Weeden Street. In 1872, Edwin Jenckes, by then a successful supplier of equipment to textile manufacturers in Walpole, Massachusetts and Pawtucket, established a company with textile maker Nathaniel Hicks, as a vehicle for the manufacture of patented ring travellers. In 1883, the company took on the name \\"E. Jenckes Manufacturing Company\\", and acquired a portion of the land now making up the plant. The company's earliest buildings were built that year, but were demolished in 1915-16. The company was successful in manufacturing textile-making equipment, and soon expanded into textile production itself. In the 1910s, the company developed a heavy cotton duck fabric that could be dipped in rubber for use in automotive applications. The company was closed down in the 1930s after a series of acquisitions, and the property was purchased by the city and subdivided for other uses. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Pawtucket, Rhode Island ==References== Category:Industrial buildings completed in 1883 Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Rhode Island Category:Buildings and structures in Pawtucket, Rhode Island Category:National Register of Historic Places in Pawtucket, Rhode Island ","title":"Jenckes Spinning Company"},{"id":"56795480","text":"Anatoly Aleksandrovich Vaneyev (, Arkhangelsk ‚Äì , Yermakovskoye village, now capital of the Yermakovsky District in the Krasnoyarsk Krai) was an active participant of the revolutionary movement in the Russian Empire. == Biography == G.

An investigation of some kind usually follows a fatal diving accident, or one in which litigation is expected. There may be several investigations with different agendas. If police are involved, they generally look for evidence of a crime. In the US the Coastguard will usually investigate if there is a death when diving from a vessel in coastal waters. Health and safety administration officials may investigate when the diver was injured or killed at work. When a death occurs during an organised recreational activity, the certification agency's insurers will usually send an investigator to look into possible liability issues. The investigation may occur almost immediately to some considerable time after the event. In most cases the body will have been recovered and resuscitation attempted, and in this process equipment is usually removed and may be damaged or lost, or the evidence compromised by handling. Witnesses may have dispersed, and equipment is often mishandled by the investigating authorities who are often unfamiliar with the equipment and may store it improperly, which can destroy evidence and compromise findings. Recreational diving accidents are usually relatively uncomplicated, but accidents involving an extended range environment of specialised equipment may require expertise beyond the experience of any one investigator. This is a particular issue when rebreather equipment is involved. For every incident in which someone is injured of killed, it has been estimated that a relatively large number of \\"near miss\\" incidents occur, which the diver manages well enough to avoid harm. Ideally these will be recorded, analysed for cause, reported, and the results made public, so that similar incidents can be avoided in the future. == Reasons for investigation == Professional diving accidents are usually investigated when a reportable injury occurs in terms of occupational health and safety legislation. The purpose is generally to allow avoidance of recurrences of the circumstances leading to the incident if practicable, and where relevant, to establish whether there was fault attributable to any involved party, which could lead to criminal or civil charges. Accident investigation may help to identify the cause of a specific accident. If a pattern can be identified this may inform procedures and legislation to reduce the risk of the same pattern of accident recurring in the future. An investigation may identify shortcomings in training or procedures, or problems with equipment. Fatalities are often investigated as potential crimes until the cause of death has been identified. Insurance claims may rely on information from an investigation to establish whether the accident is covered by a policy. Occupational health and safety inspectors may investigate an occupational diving incident to identify whether regulations have been violated. Civil litigation for claimed damages can be more equitably decided when the circumstances leading to the injury have been identified. The ability to provide documentary evidence showing that correct procedure was followed can simplify the investigation and may lead to more accurate and reliable findings. Equipment, procedures, organization, environment, individual factors and interactions between them are the sources of contributing and compounding events and conditions. Analysis of near accidents can be of great value to identify sources of error and allow planning to reduce or eliminate contributing and compounding conditions. A safety study estimated about a million shortcuts taken per fatal accident. Accident investigations typically focus on the end event, and attempt to erect barriers to similar accidents, such as personal protection equipment, backup equipment or alarm systems. These are intended to prevent the recurrence of similar accidents, and are often effective in this limited goal. Accidents continue to occur because the majority of the contributing and compounding factors are not addressed. Human behavior and the systems in which people work are too complex to analyse all possible interactions. A more effective route to accident prevention is to reduce or mitigate the occurrence of human error by focusing on the contributing and compounding human factors that create an environment in which accidents are likely to occur. == General procedures == The victims of diving accidents are generally recovered or rescued by other divers in the vicinity. It is unusual for a diver to be left underwater with no immediate attempt at recovery, so in situ forensic investigation is seldom applicable, and the investigation usually relies on the accounts of witnesses. Different people may make different reports and develop different opinions about what happened. It is not unusual for people with less knowledge and understanding to misinterpret what they have seen and investigators need to gather as much information as reasonably possible to improve the chance of getting accurate information. Recommended autopsy procedures have been summarised by specialists in diving fatality investigations and are available as guidelines to reduce the risk of overlooking pertinant evidence by pathologists less experienced in diving related autopsies. There are three parts to a fatal accident investigation. *Autopsy to determine where possible any medical factors that may have caused or contributed towards the death, *Investigation of the sequence of events to determine whether any procedural or behavioural issues caused or contributed towards the death. This is usually done through witness interviews and looking into the deceased's history of training and experience, and *Inspection and testing of the equipment used by the deceased, to find out if any equipment problems, defects, or malfunctions were contributory. Most marine incident emergency response and accident investigation protocols have been written to manage surface incidents. These protocols are often inadequate for discovering the facts that could improve diving safety, and there is often a lack of cooperation between investigators and stakeholders in the outcomes of investigations. It is not usually necessary to dive to inspect the site of a diving accident, but sometimes there are unusual environmental features which make underwater inspection desirable. === Recreational diving accidents === A large proportion of recreational divers use a personal decompression computer to monitor depth, time and decompression status. These generally log a dive profile by recording depth and time at regular intervals, and this data can usually be downloaded or inspected on the instrument. This usually constitutes a reliable and objective record of the actual dive profile, and is normally admissible as evidence. Accuracy may vary depending on calibration. In some cases assistance from the factory may be needed to reover the data. to be expanded === Professional diving accidents === Professional diving on scuba also frequently uses dive computers as dive profile recorders. The data logged by the computer can be useful in determining the details of the dive profile and interpreting the sequence of events, particularly where there is no communications recording available. to be expanded === Commercial diving accidents === Surface supplied diving usually uses a diver intercom system to provide voice communications between the diver and supervisor, both for management and control of the dive, and for safety, as the supervisor can monitor the condition of the diver by hearing the breathing sounds. It is standard procedure for many (possibly most) contractors to record the voice communications of the dive and retain them for at least 24 hours, or longer in the case of an incident. These recordings are usually available as evidence in an official investigation. Surface supplied divers do not generally carry personal decompression computers, as depth profile is monitored from the surface, and decompression is controlled by the supervisor, who will log changes in depth as and when they occur. to be expanded == Preservation and disclosure of evidence == Failure to identify, preserve, and produce critical evidence such as dive computer data can result in sanctions against the responsible party, including findings in favour of the party requesting the lost information. Investigators without a sufficient knowledge of diving equipment have been known to destroy or lose critical evidence through mishandling of equipment, even when it survived rescue and recovery efforts. In US Federal law the owner of equipment that logs data during an incident that may be the subject of litigation is obliged to preserve that data and make it available as evidence if the case comes to court at a later date. Litigants are required to find out what they have and disclose everything relevant to the opposition. Detailed checklists and standardised report formats have been developed for use by investigators to minimise the risk of missing important evidence and of compromising the evidence. These are available for open-circuit and rebreather equipment. === Special procedures for rebreather equipment === Although all cases where a diver dies while wearing a rebreather are classified as rebreather fatalities, this does not necessarily mean that a rebreather equipment problem was a contributory factor to the death of the diver. Not much is known about the root causes of these accidents because many investigations were inadequate and such findings as exist are often not made public. This makes it difficult to objectively improve the equipment, procedures and training so that the faults and errors are not repeated. The most common equipment tests in rebreather incidents include examination of the equipment, scrubber testing, oxygen consumption tests, work of breathing measurements, checks on electronics and sensors, and tests of modifications where present. Equipment problems are the trigger a large percentage of incidents, though equipment failures are less common. Procedural and human-machine interactions are a significant factor in rebreather incidents, and more common than in open circuit diving. In the European Union, breathing apparatus for underwater use is a category III product, meaning that failures are potentially lethal. The harmonised standard for diving rebreathers is EN 14143-2003, so rebreathers will be checked against that standard. The appropriate tests depend on the condition of the unit and the specifics of the case. As a general rule the first items are to download the logs from dive computers and breathing apparatus following the manufacturer's specifications. The assembled rebreather's exterior is checked and photographed, and the gas content of the counterlung is sampled and analyzed. Although there are many possibilities for the counterlung gas to mix with the surroundings, a finding of a low oxygen content may indicate hypoxia if there is no evidence of an alternative cause of low oxygen levels. The content of the cylinders is also measured and analysed and the cylinders, regulator and check valves inspected. The work of breathing is measured on the appropriate equipment. The unit is dismantled and the sensors, electronics and battery are tested, and the scrubber inspected. After cleaning, disinfecting and reassembly, the unit is test dived, in case there is some subtle problem that can be detected by an expert user, such as buoyancy, weight distribution and performance in various orientations. Ergonomics and performance implications of any customisation will be checked. All results are recorded, and photographs taken at various stages of the procedures. == Causes of diving accidents == Causes of diving accidents are the triggering events that when combined with inadequate response, lead to an adverse consequence which may be classified as a notifiable incident or an accident when injury or death follows. These causes can be categorised as human factors, equipment problems and environmental factors. Equipment problems and environmental factors are also often influenced by human error. The risk of injury varies with the mode and classification of the dive. In recreational diving it is generally possible for a diver to make several errors of judgement or calculation without adverse effects. More technical dive profiles may be less tolerant of error to the extent that a single error may be life-threatening, so technical divers tend to carry and use equipment to mitigate such possible errors, and to use and practice procedures known to reduce the risk of committing such errors. Professional diving is generally required to have a risk as low as reasonably practicable, and this implies the use of equipment redundancy, procedures known to minimise risk, and the availability of support personnel and equipment on site to mitigate reasonably foreseeable incidents. === Human factors === Human error is inevitable and everyone makes mistakes at some time. The consequences of these errors are varied and depend on many factors. Most errors are minor and do not cause significant harm, but others can have catastrophic consequences. Examples of human error leading to accidents are available in vast numbers, as it is the direct cause of 60% to 80% of all accidents. Inexperience and lack of competence are the commonest root causes of diving fatalities. Inattention and negligence are known to be common contributory factors in diving accidents, and have been the root cause of some accidents.  Physiological factors  A wide range of physiological factors may trigger or contribute towards a diving accident. The causes of death or serious injury in diving accidents include drowning, lung overpressure accidents, decompression sickness, carbon monoxide poisoning and trauma due to impact with boats. These are usually the final effect and may be combined, though the usually the cause of death is attributed to just one of the causes. Acute oxygen toxicity, hypoxia, hypothermia and squeezes (barotrauma) may also be primary causes of diving accidents. Physiological triggering events that may lead to a diving accident, but are not generally the direct cause of death include nitrogen narcosis, dehydration, exhaustion, hypothermia, excessive work of breathing, motion sickness and the effects of alcohol and recreational drugs. Occasionally side effects of medical pharmaceuticals may also trigger an accident. Epileptic seizures should not occur, as a history of epilepsy is a bar to diver training, but cases have occurred where the problem was not disclosed and the person subsequently died as a result of drowning after losing their air supply during a seizure. These factors are often overlooked in accident investigations, and this may lead to a misleading conclusion about the cause of death. Problems not directly related to diving may also cause death while diving, such as a cardiac event or stroke, possibly triggered by the physical effort of a difficult situation. These causes may be overlooked and the death inaccurately ascribed to drowning. Drowning may be the most common reported cause of death in diving incidents. However, an autopsy listing drowning as the cause of death may not have established the reason for drowning, and autopsies on diving accident victims require a specific set of procedures to detect evidence of other possible causes. Drowning has been reported as the default finding in water related deaths where other causes were not detected, and may be erroneous. A properly equipped diver following recommended practices, diving in an environment compatible with their competence and in good health should not drown. When drowning is the direct cause of death it has usually been the final stage of a cascade of incidents which at some stage got out of the diver's control and culminated in drowning. The sequence of events is relatively difficult to establish and requires an understanding and familiarity with the equipment and procedures which may not be known to the investigators. This lack of clarity can lead to inappropriate litigation.  Psychological factors  In a high risk environment, as is the case in diving, human error is more likely to have catastrophic consequences. A study by William P. Morgan indicates that over half of all divers in the survey had experienced panic underwater at some time during their diving career. These findings were independently corroborated by a survey that suggested 65% of recreational divers have panicked under water. Panic frequently leads to errors in a diver's judgment or performance, and may result in an accident. Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of dive accidents and fatalities.  Procedural factors  Only 4.46% of the recreational diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable to a single contributory cause. The remaining fatalities probably arose as a result of a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and procedural errors are generally avoidable by a well- trained, intelligent and alert diver, working in an organised structure, and not under excessive stress. === Equipment issues === Most diving equipment is quite rugged and very reliable when correctly maintained and tested before use, but almost anything can fail and cause a problem for the diver. Some failures are merely an inconvenience, but others can be immediately life- threatening, so part of diver training is how to manage those failures which constitute an immediate risk to health or life. These are generally failures affecting breathing gas supply and buoyancy. Failures of environmental protection are generally not immediately life-threatening to recreational divers, who are able to abort a dive and surface at any time, but are more serious for divers with decompression obligations, ore are unable to surface because of a physical overhead barrier, or dive in extremely cold or polluted water. Loss of buoyancy is less of a problem to surface supplied divers as they have a lifeline and do not easily run out of gas, but an uncontrolled ascent can be dangerous even when there is technically no decompression obligation. For a scuba diver, loss of breathing gas and buoyancy together can be deadly.  Out of gas incidents  A high proportion of scuba accidents involve running out of breathing gas. However, in the majority of these cases there is no equipment failure, or a minor equipment failure is mismanaged. Out of gas incidents are immediately life-threatening underwater, and all divers are trained in mitigation procedures. Recreational divers who rely on a dive buddy to supply gas in an emergency are expected to carry a secondary demand valve and remain close enough to their buddy to provide gas without delay in an emergency. Alternatives to gas sharing are to make an emergency ascent to the surface, a procedure implicated in a large proportion of fatalities, or to carry an independent alternative gas supply. Solo and rebreather divers follow this latter strategy, and technical divers may choose to carry bailout gas or use a scuba configuration that reduces the risk of a complete loss of gas in the event of most scenarios, at the cost of greater skill requirements and task loading. Professional scuba divers may be required to carry bailout gas. The submersible pressure gauge is extremely reliable, and seldom fails catastrophically without warning, though they can be inaccurate at low pressures. Occasionally a hose bursts due to immediate or accumulated damage, and a low pressure hose burst can empty a cylinder in a few minutes to seconds depending on the contents of the cylinder, while also making the remaining gas unavailable to the diver. Unrecoverable free-flows are rare, but occasionally occur, and regulator freeze can cause a free-flow which can only be stopped by closing the cylinder valve. More commonly, a diver will use up all the gas without noticing until the pressure is critically low. A common complication of loss of breathing gas supply is that the same gas supply is routinely used for breathing and buoyancy control in recreational scuba diving. Surface supplied divers are generally obliged to carry sufficient bailout gas to return to a place of safety if the main gas supply fails, and this is usually activated by opening a valve on the helmet or harness that is in easy reach of both hands. Unsurprisingly, the number of out of gas fatalities in surface supplied diving is very low.  Breathing gas quality problems  Contamination of the breathing gas will have effects that depend on the concentration, the ambient pressure, and the specific contaminants present. Carbon monoxide produced by overheating of the compressor, or by contamination of the intake air by internal combustion engine exhaust gas is a well known risk, and can be mitigated by using hopcalite catalyst in the high pressure filter. Contamination by carbon dioxide is unusual in open circuit breathing apparatus, as natural air usually has a low enough content not to be a problem at the ambient pressures of most dives. It is a relatively common problem for rebreathers, as the metabolically produced carbon dioxide in the exhaled gas must be removed chemically by the scrubber before the gas can be breathed again. Scrubber breakthrough can occur for a variety of reasons, most of them connected to user error, but some more likely due to design details of the specific unit. A slow buildup of carbon dioxide can usually be noticed by the diver in time to bail out, but sometimes the concentration can rise so rapidly that the diver is incapcitated before being able to bail out. Use of breathing gases other than those planned for the current depth range of a dive can have undesirable consequences. The oxygen concentration of a gas may be toxic or insufficient to support consciousness if used at an inappropriate depth, and the inert gas components will not be correctly accounted for in decompression calculations, which might result in decompression sickness. Both oxygen toxicuty and hypoxia may render the diver unconscious without warning, and decompression sickness symptoms may be debilitating if severe, and are generally unexpected.  Breathing apparatus malfunctions  Open circuit scuba is generally very reliable if correctly maintained and serviced, and tested before the dive. Maintenance and testing procedures are simple and few in number, nevertheless divers may neglect them due to complacency, distraction or incompetence. Rebreather scuba is considerably more complex than open circuit scuba, and the number of failure modes is much greater. The complexity of routine maintenance, pre-dive setup and pre-dive testing are such that documentary checklists specific to the equipment model are strongly recommended by experts. Electronically mediated predive check sequences are available on some electronic closed circuit rebreathers, but even these occasionally fail to detect a latent problem. Surface supplied diving equipment may provide a constant flow or demand regulated gas supply. The surface gas control panel allows alternative gas supplies to be connected if the primary supply fails, and a further backup supply is generally carried by the diver. This multiple redundancy reduces the number of ways the gas supply to the diver can be critically compromised, and further mitigation is provided by the standby diver, who can also supply emergency breathing gas. As a consequence, surface-supplied divers are very seldom critically affected by breathing gas supply failure.  Buoyancy problems  Insufficient buoyancy is a problem for divers who must ascend through the water column without assistance from a lifting platform, a surface tender, or something they can climb. This effectively limits the problem to freedivers and untethered scuba divers. Insufficient buoyancy at the end of a dive can prevent the diver from surfacing before breathing gas runs out, cause the diver to sink to an unintended depth or cause a diver at the surface to be unable to stay afloat. Insufficient buoyancy at the end of a dive is usually due to diver error in carrying too much weight or to a major failure of the dry suit or buoyancy compensator (BC or BCD). Insufficient buoyancy at the start of a dive can also be caused by carrying too much weight, but can also be due to a poor match between mass of gas carried and volume of buoyancy compensator, which is usually only a problem with technical divers, who may start a dive with a relatively large mass of gas. A major flood of the dry suit can cause a sudden large loss of buoyancy at any time during a dive. A properly trained and equipped diver will be able to correct this either by BC inflation or weight shedding. Divers are trained to manage problems of insufficient buoyancy due to equipment malfunctions, and to adjust their weighting to suit the equipment used for a specific dive. The consequence of uncompensated insufficient buoyancy is usually drowning. Almost all fatalities due to insufficient buoyancy can be ascribed to diver error if the diver was conscious and able to act at the time that the problem was noticed. Excessive buoyancy can be a problem for any diver who is constrained from making a direct uncontrolled ascent. It is a hazard for all divers who breath underwater at ambient pressure, as a rapid ascent can cause decompression illness. Excessive buoyancy at the start of a dive is usually caused by insufficient weighting, which is diver error. Loss of ballast weights can occur at any time during a dive, and can have various causes, depending on how the weights are carried, including voluntary shedding of too much weight in a perceived emergency. A third cause of excessive buoyancy, which develops during a dive and usually manifests at the end, during the ascent, is insufficient weighting to compensate for the mass of gas used during the dive. This can be almost always be ascribed to diver error, and usually occurs when a diver miscalculates the buoyancy increase due to gas usage, and does not carry sufficient weight to compensate. It is a common problem when unfamiliar equipment is used without a checkout dive with the cylinder nearly empty. Divers will often accept the recommendations for weighting given by the dive shop supplying the equipment, or base their weighting on similar equipment used in the past. For recreational divers who do not exceed the no-stop limit, this is seldom seriously harmful. At worst the ascent rate may be a little fast near the surface and they will be unable to do a safety stop, but for divers with a significant decompression obligation, it can have more serious consequences. Surface supplied divers who plan a dive with long decompression obligations usually carry weights which cannot easily be removed, to reduce the risk of accidentally losing them and becoming uncontrollably buoyant. The other common cause of excessive buoyancy which can occur at any time in a dive, is excess gas in the dry suit or buoyancy compensator. This can be caused by several factors, some of which can be classed as diver error, and others as equipment malfunction, but divers are trained to deal with these malfunctions as they are reasonably foreseeable, so failure to correct them when they occur is also generally a diver error in the wider sense. Buoyancy compensator malfunction has been implicated in a significant number of fatal incidents, usually due to a problem with the inflator mechanism, but in some cases the BCD could not stay inflated. In most of these fatalities, the buoyancy compensator was not used competently, usually by over-inflation which caused an uncontrolled ascent, or deflating when more buoyancy was required at the surface. Overweighting can also be classified as misuse of equipment. Inability to inflate the buoyancy compensator can also occur when the diver runs out of breathing gas, as the breathing gas supply is generally the inflation gas supply. This can complicate an emergency ascent, particularly if the diver is not immediately aware of the implications relating to buoyancy of breathing gas loss. BCD blowups can occur when the inflation valve sticks open. In most cases this can be quickly corrected, either by pulling the valve open or by disconnecting the LP inflation hose, and if the system has a low flow rate when fully open, this is seldom a major problem, as it is possible to dump air faster than it flows into the BCD. However, some inflator systems have a high flow rate, and if these valves stick fully open, the diver may not be able to dump fast enough to prevent being dragged upwards, at which stage a positive feedback of expansion of gas already in the BCD and possibly also the suit may become unrecoverable. Attempts to fin downwards against the buoyancy are likely to trap gas in the BCD and suit. Ascents are safer if the diver is trimmed feet down and shoulders high to facilitate dumping from both suit and BCD. Double bladder BCDs are used by some technical divers as a backup in case the primary fails by not retaining air. This can happen if the inflation hose tears or comes off, or the bladder has a major puncture near the top that cannot be compensated by trim. The problem with this form of equipment redundancy occurs when the diver inadvertently inflates or deflates the wrong bladder. It is also possible for the inflation valve of a secondary bladder with low pressure inflation supply to malfunction and leak gas into the bladder without the diver's input or knowledge, and the diver then finds it impossible to dump sufficient gas from what they mistakenly believe to be the inflated bladder. This risk can be avoided by not connecting a pressure supply hose to the inflator for the secondary bladder, by having a distinctly different style of inflator mechanism, by mounting it on the other side of the diver to the primary inflator, and by never using it underwater while the primary bladder is functional. The other way of managing this problem is to mount the two inflator valve units together, and basically always assume that both bladders have gas in then, so always dump from both at the same time. This may be problematic if the diver needs to deflate while inverted and the lower dump valves are not positioned to allow simultaneous operation. If a dry suit is worn, the dry suit can be inflated as a substitute for the BCD in an emergency, but a dry suit is not well suited to operate at a good trim with a large amount of gas inside, and the risk of a runaway inverted ascent is significant. Remaining upright and ascending without delay is most likely to avoid complications. Divers who carry a delayed surface marker buoy (DSMB) can use it to signal the surface that they are ascending, and use it to positively control depth and ascent rate once deployed, by maintaining some tension in the line. The equipment is considered an important safety aid, but deployment is a period of relatively high risk, as if the line snags and stops unrolling the buoyancy may be sufficient to drag the diver up far enough to cause the expansion of the suit and BCD to get out of control, and if the diver lets go of the DSMB it will be lost. The risks of clipping on the DSMB during deployment are considered unacceptable by some, and this practice has been implicated in fatal accidents. A spare DSMB and spool may be carried in case of this contingency.  Thermal problems  *Hypothermia *Overheating is a less common problem, and is usually associated with special environments. **Scalding in hot water suits  Hazardous tools and activities  Underwater cutting and welding activities involve the use of live electrical conductors exposed to the water in the close proximity of the diver using them. Electrocution is possible, though unlikely to be fatal. as the voltages are fairly low. They also involve extreme heat and the generation of explosive gases, which may accumulate under obstacles to their free escape, and may detonate, causing pressure trauma to the diver. Stringent precautions are required for using this equipment, including training in the appropriate procedures. Nevertheless, accidents occasionally happen. The equipment used and injuries manifested are pointers towards possible triggering events. Professional divers are often required to assist with the lifting and placement of large, massive objects underwater during the course of their employment. This exposes them to hazards of impact, pinching and crushing. Trauma caused by such incidents is usually obvious and easily identified. In some cases the triggering incident is a lapse of procedure, other times it may be an unexpected environmental effect, though seldom unforeseeable. Occasionally a failure of properly tested, inspected and operated equipment may occur. Negligence is often contributory to such accidents. Recreational divers are usually not sufficiently trained to safely perform these tasks, and are at greater risk. Entanglement in a runaway buoyant lift is a hazard specifically of working with lift bags, and particularly when filling them with breathing gas from scuba cylinders carried by the diver. Filling a lift bag at depth can deplete the gas supply in a cylinder rapidly, so a dedicated cylinder should be used when this work must be done on scuba. *High pressure waterjetting *Handling explosives === Environmental factors === *Overhead environments where a direct vertical ascent to the surface is not possible. Examples include flooded caves and mines, sewers, closed tanks, culverts, penstocks and the interior of shipwrecks. *Strong current and surge *Pressure differentials, particularly when they cause flow towards an enclosed space or mechanical hazard. A pressure difference can draw a diver into a hazard, or trap the diver against an opening too small to pass through. In extreme cases the pressure difference across a small opening can cause direct trauma. *Entrapment hazards *Hazardous materials == Autopsy findings == Drowning is death resulting from hypoxemia caused by asphyxiation by immersion in a liquid. It is very often the direct cause of death in diving accidents, but usually follows a series of events triggered by an event which need not necessarily have been fatal. Drowning is a diagnosis of exclusion, it is appropriate when other possibilities have been ruled out. In scuba diving drowning is usually the consequence of running out of breathing gas at depth or under an overhead barrier to a direct ascent to the surface, but can aso occur as a consequence of loss of consciousness for any one of a variety of reasons followed by a compromised airway. In breathhold diving it usually occurs when the diver loses consciousness or reaches a state of hypercapnia severe enough to cause involuntary inhalation before reaching the surface. The airway of a surface supplied diver is usually protected by the helmet or full- face mask, and consequently these divers should survive a loss of consciousness if rescued while a suitable breathing gas supply is available. Arterial gas embolism requires overextension of lung tissue which can occur on ascent. A sufficient overexpansion of the lungs requires a simultaneous decrease in depth and failure to release gas from the lungs, so that the blood-air interface is ruptured while there is sufficient overpressure to force gas into pulmonary blood vessels against local blood pressure Decompression sickness requires supersaturation of tissues during the decompression of ascent, and is bubble formation is affected by ascent rate and the amount of gas dissolved in the tissues during exposure to pressure while breathing. Presence of tissue bubbles during autopsy is not necessarily an indication of DCS as gas will come out of solution when a body is decompressed by recovering to the surface. Dive history as recorded by a personal dive computer or bottom timer can indicate a probability of gas bubbles being a consequence of decompression sickness, lung overpressure induced arterial gas embolism or an artifact of post mortem recovery decompression. Paradoxical gas embolism - venous blood with bubbles which would be asymptomatic if filtered through the pulmonary circulation passing through a patent foramen ovale into the systemic circulation during exertion during ascent or after surfacing, and then lodge in critical tissues where they may grow by diffusion processes. Divers are often unaware of a PFO, and there is not generally a requirement to be tested for PFO for recreational or professional divers as it is not a disqualification for diving. Cardiovascular disease: The most common natural disease process associated with diving fatalities. Often sudden death is the first indication of cardiovascular disease, but sometimes the diver had known problems but chose to continue diving. In divers older than 35 years cardiovascular disease is second only to drowning as the primary cause of death, and is frequently implicated in drownings. Carbon monoxide poisoning is rare, but occasionally occurs due to contaminated breathing gas. Partial pressure in the breathing gas is increased in proportion to depth, and concentrations that might be tolerated at the surface could be lethal at depth. Breathing gas tests can confirm or exclude the presence of carbon monoxide in toxic concentrations. Mechanical trauma is usually obvious when it is the direct cause of death, but it is possible for less obvious injury to cause a short term reduction in the level of consciousness sufficient for the diver to be unable to avoid drowning, or to hinder the diver from taking the necessary action. == General findings == The direct cause of death is not usually the ultimate aim of the investigation. A finding of drowning, gas embolism or decompression sickness by the autopsy opens the question of why that happened, and whether it could or should have been avoidable. The equipment, procedures and training associated with diving are specifically intended to prevent drowning, barotrauma and decompression sickness, and a fatality caused by one of these is an indication that the system failed in some way. To be useful in preventing similar incidents, it is necessary to find out how and why the system failed. In non-fatal accidents, this is the primary purpose of the investigation. Buddy separation is frequently associated with recreational diving incidents. This can be interpreted to indicate that the buddy system as commonly practised by recreational divers is flawed. Either the divers are not effectively adhering to the buddy system as specified by the training agencies, or the circumstances of the dive were beyond the capacity of the divers to remain together, which implies that the divers were not technically competent to perform that dive. This problem is exacerbated by arbitrary pairing of strangers to dive as buddies by dive professionals who are not familiar with the competence of the divers beyond the certification they have produced when booking the dive. The dive professionals are usually indemnified by a waiver/release that the divers are required to sign as a condition of service, leaving the divers vulnerable to the consequences of being paired with an incompetent or negligent buddy, or buddies who have been trained in slightly different procedures, and may be unfamiliar with each other's equipment and intentions. The reaction to this problem includes the two extremes - The DIR philosophy of strict adherence to a standardised system of procedures and equipment, and not diving with anyone who does not use the same system, and the self-reliant route, where the diver elects to dive as if on their own, not relying on the buddy for assistance, and carrying sufficient equipment redundancy to manage reasonably foreseeable incidents unaided. These divers may choose to dive solo rather than be burdened by a buddy of unknown competence or known incompetence, but may be obstructed in this choice by legislation or terms and conditions of service. A common finding in recreational diving is human error, most often of the victim. In some cases the diver was not competent for the specific activity due to lack of appropriate training, in others the scope of the training was appropriate but the diver 's skills were insufficient at the time. Even when equipment problems are involved, they are usually due to human error, either by misuse, failure to check functionality, or inappropriate reaction to a problem. In professional diving, although there are considerably more safeguards required, and the incidence of accidents is lower, human error remains a major contributor, but it is sometimes error by other members of the dive team. == Competence of investigators == Fatal scuba diving accidents are uncommon, and training of forensic investigators and pathologists does not generally include the relevant skills and specialist knowledge. Specialist workshops have been run to provide a better understanding of diving physiology and pathophysiology, epidemiology, gathering of pertinent history, familiarization with dive equipment, modification of autopsy protocol, interpretation of the findings, and determination of the most likely cause of death. == Near miss reports == For every incident in which someone is injured of killed, it has been estimated that a relatively large number of \\"near miss\\" incidents occur, which the diver manages well enough to avoid harm. In many cases these can be ascribed to inherent hazards of diving, and the responses which compensated for the hazardous event are standard diving procedures, correctly and promptly applied, but there are also situations where something unforeseen, not immediately explicable, or previously considered highly improbable, occurs. Ideally these incidents will be recorded, analysed for cause, reported, and the results made public, so that similar incidents can be avoided in the future. This tends to happen more consistently in professional diving, where occupational health and safety concerns are more closely monitored, and in organisations with an established safety culture. == References == Category:Underwater diving safety ","title":"Investigation of diving accidents"},{"id":"56795530","text":"Werner Ehrensperger (born 10 March 1940) is a Swiss coxswain.

Later that year, on July 15, the show was renewed for a second season which premiered on April 18, 2020. ==Synopsis== In the small quiet town of Monte Macabre, two total opposite half-brothers search about the town for adventure and find strange and supernatural happenings with the help of their supernatural grandmother. ==Promotion, production, and release== The idea for the show originally started as a thesis project titled High Noon in Mexico in 2002 by Molano when he was a Maryland Institute College of Art student, where Victor and Valentino were part of a video game, along with a third brother named Vicente. In 2004, the idea took the name of \\"Victor, Valentino and Vicente.\\" Years later, he revisited the project when interning for Titmouse, where he worked after graduating from MICA, and worked as a \\"clean-up artist\\" on Superjail!. Being a Latin American folk-themed show, its pilot episode premiered directly on the channel on October 29, 2016 (two days before their local Day of the Dead). In this pilot, Molano voiced Victor, and planned on finding someone else. However, he decided to, ultimately, voice Victor in the main show. He later stated that he was, as a kid, just like Victor, thinking he could \\"do no wrong,\\" and hoped the show would give a \\"good lesson for kids.\\" The main show itself, is produced at Cartoon Network's studio in Burbank, California. Molano noted that this is where all the writing, storyboarding, pre- and post-production is done, with 36 people working on pre-production, while the main production of the animation is done by two studios based in Seoul: SMIP Co., LTD. and Digital eMation, Inc. He further noted that the visual inspiration from the show comes from \\"Mesoamerica‚Äôs beautiful, ancient art styles.\\" In 2019, Molano expressed some of the challenges with producing the show. This included condensing \\"large, epic scale, sometimes adult-themed myths/stories\\" into 11-minute episodes and making them \\"digestible content rated for kids.\\" He was inspired to borrow from \\"storylines from indigenous cultures all around Mesoamerica\\" in an attempt to bring them into the \\"US cultural imaginary.\\" The art directors of the show, two brothers, Josh Parpan and Justin Parpan, who had worked on Gravity Falls and Ducktales respectfully, added their perspective. Their work allowed the \\"culturally-specific world for the series\\" to be constructed, which they showcased on a Tumblr blog titled \\"Folk Art Friends ‚Äì The Art of Victor and Valentino.\\" In an interview with Cartoon Brew, they expressed the need to \\"do something new and different artistically,\\" and immersed themselves in \\"a variety of Latin American art,\\" with many forms of inspiration. ==Characters== * Victor \\"Vic\\" Calavera (voiced by Diego Molano): Valentino's younger half-brother who is as easily bored as he is excitable. He prefers playing games, pulling pranks and being mischievous, but can be rather hasty and uncoordinated. He would rather look cool than follow directions, but cares about Valentino above anything else. Additionally, he is really bad at spelling, prefers being dirty and is easily duped into committing certain acts. * Valentino \\"Val\\" (voiced by Rico Rodriguez [pilot]; Sean-Ryan Petersen [series]): Victor's older half-brother who is more cautious and likes taking in the smaller things in life. He has better coordination than Victor and is smarter, but still looks out for him and cares for his well-being. He is seemingly overweight, but seems to be pretty strong and muscular at times, seeing to how he lifts heavy and huge things easily and is very knowledgeable about ancient Mexican culture and its history. * Chata (voiced by Carla Tassara [pilot]; Laura Patalano [series]): the boys' grandmother, with whom they stay in Monte Macabre for the summer. She appears to be blind, is stern, yet kind. The pilot depicts her as an undead spirit that can take on a human form, while the series only implies her supernatural connections. In a 2019 interview, Molano said that he based Grandma Chata on his own grandmother. * Maria Teresa (voiced by Frankie Qui√±ones): Charlene and Pineapple's mean- spirited grandmother and Chata's rival. She owns her own taco establishment. ** Charlene (voiced by Cristina Milizia): A strange and macabre little girl who picks on/hangs out with Vic and Val. She has connections to the supernatural and likes using them on the brothers. She has a crush on Victor and takes every chance to be involved with whatever he is doing. ** Pineapple (voiced by Diego Molano): A large, lumbering, monosyllabic boy who is Charlene's brother. He acts as a stooge for her and, despite his intimidating appearance, is shown to like dancing and be sympathetic. * Julio \\"Don\\" Jalape√±o (voiced by Jason Hightower): The local mini-mart owner who gets occasionally caught up in Vic and Val's antics, and is well-versed in Mexican and Latin-American folklore and cryptids. He seems to be attracted to Grandma Chata and sweats a lot in her presence. * Xochi Jalape√±o (voiced by Cristina Vee): Don Jalape√±o's teenage daughter who tends to the supernatural plants in the back of the store. She can be intimidating and takes Salsa dancing. ==Episodes Broadcast == The show first broadcast on Cartoon Network in the U.S. and Latin America on March 30, 2019, part of the channel's 2018-2019 programming lineup. The show premiered on Cartoon Network UK on 26 August 2019. It then premiered on September 23 in Italy with episodes 1x7 and 1x12 and then officially premiered in October 7 with regular episodes. It also aired on Cartoon Network India on 1 November 2019. In October 2020, Cartoon Network commemorated Hispanic Heritage Month with an \\"ongoing content series that celebrates equality and individuality,\\" which was narrated by Sean-Ryan Petersen, who voices Valentino, and features a \\"variety of powerful youth activists.\\" In addition to this, fans were encouraged to stream Victor and Valentino episodes, and those of other series, in Spanish on the Cartoon Network App. == Reception == The series has been reviewed positively. Remezcla described it as show with Gravity Falls vibes and something that aims to give Latino kids an \\"entertaining look at the folktales and myths that populate the American continent.\\" Common Sense Media called the show a \\"comedy adventure series\\" based in a town which is a \\"setting for all kinds of supernatural oddities inspired by Latin American folklore.\\" Other reviewers concurred. The L.A. Times called the show a \\"supernatural action comedy,\\" and praised its \\"mix of Mexican visual motifs and Japanese anime conventions,\\" saying it makes for \\"something new, yet familiar.\\" Gizmodo described the show as the first series on Cartoon Network \\"starring a predominantly Hispanic cast\\" and praised the matter-of-fact, casual approach to \\"indigenous, Mesoamerican culture.\\" The reviewer further stated that the show has the space to do worldbuilding while \\"letting its supernatural elements sometimes take the backseat\\" and called it a \\"clever, good-hearted show.\\" In the same fashion, Collider stated that the animation is \\"a rare title that offers up something new,\\" that it welcomes \\"viewers of Mesoamerican backgrounds,\\" shares a lot with OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes, and is a series that is \\"fun and funny enough for kids\\" while offering stories \\"worth watching for audiences of any age.\\" Similarly, Deadline argued that the show gave off \\"some fun-filled\\" Steven Universe and Rick & Morty vibes. == Notes  References  * Category:2019 American television series debuts Category:2019 Mexican television series debuts Category:2010s American animated television series Category:2020s American animated television series Category:Animated television series about brothers Category:Cartoon Network original programming Category:Cartoon Network Studios series Category:English-language television shows Category:American children's animated adventure television series Category:American children's animated comedy television series Category:American children's animated drama television series Category:American children's animated mystery television series Category:Fictional Mexican people Category:American flash animated television series ","title":"Victor and Valentino"},{"id":"56795543","text":"The Reid Concert Hall is a small music venue in the city of Edinburgh, Scotland. It is located in the south-western corner of Bristo Square about south of the Royal Mile, and is part of the University of Edinburgh. Originally opened in 1859 as the Reid School of Music by the university's professor of music, John Donaldson (1789-1865), it was designed by the Scottish Architect David Cousin and is a Category A listed building. The hall is named after General John Reid, an army officer and musician who founded the Chair of Music (Reid Professor of Music) at the university. ==Performances== The Reid Hall is hosts a number of classical chamber music concerts throughout the year, mostly performed by students and academics. In its history a number of works by Kenneth Leighton were premiered at the Reid Hall. After the composer's death, the hall hosted a memorial concert performed by Wakefield Cathedral Choir. During the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Reid Hall is used as a performance venue called \\"The Cowbarn\\" by Underbelly. ==Architecture== The Reid School of Music is a tall, rectangular sandstone ashlar building, designed by David Cousin in an Italianate Neoclassical style. The exterior large sash windows are flanked by decorative shell-headed niches. The roof is surrounded with an ornate, dentilled cornice and heavy, bracketed eaves, below which is an inscription carved into the frieze, \\"\\". Steps lead up to the entrances, which are flanked by pairs of classical columns and topped with porticos. The interior consists mostly of a spacious concert hall, which is noted for its highly decorated neoclassical coffered tunnel vaulted ceiling. Against the east wall of the concert hall is a reproduction classical organ, which was built by J√ºrgen Ahrend in 1978. The wooden casing was designed by James Haig Marshall of Ian G Lindsay and Partners. The concert hall was designed to offer \\"dry\\" acoustics with low reverberation. By contrast, the neighbouring McEwan Hall opened in 1897 is a grand, colossal space with high reverberation. ==Music museum== When the Reid Hall was built, Professor John Donaldson (1789-1865) also added a museum gallery to display his private collection of old and unusual musical instruments. The Reid Hall is considered to be the oldest purpose-built musical museum in Europe. Today, the North Room houses the John Donaldson Collection of Musical Instruments, which, along with the Russell Collection, forms part of the Musical Instruments collection of the University of Edinburgh. == See also == * List of music museums *St Cecilia's Hall ==References * Category:Music venues in Edinburgh Category:Former churches in Scotland Category:Edinburgh Festival Fringe venues Category:Neoclassical architecture in Scotland Category:Buildings and structures of the University of Edinburgh Category:Italianate architecture in the United Kingdom Category:Museums in Edinburgh Category:Music museums in the United Kingdom Category:University museums in Scotland Category:1859 establishments in Scotland Category:Musical instrument museums in the United Kingdom Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1859 ","title":"Reid Concert Hall"},{"id":"56795557","text":"The Kliegle Garage in Goodwin, South Dakota, United States, was built in 1916.

In early 2016, the band met in Chicago, Illinois for a photo shoot as well as a music video shoot resulting in videos for the tracks New Leaf, Aflame, and Downtown. Currently New Leaf has been the only video released. === Recording === Recording of the band's debut album began in October 2015. Due to the fact that everyone in the band resides in different parts of the country, each member would self produce and record their parts at their respective home studios. Recording for the album was finished in the Summer of 2017. As of October 2017 the album, The Ultra Head Frequency, has been in the process of being mixed and mastered by Richard Easterling for a TBA 2018 release date. === Live === Although the full band has yet to make its live debut, Zen From Mars co-founders Stephen Shareaux and Drew Fortier began performing acoustic shows around the country with a setlist made up of material from Shareaux's former band Kik Tracee, Shareaux's solo album Golden as well as stripped down renditions of Zen From Mars songs. Some notable appearances include performing multiple sets at the grand opening of Megadeth bassist David Ellefson's Ellefson Coffee Co. in Jackson, Minnesota, as well as opening for Mark Slaughter's solo band at Dingbatz in Clifton, New Jersey, and performing a co-headlining set at Herman's Hideaway in Denver, Colorado with the now late ex-Faith No More vocalist Chuck Mosley, with whom Fortier was also guitarist for, and is currently doing a film on. === Releases === August 2016, while in the midst of recording, the band released a video snippet titled Who Is ZFM? hinting the identities of the band members. Days later the band was announced and a music video was released for a Matt Wallace mix of an early version of the track New Leaf. September 2016, a teaser of the song Aflame was released.

Its author says that Israel has assassinated more people than any other western country since World War II. It portrays the assassinations of British officials, Hamas, Hezbollah and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) leaders, and Iranian nuclear scientists. To write the book, Bergman carried out about a thousand interviews with political figures and secret agents and consulted \\"thousands\\" of documents. ==Synopsis== Rise and Kill First describes the targeted killings carried out by Israeli secret agencies and the personalities and the tactics used. The book's title is inspired by a statement in the Talmud: \\"If someone comes to kill you, rise up and kill him first\\". Based on a thousand interviews and thousands of documents, the book is the story of many political and intelligence figures such as agents of Mossad, Shin Bet, and the Israeli military, some of them speaking under their real identity. Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert, former Israeli prime ministers, and Meir Dagan, a recent head of Mossad for eight years, were among those interviewed. The book begins with the founding of Bar Giora in 1907 by Yitzhak Ben Zvi. The organization later became Hashomer, then the Haganah and finally the core of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). According to Bergman, Israeli covert agencies have undertaken targeted assassinations against \\"Arab adversaries throughout its pre- and post-statehood periods\\". They have assassinated more people than any western country since World War II, carrying out \\"at least\\" 2,700 assassination operations in the seventy-year period since Israel's formation. \\"Poisoned toothpaste that takes a month to end its target's life, armed drones, exploding mobile phones, spare tires with remote-controlled bombs, assassinating enemy scientists and discovering the secret lovers of Muslim clerics,\\" are among the methods described in the book used by Israel to carry out assassinations. Bergman discusses the assassination of British officials, Hamas, Hezbollah and PLO leaders, and Iranian nuclear scientists. According to the author, some of the assassinated individuals include: PLO leader Yasser Arafat; Ali Hassan Salameh, leader of Black September; Abu Jihad, Arafat's aide and co-founder of the Fatah party; Yahya Ayyash known as the \\"Engineer\\", Hamas' chief bomb maker; and Ahmed Bouchiki, a Moroccan waiter. Menachem Begin, Yitzak Shamir, Ariel Sharon, described by Bergman as a \\"pyromaniac\\", and Ehud Barak, each of whom would later lead the government of Israel, are named as assassins in Rise and Kill First. Bergman describes the details of operations carried out in Iran, Egypt, Syria and Germany. According to the book, Ariel Sharon mistakenly ordered Mossad shoot down a plane, carrying 30 wounded Palestinian children, survivors of the Sabra and Shatila massacre. The operation was cancelled \\"at the last moment\\" after it was reported that Arafat was not on board. He \\"even\\" consented to the downing of a commercial plane if it was carrying Arafat, Bergman says in his book. The book also recites secret favours carried out by the Mossad at the request of foreign governments and leaders, such as for king Hassan II of Morocco. ==Reception== According to Kenneth M. Pollack, a former CIA intelligence analyst, the book is \\"smart, thoughtful and balanced, and the English translation is superb\\", while it fails to \\"answer ... the problem of terrorism\\", and offers no end to it. Pollack describes the end of the book as showing targeted killing is like an addictive drug which just cures the \\"worst symptom (terrorism) of a terrible disease (Palestinian anger)\\" but does not cure the disease itself. The book is described by Ethan Bronner, a senior editor at Bloomberg News, as \\"the first comprehensive look at Israel's use of state-sponsored killings,\\" and as a \\"meticulously researched book\\" by Charles Glass, an author, journalist, broadcaster and publisher specialising in the Middle East. === Awards === * 2018: National Jewish Book Award in the History category ==Research== According to Bergman the Israeli secret services tried to intervene in his work, held a meeting in 2010 to disrupt his research and warned former Mossad employees against giving interviews to him. ==References== Category:2018 non-fiction books Category:Military operations of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict Category:Targeted killing ","title":"Rise and Kill First"},{"id":"56796226","text":"Yury Sharkov (born 29 November 1930) is a Soviet alpine skier.

After the students refused workers access to the central loudspeakers in the square, a broadcast station was set up in the BWAF headquarters near the western reviewing stand outside of Tiananmen. According to sociologists Andrew G.

Partially because of her booming and commanding voice, L√º became the voice for the union's public address system, reading documents submitted by ordinary workers, journalists, government office workers, and even Party cadres and soldiers. L√º read everything that was submitted including poems, manifestos, appeals for material support, song lyrics, open letters, announcements for demonstrations, and also told stories to inspire workers and bystanders. She also helped produce handbills and leaflets using a portable mimeograph, purchased books detailing Party corruption, visited nearby factories to try and rally workers to support the students, and acted as the spokesperson for the BWAF from May 26 to June 3.\\"ZhuƒÅnf«éng g≈çng z√¨ li√°n L«ö Jƒ´nghuƒÅ: W«í de shƒìngm√¨ng yƒ´n li√πs√¨ bi√†n d√© g√®ng y«íu y√¨y√¨/sh√¨p√≠n ‰∏ìËÆøÂ∑•Ëá™ËÅîÂêï‰∫¨Ëä±ÔºöÊàëÁöÑÁîüÂëΩÂõ†ÂÖ≠ÂõõÂèòÂæóÊõ¥ÊúâÊÑè‰πâ/ËßÜÈ¢ë [Interview with Ms. Lu Jinghua: My Life Became More Meaningful Because Of June 4th / Video],\\"Bowen Press, June 17, 2016.

In the aftermath of the crackdown, when many members of the BWAF were arrested, L√º spent several weeks absconding: first hiding in a friend's apartment, before fleeing to Hebei Province in the northeast, where her husband was working (her husband, Li Zhilang, would serve seven months in prison for sheltering her after the crackdown).Steven Lee Myers, \\"From Tiananmen Square to New York Sweatshops; One Woman's Fight to Better the Lot of Workers Under Communism and Capitalism,\\" The New York Times, March 9, 1992.

Eventually L√º reached Guangzhou. There, an underground railroad had been set up by Hong Kong activists and journalists, and, on August 23, she was able to slip across the border to safety in Hong Kong. In December 1989, five months after she applied for political asylum at the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong, she arrived in Los Angeles as a political refugee. == Life after Tiananmen == For a time she worked in a grocery store in Los Angeles, before moving to New York. Through her high-profile appearances and activism with human rights organizations, L√º came to the attention of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU), who hired her in 1990. She worked as an organizer and educator with the ILGWU until 1996 when the organization merged the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union to form the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees. In 1996, she switched to building computer systems; today she sells real estate. Since leaving China, Lu has campaigned extensively for workers rights and for democracy in China. In 1990, she met with US senators and the AFL-CIO to try and convince them to campaign for the release of Chinese workers, particularly those imprisoned in the aftermath of the Tiananmen protests.

Unveiled at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, it is the automaker's second car after the Rimac Concept One and is described as a significant technological leap, dubbed \\"a car alive with technology\\". The exterior was designed by the Croatian-born Austrian Adriano Mudri. Rimac plans to produce 150 vehicles and is currently in the process of homologation for the global market. The first deliveries are expected to take place in 2020. The C_Two was sold out almost three weeks after its launch. The C Two is manufactured in the same factory and at the same rate (of roughly 1 per week) as the Pininfarina Battista, which is based on the same platform. ==Production history== During the global homologation process, the company constructed 4 prototypes for different testing purposes. In June 2020, Rimac opened a new facility in Veliko Trgovi≈°ƒáe which will serve as assembly for C_Two homologation prototypes as well as future production vehicles for customers. At full capacity, the facility should produce 4 vehicles per month and currently plans to produce an additional 13 prototype vehicles by the end of 2020. The delivery of production cars to customers was initially planned in 2020, but was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Features and specifications== Rear view (production version shown at Salon Priv√© at Blenheim Palace) With an alleged top speed of and a power output of , the car is claimed to be capable of accelerating to from a standstill in 1.85 seconds, making it potentially one of the fastest accelerating cars ever made. While also advertising a maximum range of on the NEDC cycle, the car is also claimed to be able to complete two consecutive laps of the N√ºrburgring with a negligible drop in performance. Rimac claims the car was designed to be very durable and could be driven hard. In addition to this, the car is technologically capable of Level 4 of autonomous driving with full Advanced driver-assistance systems, and is unlocked using face recognition technology. If connected to a fast charger, it can be recharged to 80% in less than 30 minutes. The car features an entirely new design and does away with the conventional doors, now incorporating butterfly doors instead.

M√©li√®s's adaptation expanded and altered the Charles Perrault version of the story to allow for additional comedy and detail, as well as a happier ending than Perrault provided. In the film, Red Riding Hood is a high-spirited, adventurous daughter in a family of bakers in the French countryside, nearly eaten by a wolf during her journey to take a galette to her grandmother. Red Riding Hood is rescued by the bakery staff just in time, the wolf meets his end during a dramatic chase, and all return home victorious. The film was distributed internationally, including in its native France by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company, in Britain by the Warwick Trading Company, and in the United States‚Äîwithout permission from or credit to M√©li√®s‚Äîby the Edison Manufacturing Company. The film is presently presumed lost. ==Plot== In a bakery in the French countryside, Father Latourte, his wife, and their staff are busy with customers, pastries, and baked goods of all kinds. The Latourtes' young daughter, called Red Riding Hood, reads by the firelight until her parents leave for a moment. She starts to play boisterously, getting the bakery staff mixed up in hijinks and pratfalls. Her father and mother return, chagrined by her escapades, and she is told to take a pot of butter and a galette to her grandmother's cottage. Red Riding Hood travels through the forest on her errand, meeting a wolf, who finds out where she is going. Encountering her friends from the village school, she happily pauses her journey to play and dance with them. Meanwhile, at a windmill near the cottage, the miller Sans-Souci has comic trouble with his mule. The wolf arrives at the cottage, has a spirited fight with the grandmother, swallows her, puts on her clothes, and waits in her bed. Red Riding Hood arrives, and in silent-film pantomime the famous dialogue (\\"Goodness, what big eyes you have!\\", \\"The better to see you with\\", etc.) takes place. The wolf is about to pounce on Red Riding Hood when the staff of the bakery, in search of the missing child, bursts into the cottage. Pandemonium breaks out as the wolf is chased all around the cottage and finally, with a shatter of glass, out a closed window. The bakers follow him through the forest, with country folk joining in the chase as it goes on. As the wolf crosses a bridge over a rocky gorge and a torrent, he is shot by a garde champ√™tre. The wolf has an over- the-top death scene, somersaulting and tumbling, until the bridge breaks and sends him into the torrent. The wolf's body is pulled out of the river and carried off on a stretcher. In the village square, a f√™te is in progress. Red Riding Hood's rescue procession comes back just in time to watch the great parade of village worthies, peasants, and schoolchildren through the square. The wolf's body is ceremoniously put on a spit and roasted. A spectacular apotheosis shows Red Riding Hood, in the pose of Saint Michael Fighting the Dragon, skewering her enemy on a pedestal of enormous galettes and butter pots, surrounded by baking and cooking implements. ==Production and release== M√©li√®s based Red Riding Hood on Charles Perrault's version of the story, expanding it with comedy and \\"picturesque episodes,\\" and altering the plot to allow for a happy ending (in Perrault's telling, the heroine is eaten by the wolf). In the catalogue description of the film, M√©li√®s emphasized the comic and \\"picturesque\\" (pittoresque) nature of the adaptation, highlighting an onscreen scene change from the outside to the inside of the grandmother's cottage as a \\"beautiful stage machinery effect\\" (joli effet de machinerie th√©√¢trale). The film was released by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 337‚Äì344 in its catalogues, where it was advertised as a \\"spectacular f√©erie play in twelve tableaux\\" (pi√®ce f√©erique √† grand spectacle en 12 tableaux). The Warwick Trading Company handled distribution in Britain, where the film could be purchased either in black-and-white (for 18) or with hand colouring applied (for 36). To anglicize the film for British audiences, Warwick's publicity renamed Father Latourte to Mr Plumcake. The Edison Manufacturing Company, taking advantage of what was then permissible under international copyright law, made its own prints of M√©li√®s's film and sold them in the United States without M√©li√®s's permission, claiming the film to be one of their productions. Red Riding Hood is currently presumed lost. ==References * Category:Films directed by Georges M√©li√®s Category:French films Category:French silent short films Category:French black-and-white films Category:Lost French films Category:Films based on Little Red Riding Hood ","title":"Red Riding Hood (1901 film)"},{"id":"56796284","text":"Oopik Pitsuilak is an Inuk carver and sculptor who works in the Cape Dorset community of Inuit artists in Canada. == Early life == She was born in Lake Harbour, Northwest Territories, now Kimmirut, Nunavut, in 1946.

He was deputy leader of the Westminster City Council, and chairman of its planning committee for 17 years. He served as Lord Mayor of Westminster 1996-1997 and also chaired the London Mayors' Association between 1998 and 2016. ==Early life== Robert Davis was born on 27 September 1957. He is the son of Gerald Davis (died 2000) and Pamela Davis n√©e Lee (died 1997). He was educated at Christ's College, Finchley, followed by Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge and Wolfson College, Cambridge, after which he trained as a solicitor at the College of Law in London's Lancaster Gate. He was admitted as a solicitor in October 1983. From 1985 to 2015, Davis was a partner (now a consultant) in solicitors' firm Freeman Box, Bentinck Street, Marylebone, London, specialising in property law. ==Political career== Davis was first elected to Westminster City Council in 1982 for the Bayswater ward, before representing neighbouring Lancaster Gate from 1986 onwards. From 1996 to 1997, he was the then youngest Lord Mayor of Westminster. During his year of office, he participated in a number of events with Nelson Mandela during his state visit to the UK in July 1996. Between 2003 and 2018, Davis served on a rota basis as one of a number of Lord Mayor Locum Tenens (deputising for the Lord Mayor). He was deputy leader of the council from May 2008 until March 2018. In addition, he served as Cabinet Member for the Built Environment (with responsibility for planning, major infrastructure projects and special events) from 2002 to 2017, and Chaired the Council's principal Planning Committee for seventeen years, from 2000 to 2017. Davis also served as Cabinet Member for Business, Culture and Heritage between January 2017 and March 2018. Prior to this, he created West End Live in 2005, which has become an annual theatrical event. It originally took place in Leicester Square, but is now staged in Trafalgar Square each June, comprising fully costumed extracts from all the current West End musicals. Davis produced the event and raised all the monies necessary until he retired as a Cabinet Member in 2018. As Cabinet Member for large infrastructure projects, he initiated and led on the project to make Baker Street and Gloucester Place two way, the public realm improvements to Bond Street and Hanover Square, and the public realm project around the Aldwych. He also oversaw the ¬£21m rejuvenation of Leicester Square, and the regeneration of Piccadilly and Marble Arch. As chairman of the council's principal planning committee, he was instrumental in persuading the developers of a site in Victoria to include a theatre in their development ‚Äì now known as the The Other Palace ‚Äì and in persuading Derwent London to build a new 650-seat theatre in Charing Cross Road (now under construction and due for completion in 2022, it is currently known as the \\"Nimax\\"). As Cabinet Member for Planning he introduced and led on the Council's \\"Design Excellence\\" campaign to improve the quality of architecture in Westminster. He also conceived the idea of \\"the City of Sculpture\\" Festival which persuaded sculptors and galleries to place large art work and sculptures throughout the City of Westminster, including down Park Lane and at Marble Arch. In 2017, Davis had the idea of a temporary theatre at Marble Arch and co-produced the musical Five Guys Named Moe at the theatre with Underbelly. He was also responsible for the Council's Green plaque scheme commemorating famous people and events, and their association with Westminster properties. Davis chaired the Westminster World Heritage Site Board between 2015 and 2018. In July 2014, he was invited by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to become a member of an advisory committee established by the Government to support the erection of a statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Trafalgar Square. In March 2018, following criticism of \\"the large scale of gifts and hospitality\\" received by Davis from property developers, he resigned as Deputy Leader of the Council and as a Cabinet Member to allow an internal independent inquiry to investigate the issues at his own request. He subsequently resigned from the Council in October 2018. At the time of his resignation, he was the borough's longest currently serving councillor, with a tenure lasting over 36 years. He was also the longest-serving Westminster councillor since the borough's formation in 1965. ===Allegations=== On 7 March 2018, Davis stood down as deputy leader and as a cabinet member after The Guardian reported into him having received hospitality and gifts over 500 times between 2012 and 2017, much of it from property developers, during the period when he was Chairman of the Planning Committee. Davis enjoyed hospitality from leading property developers, including Gerald Ronson, Sir Stuart Lipton, Brian Bickell and Sir George Iacobescu. Council rules require that any gifts or hospitality valued at ¬£25 or more must be declared, and Davis's register included trips to Switzerland, France, the US, and Scotland's Gleneagles Hotel and golf resort. At Davis's request, Westminster's legal director investigated whether Davis had breached the council's code of conduct. The investigation was assisted by independent barrister James Goudie QC. It reported in October 2018, with Sir Stephen Lamport, who was independently overseeing the investigation, finding that Davis had \\"breached the code of conduct\\" whilst a councillor, and that his \\"acceptance of gifts and hospitality from developers before or after a planning decision may ... have placed him in a position in which people might seek to influence him in the performance of his duties.\\" Lamport stated that there was no evidence of any inappropriate conduct or illegality, but the scale of the hospitality received by Davis was \\"extraordinary\\". Davis's official declarations revealed that he was the recipient of tickets to West End shows and invitations to what were described by The Guardian as \\"exclusive dinners in London's finest restaurants\\", as well as trips to the south of France. On one day in Mallorca, he managed two lunch meetings: the first at the home of theatrical impresario and Conservative peer Andrew Lloyd Webber, and the second at the home of the Earl of Chichester. The number of times Davis received hospitality or gifts was in fact 893 ‚Äì higher than had earlier been reported by the same newspaper. From the beginning of 2015, he was entertained by and received gifts from figures in the property industry over 150 times, which made such occurrences nearly weekly. The Guardian found that Davis received gifts or hospitality from property companies who were involved in half of the planning applications which his committee ruled on in 2016. According to Lamport, the high level of gifts and hospitality accepted by Davis \\"lay open his reputation, and therefore that of the Council, to a perception ‚Äì fairly or unfairly ‚Äì that called into question his personal responsibility to promote high standards of conduct\\". In his resignation statement, Davis said: \\"An inquiry has been completed by the council. They have confirmed that none of the declarations I made or hospitality I received influenced decisions I took as a councillor and that nothing I did was unlawful. However, they have concluded my actions nevertheless created a perception that was negative to the council. While I dispute this, I wish to draw a line under the matter. It is now time for me to move on to the next stage in my life and for the next generation of councillors to lead Westminster.\\" == Other interests== Between 1997 and 2016, Davis chaired the London Mayors' Association, an organisation comprising the current and former mayors of the 33 London Boroughs, which was originally founded in 1901. Davis turned the then moribund LMA into a successful and widely-recognised group. He was a director and trustee of the Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park from 1986 to 2019, and Chairman of the Board between 2009 and 2019, during which time the venue won several theatrical awards, including Oliviers. Together with his fellow Councillor Lady Flight, and other colleagues, he founded the Sir Simon Milton Foundation, a registered charity which was established after the death of Davis's partner Sir Simon Milton (lately Leader of Westminster Council, Chairman of the Local Government Association and Deputy Mayor of London and Chief of Staff to Boris Johnson as Mayor of London until Milton's death in 2011). The purpose of the charity was to continue to support Simon's priorities to address loneliness and isolation among older persons and to support young people into work through supporting their educational needs. The Foundation now runs Silver Sunday, a day held every October to support older people in meeting others by attending one of over 1,200 events throughout the country. The Foundation has also sponsored the establishment of the Sir Simon Milton Westminster University Technical College in Pimlico, and has distributed a number of bursaries and grants to students in financial need, including at Davis and Milton's own Cambridge College, Gonvile & Caius. Davis is currently Deputy Chairman of the Foundation. Davis is a trustee of the Savoy Educational Trust, a charity established by the Directors of the Savoy Hotel, which provides financial assistance to hospitality colleges and schools. [25] He is also a trustee of Mousetrap Theatre Projects, a charity that helps young people, including those with disabilities, to be able to go to West End theatre shows at a low cost. [26] In 2007, Davis helped establish the Westminster Guide Lecturers' Association, which awards authorised green badges to tour guides expert in the history of the City of Westminster who have passed an exam. Davis was its first Honorary President between 2007 and 2017. He has been the International Goodwill Ambassador of the London New Year's Day Parade since 1998, and between 2003 and 2018 organised the Westminster Council entry in the Parade, winning the Best Borough Entry seven times. He also served on the Board of the New West End Company (the Business Improvement District for Oxford Street, Regent's Street and Bond Street) between 2000 and 2011, and again between 2017 and 2018. ==Honours and Awards== Davis is a Deputy Lieutenant for Greater London. In 2015, he was awarded an MBE for services to local government and planning. ==Personal life== His long- term partner (until his death in 2011) was Sir Simon Milton, who had been leader of Westminster City Council and Deputy Mayor of London to Boris Johnson. In 2007, they entered into a civil partnership at London's Ritz Hotel. ==References *The Guardian: Full list of Westminster councillor Robert Davis's 514 freebies Category:Living people Category:Alumni of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge Category:Conservative Party (UK) councillors Category:Councillors in the City of Westminster Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Greater London Category:Gay politicians Category:LGBT politicians from England Category:British solicitors Category:Alumni of Wolfson College, Cambridge Category:1957 births Category:People educated at Christ's College, Finchley ","title":"Robert Davis (British politician)"},{"id":"56796335","text":"Tom Woodruff Jr. (born January 21, 1959) is an American actor, director, producer and special effects supervisor.

The exhibition was a surprise success for the British Museum, which extended its run, despite the fact that it had struggled to attract sponsorship. Ice Age art attracted large visitor numbers and good reviews. Cook used art by Picasso, Degas, Mondrian, and Matisse, as well as work by modern artists such as Ghislaine Howard in combination with Ice Age artefacts to examine the development of western art. Ice Age art was transformed into a new exhibition called Art in the age of Altamira at the Fundaci√≥n Bot√≠n, Santander in late 2013. ===The Lampedusa Cross=== The Lampedusa Cross was acquired by Cook for the British Museum in 2015.

It was the first-ever meeting between leaders of North Korea and the United States. They signed a joint statement, agreeing to security guarantees for North Korea, new peaceful relations, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, recovery of soldiers' remains, and follow-up negotiations between high-level officials. Both leaders also met separately with Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Immediately following the summit, President Trump announced that the U.S. military would discontinue \\"provocative\\" joint military exercises with South Korea, and stated that he wished to bring the U.S. soldiers back home at some point, but he reinforced that it was not part of the Singapore equation. On August 1, 2018, the U.S. Senate passed the military budget bill for 2019, forbidding funding the reduction of active USFK personnel below 22,000; significant removal of US forces is considered a non-negotiable item in denuclearization talks with the North. After a period of heightened conflict that included North Korea successfully testing what it claims was its first hydrogen bomb and the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in late 2017, tensions began to de-escalate after Kim Jong-un announced his desire to send athletes to the 2018 Winter Olympics being held in South Korea. During the games, Kim proposed talks with South Korea to plan an inter-Korean summit. On March 8, the South Korean delegation returned from the talks and traveled to the United States to deliver an invitation by Kim Jong-un to Donald Trump for a meeting. High-level exchanges between the two sides then took place, including a visit by then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo to Pyongyang and a visit by Kim Yong-chol, Vice Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea, to the White House. Both sides threatened to cancel the summit after a round of joint military exercises by the U.S. and South Korea, with Trump even delivering a formal letter to Kim to call off the meeting; however, the two sides eventually agreed to meet. A second meeting was held between Trump and Kim in February 2019 in Hanoi, Vietnam. ==Background== USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group and South Korean Navy vessels having a joint exercise on May 3, 2017 Korea has been divided since 1945. The Korean War of 1950‚Äì1953 ended with an armistice agreement but not a peace settlement. A sporadic conflict has continued, with American troops remaining in the South as part of a mutual defense treaty. The North began building a nuclear reactor in 1963, and it began a nuclear weapons program in the 1980s. North Korea first committed to denuclearization in 1992 in the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. In a speech authored by David Frum, President George W. Bush referred to North Korea as part of an \\"axis of evil\\" during his 2002 State of the Union address, but in the 2005 Joint Statement of the Fourth Round of the Six-Party Talks, North Korea reaffirmed the 1992 Joint Declaration and the goal of verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. In 2008, North Korea voluntarily gave information on its nuclear program in exchange for sanction relief, and they were taken off the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. Despite this, nuclear inspectors were barred from surveying any North Korean weapons facilities. The Obama administration had a policy of \\"strategic patience\\", in which perceived North Korean provocations would not be \\"rewarded\\" with presidential attention or the sending of high- level envoys but instead be punished with sanctions and greater military coordination with South Korea and Japan. More nuclear tests were conducted in the succeeding years, and the 2010 bombardment of Yeonpyeong markedly raised tensions between North Korea and South Korea. The escalation of North Korea's nuclear program advanced particularly under the rule of Kim Jong-un, who became the leader in December 2011, after his father Kim Jong-il died. Donald Trump was elected US President in 2016 with a position of opposition to Barack Obama's policy of \\"strategic patience\\" towards North Korea. While advocating a tough stance, he also expressed openness to dialogue, saying he would be prepared to \\"eat a hamburger\\" with Kim. He put himself at odds with military allies, saying that it would be better if South Korea and Japan protect themselves. In return, a pro-North Korean website, DPRK Today, described him as a \\"wise politician\\". The editorial suggested that Trump might make the slogan \\"Yankee go home\\" a reality. In 2017, Moon Jae-in was elected President of South Korea with a promise to return to the Sunshine Policy of friendly relations with the North. Artist's conception of the Hwasong-15 on its mobile launch vehicle, depicted to scale During a period of heightened tensions with the United States, North Korea successfully tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), named Hwasong-14, in July 2017. In response to heightened North Korean rhetoric, Trump warned that any North Korean attack \\"will be met with fire, fury and frankly power, the likes of which the world has never seen before\\". In response, North Korea announced that it was considering a missile test in which the missiles would land near the US territory of Guam. North Korea tested what some sources argued may have been its first hydrogen bomb on September 3. The test was internationally condemned, and further economic sanctions were put on North Korea. The United States also added North Korea back to its State Sponsors of Terrorism list after nine years. On November 28, North Korea launched the Hwasong-15, which, according to analysts, would be capable of reaching anywhere in the United States. The United Nations responded by placing further sanctions on the country. After North Korea claimed that the missile was capable of \\"carrying [a] super-heavy [nuclear] warhead and hitting the whole mainland of the U.S.\\", Kim-Jong-Un announced that they had \\"finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force\\", putting them in a position of strength to push the United States into talks. Moon Jae-in (standing, lower left) with the North Korean representatives (upper right) and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence (lower right) at the PyeongChang Olympics In his New Year address for 2018, North Korean chairman Kim Jong-un celebrated completing their nuclear capabilities and proposed talks for sending a delegation to the upcoming Winter Olympics in South Korea. In January a false missile alert alarmed Hawaii. The Seoul‚ÄìPyongyang hotline was reopened after almost two years. North Korea sent an unprecedented high-level delegation, headed by Kim Yo-jong, sister of Kim Jong-un, and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly Kim Yong-nam, and including performers like the Samjiyon Orchestra. The delegation passed on an invitation to President Moon to visit North Korea. The United States was represented by Vice President Mike Pence. After arriving late to a dinner hosted by President Moon, he was asked to greet the other dignitaries, but he shook hands with everyone except Kim Yong-nam and left early. North and South Korean athletes marched together in the Olympics opening ceremony and fielded a united women's ice hockey team. ==Announcement== Chung Eui-yong (left), the South Korean national security chief, and Kim Jong-un meeting in Pyongyang on March 5, 2018.

On March 5, 2018, South Korea's special delegation agreed to hold the third inter- Korean summit at Inter-Korean Peace House in Panmunjom on April 27, 2018. On March 6, after returning to South Korea, the national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, and National Information Director Suh Hoon traveled to the United States on March 8 to report to Trump about the upcoming inter-Korean summit and relayed to President Trump the North Korean chairman Kim Jong-un's invitation.

ROK President Moon Jae-in and US President Donald Trump, November 2017 The White House announced that the UN Sanctions would remain in place until an agreement between the United States and North Korea is reached. On March 6, Sarah Sanders said that the White House would need to see \\"concrete and verifiable steps\\" toward the denuclearization of North Korea before Trump would meet with Kim Jong-un. Later that day, an unidentified Trump official told The Wall Street Journal that Trump had still accepted Kim Jong-un's invitation. South Korea's national security adviser Chung Eui-yong visited China on March 12 to meet with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, of the foreign officials and report on the planned inter-Korean summit as well as the North Korea-United States summit and asked their advice.

National Information Director Suh Hoon visited Japan and had a consultation with Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe including the foreign officials about the denuclearization and Permanent Peace on the Korean Peninsula. ==PreparationsPreparatory talks=== South Korea's foreign ministry announced on March 18 that selected informal delegations from North Korea, South Korea, and the US would meet for denuclearization discussions in April in Vantaa, Finland. (This type of discussions, as held previously, had sometimes been referred to as track-2 talks.) According to South Korea's Yonhap news, Choe Kang-il, a deputy director general for North American affairs at North Korea's foreign ministry, would also attend the event, which Yonhap termed \\"track-1.5 talks\\". ===Kim Jong-un's meeting with Xi Jinping=== North Korea's supreme leader Kim was in Beijing on March 25‚Äì28, 2018, arriving by special train for talks with China's paramount leader Xi Jinping, Kim's first known out-of-country excursion since taking power six years previously. China stated that North Korea was \\"committed to denuclearization\\" and willing to hold a summit with the United States. It was organized by the invitation of Xi. During the meeting between two leaders, Kim officially invited Xi to the North Korean capital Pyongyang when it was convenient in his schedule, and Xi accepted the invitation. Xi urged Kim to strengthen the strategic and diplomatic future partnership between China and North Korea. Kim stressed to Xi that North Korea and China are communist countries and that there are many ways to cooperate in various aspects in the future. Kim and Xi met again on May 7, 2018, in the city of Dalian, China. === Announcement within North Korea === According to North Korea's state media Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), Kim led a meeting of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea's political bureau on April 9, 2018, where he spoke about the planned summit with Trump for the first time. === Proposed conditions by North Korea === On April 11, North Korea presented five entreaties as conditions for the dismissal of their nuclear-capable ICBMs: # Ensuring the United States and South Korea do not locate nuclear weapons strategic assets within the vicinity of the Korean Peninsula # Ceasing development or operation of strategic nuclear assets during USFK‚ÄìROK combined military training # Ensuring the United States will not attack North Korea with conventional or nuclear weapons # Converting the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement into a peace treaty on the Korean Peninsula # Establishing official diplomatic ties between North Korea and the United States. Although North Korea was previously expected to request the withdrawal of United States Forces Korea (USFK) from South Korea, North Korea publicized they would embrace the continuous deployment of 25,000 USFK troops in South Korea as long as the security of North Korea is guaranteed. ===April 2018 inter-Korean summit=== Kim and President of South Korea Moon Jae-in shake hands in greeting, in an initiating gesture for the April 2018 inter-Korean summit. At an inter-Korean summit on April 27, 2018, held at the Peace House in Panmunjom, the leaders of North and South Korea agreed to formally end the Korean War before the end of the year and confirmed the goal of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula through denuclearization. === Release of the American detainees=== President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump welcome home three American returnees from North Korea. On May 10, 2018, three Americans held by North Korea were released following negotiations between the Trump administration and the North Korean regime. Some have speculated that their release was part of an attempt of the regime to motivate the US to continue the negotiations and perhaps ease the pressure upon the North Koreans. Nevertheless, their release has managed to ease the tensions between the Trump administration and the North Korean regime, enabling both sides to proceed to further negotiations, possibly leading to the 2018 North Korea‚ÄìUnited States summit. The three Americans Kim Dong-chul, Kim Sang-duk, and Kim Hak-song left North Korea accompanied by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and were greeted by the president and the first lady upon their landing on US soil at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. ===Tensions, cancelation, and reinstatement=== A commemorative coin released on May 21 by the White House Communications Agency for the summit Letter sent to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un by US President Donald Trump informing Kim of the cancellation of the summit American Vice President Mike Pence said on May 21, 2018, that \\"this will only end like the Libyan model ended if Kim Jong-un doesn't make a deal\\" to \\"dismantle his nuclear weapons program\\". Trump had made similar remarks on May 17, as he described that Libya's fate is \\"what will take place if we don't make a deal\\". These comments were in reference to the killing of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi after military intervention by Americans and Europeans in 2011. After a NATO airstrike prevented Gaddafi's escape, the Libyan rebels captured, assaulted, sodomized, and executed Gaddafi. However, Libya under Gaddafi had already in 2003 voluntarily ended its nuclear weapons program and complied with conditions set by Western powers. As a result, North Korean vice foreign minister Choe Son-hui called Pence's remarks \\"ignorant and stupid\\" and threatened a \\"nuclear-to-nuclear showdown\\". Trump canceled the summit on May 24, 2018, via a letter to Chairman Kim, writing that \\"based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting ... You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used.\\" Even though it was Trump who decided to cancel, Trump told Kim, \\"If you change your mind having to do with this most important summit, please do not hesitate to call me or write.\\" South Korean President Moon was left \\"very perplexed\\" by Trump's cancellation, while the South Korean minister in charge of inter-Korean affairs Cho Myoung-gyon said that North Korea \\"remains sincere\\" on \\"efforts on denuclearization and peace building\\". In response to Trump's cancellation, North Korean vice foreign minister Kim Kye-gwan expressed his country's \\"willingness to sit down face-to-face with the US and resolve issues anytime and in any format\\", being \\"open-minded in giving time and opportunity to the US\\" for the \\"peace and stability for the world and the Korean Peninsula\\". Trump's cancellation had come on the day North Korea had detonated explosives at its only known nuclear test site, at Punggye-ri in front of international journalists; North Korea claimed that this would have demolished the test site. On May 25, however, Trump announced that the summit could resume as scheduled following a \\"very nice statement\\" he received from North Korea and that talks were now resuming. The following day, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed in a statement that a \\"pre-advance team for Singapore will leave as scheduled in order to prepare the summit should take place\\". The team, consisting of about thirty staffers from both the White House and State Department, met with North Korean counterparts over Memorial Day weekend. Kim Yong-chol met with Pompeo on May 30, and with Trump on June 1. On May 30, North Korean general Kim Yong- chol arrived in New York City to meet with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Negotiations between Kim and Pompeo continued the next day, and Pompeo later stated at a press conference that \\"good progress\\" had been made. Kim Yong- chol, who is the Vice Chair of Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, is the highest-ranking North Korean official to visit the US since 2000 (when Jo Myong-rok met with US President Bill Clinton in Washington, D.C.). On June 1, Trump announced the summit would resume as scheduled for June 12 after he met Kim Yong-chol at the White House. Kim Yong-chol delivered a letter from Kim Jong-un to Trump, of which Trump first told reporters that it was \\"a very nice\\" and \\"a very interesting letter\\", yet eight minutes later said \\"I haven't seen the letter yet. I purposely didn't open the letter\\". === US‚ÄìSouth Korea summit === Moon Jae-in met with Trump on May 22. On May 22, 2018, South Korea President Moon Jae-in visited the United States to meet President Trump, to promote Trump-Kim summit progress, and to coordinate the two countries' common strategy regarding the upcoming summit, following harsh rhetoric from North Korea towards Washington. === Closure of Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site === North Korea shut down its Punggye-ri nuclear test site on 23 May (Thursday) to demonstrate its commitment to denuclearization. On 12 May 2018, North Korea announced the closure and planned dismantlement of its Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site, and invited journalists to witness the destruction of its tunnels and other testing infrastructure. On 24 May 2018, reporters witnessed explosions to purportedly close those tunnels, although independent inspectors were not present.North Korea nuclear test tunnels at Punggye-ri 'destroyed' , BBC News, 24 May 2018. Those explosions destroyed the portals to several test tunnels, but the extent of the damage to the tunnels themselves was not clear.The Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site Destroyed: A Good Start but New Questions Raised about Irreversibility , 38 North, 31 May 2018More Potential Questions About the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site Destruction , 38 North, 8 June 2018.Institute Statement on the Dismantlement of Punggye-ri , David Albright, Institute for Science and International Security, 25 May 2018. === Replacement of North Korean generals === On June 3, North Korea's Chairman Kim Jong-un replaced three generals of highest military officers who are responsible for the development of North Korea's ICBM nuclear weapons. === May 2018 inter-Korean summit === Two leaders of North and South Koreas exchanged their opinions about the issues and solutions for the Trump-Kim summit as Trump abruptly cancelled the upcoming US-North Korea summit on 12 June. The principal agenda of the meeting was trying to get U.S. summit back on track and keep progressing the denuclearization talks. The second 2018 summit was established by Kim Jung-un's suggestion within a whirlwind 24 hour notice, but Moon Jae-in accepted Kim's invitation as per the critical nuclear agenda between North and South Korea. Moon Jae-in had expressed his belief, and he discussed with Kim Jong Un about Kim's willingness to join nuclear interventions with Trump. Both leaders also agreed to accelerate the implementation of the Panmunjom Declaration and meet again at \\"anytime and anyplace\\" without formality. ===Potential denuclearization process=== During President Donald Trump's meeting with North Korea envoy, the former spy chief Kim Yong-chol at the White House, Trump said that he would choose the \\"denuclearization process\\" in North Korea. The nuclear warheads and the ICBM nuclear missiles completed in North Korea could be transferred outside of North Korea and economic sanctions on North Korea could be partly alleviated. The next step would be comprehensive inspections on North Korea's nuclear facilities and nuclear ICBM weapons program by IAEA. On July 7, 2018, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono and South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung Wha met in Tokyo, where they reaffirmed their unity in urging North Korea to denuclearize as promised. The ministers stressed the need to call on North Korea to take concrete steps toward denuclearization and to keep existing U.N. economic sanctions in place. Ten days later, Donald Trump said there is \\"no time limit\\" for North Korea to denuclearize and that there is no need to rush the process. ===Logistical preparations=== On June 3, a \\"special event area\\" was declared by the Ministry of Home Affairs around the area surrounding the Shangri-La Hotel Singapore and stringent security measures will be in force from June 10‚Äì14. On the same day, a smaller segment within the \\"special event area\\" was declared a \\"special zone\\" by the Singapore Police Force where enhanced police powers will be in effect during the same period. On June 5, the Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore) declared the whole of Sentosa Island, including waters off its south-west beaches, a \\"special event area\\" from June 10‚Äì14. The summit venue Capella Singapore sits on the \\"special event area\\". The government also issued an order exempting four bulletproof and bombproof vehicles from certain traffic rules for the purposes of conveying \\"non-citizen\\" individuals for the summit from June 5‚Äì30. The F1 Pit Building has also been designated as the summit's International Media Centre for international journalists to cover the summit and will be operated from 10 am on June 10 to 10 pm on June 13. On June 6, Singapore's aviation authorities announced that temporary airspace restrictions will be put in place for parts of June 11, 12 and 13. Aircraft arriving at Singapore Changi Airport will be required to reduce speed and some restrictions are placed on runway use. Aviators are also informed to stay away from Paya Lebar Air Base, a facility used by US Presidents on their previous visits to Singapore. The Singapore Mint also released three commemorative medallions to mark the summit. They are available in gold proof, silver proof, and nickel plated zinc proof. On June 9, the Singapore Police Force and the Land Transport Authority announced that security measures, such as road closures and security checks, will kick in. Some bus stops in the Tanglin area will be skipped and security checks will be conducted along stretches of roads around the Shangri-La Hotel Singapore and the St Regis Hotel Singapore, the two hotels Trump and Kim are believed to be staying in. Bag searches and other security checks may be conducted for visitors entering Sentosa Island. On June 11, Singapore's Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan announced that the Singapore government would be paying for the North Korean contingent's hotel bill, forming part of the total US$20 million expenditure for the summit, as it was \\"hospitality that we would have offered them\\". On June 25, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) announced that the summit cost S$16.3 million, lower than the initial planned cost mentioned by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. ===Diplomatic preparations=== In preparation for the summit, Singapore's Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan visited the United States on a working visit and met with the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor John R. Bolton. He visited North Korea and met with North Korea's Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly Kim Yong-nam to further lay the groundwork for the Trump-Kim summit. The United States did not convene a Cabinet-level National Security Council meeting to discuss the summit with North Korea. Trump said: \\"I think I'm very well prepared ... I don't think I have to prepare very much ... this isn't a question of preparation, it's a question of whether or not people want it to happen, and we'll know that very quickly.\\" ===Media center=== Logo used at the International Media Centre Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong visited the summit's International Media Centre on June 10 when it opened. At a media conference, Lee mentioned that the summit cost S$20 million, with security costs taking up S$10 million and the setting up of the International Media Centre costing S$5 million, but it is a cost that Singapore is \\"willing to pay\\". The media center opened to journalists and they were given customized items, including a bottle of water, a fan, and a notebook. The center hosted more than 2500 local and international journalists. ==Meeting locationBackground=== U.S. Secretary of State (then CIA Director) Mike Pompeo and Kim Jong-un meeting in Pyongyang, North Korea on March 31, 2018 On March 31 and possibly also April 1, then-CIA director Mike Pompeo had secretly met with Kim in Pyongyang to lay the groundwork for the summit, including their discussing possible venues. On April 17, on the day of a meeting at Mar-a-Lago of Trump with Prime Minister of Japan Shinz≈ç Abe, sources revealed to reporters the identities involved in the discussions in Pyongyang. ===Locations considered=== Trump administration sources said on April 28 that the meeting would be held in either Singapore or Mongolia. On April 30, Trump remarked on a possibility the Peace House and inter-Korean House of Freedom (Joint Security Area) in Panmunjom would serve as venues. Trump believed that Panmunjom in DMZ would be the reasonable location for the meeting to remove nuclear weapons and to sign the preparatory peace treaty on the Korean peninsula. The inter-Korean Peace House was where the 2018 inter-Korean summit was held earlier in April. Singapore was the site of a recent China-Taiwan summit. Mongolia has sponsored a number of talks in recent years involving regional and international players and is accessible by train from North Korea. On April 30, Trump confirmed that Singapore, the Peace House and the inter-Korean House of Freedom were under consideration. American officials said the most likely mutually-agreed-upon choice of venue would be in Southeast Asia or Europe, especially from among the choices of Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, Switzerland (where Kim and his two siblings had some schooling), or Sweden (whose embassy acts as intermediary for Americans traveling in North Korea). Another possible location of the summit would be Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Additionally proposed venues included Pyongyang, North Korea (favored by Kim); the Inter-Korean Peace House in Panmunjom near the boundary of the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea (site for the April 27, 2018 inter-Korean summit; a site possibly favored by Kim for the summit with the US as well); the Russian port city of Vladivostok (accessible to Kim by land or sea and nearby Vyatskoye, Kim's predecessor and father Kim Jong-il's February 16, 1941 birthplace ); a Chinese city such as Shenyang, Changchun, or Beijing (favored by China); Seoul or South Korea's Jeju Island; or, aboard a US ship in international waters. ===Announcement on holding the talks in Singapore=== North Korea's Vice Chairman Kim Yong-chol delivers a personal letter from Kim to Trump, in the White House Oval Office on June 1, 2018. CNN reported on May 9 that Singapore will be hosting the meeting on June 12. As per CNBC, a White House official said Singapore was chosen as it has diplomatic relations with both United States and North Korea, and was one of the few countries that have relationships with both countries. Trump confirmed the location on May 10 and announced that the summit is set for June 12. At from Pyongyang's Sunan airport, Singapore is easily within the range of Kim's Soviet-made Il-62M aircraft. Local media reported that the most likely choice of venue would be the Shangri-La Hotel Singapore near Orchard Road, known for hosting the annual Shangri-La Dialogue and the 2015 Ma‚ÄìXi meeting. A South Korean report also cited The Istana, the official residence of the President of Singapore, as a possible venue to host the summit. Trump together with Vice Chairman Kim Yong- chol of the North Korean delegation, outside the Oval Office An aerial view of the Capella Singapore Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs further provided information on the summit stating that \\"Singapore is pleased to host the meeting between President of the United States Donald J. Trump and Democratic People's Republic of Korea State Affairs Commission Chairman Kim Jong-un on 12 June 2018. We hope this meeting will advance prospects for peace in the Korean Peninsula\\". However, the ministry did not provide any details on the venue and the arrangements. Following Trump's renewed commitment to the summit on June 1, Singapore's Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen welcomed the move and stated that Singapore would cover some of the costs of the summit. Advance team members of the American and North Korean delegations that were meeting in Singapore in prior weeks were believed to have been staying in Capella Singapore on Sentosa, and the Fullerton Hotel Singapore in the city's Downtown Core respectively, both of which were additional venue options for the summit. The White House announced on June 4 that the meeting will take place at 9:00 am (SGT), and confirmed the next day that Capella Singapore will be the venue for the June 12 summit. The US clarified that they would not pay for North Korea's officials' accommodation. They also affirmed that they would talk with the South Korean and Japanese governments if asked about the possible declaration of the end of the Korean War during the summit. On June 9, 2018, at a press conference at the G7 Summit in Quebec, Trump estimated that the interpersonal chemistry between him and Leader Kim Jong-un would be a deciding factor in the success of the Summit in Singapore and that this would be a one-time chance for North Korea to strike a deal. ==Pre-summit eventsLeaders' arrivals=== Kim arrived in Singapore in an Air China Boeing 747-400 registered B-2447; Photo of this aircraft taken in Beijing in March 2018 US President Donald Trump left the 44th G7 summit around four hours earlier than scheduled and departed directly for Singapore. He reportedly viewed the G7 summit as a \\"distraction\\" from his summit with Kim. Trump landed at Singapore's Paya Lebar Airbase at 20:20 local time and was welcomed by Singapore's Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan. A US Air Force Boeing C-17 Globemaster III transport plane was already at the air base ahead of his arrival. Trump stayed at the Shangri-La Hotel Singapore, which has also hosted previous US Presidents. North Korean chairman Kim Jong-un landed at Singapore Changi Airport on Sunday at about 14:35 local time and was welcomed by Singapore's Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan and Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung. Kim flew to Singapore on a Boeing 747 operated by Air China, a plane used by the highest echelons of the Chinese leadership. According to media reports, a cargo plane, an Air Koryo Ilyushin Il-76, containing food items and other perishables landed in Singapore from North Korea before Kim's plane landed. Chiller trucks ferried them to the St. Regis Hotel Singapore where Kim stayed. A third plane from North Korea, an Air Koryo Ilyushin Il-62, landed shortly afterward; Kim's sister and Vice Director of the Propaganda and Agitation Department, Kim Yo-jong, was believed to be on board. ===Working- level meetings=== Both Trump and Kim met separately with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Kim met Lee on Sunday evening at The Istana. Trump met Lee on Monday afternoon, also at The Istana. He was accorded a bilateral meeting, followed by a working lunch and then an expanded bilateral meeting. During the meeting, Trump accepted President Halimah Yacob's invitation to make a State Visit to Singapore in November 2018, in conjunction with the 6th ASEAN-US Summit and 13th East Asia Summit. A working-level meeting was held between the United States Ambassador to the Philippines Sung Kim and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Choe Son-hui, at The Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore on Monday morning. The meeting lasted over two hours and was believed to further work out the details of the summit between Trump and Kim and to push forward their agendas.

Dennis Rodman  Retired U.S. basketball star Dennis Rodman, who made a number of visits to North Korea to promote sports and developed a personal relationship with Chairman Kim over several years, announced that he would be in Singapore during the summit but would not be involved in the meeting. Rodman arrived the day before the summit. The basketball star broke down in tears live on CNN as he recounted the hostility he faced for meeting Kim Jong-un. ==Summit meeting== The summit was broadcast in real-time internationally. ===One-on-one meeting=== Kim and Trump before the start of their one-on-one meeting United States President Donald Trump arrived at Capella Hotel first before North Korean leader Kim Jong-un arrived seventeen minutes later.

Trump and Kim emerged from the one-on-one talks and walked down the corridor to the Cassia where the expanded bilateral meeting took place. Trump described the one-on-one meeting as \\"very very good\\" when asked by a reporter. When Trump was asked if he had notes of the one-on- one meeting to refer back and verify, Trump replied, \\"I don't have to verify because I have one of the great memories of all time\\". ===Expanded bilateral meeting and working lunch=== The expanded bilateral meeting between both the United States and North Korean delegations Both countries' delegations proceeded to participate in an expanded bilateral meeting and a working lunch.

Some commentators expressed skepticism towards the signed agreement, pointing to a history of failed past agreements and to the vague wording of the declarations. China raised the possibility of sanction relief following the summit, but Pompeo said sanction relief would only be granted after complete denuclearization. Joint-military exercises between the United States and South Korea were halted, a demand that North Korea had long made. Visitors to North Korea reported that anti-American posters, postcards, stamps and similar items were no longer sold in tourist shops. ==Incidents== On June 9, two South Korean media personnel from South Korean broadcaster KBS News were arrested for trespassing at the home of the North Korean ambassador in Singapore. KBS News subsequently issued an apology for not being cautious. The two media personnel were deported the next day on June 10. On June 11, five South Korean women were arrested on Monday night for protesting outside the St. Regis Hotel where Chairman Kim and his delegation were staying. The police warned the women for violating the Public Order Act but they refused to cooperate, leading to their arrests. == Aftermath Progress of joint statement=== The director of USC Korean Studies Institute David C. Kang wrote an analysis of North Korea's solution which was published in The New York Times. Writing that the Trump administration should proceed with the necessary action items of U.S. side in order to ask North Korea to give up their Nuclear Weapons, Kang emphasized that unilateral disarmament of the DPRK would be impractical, and that a \\"phased\\" and \\"synchronous\\" approach with \\"step by step\\" negotiations would be a more reasonable way forward, with respect to the US-DPRK Joint Statement signed at the Singapore summit. The DPRK has shown eight or more types of various actions on their portion of the agreement; a moratorium on missile/nuclear tests, dismantling the Sohae atomic test and satellite launch site, the shutting down of an intercontinental ballistic missile assembly facility near Pyongyang, the returning of the remains of 55 U.S. Soldiers killed in the Korean War, the removal of domestic anti-American propaganda, and the release of three American Citizens arrested and imprisoned in the DPRK, as North Korean action items of the summit. However, the US has thus far taken only one action; the cancelling of joint military exercises between the US and South Korean Air Forces in the peninsula. If the United States should complete more of its action items under the Singapore agreement, with regard to North Korea's security concerns, the North Korean government in turn may be willing to make further actions toward denuclearization.nytimes.com-22 Aug 2018: \\"Why Should North Korea Give Up Its Nuclear Weapons? \\"voanews.com 27 July 2018: Mattis: No Decision on Fate of Korean Peninsula Exercises North Korean minister Ri Yong-ho has claimed that the US is backtracking or has made no progress on the American side of the Singapore Summit agreement, while saying that North Korea itself has taken some measures including the cessation of nuclear and missile testing, along with the removal of a primary nuclear site.english.yonhapnews.co.kr - 5 Aug 2018: N. Korean minister says U.S. is backtracking on Sentosa deal US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has made a request for North Korea to hand over 60 to 70 percent of its nuclear arsenal within six to eight months. However, the DPRK has not yet accepted that proposal.vox.com - 5 Aug 2018: [ https://www.vox.com/2018/8/8/17663746/pompeo-north-korea-nuclear-60-70 Exclusive: Pompeo told North Korea to cut its nuclear arsenal by 60 to 70 percent] The North Korean foreign minister released an announcement criticizing unilateral denuclearization, and Ri Yong-ho has emphasized that it is only equitable to perform a ‚Äúbalanced, simultaneous, step-by-step implementation‚Äù of the US-DPRK Joint Statement.english.hani.co.kr - 5 Aug 2018: North Korean foreign minister releases statement denouncing unilateral denuclearization There are four action items in the Joint Statement, the first and second items being the renewal of North Korea‚ÄìUnited States relations, the third item being the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and the final item the recovery of American POW/MIA remains from the Korean War. Currently, there are still three American nuclear capable jets stationed in South Korea. Additionally, North and South Korea, still lacking a proper peace treaty, are still technically at war. The DPRK urged the US to guarantee the DPRK's security by a formal declaration of the ending of the Korean War, in exchange for the DPRK ending its nuclear program and forfeiting its nuclear weapons.RT AMERICA - 5 Aug 2018: North Korea will only denuclearize if there is a peace treaty says, antiwar organizer, Doug Bandow, a special assistant to former President Ronald Reagan, suggested that the US provide the DPRK with a safety framework in the form of a peace treaty, in exchange for the DPRK ending their nuclear program.nationalinterest.org - 5 Aug 2018: Ending the Korean War Is in the National Interest, === Removed anti-American propaganda in DPRK === The DPRK government toned down aspects of its anti-American propaganda after the Singapore summit, with many anti-American posters being removed in the capital to give way to less politicized messages. The government also cancelled North Korea's annual \\"anti-US imperialism\\" rally on 27 July, a national holiday commemorating the start of the Korean War (Fatherland Liberation War in DPRK historiography). ===Pompeo's subsequent visits to North Korea=== On July 6‚Äì7, Pompeo travelled to North Korea for the third time to continue the negotiations with Kim Yong-chol, \\"a senior official who has been [North Korea's] point person in deliberations with the United States, South Korea and China\\". After the meeting, Pompeo said that the talks were productive and that progress had been made \\"on almost all of the central issues\\". However, North Korean state media criticized the meeting soon after, saying the U.S. had shown a \\"gangster-like attitude\\" and calling the demands of the Trump administration \\"deeply regrettable\\". Notwithstanding the stern reports, Pompeo delivered a letter from Kim to Trump, in which the latter expressed his hope for successful implementation of the US-North Korea Joint Statement and reaffirmed his will for improving the relations between the countries. Pompeo announced on August 23, 2018, that he would return to North Korea the following week for the fourth round of talks. The following day, Trump tweeted that he had asked Pompeo not to make the trip because he felt \\"we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\\" Concerning the cancellation of Pompeo's planned North Korea trip, Vox summarized the background based on the reports by The Washington Post and CNN that North Korea delivered an irate letter to Pompeo and the letter was shown to Trump in the Oval Office on Friday, and Trump tweeted the cancellation of Pompeo's trip. The message from DPRK was North Korea's evident disappointment as Washington had shown no real eagerness to sign a peace treaty to end the Korean War. South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha spoke to Pompeo by telephone on August 25, urging the U.S. and DPRK to continue talks relating to denuclearization and peace on the Korean peninsula, in spite of concerns over the cancellation of the trip by Trump. Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono revealed appreciation for Pompeo's \\"prompt communication‚Äù with South Korea, and said Japan would be pleased to cooperate with the U.S. for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. ===Return of remains of US soldiers=== After the Trump-Kim summit, North Korea searched for and returned the remains of U.S. POWs and MIAs from the Korean War. The remains of US soldiers in DPRK start the journey to the U.S. after 65 years. The US war remains were delivered from the eastern DPRK city of Wonsan by U.S. military transport plane C-17 Globemaster to the Osan Air Base near Seoul South Korea. On June 27, Pompeo said North Korea was planning to hand over presumed remains of U.S. soldiers killed during the Korean War in the near future. Following Pompeo's second visit to Pyongyang, a lower ranks meeting took place on July 15 regarding the retrieving of remains of US soldiers from the Korean War. Pompeo called the talks \\"productive\\" and said the two sides had reached firm commitments on the issue. On July 27 North Korea handed over 55 boxes of human remains, thus starting to fulfill their pledge in the Singapore declaration. The remains were saluted in a ceremony in their honor by US soldiers.BBC More than 36,000 American troops died during the Korean War, but some 7,700 remain unaccounted for, including 5,300 believed to have died in North Korea. Earlier, 220 remains were recovered during 1996‚Äì2005.NYTIMES North Korea reported to the U.S. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency that they couldn't be sure how many individuals were represented in each of the 55 boxes. There was uncertainty about the nationality of the war remains, whether the individuals were American or from other countries that took part in the Korean War, such as Australia, Belgium, France, and the Philippines. Kelly McKeague, the director of the POW/MIA Accounting Agency, said a preliminary review showed that the remains are \\"consistent\\" with being American and are from the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. The next phase would be matching the dental records, X-rays and DNA testing to further analyze the remains for possible identification. McKeague expressed his opinion that North Korea needs to allow the resumption of joint U.S.-North Korean searches of battlefields and POW camp graveyards to discover more war remains as soon as practical. === Shutdown of ICBM assembly facility near Pyongyang === The Voice of America (VOA) reported on July 25 that there is evidence that North Korea has dismantled an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) construction facility near Pyongyang. It was confirmed by analyzing satellite images taken around the March 16 with the latest satellite images in July. It was the investigated place of the factory that the Hwasong-15 ICBM that North Korea test-launched on November 29, 2017, was assembled at this plant and then moved on a transporter-erector-launcher (TEL). Kim Jong-un was at this vehicle factory that was connected to the ICBM assembly factory when he gave the command for the transfer of the TEL carrying the Hwasong-15 ICBM. State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert announced that the U.S would be looking for DPRK's consent for allowing the Verification process of the denuclearization of North Korea. Heather also added ‚ÄúVerification is obviously something that is paramount. Verification from legitimate groups and done by legitimate countries.\\" ===Destruction of missile test site=== North Korea dismantled the various significant parts and permanent structure of the Sohae ICBM missile & Satellite Launching Station. The DPRK Government had begun to dismantle an ICBM rocket launching and testing engine site to demonstrate its commitment to denuclearization. CBS News has identified the site as the freshest of North Korea's recognised major missile testing facilities. On July 24, it was reported that North Korea had begun to dismantle a rocket launching and testing site near Tonchang, an action which Kim had pledged to Trump. South Korean President Moon called the move \\"a good sign for North Korea‚Äôs denuclearization\\". The North Korea monitoring specialist group 38 North found that the Sohae Station, a satellite-launch site in North Korea, was being demolished. Satellite imagery shows that several significant structures were destroyed: a missile-launching stand and a building near a launchpad for satellites. 38 North suggested that it is an essential beginning step towards achieving a commitment made by Kim Jong Un at the June 12 Singapore Summit. On 7 August, there is more progress on Dismantling Facilities at the Sohae Satellite and Missile Launching Station. it entails the demolition of the test stand's concrete foundations, launch pad's gantry tower and pad foundation, etc. While the previous dismantlement of the vertical engine test stand on 23 July, represents a fulfilment of Chairman Kim's arrangement with President Trump conducted publicly during the post-Singapore Summit press conference, activity at the launch pad and concrete foundation appears to go exceeding that pledge. These activities, however, must be viewed cautiously as ‚Äúprincipal steps‚Äù since neither are presently permanent or irreversible. Concerning 38 North's scrutiny, it would characterize more durable and irreversible actions as there is no identified facility with equivalent capabilities elsewhere in the DPRK. North Korea announced in December 2019 that it had recently conducted a \\"very important test\\" at the Sohae site. Some analysts believed the test involved a new ICBM engine, as the country was believed to be migrating from its liquid-fueled missiles to new solid-fueled versions that were easier to transport, conceal and launch. The country announced it had conducted a \\"crucial test' at the Sohae site days later. ===Negotiation process between US and DPRK=== In August, during the ASEAN Regional Forum 2018, North Korea's nuclear program was the critical agenda item. ASEAN forum foreign ministers issued a joint statement calling for a \\"complete denuclearization\\" which is the same phrase used in the joint statement issued after the summit, and represents a change from last year's call for a \\"complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization\\".asia.nikkei.com - 5 Aug 2018: Let's offer North Korea a peace treaty officially ending the Korean War South Korea's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha has said that she had \\"considerable\\" consultations over the issue of the declaration to a formal end of the 1950-53 Korean war with the Chinese and U.S. foreign ministers.yonhapnews.co.kr - 5 Aug 2018: S.

On November 13, 2018, Kim Eui Keum, a spokesman for South Korean President Moon Jae-In, described the report and images as \\"nothing new\\" and further stated that North Korea \\"has never signed any agreement, any negotiation that makes shutting down missile bases mandatory.\\" CNN acquired satellite images in December 2018 that indicated North Korea was continuing to significantly expand a major long-range missile site in the mountainous interior of the country, including an \\"extremely large underground facility\\" that could be under construction as of August 2018.\\"New satellite images reveal activity at unidentified North Korean missile base,\\" CNN, December 5, 2018: https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/05/politics/north-korea-satellite-images- missile-base/index.html ==Second U.S.‚ÄìNorth Korean Summit== On October 7, 2018, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Kim met in Pyongyang and agreed to a second U.S.‚ÄìNorth Korea summit, with South Korea's presidential office stating that it would take place \\"as soon as possible.\\" It is unknown at this time when the second summit will take place.

The principle issues in the case were whether the bank had breached its duty to its customer by transferring the monies despite the suspicious circumstances surrounding the transfer request, and if so, whether the claim of the customer against the bank was precluded by the fact that the fraudulent acts of the director should be attributed to the customer so as to bar the claim of the customer against the bank. The Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal, which had held that on the facts that the bank had breached the duty to their customer, and the fact that the fraud was perpetrated by a director of the corporate customer did not preclude the claim by that corporate customer against the bank. Practical Law reported that this is the first decision where a bank in the United Kingdom had ever been held to be liable for breaching their duty to scrutinise customer transactions for possible fraud. ==Facts== Singularis Holdings Limited was a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands which was a personal asset holding company for Mr Maan Al Sanea. Mr Al Sanea was both a director and shareholder of Singularis. Singularis held a bank account with Daiwa Capital Markets Europe Limited which had very substantial sums of money on it. Between 12 June and 27 July 2009 Mr Al Sanea gave eight separate instructions to Daiwa to make payments totalling approximately US$204 million out of Singularis's account. It was accepted by all parties that these payments instructions were fraudulent. At the time of the payments Singularis was verge of insolvency, and the payments were all made to other companies (referred in the judgment as the \\"Saad Group\\") which were owned and controlled by Mr Al Sanea. Daiwa had raised concerns about the financial state of Singularis's financial position, as well as the freezing of Mr Al-Sanea's personal assets. Shortly before the relevant payment instructions, Daiwa's head of compliance sent an internal e-mail to colleagues: :\\"As you are all aware the SAAD group and some of the related individuals and entities have been experiencing well publicised problems including downgrades and the freezing of bank accounts. Under these circumstances can I re-emphasise the need for care and caution in terms of any activity on their accounts with us. Singularis have reasonably large sums of client money lodged with us and we need to ensure we maintain appropriate oversight of both further deposits and requests for payments ‚Ä¶ We should therefore ensure that any funds received relate to normal business activities and, if they are unsolicited, can clearly be linked back to their normal investment business ‚Ä¶ Clearly any payment requests we receive must be properly authorised and be 'appropriate' in the context of our business relationship with them. If there are any doubts or concerns please contact compliance or legal ‚Ä¶\\".Singularis v Daiwa, at paragraph 16. That warning was not heeded, and the eight fraudulent payment instructions were paid out either without demanding any explanation at all, or on the basis of explanations that ostensibly appeared to be false.Singularis v Daiwa (High Court) at paragraph 154. The Court of Appeal indicated that \\"There were failures at every level within Daiwa\\", and the trial judge found that Daiwa had a \\"dysfunctional structure leading to a sequence of events where everyone [assumed] that someone else [was] dealing with investigating the disputed payments but no one [troubled] to check whether that [was correct]\\". The trial initially came before Rose J, handed down a lengthy judgment, in which she held that the bank had breached its duty to the customer, holding that \\"Any reasonable banker would have realised that there were many obvious signs that Mr Al Sanea was perpetrating a fraud on the company.\\" However she reduced the claim by 25% to reflect the contributory negligence of the customer in allowing Mr Al Sanea to act without restraint. She further held that the fraud of Mr Al Sanea was not to be attributed to the company so as to bar any right of action on the basis of illegality. ==Decision== Daiwa did not appeal against the finding of the trial judge that they had breached their duty of care as a bank to take reasonable care (the so-called Quincecare duty, after the decision of Steyn J in Barclays Bank plc v Quincecare Ltd [1992] 4 All ER 363). Instead they appealed against the decision of Rose J on five separate grounds:Singularis v Daiwa, at paragraph 32. * Mr Al Sanea's conduct and state of mind should have been attributed to Singularis for the purposes of its claim against Daiwa. * Daiwa's duty did not extend to protecting the interests of Singularis's creditors and that, in circumstances where the only persons who suffered losses were creditors, for whose exclusive benefit the claim was brought, no claim lay against Daiwa. * Daiwa had an equal and opposite claim for the tort of deceit which should have extinguished its claim. * Singularis's claim should have been precluded by an illegality defence. * But, if Daiwa was liable to Singularis, the reduction in damages should be greater than 25% under the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945. Sir Geoffrey Vos gave the judgment of the Court of Appeal. After reviewing the facts and the relevant authorities, Sir Geoffrey expressed the view that there essentially six core issues. ===Issue #1 - Attribution === The first issue was whether the fraud of Mr Al Sanea should be attributed to Singularis. Counsel for Daiwa strongly urged that as Singularis was a \\"one man company\\" the fraud of Mr Al Sanea should be the fraud of the company. The Court of Appeal held that Rose J had correctly applied the test set out by the Supreme Court in , and that Singularis should not have that knowledge attributed to it. He cited with approval the comments of Lord Sumption in Jetivia: He further went on to elaborate that he did not find the phrase \\"one-man company\\" to be a helpful one. He noted in this case that Mr Al Sanea was not the sole director, although the other directors of Singularis were described as \\"supine\\".Singularis v Daiwa, at paragraph 95. === Issue #2 - Illegality === The second issue was whether, if Daiwa succeeded on the first issue, the illegality defence would bar the claim of Singularis. The key authority in relation to illegality as a defence was now . As Daiwa had not succeeded on the first issue, Sir Geoffrey declined to spend a great deal of time considering the second issue, but he added only that if he had been called upon to determine the point, he was satisfied that Rose J had correctly applied the test at first instance. Rose J had considered the point fairly shortly herself, dismissing it in only five short paragraphs, but she had formed the view that \\"Applying the test set out by Lord Toulson points firmly in favour of rejecting the illegality defence put forward by Daiwa.\\"Singularis v Daiwa (High Court) at paragraph 216. === Issue #3 - Causation === The third issue was whether the claim ought to fail because any breach by Daiwa was not causative of the loss. The appellants relied upon Berg Sons & Co v Adams [1992] BCC 661. In that case Hobhouse J had held that the directing mind of the company, to whom an auditor's report was directed, already knew the true facts. Therefore, his knowledge was attributed to the company, which meant that the company did not rely on the auditor's report, and the claim failed. The situation here, the appellants submitted, was exactly the same: once Singularis is identified with Mr Al Sanea's fraud, it is a dishonest company, and was not relying on Daiwa to perform its Quincecare duty. The Court of Appeal dismissed that argument. It has already held that the fraud of its principal was not to be attributed to Singularis. But the court went on to hold that, even if Mr Al Sanea's fraud were to be attributed, the claim would still be rejected because the directors of Singularis who were not acting fraudulently were indeed relying on Daiwa for the performance of its Quincecare duty. === Issue #4 - Tort of deceit === The appellants argued, in reliance upon the decision of Evans-Lombe J's decision in Barings plc v Coopers & Lybrand [2003] PNLR 34, that Daiwa should have an equal and opposite claim in deceit against Singularis. The Court of Appeal rejected that contention. The court accepted that, ordinarily, a third party who was misled by Mr Al Sanea's false statements into entering into a transaction would be able to recover all losses flowing from that transaction. But in this case Daiwa was not an ordinary third party; it was in breach of a pre-existing legal duty to Singularis to refrain from making the payments whilst the circumstances put it on inquiry. Accordingly, the court held that, even if Mr Al Sanea's fraud were to be attributed to Singularis (which it was not), Singularis's claim cannot be defeated by an equal and opposite claim in deceit by Daiwa against Singularis. === Issue #5 - Claims for the benefit of creditors === The appellants argued that these claims were all brought by, and for the indirect benefit of, the creditors of Singularis (through the liquidator). The trial judge had held that there was no principle of law which entitled the court to consider what a party intended to do with the money it recovers, and that the solvency or insolvency of Singularis did not affect that principle. The Court of Appeal broadly endorsed that, holding \\"the identity of those creditors cannot in this situation affect the question of whether the company in liquidation has a claim against Daiwa for breach of its Quincecare duty.\\"Singularis v Daiwa at paragraph 89. === Issue #6 - Contributory negligence === The Court of Appeal indicated that to set aside an assessment of contributory the appellants would need to show that the trial judge had either made an error of principle or reached a conclusion wholly outside the range of reasonable possibilities. at paragraph 16. They quickly dismissed the suggestion saying that appellant's arguments \\"do not get off the ground\\". === Summary === Accordingly, the Court of Appeal dismissed all of Daiwa's claims in the appeal, and upheld the decision of the trial judge that it was liable to Singularis for its breach of the Quincecare duty to scrutinise instructions which would put an ordinary banker on notice of fraud. Sir Geoffrey added a few remarks in closing. He stressed that it will be a rare situation for a bank to be put on inquiry under the Quincecare duty, and that there is a high threshold. In this case \\"any reasonable banker would have realised that there were many obvious, even glaring, signs that Mr Al Sanea was perpetrating a fraud on the company when he instructed that the money be paid to other parts of his business operations\\". He stress that this case was an unusual one.Singularis v Daiwa at paragraph 98. He also noted Daiwa sought to rely at every level of its argument on the existence of a prior fraud as a reason why it ought to have a successful defence. But this ignored the fact that the prior fraud is an essential ingredient of the claim for breach of the Quincecare duty. Finally, he stressed in relation to the authorities that there is no proper comparison between the duties of an auditor and the duty of a banker. A banker's duties in respect of properly authorised instructions to make payments are strictly limited. The banker's duty only arises where, abnormally, the banker is put on inquiry by the particular circumstances. He approved the comments of Steyn J said in Quincecare that \\"trust, not distrust, is the basis of a bank's dealings with its customers\\". ===Supreme Court=== In the Supreme Court the unanimous decision was handed down by Lady Hale, dismissing the appeal. ==Authority== Commentary on the decision has been broadly positive. Despite the wide-ranging grounds of appeal in the Court of Appeal most of the commentary has focussed upon the first instance decision being upheld and the bank being found liable for breach of the Quincecare duty. Practical Law reported that, in the 25 years since Quincecare was decided, this is the first decision where a bank had ever been held to be liable for breaching the duty under English law. Despite the comments of Sir Geoffrey Vos about the unusual facts of the case, and how liability under the Quincecare duty will be rare, inevitably banks will be concerned about being held liable for the frauds of others. ==Footnotes== Category:2019 in British law Category:2019 in case law Category:English banking case law Category:Court of Appeal (England and Wales) cases Category:Daiwa Securities Group Category:Fraud ","title":"Singularis Holdings Limited (in liquidation) v Daiwa Capital Markets Europe Limited"},{"id":"56796621","text":"Heide Hinrichs (born 1976) is a German artist living and working out of Brussels, Belgium.

Her performance of Whitney Houston's \\"I Will Always Love You\\", taped when she was a 13-year-old on the 2013 German edition of The Voice Kids, is the most watched YouTube video by an Austrian artist. She has recorded three albums. ==Biography== Kamhuber has always loved to sing, and made her first public singing appearance at the age of three at her great-grandmother's nursing home. From the age of ten she studied vocals at the Heidenreichstein music school. While she was still ten, she participated in the casting for the N√ñN Talent Contest in April 2010. \\"That was my first stage performance,\\" she recalls, \\"and I was very nervous.\\" She finished second. Later in 2010, having turned eleven, she participated in the Austrian annual televised children's talent show titled Kiddy Contest where she reached the finals and finished in third place. From then on, she regularly took singing lessons and often sang at small to medium size concerts. At a fundraiser in 2012, she sang a folk song for the first time and discovered she loved the genre. The same year she made the semifinals in another Austrian talent show, Die gro√üe Chance on ORF. At 13 she was the youngest singer in the contest. In 2013, she participated in the German edition of The Voice Kids, where she made it to the battles (or the knockout rounds) stage. Her performance of Dolly Parton's anthem \\"I Will Always Love You\\" in the blind audition has garnered over 200 million views (as of May 2020) on YouTube, and is the most watched YouTube video by an Austrian artist. (All three judges turned and she chose to be on Lena Meyer-Landrut's team.) Thanks to The Voice Kids she was noticed by people in the music industry and had a production team formed around her. Uwe Altenried (composer) and Peter and Gaby Wessely (lyricists) wrote the first song‚Äî\\"Wer Ordnung h√§lt (...ist nur zu faul zum Suchen)\\"‚Äîjust for her. That was followed by a record contract with Tyrolis Music. In the same year, Andy Borg invited her to sing her song on the Austrian folk music television show Musikantenstadl. On 2 January 2014, she released her debut album Wie guat, dass i a Madl bin, which contains 12 folk songs. In the 2015/2016 season, with the song \\"Stay Tonight\\", she made the shortlist of the Facebook (online) selection for the wildcard place in the Austrian national selection final for the Eurovision Song Contest. In December 2016 she released her second single, titled \\"Wunder\\". She was named youth ambassador for the UNESCO Club Austria's Gold Ribbon Campaign \\"Warriors and Angels\\" in early 2017.

He has won a Tony Award (out of 3 total nominations), a Drama Desk Award (out of 11 total nominations), and an Obie Award. == Personal life == He currently lives in the East Village, New York City. == Career == After graduating from Dartmouth College Coughlin moved to New York City and worked as a composer for several years, primarily writing incidental music for plays and dance. Theaters he composed scores for include The Hartford Stage (Antony and Cleopatra), BAM Theater Company (A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream and The Winter‚Äôs Tale), Denver Center Theater and many others. He has said that composing did not suit his personality as well as orchestrating and with the 1981 musical Is There Life After High School? (by Craig Carnelia and Jeffrey Kindley) he got the opportunity to move into writing orchestrations for the theater. He had been hired as musical director of the show, but was asked to also do orchestrations on the side. The show had a regional run at Hartford Stage in CT and a year later arrived on Broadway. It had a lengthy preview period at the Ethyl Barrymore Theatre but a short run of only 12 performances. Despite what must have been a disappointing start to orchestrating for the theater the \\"side job\\" eventually became his primary focus. Since that time he has orchestrated over 100 works for Broadway and other theater, opera, recordings and concert hall. After a period of working in the commercial world as a composer and arranger (for jingles and industrials), Coughlin came back to orchestrating for the theater with William Finn‚Äôs Romance In Hard Times at the Public Theater in 1989. He continued to orchestrate various shows off-Broadway and in regional theaters (including William Bolcom‚Äôs Casino Paradise). His first big theater success was as orchestrator for Adam Guettel‚Äôs Floyd Collins in 1994, directed by Tina Landau. The show later played at Playwrights Horizons in New York (where he won an Obie award for his work on that show). It had a short run but made a big impact on contemporary musical theater. === Broadway and West End === Coughlin‚Äôs first Broadway orchestrations were for revivals of classic Broadway shows including the 1996 revival of The King and I, The Sound of Music (1998), and Once Upon A Mattress starring Sarah Jessica Parker. Later he also orchestrated revivals of On the Town and Annie Get Your Gun (starring Bernadette Peters). Original Broadway musicals he has orchestrated include Triumph of Love (starring Betty Buckley), The Wild Party (Michael John LaChiusa), Urinetown (for which he received a Tony Award nomination), Dolly Parton's 9 to 5, Am√©lie and War Paint (starring Patti LuPone and Christine Ebersole). In 2005, he collaborated with Ted Sperling and Adam Guettel on orchestrations for Guettel‚Äôs The Light in the Piazza which became ‚Äúa surprise popular hit‚Äù. The show garnered all three a Tony Award and a Drama Desk Award for best orchestrations that year. Coughlin has also provided additional orchestrations for the Broadway musicals Big Fish, On the Twentieth Century (2015 revival) and Something Rotten!, among others. In 2014, he orchestrated another revival (of sorts) when he expanded his original 5-piece orchestration of Urinetown for the London premiere of the show thirteen years later. The expanded orchestration only added one additional player (a trumpet) but required rewriting of all the wind instruments in the show. He has written that this 6-piece expanded version is what he had always wanted for the original Broadway version, but the budget didn't allow for the extra player. The London production had a successful run at the St James Theatre (now The Other Palace) and then moved to the West End. === Long-time collaborations === Coughlin has had long-running collaborations with three prominent composers: Michael John LaChiusa, the songwriting team of Scott Frankel (music) and Michael Korie (lyrics), and with opera and theater composer Ricky Ian Gordon. For LaChiusa he orchestrated 6 shows and one opera including Giant (Larry Hochman provided additional orchestrations), The Wild Party, See What I Wanna See, and First Daughter Suite (a co-orchestration with Michael Starobin). For Frankel and Korie, he orchestrated Grey Gardens (for which he received a Tony Award nomination), Far From Heaven, Happiness (directed by Susan Stroman), Finding Neverland (UK version) and War Paint. He co-orchestrated (with the composer) three major Gordon operas (The Grapes of Wrath, 27 and Morning Star) and (as sole orchestrator) three musicals. === International === Coughlin has also worked extensively overseas, providing orchestrations for five new musicals at S√∏ren M√∏ller's Fredericia Teater in Denmark; for revivals of Candide (in a chamber music orchestration for the National Theatre), Assassins and the aforementioned Urinetown in London; and for 3 musicals (co-orchestrations with Larry Hochman) by Mar√≠a Isabel Murillo MISI in Bogot√°, Colombia. === Recordings and classical work === In the non- theater realm, he has written orchestrations for many singers (for both concert and recording) including Audra McDonald, Kristen Chenoweth, Julian Fleisher, Nadine Sierra, and Darius de Haas. In the classical world, Coughlin has often worked with conductor Michael Tilson Thomas, notably as orchestrator for Bernstein‚Äôs Arias and Barcarolles, The Thomashevsky Project (with co- orchestrator Peter Gordon) and on the 1992 recording of Bernstein's On the Town, where he orchestrated two songs cut from the original 1944 production. Those songs (\\"Gabey's Comin‚Äô\\" and \\"The Intermission's Great\\") had never been orchestrated but were added back for this new recording. \\"Gabey‚Äôs Comin‚Äô\\" is now a part of the currently available live-performance version of the show. In 2016 they collaborated once again on one of Tilson Thomas's own compositions (Four Preludes on Playthings of the Wind) with Coughlin supplying orchestration assistance as the score was finalized. It was Tilson Thomas who suggested Coughlin to Bruce Hornsby who was assembling a concert suite of four songs to be premiered at the New World Symphony in 2015. In his writing Hornsby had become interested in the techniques of modern classical music (Ligeti, Carter, Schoenberg, etc.) and was experimenting with ways to meld those compositional techniques with his own signature pop music style. The concert was a success and the collaboration continued. The suite now consists of eleven songs. === Metallica and S&M2; === In 2019 he joined forces with Metallica and Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony to create arrangements and orchestrations for S&M2;, marking the 20th anniversary of the legendary S&M; concert of 1999. Many of the original Michael Kamen orchestrations were used, and the concert updated with Metallica material from the last 20 years. Coughlin arranged and orchestrated \\"Moth Into Flame\\", \\"Halo On Fire\\", \\"Confusion\\", \\"The Day That Never Comes\\", \\"Unforgiven III\\", and \\"All Within My Hands\\". He also wrote a new orchestration for Master of Puppets from the original S&M; concert and adapted and reworked Geoff Alexander and Michael Kamen's Enter Sandman chart. S&M2; was the inaugural concert in the new Chase Center arena in San Francisco. Performances took place September 6 and 8 with a world-wide one-night-only movie screening planned for the following month. == Awards and nominations == Wins *1995 Obie Award, Orchestrations Floyd Collins *2005 Tony Award, Best Orchestrations The Light in the Piazza *2005 Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Orchestrations The Light in the Piazza Nominations *1996 Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Orchestrations Floyd Collins *1998 Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Orchestrations The Sound of Music *2001 Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Orchestrations Urinetown *2002 Tony Award, Best Orchestrations Urinetown *2006 Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Orchestrations Grey Gardens *2006 Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Orchestrations See What I Wanna See *2007 Tony Award, Best Orchestrations Grey Gardens *2009 Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Orchestrations 9 to 5 *2011 Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Orchestrations The Burnt Part Boys *2013 Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Orchestrations Giant *2016 Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Orchestrations First Daughter Suite *2017 Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Orchestrations War Paint ==References External links == *Official website: *Bruce Coughlin at the Internet Broadway Database *Bruce Coughlin on the BroadwayWorld Theatre Database Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American music arrangers Category:Musicians from New York City Category:Dartmouth College alumni Category:People from the East Village, Manhattan ","title":"Bruce Coughlin"},{"id":"56796738","text":"Gloss () is a 2007 Russian satirical melodrama directed by Andrei Konchalovsky.

Some common definitions are: * The first unusual thing to happen in the scene and how it will go on to define the scene. * A pattern that arises from the relationship between the characters. == Application == Working the concept into a player‚Äôs scene work is known as ‚Äúplaying the game‚Äù. When the Game is discovered the players have two ways to apply it into the scene. === Exploring === Players can explore the Game by delving into the psychology of their characters and try to understand why they do the things that they do. === Heightening === The Game can be escalated by raising the stakes. A character‚Äôs actions can be taken to the extreme or they can be placed in more absurd situations to see how the Game plays out. == Moving beyond the game == It is noted that focusing too much on trying to find the Game can cause players to miss the game entirely. Some players say that one should not pay too much attention while performing, and that they should only try to have fun.

OC=oceanic crust, OLM=oceanic lithospheric mantle, CC=continental crust, CLM=continental lithospheric mantle In plate tectonics, slab detachment or slab break-off may occur during continent-continent or arc-continent collisions. When the continental margin of the subducting plate reaches the oceanic trench of the subduction zone, the more buoyant continental crust will in normal circumstances experience only a limited amount of subduction into the asthenosphere. The slab pull forces will, however, still be present and this normally leads to the breaking off or detachment of the descending slab from the rest of the plate. The isostatic response to the detachment of the downgoing slab is rapid uplift. Slab detachment is also followed by the upwelling of relatively hot asthenosphere to fill the gap created, leading in many cases to magmatism. The uncritical use of the slab-detachment model to explain disparate observations of magmatism, uplift and exhumation in continental collision zones has been criticised. ==Slab tears== Detachment initiates at a particular point on the slab and will then propagate laterally along the descending slab, forming a slab tear. The propagation of the detachment will be accompanied by lateral migration of both the associated uplift and the magmatism. Such laterally propagating tears have been recognised from several collision zones, such as the Hindu Kush part of the Himalayan Belt. ==References== Category:Plate tectonics ","title":"Slab detachment"},{"id":"56796849","text":"Sir William Reid FRSE FIME DSc DCL (20 June 1906-2 October 1985) was a 20th century Scottish businessman and mining engineer.

She developed quantitative research methods used to study sociometry, a quantitative method for measuring social relationships. This work is cited as being the birth of social network analysis. == Career == Jennings graduated from the New Jersey College for Women (now known as the Douglass Residential College at Rutgers University) in 1927 with a Bachelor of Letters degree. Jennings pursued her graduate degree in psychology at Columbia University and specialized in empirical research design. While working in the lab of psychologist Gardner Murphy, she met Jacob L. Moreno. Through her knowledge of quantitative research methods and statistics, Jennings worked with Moreno to develop an empirical approach to social network research. Together they studied how \\"social relations affected psychological well-being‚Äù and ‚Äúused quantitative methods for studying the structure of groups and the positions of individuals within groups.\\" Jennings and Moreno's research at Sing Sing and the New York Training School for Girls (also known as Hudson School for the Girls) \\"involved systematic data collection and analysis\\" and resulted in two published works: Application of the Group Method to Classification in 1932, and Who Shall Survive? A New Approach to the Problem of Human Interrelations in 1934. This research is responsible for the development of sociometry. During this time, Jennings and Moreno also became the first to use a stochastic network model (or, \\"chance sociogram\\", as they called it), predating the Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model and the network model of Anatol Rapoport. In 1931, Jennings received her Master of Arts degree from Columbia University. Her master's thesis was entitled \\"The nature of the pathetic.\\" At that time she was living in Stelton, New Jersey. In 1943, Jennings completed her PhD thesis Leadership and Isolation: A Study of Personality in Interpersonal Relations. It was published by Longman, Greens, and Company. Leadership and Isolation strove to examine how often-chosen leaders and isolates arise in a population. It was a continuation of analysis from the data collected at the New York Training School for Girls. Research subjects were asked who they would like to work with and who they would like to live with. Eight months later, there was little change in the selected leaders and isolates. Benjamin Karpman, a psychiatrist, reviewed the first edition of Leadership and Isolation for the Journal of Clinical Psychology. In his review, he describes the importance of Jennings' research. Karpman closes his review encouraging all psychiatrists to read Jennings‚Äô book, stating \\"it offers the most profound analysis of leadership and isolation in the social process this reviewer has discovered in the field of social psychology.\\" A second edition of Leadership and Isolation was published by Longman, Greens, and Company in 1950. Morris Janowitz, a founder of military sociology, reviewed the book for the American Journal of Sociology. In his review, Janowitz wrote that Leadership and Isolation \\"can be viewed as an ingenious empirical study which helped fashion sociometry as a research tool.\\" According to structural sociologist Linton C. Freeman, the empirical methods developed by Jennings and applied in Moreno's sociometry studies laid the groundwork for future social network research: > \\"Clearly, with a great deal of help from Jennings and Lazarsfeld, Moreno had > developed an approach that included all of the defining properties of social > network analysis. It was based on structural intuitions, it involved the > collection of systematic empirical data, graphic imagery was an integral > part of its tools and it embodied an explicit mathematical model. That > structural perspective, moreover, was generalized to a range of phenomena. > Thus, the group led by Moreno displayed all four of the features that define > social network analysis.\\" Freeman draws the conclusion that Jennings was instrumental in the empirical research done in support of theories from Moreno: > \\"My own suspicion is that Jennings's contributions were immense. Moreno had > no research training at all, and until this point, he had shown absolutely > no interest in systematic research. All of his earlier publications were > couched in heavy mysticism. But his newer works‚Äìthose produced during his > collaboration with Jennings‚Äìwere comparatively systematic and were, for the > first time, empirically grounded. The obvious conclusion is that, though the > intuitive ideas came from Moreno, the completed research and the > publications drew heavily on the contributions of Jennings. Jennings, it > seems, was not only a collaborator but she was, in Moreno's terms, a very > powerful 'muse.'\\" == Selected works == * Moreno, Jacob L. and Jennings, Helen Hall. (1938).

Later renamed, the society was behind a number of lawsuits seeking to ensure the separation of church and state. ==HistoryFounding of the organization=== The society was founded in 1915. In January 1920, under the auspices of the Freethinkers' Society, Thomas Wright lectured in New York on Nietzsche and Thomas Paine in Manhattan. The society was behind a number of lawsuits seeking to ensure the separation of church and state. In 1925, the society was suing Mount Vernon, New York to stop school authorities from requiring children to attend religious services, with the case picked up as important by attorney Clarence Darrow. As of 1926, publisher Joseph Lewis remained president. After a court order favored their suit in early 1926, later that year, the society instituted injunction proceedings against the Board of Education of White Plains, New York over the decision of Supreme Court Justice Ellis J. Staley to allow time out for children's religious instruction. In May 1927, the Freethinkers' Society of New York took a decision on religious teaching to the Supreme Court on an appeal, after the court upheld the \\"religious training of public school children during schools hours at churches by parents.\\" ===Incorporation and renaming=== In 1928, Lewis incorporated The Freethinkers Society, renaming it \\"The Freethinkers of America\\" and becoming its president. In March 1930, at a luncheon honoring Philip J. Peabody, it was announced the society would move to legally force the Board of Education to eliminate the reading of the Bible in public schools. It was announced that Mayor Joseph Wheless, attorney for the association, would handle the case, with aid offered by Clarence Darrow, Arthur Garfield Hays and Stephen B. Vreeland. As of November 1935, Freethinkers of America had 30,000 members at $1 a year for membership, with Lewis still president. In 1936, Lewis denied that three honorary vice presidents had resigned, after the National Conference of Christians and Jews declared that Rupert Hughes, Clarence Darrow, and Harry Elmer Barnes had removed their names. Barnes confirmed he had argued with Lewis over Lewis' annual statement denouncing Yom Kippur, but had not resigned. The society successfully challenged the use of public school buildings for religious training in 1948, with a decision by the Supreme Court despite protests by religious groups. In 1956, the organization sued to attempt to remove the \\"under god\\" from the Pledge of Allegiance, which had been added the year before. In 1958, the Freethinkers of America filed a suit over a hospital ban prohibiting birth-control therapy in New York city hospitals. Lewis died in 1968 after decades of activity with the organization. ==Members== Luther Burbank who was a member and first Honorary Vice President. ==See also== *Freethought *Golden Age of Freethought *Secularism == References == Category:Freethought organizations Category:Freethought Category:Organizations established in 1915 Category:Secularism in the United States Category:1915 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Freethinkers Society"},{"id":"56797041","text":"Geoff Berman is an American political operative.

The model based demand for medical care on the interaction between a demand function for health and a production function for health. Andrew Jones, Nigel Rice, and Paul Contoyannis call the model the \\"founding father of demand for health models\\".Jones, Andrew M. Rice, Nigel, and Contoyannis, Paul. The Dynamics of Health in Jones, Andrew M., ed. The Elgar companion to health economics. Edward Elgar Publishing, 2012. p15 ==Model== In this model, health is a durable capital good which is inherited and depreciates over time. Investment in health takes the form of medical care purchases and other inputs and depreciation is interpreted as natural deterioration of health over time.Grossman 1972 In the model, health enters the utility function directly as a good people derive pleasure from and indirectly as an investment which makes more healthy time available for market and non-market activities. The model creates a dynamic system of equations which can be cast as an optimization problem where utility is optimized over gross investment in health in each period, consumption of medical care, and time inputs in the gross investment function in each period. In this way, the length of life of the agent is partially endogenous to the model. Dynamic optimization problems are often optimized using comparative statics, setting partial derivatives of the outcome function of interest, in this case the utility function, equal to zero. When the partial derivative of the utility function with respect to health consumption is assumed to equal zero, the resulting sub-model is the investment model. Solutions to the problem of this sub-model generally show that the rate of return on health capital must equal the opportunity cost of said capital. Thus, increases in the depreciation rate over time cause the optimal stock of health to decrease. If the marginal efficiency of capital curve is inelastic, gross investment grows over time. In practical terms, this model thus predicts that older people will have more sick time and time spent on increasing health and have higher medical expenditures than younger people. Another implication is that since increases in wages shift the marginal efficiency of capital curve to the right and increases the curve's slope, an increase in wage will increase the demand for health capital. ==Theoretical expansions== The Grossman model was extended in a number of directions. Among the first to include uncertainty in the model were Charles Phelps and Maureen Cropper.Phelps, Charles E. \\"Demand for reimbursement insurance.\\" In The role of health insurance in the health services sector, pp. 115-162. NBER, 1976.Cropper, Maureen L. \\"Health, investment in health, and occupational choice.\\" Journal of Political Economy 85, no. 6 (1977): 1273-1294. The relationship between education and health was expanded in the model by Isaac Ehrlich.Ehrlich, Isaac. On the interaction between education and health and the concept of human capital. Mimeo., Jan, 1978. Regarding the relationship between education and medical care demand, one important question is whether the marginal efficiency of capital elasticity with respect to education is less than or greater than one. If the curve is elastic (elasticity greater than one), education will increase medical care demand. On the other hand, if the curve is inelastic, education will decrease medical care demand. Jan Acton expanded the time constraint by including travel and waiting time in health care.Acton, Jan Paul. \\"Nonmonetary factors in the demand for medical services: some empirical evidence.\\" Journal of Political Economy 83, no. 3 (1975): 595-614.Grossman 1982 ==Empirical estimation== Important empirical studies into these components include the RAND Health Insurance Study led by Joseph Newhouse in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. This study sought to estimate income, money price, and time price elasticities of demand for medical care.Manning, Willard G., Joseph P. Newhouse, Naihua Duan, Emmett B. Keeler, and Arleen Leibowitz. \\"Health insurance and the demand for medical care: evidence from a randomized experiment.\\" The American economic review (1987): 251-277. Another important study was the Oregon Health Insurance in the late 2000s and also estimated the role of public health provision on healthcare demand and was led by Katherine Baicker and Amy Finkelstein.Finkelstein, Amy, Sarah Taubman, Bill Wright, Mira Bernstein, Jonathan Gruber, Joseph P. Newhouse, Heidi Allen, Katherine Baicker, and Oregon Health Study Group. \\"The Oregon health insurance experiment: evidence from the first year.\\" The Quarterly journal of economics 127, no. 3 (2012): 1057-1106. ==Criticisms== In the model, health is neither a pure investment good nor a pure consumption good, but health stock benefits the agent in two ways, directly increasing utility and second by increasing healthy time available for other activities. One early criticism is that framing health as a dichotomous concept is intuitively wrong in that health is simultaneously both and health provides both alternatives simultaneously.Muurinen, Jaana-Marja. \\"Demand for health: a generalised Grossman model.\\" Journal of Health economics 1, no. 1 (1982): 5-28. Similarly, critics of Grossman's model have conceptualized the issue not from the point of view of healthcare demand, but the avoidance of illness which in itself is a disutility Cropper, M. L. (1977). Health, investment in health, and occupational choice. Journal of Political Economy, 85(6), 1273-1294.. In that sense, poor health is seen as a factor diminishing or interrupting an individual's ability to achieve maximum utility, with death being seen as a permanent interruption. In another departure from Grossman's model on the question of expenditures and demand over time, University of Maryland Economics professor Maureen Cropper argues that healthcare demand should be delineated between preventative care and treatment of illness, the latter of which is often correlated with end of life treatment and can be seen as more random based on illness occurrenceibid. The former variable is more predictable, but very much correlated to those earlier in their life cycle and present in the labor marketibid. Additionally, researchers have questioned the independence of the individual variables in the model such as education, income, as well as socioeconomic and occupation statusFuchs, V. R. (2004). Reflections on the socioeconomic correlates of health. Journal of health economics, 23(4), 653-661.. Particular attention had been paid to riskier professions, which generally entail higher wages due to occupational hazards and thus make such variable co-dependentibid. Much to the same point, Dr. Victor Fuchs argues that both genetic and gendered differences operate as unobserved, immutable variables within the modelibid. ==References Bibliography == *Grossman, Michael. \\"The demand for health: a theoretical and empirical investigation.\\" NBER Books (1972). *Grossman, Michael. \\"The demand for health after a decade.\\" Journal of Health Economics 1, no. 1 (1982): 1-3. *Grossman, Michael. \\"The demand for health, 30 years later: a very personal retrospective and prospective reflection.\\" Journal of Health Economics 23, no. 4 (2004): 629-636. *Grossman, Michael.

He has worked as presenter and juror on programmes such as Shopping Queen. == Life and career == Guido Maria Kretschmer was born in M√ºnster on 11 May 1965 and grew up in Einen, Warendorf. After two semesters of studying medicine, he began his career as a designer in Ibiza on the popular hippie market of the island with a small stand of clothes that he had sewn himself. This earned him the attention of German musician Udo Lindenberg, who ordered brocade jackets for his tour. In 1987, Kretschmer founded the company GMK by pepper, with its headquarters in M√ºnster and Palma, as well as the fashion label Guido Maria Kretschmer Corporate Fashion. Initially with three employees, he mostly worked as designer for large companies. His first large-scale order was the creation of uniforms for crew members of the airline Hapag-Lloyd Flug. Along with work outfits for Deutsche Telekom, Kempinski, Hotel Maritim, and Emirates Airlines, he also designed around 2,5 million suits for the TUI Group. In 2004, Kretschmer founded the label Guido Maria Couture, with which he reached his creative focal point, designing cocktail dresses and evening gowns as well as the associated accessories. His first fashion shows in this field were held in Shanghai and Tokyo. In 2005, he presented his creations for the first time at the Berlin Fashion Week. After he was chosen by German actress Katharina Thalbach to design the stage outfits for an Oscar Wilde play, he began designing for various theatre and film productions, such as for a production of The Barber of Seville by the Deutsche Oper Berlin. In the film field, he designed the outfits for ', Messy Christmas, and Rubbeldiekatz. In the latter two, he also had guest roles. His label is regularly represented on large fashion shows and celebrities such as Charlize Theron, Jane Seymour, Patricia Kaas, Iris Berben, Martina Gedeck, Jasmin Wagner, and Heino Ferch have worn his creations. He maintains showrooms in M√ºnster, Berlin, and Palma, and opened a shop in Munich in 2009. Since January 2012, Kretschmer has been presenting the television show Shopping Queen on VOX as well as its celebrity version since April of the same year. In March 2012, he entered a civil union with his longtime partner Frank Mutters at the Rathaus Sch√∂neberg. A special collection named \\"Guido Maria Kretschmer for eBay\\" was developed up until 23 April 2013 as part of a crowdsourcing project in which visitors of the project page could vote on the collection and its production. Also in 2013, he published his first book, Anziehungskraft: Stil kennt keine Gr√∂√üe. In 2013 and 2014, Kretschmer was a judge on Das Supertalent, the German instalment of the Got Talent franchise, alongside Dieter Bohlen, Bruce Darnell, and Lena Gercke. Since the autumn of 2014, he has been advertising for the OGI Oil & Gas Invest AG. He is an ambassador of the Stiftung Deutsche Schlaganfall-Hilfe. In May 2018, he was part of the presenter team for RTL's broadcast of the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, alongside Frauke Ludowig. RTL's reporting as well as that of concurrent channel ZDF were criticised for being \\"disrespectful\\" and \\"racist\\". == Filmography  Film === * 2007 ‚Äì Messy Christmas * 2010 ‚Äì Das Leben ist zu lang * 2011 ‚Äì Rubbeldiekatz === Television === * 2012 ‚Äì Das perfekte Model (juror) * Since 2012 ‚Äì Shopping Queen (commentator and juror) * Since 2012 ‚Äì Promi Shopping Queen (commentator and juror) * 2013 and 2014 ‚Äì Das Supertalent (juror) * 2014 ‚Äì Hotter Than My Daughter (presenter) * 2015 ‚Äì Deutschlands sch√∂nste Frau (presenter) * 2015 ‚Äì Geschickt eingef√§delt ‚Äì Wer n√§ht am besten?

On July 3, 2013 the wreck of the Australasia was added to the National Register of Historic Places. ==History== The Australasia (Official number 106302) was built in 1884 in West Bay City, Michigan by the shipyard owned by Captain James Davidson. She was built for the Davidson Steamship Company which was also owned by Captain Davidson. At a length of the Australasia was one of the largest wooden ships ever built; her beam was wide and her cargo hold was deep. She was powered by a fore and aft compound engine which was fueled by two coal burning Scotch marine boilers. Stern view of the Australasia at an ore dock She had a gross tonnage of 1829.32 tons and a net tonnage of 1539.20 tons. On September 17, 1884 the Australasia was launched as hull number #9. At the time of her launch the Australasia was the largest wooden hulled ship in the world. Because of her enormous size the Australasia needed iron cross bracing, an iron keelson, iron plates, and several iron arches to increase her strength. She was used to haul bulk cargoes such as iron ore, coal, grain and sometimes salt. She could carry these cargoes so efficiently that she earned a fortune for her owners at a time when small, less versatile wooden vessels were quickly being replaced by larger, and stronger iron or steel vessels. Just like all ships owned by Captain Davidson, the Australasia used to tow a wooden schooner barge. ==Final voyage== On October 17, 1896, the Australasia was bound from a port on Lake Erie for Milwaukee, Wisconsin, carrying 2,200 tons of soft coal. At around 6:00 p.m. near Baileys Harbor, the crew of the Australasia discovered \\"a fire beneath the texas on the main deck\\". They attempted to fight the blaze but failed. The crew abandoned the Australasia before she reached Jacksonport, Wisconsin. At 10:30 p.m., the Australasia was about four hours off Jacksonport when the tugboat John Leathem came upon the struggling steamer. The Leathem began towing the Australasia to shore, but the hawser connecting them kept burning through. At 9:00 a.m. on October 18, 1896, the crew of the Leathem gave up trying to salvage her and instead dragged her onto the beach in of water south of Cave Point. Her crew decided to scuttle her; they did this by ramming a hole in the Australasia's side with the Leathem's stem. She was left heading north by northwest. She burned until the night of October 18, 1896. ==The Australasia today== The Australasia in Fort William, Ontario The Australasia was declared a total loss. Much of her cargo of soft coal and machinery was salvaged, however her hull was beyond repair and was abandoned. Today her lower hull lies mostly buried in sand 15 to 20 feet of water off Whitefish Dunes State Park. Because most of her hull remains buried in sand, there is the possibility that different hull sections may be uncovered which may reveal more significant information about her construction. Not a trace of her cargo is visible on the site of her wreck, but traces of coal is visible on a beach nearby. The wreck of the Australasia is rarely visited by divers which means that very little site disturbance to the site has occurred. Close by are the wrecks of several other ships including the early steel freighter Lakeland, the large wooden bulk carrier Frank O'Connor, the wooden steamer Louisiana which was lost during the Great Lakes Storm of 1913, the schooner Christina Nilsson and the steamboat Joys. ==ReferencesNotes=Citations=== Category:1884 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1896 Category:Shipwrecks on the National Register of Historic Places in Wisconsin Category:National Register of Historic Places in Door County, Wisconsin Category:Shipwrecks of Lake Michigan Category:Great Lakes freighters Category:Steamships of the United States Category:Merchant ships of the United States Category:Door County, Wisconsin Category:Shipwrecks of the Wisconsin coast Category:Ships sunk with no fatalities Category:Ships built by James Davidson ","title":"SS Australasia"},{"id":"56797241","text":"Rachel Kerina Chikwamba is a Zimbabwean plant geneticist born in 1967. She is in the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Group Executive: Strategic Alliances and Communication. She is an active member of the Academy of Science of South Africa. == Research and career == Chikwamba obtained an undergraduate degree in Crop Science from the University of Zimbabwe, and later graduated from the University of Queensland with a Master's degree. In 2002, she obtained her PhD in genetics from Iowa State University, with a dissertation exploring the production of novel proteins in plants. She then worked as a post-doctoral research associate at Arizona State University's Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccinology within the Biodesign Institute. There, her research focused on the expression and assembly of plant proteins. Chikwamba also holds an MBA from the Gordon Institute of Business Science at the University of Pretoria. Chikwamba's research involves plant manufactured pharmaceuticals and metabolic engineering. Using mainly sorghum, maize and banana, she explores three main research avenues: improving the nutritional quality of food crops; using plants to produce biomolecules of pharmaceutical interest; and investigating biochemical pathways of indigenous plants with medicinal value. Chikwamba chairs the board of the Applied Centre for Climate and Earth Systems Science (ACCESS). She has worked at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) since 2004, in various capacities. She helped develop the Health Research Impact Area strategy, and served two terms on the CSIR's Strategic Research Panel. As Chief Researcher and Competence Area Manager at CSIR Biosciences, she facilitated major global partnerships for CSIR, and was the lead for the African Biofortified Sorghum (ABS) project, which aim to produce nutritionally fortified sorghum, focusing on pro-vitamin A, protein quality and mineral bioavailability. As a principal investigator for CSIR, she led a number of both internationally and locally funded projects including European Union Framework projects, the Gates Grand Challenge on nutritional fortification, the GreenPharm initiative (which aims to make antibody therapeutics using plant-based technology), and New Partnership for Africa's Development/Biofisa projects. Chikwamba was on the team which produced RabiVir, an antibody treatment made from plant leaves to treat rabies. In October 2011, she was made CSIR Group Executive: Strategic Alliances and Communication, and in this capacity she managed partnerships, stakeholder interactions, and associated communication. She also held the position of CSIR Group Executive: Chemicals, Agriculture, Food and Health. In late 2019, Chikwamba was elected the Director General of the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), but for personal reasons did not take up the position. During her career, Chikwamba was also a lecturer with the University of Pretoria's Departments of Plant Science, of Botany, and of Forestry and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute (FABI). In this capacity, she leads a program to genetically improve banana and maize crops. She was made an Honorary Research Fellow at St George‚Äôs Hospital at the University of London.

In the 2015 Riigikogu elections, he ran as an independent under the Estonian Free Party list, being billed as a vote magnet due to his popularity, as well as running on a campaign message of anti-corruption, and received 7,307 votes in the same district, being elected to the Riigikogu. He was fined due to protesting a law that prohibited outside political ads after the cutoff date before an election by having campaign ads on his car after the date had passed, claiming it creates disadvantages for a small party to gain traction. As a member of the Riigikogu, in 2015, Talvik helped to create a committee to investigate alleged corruption in the financial dealings of the Port of Tallinn, as well as protecting state companies from corruption. He was elected to be the committee chairman of the Anti-Corruption Select Committee on 16 December 2016, with of the Centre Party as deputy chairwoman. He is currently a member of the Rural Affairs Committee. Talvik would later fully join on 8 March 2017 and become the leader of the Free Party, elected into the position on 24 April. His election came after the Free Party controversially kicked out fellow candidate for leadership Jevgeni Kri≈°tafovit≈° on 24 March 2017 for \\"spreading falsities and slandering the party\\". Afterwards, he resigned as chairman of the Anti-Corruption Select Committee, with former leader of the party Andres Herkel being elected in his place on 13 June. In May 2018, Talvik chose not to re-run for the Free Party leadership and Herkel was reelected as the Free Party's chairman on 12 May. A day later, Talvik left the Estonian Free Party, but promised to stay in politics. ==FilmographyAs producer=== * \\"K√µrbekuu\\" (1999, short feature film) * \\"Tulekummardajad\\" (2000, documentary film) * \\"Waterbomb for the Fat Tomcat\\" (2004, along with Gatis Upmalis, children's film) * \\"The Singing Revolution\\" (2006, documentary film) * \\"Kinnunen\\" (2007, along with Aet Laigu) * \\"December Heat\\" (2008) * \\"\\" (2009, documentary film) * \\"Okupeeri oma m√º√ºr\\" (2013, documentary film, with ) (source:) ===As director=== * \\"Vene metalli ja US $ suudlus\\" (1993, with ) * \\"√ñ√∂liblika j√µulud\\" (1994, with Rein Kotov) * \\"Vabadus v√µi surm\\" (1995) * \\"\\" (2009, documentary film) (source:) ==External links== * ==References== Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:Estonian male stage actors Category:Estonian male film actors Category:Estonian film directors Category:Estonian film producers Category:Estonian screenwriters Category:Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre alumni Category:Members of the Riigikogu Category:21st-century Estonian politicians ","title":"Artur Talvik"},{"id":"56797283","text":"Daniel Wayne Hooper (born December 16, 1976) is an American cosmologist and particle physicist specializing in the areas of dark matter, cosmic rays, and neutrino astrophysics.

She was a member of the Tewa and a resident of Santa Clara Pueblo. ==Personal life== Born on November 6, 1927, Angela Tafoya Baca was the daughter of Severa and Cleto Tafoya. Her childhood home, located in the center of the plaza in Santa Clara Pueblo, later became the Merrock Galeria, which was owned and managed by her nephew Paul Speckled Rock. Angela married Jose Antonio \\"Tony\\" Baca, who served as private first class in the United States Army during World War II. He worked for the Zia Company (later Johnson Controls), which provided support services to Los Alamos National Laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico.

Angela Baca learned pottery-making techniques from her mother, Severa Tafoya, a well-known potter of Santa Clara Pueblo. According to Angela, her mother made melon bowls with large ridges, and Angela decided to make them with smaller ridges. Her initial work won first prize at the Santa Fe Indian Market, Santa Fe, New Mexico, and she decided to focus on melon bowls, both red and black, although her work includes other designs, as well. She is considered to be the matriarch of the melon potters. A photograph of Angela Baca at the Santa Fe Indian Market in 1991 is available in the Palace of the Governors Photo Archives Collection. Four of her children have carried on their mother's tradition of making melon vessels.

Both Hoathley 1 and the second mission, Operation Fungus, flew out on the night of 20 Apr 1943 from Derna airfield. The missions' objective was to establish who the Partisans were, who was their leader and if and how they could be utilised to further the Allies' military ambitions. They also served as each other's backup, in case one failed to reach the Partisans or fell into enemy's hands.Williams, p. 136 The mission consisted of three Yugoslav Canadians who were recruited by the SOE and trained in clandestine operations at Camp X on the Lake Ontario, near the US border.Williams, p. 10 It was led by Stevan Serdar who was joined by George Dikliƒá and Milan Dru≈æiƒá. They wore no identifiable uniform or rank.Williams, p. 134 == Background == During the Second World War, both the SOE and its military counterpart, the SIS, operated in Canada and the United States in order to recruit European immigrants as potential agents for deployment in their native countries. The policy was approved as these were often bi-lingual young men who had escaped economic or political hardship in their homelands. Some had even fought in the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side.Williams, p. 127 Once selected, they were sent to Camp X for training and then dispatched to their respective regions. Those intended to infiltrate into Yugoslavia were sent to Cairo, in preparation for the parachute drop.Williams, p. 131 Their main task would be the acts of sabotage on German communication lines and transport of oil, raw materials, troops and war materiel.Williams, p. 137 == The drop == The Hoathley 1 group was dropped \\"blind\\", without a prearranged rendezvous into Eastern Bosnia, near town of ≈†ekoviƒái. The intention was for them to connect with the local population and try and locate the Partisan troops. Previous SOE intelligence suggested that there were resistance fighters in the area.Deakin, p. 1 They were lucky, and shortly after landing they were able to join the Partisan Bosnian Corps at the Javornik mountain. On 11 May 1943 their first signal was picked up in Cairo, reporting their safe landing and that they were on the run.Deakin, p. 213 They had become a part of a complex and brutal civil war and the war against the invaders. == The engagement == Once the Partisan leader, Tito, was informed via radio that the two British missions had arrived, unexpected and uninvited, he instructed the Partisan commanders to look after them and ensure that they did not \\"undertake some provocation which would compromise the Partisans in the eyes of the international public\\". This was in response to a previous mission, Operation Hydra, which resulted in death of two British officers most likely at the hand of a royalist chetnik in April/May 1942. For those who claimed Canadian Communist Party membership, Tito consulted the Comintern, who advised caution.Williams, p. 135 All three members of the group were miners, able to use explosives competently. They also investigated and reported on chetniks' collaboration with the Germans near Zvornik, and the Italians near Vi≈°egrad in May 1943.Deakin, p. 72 == Merging into Operation Typical == One month after the two missions had landed, the first official, and uniformed, SOE/SIS mission was dispatched from the same airport on 27 May 1943. Led by Col Bill Deakin, they joined Tito's HQ and followed him out of the encirclement at Tjenti≈°te. Deakin met up with the group in Kladanj on 28 Jun 1943 and merged them into his mission.Deakin, p. 71 The enlarged group now had three radio sets and were able to communicate with Cairo with better resilience, as regular schedule had to be kept. This enabled them to organise further military aid drops in the area.Deakin, p. 54 On 7 Jul 1943, Serdar used recently dropped British plastic explosive to interrupt rail transport of coal, hoping to deprive other trains of fuel and frustrate enemy's troop movements. On 18 Jul 1943 and on 29 Jul 1943, he witnessed and reported on the destruction of parts of the strategic Sarajevo - Vi≈°egrad line.Deakin, p. 58 On collaboration with the occupiers, they further reported on 29 Jul 1943 that the German command were using chetniks as auxiliaries, for attacks on the Partisans and for guarding the railway near Tuzla. On 15 Aug 1943 they reported that some chetniks were armed with German rifles and supplied by food and pay.Deakin, p. 72 == References  Sources == * * Category:Yugoslavia in World War II Category:Eastern European theatre of World War II Category:Special Operations Executive operations Category:United Kingdom‚ÄìYugoslavia relations ","title":"Operation Hoathley 1"},{"id":"56797421","text":"Raymonde de Kervern (1899-1973) was a Mauritian poet.

They enjoy the status of protected geographical indication (PGI) since 2012 and are grown by the Comber Earlies Growers Co-Operative Society Limited. The term applies to immature potatoes harvested between early May and late July in the area surrounding Comber. This area, sheltered by the Mourne Mountains and Ards Peninsula and protected from frost by the saltwater of Strangford Lough, has a distinctive microclimate, allowing an early potato harvest and a distinctive sweet, nutty flavour. Comber Earlies are not a variety of potato, they can be of many varieties, but are named solely after the location at which they are grown. ==History== Comber potatoes have long been linked with the Ulster Scots planters the Hamiltons and Montgomerys.

It has large, colourful flowers and is common in a narrow range near the coast around Perth, often occurring with the similar but smaller Diuris corymbosa. ==Description== Diuris magnifica is a tuberous, perennial herb, usually growing to a height of . Two or three leaves emerge at the base, each leaf long, wide and folded lengthwise. There are between three and nine golden-yellow and purple flowers long and wide. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, long and wide and curves upwards. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide, turned downwards and usually crossed. The petals are erect with an egg-shaped blade long and wide on a purplish-brown stalk long. The labellum is mauve or purple with some yellow markings, long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is wedge-shaped, long and wide and the side lobes are long and wide. There is a single yellow, ridged callus long in the mid-line of the labellum. The species is similar to several other Diuris including D. corymbosa and D. amplissima but is distinguished from them by its size, flowering period and distribution. Flowering occurs from late August to October. ==Taxonomy and naming== Diuris magnifica was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected in a reserve near Kwinana and the description was published in Australian Orchid Review. The specific epithet (magnifica) is a Latin word meaning \\"noble\\", \\"eminent\\" or \\"splendid\\" referring to the large, colourful flowers of this orchid. ==Distribution and habitat== The large pansy orchid is common in near coastal shrubland and woodland between Lancelin and Mandurah in the Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions. At the northern end of its distribution, this species hybridises with the as yet undescribed Arrowsmith pansy orchid (Diuris sp. 'Eneabba') and in the south with D. corymbosa. ==Conservation== Diuris magnifica is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. ==References== magnifica Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of Western Australia Category:Endemic flora of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 1991 ","title":"Diuris magnifica"},{"id":"56797574","text":"The 1985 UK Athletics Championships was the national championship in outdoor track and field for the United Kingdom held at Antrim Stadium, Antrim.

The ship was modified to accommodate two classes of passengers from May 1931, at the same time as third class carriages were introduced on the Golden Arrow train. Following the Golden Arrow last trip after the declaration of the Second World War, Canterbury was converted to a troop ship. On 29 May 1940 after departing the east pier at Dunkirk at 16:50 with 1960 troops Canterbury was badly damaged by a bomb near miss but was able to reach Dover. Following repairs she continued with the evacuation on 3 June 1940 completing five trips for the evacuation. She then performed some sailings from Southampton evacuations to Normandy and Brittany until the middle of June before resting on the River Dart and serving as a target practice ship of the Fleet Air Arm and a period on the Stranraer‚ÄìLarne route. From June 1942, she undertook an eight-month conversion to a troop landing ship and took part in the June 1944 Normandy landings. Postwar, she initially returned to the Golden Arrow service, but was replaced in October 1946 by the Southern Railways flagship following that ship's refurbishment.

In 1932 he moved to England, where he spent the rest of his life developing automatic gearboxes that failed to find a market. ==History== Hobbs was born in Adelaide a son of J(ohn) Harris Hobbs and Mary Eliza Hobbs, n√©e Pitt, of Payneham and studied at Prince Alfred College, where he was successful academically and in athletics. His brothers Norman Theodore Hobbs and ?? were educated at the same school. He left school at age 15, to work on his father's orchard and market garden. In his spare time, he worked on a series of mechanical inventions. He never underwent higher education and his engineering knowledge and abilities were entirely self-taught. He married Phyllis Dorothy Reid in 1927; they had a daughter Barbara on 5 May 1927. They lived in Paradise, a suburb of Adelaide, where he spent seven years working on his automatically variable gearbox until he had a working model operating in a \\"baby Austin\\" car. His invention won the support of professors R. W. Chapman and Kerr Grant of Adelaide University. A parts breakdown may be viewed here. A company, Hobbs Gearless Drive Limited, was founded in June 1931 with capital of ¬£12,250 in ¬£1 shares, to exploit the invention. Sidney Crawford of Adelaide Motors, L. M. Anderson, R. Deaves (engineer) of St. Peters, H. F. Hobbs (inventor), and his father J. H. Hobbs were the directors. J. H. Hobbs was company chairman. Other investors were G. H. Scott (factory representative for New Zealand of Austin Motor Car Company, Limited. Wellington), W. G. T. Goodman (engineer), and Adelaide Motors Limited. Both of the Hobbs and R. Deaves also invested in the company. Hobbs sailed for England with his family to demonstrate the invention to engineers at Coventry. The Hobbs settled in Leamington Spa, and had two more children: John on 1 July 1933 and David on 9 June 1939. In 1932, after some satisfactory test results, another ¬£50,000 in shares was issued, and Sidney Crawford was elected Managing Director. No major auto manufacturer ever signed a contract, and the company was wound up in 1941. Hobbs persisted, and founded Hobbs Transmissions Ltd. at Leamington Spa in 1946. In 1950 he produced a hydraulically operated four-speed \\"Mechamatic\\" gearbox, which was lighter and more compact than the American models, and found a few buyers.

Jessica McBride, for the website Heavy described him as \\"one of the strongest voices for changes to gun laws in the wake of the mass shooting.\\"Heavy Magazine, February 22, 2018, Jessica McBride, Fred Guttenberg, Jaime‚Äôs Father: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know, Retrieved March 10, 2018 ==Activism== The day after the shooting, Guttenberg spoke out for gun control, stating \\"Don't tell me there's no such thing as gun violence. It happened in Parkland\\". Before the nationally televised CNN town hall he criticized the President for not saying guns are a problem in a White House listening session, saying \\"My daughter was hunted last week\\" and \\"'I am enraged\\". During the CNN town hall he confronted Florida Senator Marco Rubio for his position on guns. According to a report in The Guardian, Guttenberg's priorities include raising the minimum age to buy guns, adding a waiting period before gun sales, having a no-loopholes policy for a mandatory background check of the gun buyer, and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines and bump stocks. While he would prefer that assault-style weapons were banned entirely, he believes that given the current political reality, that such a ban would be unlikely to ever happen, and accordingly he is advocating for measures to reduce gun violence which have a realistic chance of passage. He told the Tampa Bay Times in March 2018 he has dedicated the rest of his life to fighting for gun safety. === NRA === He is a staunch critic of the National Rifle Association as well as its spokesperson Dana Loesch, and he criticized the NRA advertisement entitled Time Is Running Out, saying if a terrorist organization released a similar video, the terror threat level would raise. He told lawmakers that \\"All our legislators who stand with the NRA, they‚Äôre standing with a terrorist group.\\" He called on President Donald Trump to address threats made against survivors and their families and demand such behavior stop. Guttenberg noted that guns were prohibited by the Secret Service at the NRA convention in Dallas when vice president Mike Pence is scheduled to speak, and criticized the decision as hypocritical. Guttenberg said: === Political === Fred Guttenberg speaks to the press on Sheriff Scott Israel's suspension on January 11, 2019 In early March 2018 he traveled to Washington to speak at a US Senate hearing about taking steps to prevent further violence. While in the Washington area he spoke at a town hall in Alexandria, Virginia. Guttenberg's advocacy has been characterized by his refusal to sit down, with Democratic Florida Senator Bill Nelson explaining that Guttenberg \\"cannot talk about this sitting down.\\" A candidate for Florida's 22nd congressional district, Javier Manjarres, wrote on social media in July 2018, \\"C'mon Fred...stop exploiting her death in the name of some political agenda...your daughter was shot by some lunatic who had an AR-15, not by the gun itself. #Fixit #VoteJavi\\". Guttenberg responded that he would do everything possible to make sure that Manjarres would not \\"sniff the halls of Congress\\", and that \\"If you call honesty around gun safety exploitation, then you clearly have a political agenda.\\" On September 4, 2018, at a hearing for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination, Guttenberg introduced himself to Kavanaugh, who looked at him, but turned away without shaking his hand.Eli Rosenberg and Seung Min Kim, Washington Post, September 4, 2018, Brett Kavanaugh ‚Äòturned his back,‚Äô says father of Parkland victim who tried to shake his hand, Retrieved October 13, 2018 The encounter was the basis of a written question from the senators, to which Kavanaugh wrote that he did not recognize Guttenberg after having had a \\"chaotic morning\\". Guttenberg criticized Kavanaugh's response, calling it \\"less than genuine\\". On February 4, 2020, Guttenberg was invited to attend President Trump's State of the Union address. During the speech, Guttenberg attempted to shout over the President, and was asked to leave. The following day he apologized for the outburst, saying he let his emotions get the best of him. Guttenberg met with Ted Cruz and Alyssa Milano to discuss gun violence. He said this was \\"a really important day.\\" === Legal === In May 2018, Guttenberg and another parent whose child was killed in the massacre filed lawsuits against American Outdoor Brands, a company that makes the AR-15 assault rifle, and Sunrise Tactical Supply, a store that sold the weapon to the shooter, as being \\"complicit in the attack\\" that resulted in 17 deaths.NBC News, Matthew Vann, May 24, 2018, Parkland families sue gun manufacturer and dealer, citing complicity: The lawsuit challenges a 2001 Florida law prohibiting state and local governments from suing gun sellers if their merchandise is used unlawfully., Retrieved May 26, 2018, \\"...The parents of Jaime Guttenberg and Max Schacter say that American Outdoor Brands, the company that makes the AR-15 assault rifle used by the suspected shooter Nikolas Cruz, and Sunrise Tactical Supply, the store that sold it to him, are complicit in the attack...\\" The lawsuit is the first step in an effort to challenge a 2001 Florida law that protects gun makers and gun sellers from such lawsuits. ==Personal life== Guttenberg is a real estate agent and auto broker in Parkland, Florida. Guttenberg, who was raised in a Jewish family, struggled with his faith after his daughter's death; he ceased attending synagogue but remained on good terms with his rabbi. ==ReferencesFred Guttenberg on PBS NewsHour Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Activists from Florida Category:American gun control activists Category:People from Parkland, Florida Category:Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Category:People from East Northport, New York Category:American real estate brokers Category:Gun politics in the United States ","title":"Fred Guttenberg"},{"id":"56797759","text":"Pawe≈Ç Kasprzak Cezary Pawe≈Ç Kasprzak (born 26 March 1961 in Wroc≈Çaw) is a Polish political and human rights activist, one of the leaders of the Obywatele RP movement , and a professional TV producer.

This location is in Nwoya District, in the Northern Region of Uganda, approximately , upstream of the boundary of Murchison Falls National Park. Kiba is approximately , above sea level, and marks the point where the Kiba River enters the Nile. ==Overview== The government of Uganda commissioned a study, titled Project for Master Plan Study on Hydropower Development in the Republic of Uganda, that was conducted by Electric Power Development Company Limited and Nippon Koei Company Limited, which was funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), in 2009. In the report of that study, published in 2011, three large hydroelectric power stations were identified for immediate envelopment, in the 2013 to 2023 time-frame, namely Isimba Hydroelectric Power Station, Karuma Hydroelectric Power Station and Ayago Hydroelectric Power Station. Two other stations were identified for development in the medium term, after the first three, namely Oriang Hydroelectric Power Station (400 megawatts), and Kiba Power Station (initially 200 megawatts). ==Project development== On 27 May 2015 the government of Uganda signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with China Africa Investment and Development Company (CAIDC), calling for a detailed feasibility study that would lead to a Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (BOOT) agreement for the Kiba Hydroelectric Power Project and the associated transmission line works. In July 2017, more than two years from the MoU, with no tangible progress, the Uganda Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development terminated the MoU. If this dam is to be built, a new investor will have to be sourced. ==Other considerations== The JICA report outlined a possible phased approach, where the power station is built over a number of years and commissioned in phases, to conserve resources and avoid building over-capacity. ==See also== * Oriang Hydroelectric Power Station * Ayago Hydroelectric Power Station * Isimba Hydroelectric Power Station * Karuma Hydroelectric Power Station ==References * Government power projects face dark future as Energy Fund dries up As of 8 June 2017. * More hydro power stations in Uganda to be constructed As of 24 November 2015. * Karuma power plant paves way for more stations As of 17 August 2013.

This election was a part of national Italian general election of 1976 even if, according to the Italian Constitution, every senatorial challenge in each Region is a single and independent race. Lombardy obtained three more seats to the Senate, following the redistricting subsequent to the 1971 Census. The election was won by the centrist Christian Democracy, as it happened at national level. Seven Lombard provinces gave a majority or at least a plurality to the winning party, while the agricultural Province of Pavia and Province of Mantua preferred the Italian Communist Party. ==Background== The Italian Communist Party, which had annexed the Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity, strengthened under Enrico Berlinguer's leadership, reducing the gap with the Christian Democracy, which by its part obtained some votes from minor forces, as the Italian Liberal Party and the Italian Democratic Socialist Party, to face the red rising. ==Electoral system== The electoral system for the Senate was a strange hybrid which established a form of proportional representation into FPTP-like constituencies. A candidate needed a landslide victory of more than 65% of votes to obtain a direct mandate. All constituencies where this result was not reached entered into an at-large calculation based upon the D'Hondt method to distribute the seats between the parties, and candidates with the best percentages of suffrages inside their party list were elected. ==Results== -

The film is based on the 1955 novel The Good Shepherd by C. S. Forester, and also stars Stephen Graham, Rob Morgan, and Elisabeth Shue. The plot follows a commander of the US Navy on his first war-time assignment in command of a multi-national escort group defending a merchant ship convoy under attack by submarines in early-1942 during the Battle of the Atlantic, only months after the U.S. officially entered World War II. Greyhound was initially scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States on June 12, 2020 by Sony Pictures Releasing, but was eventually cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic after previously being delayed indefinitely. The distribution rights were then sold to Apple TV+, which released the film digitally on July 10, 2020. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the action sequences and effective use of the 90-minute runtime. ==Plot== During the Battle of the Atlantic, convoy HX-25, consisting of 37 Allied ships, is making its way to Liverpool. The convoy's escort consists of the USS Keeling, radio call sign Greyhound, captained by Commander Ernest Krause (Tom Hanks) of the United States Navy; the British Battle-class destroyer HMS James, call sign Harry; the Polish Grom-class destroyer ORP Viktor (with a Royal Navy liaison officer on the radio), call sign Eagle; and the Canadian , HMCS Dodge, call sign Dicky. The escort ships are also under the command of Krause. Despite his seniority, it is his first wartime command. The convoy enters the \\"Black Pit\\"‚Äîthe Mid-Atlantic gap where they will be out of range of protective air cover. While they are still three days away from the resumption of air cover, high-frequency direction finding (HUFFDUFF) from the convoy flagship reports to Greyhound that it has intercepted German transmissions that are likely from a U-boat (submarine). Greyhound's crew identifies the surfaced sub heading toward the convoy. Greyhound moves away from the convoy to intercept it based on its bearing and gets the U-boat within firing range, but the heavy seas allow the U-boat to dive before Greyhound can get a visual. After sonar contact is re-established, the submarine tries to slip under Greyhound, but Krause maneuvers Greyhound above the U-boat and fires a full pattern of depth charges, resulting in his first kill. The crew's jubilation is cut short as they soon receive reports of distress rockets at the rear of the convoy. A Greek merchant ship was attacked and is sinking. Krause moves Greyhound to assist, evading torpedoes fired by another U-boat in the process. After the rescue Greyhound returns to the convoy receiving multiple messages from the other escorts: a wolfpack of six more subs is staying just out of firing range of the convoy, which Krause suspects is waiting for nightfall in order to attack. As night falls, the attack commences with five merchant ships being torpedoed and sunk. One U-boat torpedoes an oil tanker and escapes Greyhound by using an underwater decoy to waste depth charges. Krause chooses to rescue survivors from the burning oil tanker before proceeding to the action at the rear of the convoy. The next day, the submariners mount an attack on Greyhound. The captain of the submarine Grey Wolf taunts the convoy and its escorts via radio transmission, threatening to sink them all. Krause learns that Greyhound is down to six depth charges. The U-boats launch multiple torpedo runs, which Greyhound is barely able to evade. Meanwhile both Dicky and Eagle take damage, with Eagle eventually sinking. Greyhound and Dicky combine to sink one of the U-boats in an exchange of surface broadsides. Greyhound is hit on the port side by one of the U-boat's deck guns, which kills Krause's mess attendant George Cleveland and two sailors. Krause elects to break radio silence by transmitting a single word, \\"help\\" to the Admiralty. On the last day in the Black Pit, the remaining U-boats mount an all-out attack. One of the torpedoes glances off the side of Greyhound as the destroyer barely manages to evade the other. After heavy fighting, Greyhound sinks the lead U-boat. To everyone's relief, they spot air support deployed from British RAF Coastal Command. With spotting assistance from Greyhound, a PBY Catalina bomber lines up on the last visible U-boat with depth charges, sinking it instantly. The remaining three subs are assumed to have slipped away. While assessing damage, Krause receives radio contact from the head of the relief escorts, HMS Diamond, that his relief has arrived and Greyhound is due for repair and refitting in Derry alongside his two surviving companion vessels. The crew receives a \\"job well done\\" on their four U-boat kills. As Krause turns over command to a junior officer all present on the bridge gaze at their Captain with new found respect. While setting the new course, the passengers and crew of one of the convoy ships cheer and send up flares to salute Greyhound's crew for their valor and victory at sea while Krause finally prays and rests. ==CastProduction== The museum ship USS Kidd served as the movie set It was announced in September 2016 that Tom Hanks was writing a screenplay about a World War II navy destroyer. Hanks would also star in the film. In February 2017, Aaron Schneider was brought on to direct, and Sony Pictures acquired the distribution rights. Pre-production photography took place in January 2018 at sea on board HMCS Montr√©al, a frigate of the Royal Canadian Navy. In March 2018, Stephen Graham, Elisabeth Shue, Rob Morgan, Karl Glusman, and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo were cast, and filming had commenced in Louisiana, aboard USS Kidd in Baton Rouge. ==Release== Greyhound was initially scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States by Sony Pictures Releasing under its Columbia label on March 22, 2019, before being delayed to May 8, 2020 and finally June 12, 2020. Like many other films, it was then removed from the release schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. In May 2020, it was announced Apple TV+ had acquired distribution rights to the film for about $70 million; Stage 6 Films was left as the sole Sony distributor as of the release of the film. It was released digitally by the service on July 10, 2020. Apple said that the film had the biggest debut weekend of any program in the platform's history, with Deadline Hollywood saying the figures were \\"commensurate with a summer theatrical box office big hit\\". ==Reception== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 79% based on 206 reviews, with an average rating of 6.48/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Greyhounds characters aren't as robust as its action sequences, but this fast-paced World War II thriller benefits from its efficiently economical approach.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Owen Gleiberman, in his review for Variety, said the film is \\"less a drama than a tense and sturdy diary of the logistics of battle\\" and \\"though much of the action is set in the open air of the ship's command perch, Greyhound often feels like a submarine thriller: tense, tight, boxed-in.\\" Writing for the Chicago Tribune, Michael Phillips gave the film three out of four stars and said: \\"Like the canine, [Greyhound is] trim, narrow of scope, and it runs efficiently and well despite a barrage of on-screen time stamps and vessel identification markers.\\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a \\"C‚àí\\" and wrote: \\"A terse and streamlined dad movie that's shorter than a Sunday afternoon nap and just as exciting, Greyhound bobs across the screen like a nuanced character study that's been entombed in a 2,000-ton iron casket and set adrift over the Atlantic. The film offers a handful of brief hints at the tortured hero who Forester invented for his book... but the whole thing is far too preoccupied with staying afloat to profile the guy at the helm in any meaningful way.\\" ==References* * Greyhound at History vs. Hollywood Category:2020 films Category:2020s action drama films Category:2020s war drama films Category:American films Category:American action drama films Category:American war drama films Category:American action war films Category:Apple TV+ original films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:FilmNation Entertainment films Category:Playtone films Category:Stage 6 Films films Category:Films postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Films not released in theaters due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Films directed by Aaron Schneider Category:Films produced by Gary Goetzman Category:Films scored by Blake Neely Category:Films set in 1941 Category:Films set in 1942 Category:Films set in San Francisco Category:Films shot in Louisiana Category:Films with screenplays by Tom Hanks Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films based on works by C.

Davis married Henry Landerkin Roy Davis in 1926 and shortly after, the couple moved from Quebec to British Columbia. == Professional projects  Hotel Vancouver === In the spring of 1939, Davis was one of several artists approached to execute decorative work for the Hotel Vancouver. Davis was recommended by the Vancouver Art Gallery to the Ornamental Bronze Co., which showed sample models of Davis' work to the hotel architect. Davis received a commission to create ornamental grills for the hotel. She produced clay and plaster models which were then sent to a foundry so that the metalwork could be cast in large quantities. The ornamental grills and light fixtures were installed around the tops of the walls in several large public rooms and halls in the building.Davis, Olea Marion : [artist file]. (Archival material, 1969). University of British Columbia Library. The decoration of the Hotel Vancouver was rushed to ensure that all work was completed by May 1939, in time for the Royal Visit, when King George VI and Queen Elizabeth stopped in Vancouver on the westbound portion of the 1939 Royal Tour.

Riley Snorton is an American scholar, author, and activist whose work focuses on historical perspectives of gender and race, specifically Black transgender identities. His publications include Nobody is Supposed to Know: Black Sexuality on the Down Low (University of Minnesota Press, 2014) and Black on Both Sides: A Racial History of Trans Identity (University of Minnesota Press, 2017). Snorton is currently Professor of English Language and Literature at the University of Chicago. In 2014 BET listed him as one of their \\"18 Transgender People You Should Know\\". ==Biography == C. Riley Snorton is transgender scholar and author. Snorton was born in the Bronx and raised in Wedgefield, SC, Sumter, SC and attended in high school in Atlanta, GA. He has 3 older siblings and one younger sibling. Snorton earned an A.B. in Women and Gender Studies at Columbia University (2003), an M.A. in Communication at the University of Pennsylvania (2008), and he also earned his Ph.D. in Communication and Culture, with graduate certificates in Africana Studies and Gender & Sexuality Studies from the University of Pennsylvania in 2010. He is a recipient of a predoctoral fellowship at the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute at Harvard University (2009), a Mellon postdoctoral fellowship at Pomona College (2010) and a National Endowment for the Humanities fellowship at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture (2015). He is currently Professor of English Language and Literature at the University of Chicago. ==Publications Books === *Black on Both Sides: A Racial History of Trans Identity. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 2017. In Snorton's second book he provides an attempt to mapping together histories of race, gender, and sexuality in the United States to examine the origins of modern black transgender identities. Although Snorton's research draws from medical texts and journalistic narratives he makes the effort of letting the reader know that Black on Both Sides is \\"not a history per se so much as it is a set of political propositions, theories of history, and writerly experiments\\"(6). Snorton is interested in complicating and acknowledging the ways that blackness and transness do not follow a linear trajectory of time. Instead, Snorton focuses on the ways in which ‚Äúblackness and transness emerge‚Äù from slavery to emancipation up until the popular use of the Internet in the 1990s. The book engages black feminist thought, queer- and trans-of-color critique, visual culture studies, and disability theory to explain ‚Äúhow the condensation of transness into the category of transgender is a racial narrative, as it also attends to how blackness finds articulation within transness‚Äù (8). Drawing on an ‚Äúeclectic archive‚Äù compiled of medical illustrations, fugitive slave narratives, true crime books, and more, Snorton suggests that ‚ÄúTo feel black in the diaspora, then, might be a trans experience‚Äù (8). He also addresses present-day anti-black and anti-trans violence, discussing in the preface of the book Laverne Cox, and the deaths of Tamara Dominguez and Black Lives Matter activist Blake Brockington. In 2018, Black on Both Sides won a Lambda Literary Award for Transgender Nonfiction. *Nobody is Supposed to Know: Black Sexuality on the Down Low.

After 10 years working with his step-brother Eduardo Cabra \\"Visitante\\" on Calle 13, the group disbanded in 2015 and both members followed their respective careers solo. Residente took a DNA test that revealed his roots trace back to 10 different locations around the world, which inspired him to produce a studio album, a documentary, and a book released by Univision's Fusion Media Group under the same title Residente. He wrote and recorded the project over the course of two years in the countries where his roots are, including Siberia, Moscow, China, the Caucasus, France, Spain, England, Armenia, South Ossetia, Antigua, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Niger, Serbia, and Puerto Rico. His first solo album Residente was released on March 31, 2017 and includes the singles \\"Somos Anormales\\" and \\"Desencuentro\\". The album peaked at number three in the US Latin Albums and at number one in the US World Albums charts. Residente also made his solo directorial debut and directed three music videos for the record. Residente was elected the best Latin album of 2017 by the critics of Billboard, as well as the 19th best album overall of the same year.

She was educated in Baltimore City Public Schools and received her bachelor's degree in education from Coppin State College (formerly known as Coppin Teacher's College). She also studied political science, government, personnel management, behavioral aspects of management, labor relations, and equal opportunity at Morgan State University, the Community College of Baltimore, George Washington University, the University of Maryland, and Fisk University. She taught in the Baltimore school system for about 12 years. In the Baltimore Urban League she worked as a volunteer in programs to provide job opportunities for youths. She was the first Director of Community Education and Relations of the Baltimore City Community Relation Commission and interpreted the City's civil rights law for the public via radio, television, movies, print media, workshops, and conferences. She conducted a local radio program Radio WEBB. She also wrote a weekly column in the Baltimore Afro American called \\"It's Not A Man's World\\" from 1969-1974. She was the first woman Insurance Compliance Specialist for the Social Security Administration, traveling across the country to monitore affirmative action programs of government Medicare contractors to ensure equality of opportunity for minorities and women. In July, 1969, she was appointed one of only three full-time National Directors of the Federal Women's Program which was established under Executive Order of the President. She served as a consultant for the former U.S. Civil Service Commission and lectured locally and nationally at conferences, workshops, and schools. In October, 1972, she was promoted to the position of Community Relations Officer for the Social Security Administration and later named Chief of the Headquarters Coordination and Liaison Staff, Office of Governmental Affairs. This staff served as the primary source of advice and information regarding the public's position on SSA Entitlement Programs. She retired from the Social Security Administration in May 1984. Through her affiliation with the organization Woman Power she worked with women to make them more politically aware and informed on current issues. She initiated the move to have sex included in the Provisions of Acts of Discrimination in the City Civil Rights Ordinance No. 103. The amendment was passed in August 1971 and signed into law by the Mayor. She was the first African-American chair of the Baltimore City Commission for Women. She was appointed by former Governor Harry Hughes to serve on the Eastern Region Foster Care Review Board for Baltimore City. The Honorable Parris N. Glendening presented a Governor's Citation to her, acknowledging the Valued Hours Award she received from the Fullwood Foundation.

The episode sees the return of former main character Roy Harper (Colton Haynes). It also sees the return of Thea donning her Speedy suit since the ninth episode of the fifth season. The episode stars Stephen Amell (Oliver Queen) who is joined by fellow main cast members David Ramsey (John Diggle), Emily Bett Rickards (Felicity Smoak), Katie Cassidy (Black Siren), Paul Blackthorne (Quentin Lance), Willa Holland (Thea Queen), Echo Kellum (Curtis Holt) and Juliana Harkavy (Dinah Drake). Main cast member Rick Gonzalez (Rene Ramirez) is also credited but does not appear in this episode. == Synopsis == The episode starts with Jean Loring, Oliver's solicitor in his impending trial coming to him hopeful that she could get the charges against him dropped due to Rene's testimony being illegally obtained. Quentin then walks in to inform Oliver that Laurel Lance / Black Siren from Earth-2 is posing as Earth-1's deceased Laurel Lance much to the disbelief of Oliver and Thea. Oliver, Thea and Quentin go to the Star City Police Department in the hope to stop Laurel from speaking to the press but they are too late. Meanwhile Curtis visits Rene's daughter Zoe to explain to her what happened to her father. In a meeting with the Star City district attorney, he reveals to Jean and Oliver that they are no longer using Rene's testimony and instead using Roy Harper's. After learning that Roy is the witness, Felicity Smoak and John Diggle discuss the situation with Thea and Oliver. After Laurel is taken from the hospital Dinah and Quentin find that there is corrupt officers in the police department who takes her to Anatoly Kynazev. Oliver and Diggle fight about Oliver being the Green Arrow again. Thea decides to go back out to the field to save Roy, she successfully gets into the hotel room where Roy is being held and kisses him after watching him get tortured. When SWAT shows up to the hotel, Oliver pulls Thea out to save Roy later. Dinah and Quentin are tasked to find the corrupt police officers in the department. When Laurel tells them that Diaz has Roy and where he is, Oliver, Thea and Diggle get ready to go after him. Dinah offers to join them, but Oliver declines her offer due to trust issues. After Roy is rescued, he and Thea go to bed and they were being watched by an unknown person. == Production == Colton Haynes returned in this episode as Roy Harper In December 2017, it was announced that Colton Haynes was returning as his character of Roy Harper after an absence since his last guest appearance in \\"Unchained\\" since leaving in the third season. Arrow executive producers said, \\"We‚Äôre thrilled to announce that Colton Haynes will be reprising his role as Roy Harper. Roy is called back to Star City to help resolve an urgent matter with high stakes for the team. His short visit turns into something surprising when he reunites with Thea and sparks a change in both of their lives that will have long-lasting consequences‚Ä¶.\\" It was also revealed that he would have a short arc beginning in this episode. == Reception == Jesse Schedeen of IGN rated the episode 7.0 and said about the episode \\"I was thrilled when it was announced that Haynes would be returning as Roy Harper this season. Haynes‚Äô presence has been missed on the show in recent years, both because he was a memorable part of the Team Arrow dynamic in Seasons 2 and 3 and because Thea never really made for a satisfying replacement in the vigilante sidekick department.\\" He added \\"It was also nice seeing Diaz actually demonstrate his martial arts prowess for a change. In the comics, Richard Dragon is one of a small handful of post- Batman-level martial artists, and it‚Äôs about time we started to get a sense of the physical powerhouse he can be. Hopefully we‚Äôll see some good Diaz/Ollie fisticuffs in the near future.\\" Schedeen finished the review with \\"This week's Arrow is a clear good news/bad news situation. The long-awaited return of Roy Harper amounted to very little, begging the question of why he was brought back into the picture in the first place. But the renewed focus on Ricardo Diaz is beginning to help turn around this season's overarching conflict. The question is whether there's enough time left to truly take advantage of this status quo upheaval.\\" Marc Buxton of Den of Geek said in his review \\"this is the first episode where I really felt Diaz as a force to be reckoned with. Cayden James was an effective villain but since the twist of Diaz murdering James went down, Diaz has been so much background noise. But Diaz's torture of Roy really elevates the villain.\\" A writer for Express Newsline, commented about this episode by saying \\"Right from the start of this episode, it quickly becomes clear that this Arrow episode will be a rough one for Oliver Queen. (Ignoring the season 5 episode where she tried to trick Ollie she was the real Laurel.) Yet the brilliance of this plot is how it puts Black Siren in such close quarters with Oliver and the gang. It's easy to forget just how much this show has changed and evolved over the past few years, but tossing Roy back into the ensemble really drove the point home. Now, she has escaped and is ready to resume her old life.\\" They also added \\"It was nice seeing Thea back in her Speedy uniform.\\" Nicholas Graff of Sciencefiction.com said \\"Well, this was one of the episodes we had been waiting for this season, the long- awaited return of Roy Harper to ‚ÄòArrow,‚Äô and I can say it was not exactly what I had expected. Some of the side-stories seemed a bit more interesting, and it definitely felt like a bit too open-ended (I know there‚Äôs a second half to it coming along in 2 weeks), so I am honestly not sure exactly how I felt about the episode.\\" He ended his review by saying \\"Solid episode, always good to see Roy, though I kind of wish he was back in a more permanent fashion, and I was kind of hoping to see him suit up and go out and fight with the team again, like old times (though at least they put him in a red hoodie at the end, that was a nice-callback). I like where the show is going, though I think I want to see some closure or something on the split team storyline soon before they go to all-out war with Diaz and his SCPD goons. And I‚Äôm definitely not happy that we have a break next week before the second half of the Roy arc. Ah well, see you back here in 2 weeks!\\" == References  External links == * * Category:2018 American television episodes Category:Arrow (TV series) episodes Category:Law enforcement in fiction Category:Television episodes set in hospitals ","title":"Doppelganger (Arrow)"},{"id":"56798368","text":"Romeo Mathieu, (1917 ‚Äì April, 1989) was a Canadian trade unionist, progressive political activist, and leading solidarity builder for the Quebec labour movement. Mathieu is best associated with his leading role in expanding the efforts of the United Packinghouse Workers of America (UPWA) into Quebec during the 1940s and 50s, and assisting with the merger between the UPWA and the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America in 1968. He also made a significant contribution to the creation of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union in 1979. In addition to his outstanding contributions to the labour movement, Mathieu was a standing member of the Quebec intelligensia during the 1950s and 60s, and served as a formidable presence in advancing many of the province's social movements, including the Quiet Revolution. == Early life == Mathieu was born in Montreal, Quebec in 1917 and displayed a hunger for politics at an early age. Unlike most other boys in Quebec during this period, Mathieu demonstrated little to no interest in hockey or sports in general. Instead, he became a political animal and strove to be his uncle's protege, who was a professional organizer for the Liberal Party of Canada. He was educated at the Technical Institute of Montreal, where he learned mechanics and technical drawing, and graduated on the eve of the Great Depression. The experiences of the Great Depression had a profound impact on Mathieu, resulting in a paradigm shift for his worldview, political beliefs and associations. Soon thereafter, he abandoned his childhood affiliation to the Liberal Party, and, instead, embraced the emerging, and more radical, views of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). == Packinghouse worker organizing == One day in 1938, while taking a lunch break from his job in the credit department of a Montreal store, a curious, young Romeo Mathieu dropped into a union meeting, and listened to an organizer from the garment workers. From then on his life was with the labour movement. His first project was organizing workers at the Dominion Engineering Works in Longueuil, Quebec for the International Association of Machinists. The organizing drive was successful, and the new local union elected Mathieu as its full-time president. Mathieu soon made a name for himself in Quebec's labour circles, and rapidly gained a reputation for being a highly effective and, indeed, fierce union mobilizer. Before long, he became active in the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada (TLC), eventually serving on the federation's executive during the mid-1940s. TLC president Percy Bengough took special notice of Mathieu and recommended him to lead the federation's nascent organizing strategy, and corresponding campaign, for packinghouse workers. Mathieu excelled at the challenge and helped create Montreal's first packinghouse workers' union, the Packinghouse Butchers and Allied Workers Union, which was chartered with the TLC. Naturally, Romeo Mathieu served as the new union's first leader. == Master bargaining in meat sector == Mathieu was a staunch supporter of the \\"One Industry, One Union\\" movement and in 1946 he led the Packinghouse Butchers and Allied Workers Union toward a merger with the United Packinghouse Workers of America (UPWA). Always keen to put the full might of the UPWA to the cause, Mathieu led the negotiating committee that struck the \\"big three\\" of Canada's meat packing industry: Canada Packers, Burns, and Swift in 1947. The action further secured the master bargaining model that was achieved for packinghouse workers during the Second World War. The model won through Mathieu's negotiating prowess and the leadership of UPWA Canadian Director Fred Dowling became the standard across Canada, and ushered in a new era of higher living standards for generations of packinghouse workers. The system survived until the mid-1980s when Burns triggered a decade long period of brinkmanship and excessively hard bargaining that resulted in some of the largest and most violent strikes in Canadian history, and ultimately led to the end of pattern bargaining in the country's meat sector. Beyond the meat sector, Mathieu was often called upon by other unions or central labour federations to get the parties beyond impasse, including the nationwide postal strike in 1968, which was ultimately resolved by him after the Canadian Union of Postal Workers invited Romeo to act as their chief negotiator. == Building solidarity in Quebec == Through the 1940s, dual federations and unions competed for affiliates and sectors, which thereby allowed employers to pit one union against another. Mathieu, in addition to crafting mergers within his own unions and sectors, played a key role in merging Quebec's labour federations. In particular, he made a significant contribution to the creation, expansion and development of the province's main labour body, the F√©d√©ration des travailleurs et travailleuses du Qu√©bec (FTQ)/Quebec Federation of Labour (QFL). The FTQ/QFL was the result of the 1957 merger of the Provincial Federation of Labour of Qu√©bec (PFLQ) and the Federation of Industrial Trade Unions of Qu√©bec (FITQ)/F√©d√©ration des unions industrielles du Qu√©bec (FUIQ), where Mathieu served as the secretary-general, and displayed tremendous leadership in spearheading the effort to bring the two federations together. As the FTQ's first secretary-general, Mathieu helped orient the new Quebec labour federation toward the more militant approach favoured by the industrial unions of the FITQ (i.e., in contrast to the less militant approach of the craft unions of the PFLQ). Unlike other labour federations in the province, the FTQ kept its distance from the Maurice Duplessis government, took some militant stands ‚Äì in keeping with its industrial tendencies ‚Äì like the Murdochville Strike in 1957, and, eventually, supported the New Democratic Party of Canada, once it was founded in 1961. Mathieu undoubtedly also played an important role in the creation of the Canadian Labour Congress in 1956, following the merger of the TLC and the Canadian Congress of Labour, where Romeo served on the executive council. From 1956 until his retirement in 1983, Mathieu served as a vocal and highly respected member of the CLC's executive board. == Quiet Revolution == In the political arena, and in the leading intellectual and social movements of his day, Mathieu joined other young activist ‚Äì such as Pierre Trudeau, G√©rard Pelletier, Jean Marchand, Philippe Vaillancourt, Jean-Paul Lefebvre, and Ren√© L√©vesque ‚Äì in pushing for the fall of the Maurice Duplessis regime, and the rise of the Quiet Revolution, which began in the 1960s and left an indelible impact on Quebec. Firmly committed to his belief that political action and trade unionism were, and must be, interwoven, Mathieu is quoted as saying. \\"A worker is every bit a citizen too and the two can never be separated. It is sheer irresponsibility for unions to concern themselves with only work-place problems.\\" == Merging the food workers == In keeping with Mathieu's lifelong commitment to the \\"One industry, one union\\" concept, he played a pivotal role in the merger between the United Packinghouse Workers of America and the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America (AMCBW) in 1968, creating the Canadian Food and Allied Workers (CFAW) in Canada (for internal political reasons); however, in the United States UPWA ceased to exist as a brand, and its members became members of the AMCBW. Following the merger in Canada, the CFAW was led by the indefatigable Fred Dowling as its leader, and Mathieu serving as the obvious second-in-command and heir apparent. Upon Dowling's retirement in 1973, Mathieu became the leader of the CFAW, and, as such, the Canadian director of the AMCBW. Six years later, Mathieu, once again, played a defining role in yet another major merger. This time with the creation of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union in 1979, which, in Quebec, would have relied upon Romeo's very seasoned and sage hand leading the way. From 1979 until his retirement in 1983, Mathieu served the UFCW as an international vice-president, and as the director of region 18, which included all of the new union's Canadian members who once belonged the Amalgamated Meat Cutters. == Awards == On October 5, 1983, Mathieu became one of very few labour leaders to be invested into the Order of Canada for his role as \\"the former regional director and vice-president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and founder of the F√©d√©ration des Unions industrielles du Qu√©bec. In recognition of nearly a half century of hard work on behalf of his union brothers and sisters as a labour leader and negotiator.\\" In appreciation for his role in creating the union ‚Äì and the five decades of activism and commitment that helped make it possible ‚Äì UFCW Local Unions in Canada, by way of the UFCW Canada national council, established an annual scholarship in Mathieu's honour, which every year awards 18 $1,000 scholarship prizes to UFCW Canada members or their children, toward post- secondary tuition and associated costs.

He was a member of the Legislative Yuan between 1993 and 2002, then served from 2005 to 2012. ==Academic and early career== Tsao attended Matsu High School, and graduated from Central Police University. He then worked for the Lienchiang County Police Department and was a lecturer at Taiwan Police College. ==Political career== Tsao helped reach what became the Kinmen Agreement, signed in 1990. He first won election to the Legislative Yuan in 1992, and represented the Lienchiang County Constituency until 2002. In 1999, during his third term, Tsao helped negotiate the return of the Taiwanese vessel Shin Hwa from China. He was a proponent of the three links, and believed that their establishment would aid economic development in the outlying islands of Taiwan. In 2001, Tsao visited Fujian as part of a pilgrimage for the goddess Mazu. He returned to China later that month to sign an unofficial agreement with government officials of Mawei District. The Mainland Affairs Council called the move a \\"person-to-person exchange\\" that \\"had no legal bearing,\\" and warned neighboring Kinmen against a similar action. Subsequently, the MAC announced its Eight Noes\\" policy regarding exchanges with China. After Lee Yuan-tsu was prevented from attending APEC China 2001 as a representative of Taiwan's government, Tsao stated of the Kuomintang legislative caucus, \\"We agree with the government's decision not to participate in the APEC summit and condemn China's rough treatment of Taiwan's delegation that is already in Shanghai.\\" Tsao lost reelection in December 2001. Before stepping down, he helped pass amendments to the Offshore Islands Development Act, permitting more Taiwanese to visit China via the outlying islands. Tsao contested the 2004 legislative elections as an independent, and won. He was seated as a representative from Lienchiang County. A month after taking office, Tsao joined Kuomintang officials on a trip to China. He remained a staunch supporter of the three links, additionally backing landing visa privileges for Chinese visitors to Taiwan. Previously, in August 2005, he had spoken out against a planned reduction in military personnel stationed in the Matsu Islands. He proposed a full ban on land mines that December. Tsao defeated Lin Hui-kuan in the 2008 legislative elections. During this session, the Citizen Congress Watch ranked Tsao as one of the worst legislators. He began taking an interest in transportation, infrastructure, and civil order. Specifically, Tsao supported official designation of demonstration zones, and opposed the lax employment protections at free ports, as well as a proposal for Taoyuan International Airport to be exempt from most government oversight. Tsao later stated that Taiwanese nationals should be given preferential consideration for management positions at the airport because it is a state-owned enterprise. He was elected chair of the legislature's Transportation Committee alongside Lin Chien-jung in March 2009. Two months later, while discussing an amendment to the Act for Promotion of Private Participation in Infrastructure Projects that would permit Chinese investment in Taiwanese infrastructure projects, Tsao opined that the proposed change was legal. Upon hearing the statement, Democratic Progressive Party lawmakers prevented Tsao from taking his seat. He then adjourned the meeting and scheduled a second discussion which the DPP boycotted. Tsao worked to market his constituency to tourists. He urged the government to place Chinese tourists under a free independent tourist policy, and defended them publicly on occasion. Tsao also pushed for more funding through the Offshore Islands Development Fund. In March 2011, Tsao proposed an amendment to the Act for the Development of Tourism that would allow chain convenience stores to sell tickets for maritime and air transportation. The motion passed and was implemented that same month. Tsao yielded his legislative seat to Chen Hsueh-sheng in 2012. After leaving the legislature, Tsao led the Chinese Taipei Road Running Association. In October 2017, Tsao became the first directly elected leader of the Kuomintang's Lienchiang County chapter. ==References== Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Taiwanese police officers Category:Central Police University alumni Category:Members of the 2nd Legislative Yuan Category:Members of the 3rd Legislative Yuan Category:Members of the 4th Legislative Yuan Category:Members of the 6th Legislative Yuan Category:Members of the 7th Legislative Yuan Category:Lienchiang County Members of the Legislative Yuan Category:Kuomintang Members of the Legislative Yuan in Taiwan ","title":"Tsao Erh-chung"},{"id":"56798554","text":"Thomas Dove Keizur (his name is incorrectly spelled Keizer, Keiser, Kaizur, Kaiser, Keysur, Keyser, Kizer, or Kisor in various documents) was one of the earliest American pioneers to settle in the Oregon Country. In 1843, he led his large family from Missouri to Oregon over the Oregon Trail. He homesteaded in Oregon's Willamette Valley in an area north of modern-day Salem, Oregon. Keizur was one of eight citizens elected to serve on Oregon's third pre- provisional legislative committee which helped lay the foundation for the establishment of the Oregon Territory. He was also the first captain of the Oregon Rangers, the first militia unit organized in Oregon. Today, the city of Keizer, Oregon, is named in his honor. == Early life == Keizur was born on 20 November 1793 in Buncombe County, North Carolina. His parents were George A. and Mary (Dove) Keisur.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \\"Keizer\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 526.\\"The Trail to Oregon\\", They Lived Along a Rocky River, WordPress, San Francisco, California, posted 14 March 2014; accessed 18 February 2018. Keizur married Mary Girley in 1812. Together, they had ten children, five boys and five girls.Lossner, Ann, \\"Keizer‚Äôs First Families, Part 1: The Keizurs and Pughs\\", Keiser Times, Keizer, Oregon, 30 May 1980 (article reprinted from the book, Looking Back People and Places in the Early Keizer Area with the permission of its author, pp. 5‚Äì7). In 1828, the Keizurs moved from North Carolina to Giles County, Tennessee. Five years later, he moved further west to Van Buren County, Arkansas.\\"T. D. Keizur Statue\\", City of Keizer, Keizur, Oregon, accessed 15 February 2018.Wild, Tammy, Keizer, Arcadia Publishing, Charleston, South Carolina, 2015, pp. 10‚Äì11. In 1842, the Keizur family traveled to Missouri hoping to join an emigrant wagon train bound for the Oregon County. However, they arrived too late to start crossing the continent with that year's migration. As a result, the family spent a year in Missouri waiting for the 1843 wagon train to form up.\\"1842 In the East\\", Oregon Trail Timeline 1841‚Äì1843, oregon.com, Oregon Interactive, McMinnville, Oregon, accessed 18 February 2018. == Oregon Trail == Keizur and his family left Independence, Missouri, for Oregon on 20 May 1843. On the journey to Oregon, Keisur was joined by his wife, five sons, five daughters, two sons-in- law, eight grandchildren, and a brother of one of his sons-in-law.\\"1843 The Oregon Trail\\", New Perspectives on the West, Oregon Public Broadcasting, Portland, Oregon, accessed 18 February 2018. There were over one hundred wagons and approximately 900 pioneers traveling west to Oregon in 1843. In addition, the pioneers brought a herd of 5,000 cattle that followed as the wagons moved along the trail. The trek was guided by Marcus Whitman, who was returning to his mission station on the Columbia River.Hanson, T. J., \\"1843 Emigrants\\", Oregon Country, The Story of the 1843 Oregon Trail Migration, Inkwater Press, Portland, Oregon, 2006. To prevent over grazing along the route the pioneers divided into smaller traveling groups. The Keizurs joined what became known as the Applegate party, which traveled slowly with the cattle herd. Along the trail, Keiser became an active leader among the emigrants.Thompson, G. N., \\"Early Days Recalled, Story of Keizer Real Saga of the West\\", Statesman Journal, Salem, Oregon 14 November 1929, p. 6.Thompson, G. N., \\"New School at Keiser Recalls Early History of the Community\\", Statesman Journal, Salem, Oregon 15 September 1940, p. 10. The Keizurs covered over on the Oregon Trail. First, their wagon train followed the Platte River and then headed north to Fort Laramie in Wyoming. From there, they followed the North Platte River and the Sweetwater River before crossing the continental divide at South Pass in central Wyoming. Once on the west side of the continental divide, the wagon train headed for Fort Bridger and then turned north to Fort Hall. From there, the party followed the Snake River and then the Columbia River to the Willamette Valley. It took six months for the Keizurs and their fellow emigrants to cross the continent. == Oregon pioneer == The Keizur family arrived in the Willamette Valley in mid-November. They spent the winter in temporary quarters on the west bank of the Willamette River across from the Methodist mission station at Mill Creek which had been established by Jason Lee. In the spring of 1844, the family re-crossed the river and established a number claims on the west bank. The Keizur family land claims were north of the mission. In total, the adult members of the Keizur family claimed of farm land along the Willamette River.Historic Thomas Dove Keizur Tour video narrated by Jerry McGee, KeizerTV.com, Keizer, Oregon, 6 February 2010.\\"Donation Land Claim\\", City of Keizer, Keizer, Oregon, accessed 15 February 2018. Thomas Keizur himself claimed . He filed his claim under the provisional government's original land act. His property was bordered on the west by the Willamette River. To the north his land ended at Cummings Lane, a road that was built by the Keizur family. The eastern boundary was River Road and then Cheery Avenue heading south to what is today Salem Industrial Drive. The southern boundary ran from the junction of Cheery Avenue and Salem Industrial Drive west to the river. After Oregon became a United States territory, Keizur refiled his claim in accordance with the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850. In 1844, Keizur was one of eight citizens elected to the Oregon Country's third pre-provisional legislative committee. He was one of the three representatives from the Champoeg district. This was the first legislative body in the Oregon Country selected in a regular election. Members of the two previous legislative committees were selected at open public meetings. The committee met twice. Both sessions were held in Oregon City. The first meeting was at the home of Felix Hathaway from 18 to 27 June 1844. The second meeting took place at the home of Doctor John E. Long from 16 to 21 December the same year. These meetings helped lay the foundation for the establishment of the Oregon Territory.\\"1844 Meetings (3rd Pre-Provisional): June 18-27, December 16-21\\", Pre-Provisional Government, Oregon Legislative and Staff Guide, Oregon State Archives, accessed 9 February 2018.Carey, Charles H., \\"Under Provisional Government\\", General History of Oregon, Pioneer Historical Publishing Company, Portland, Oregon, 1922, p. 389.Scott, H.

In 1844, a dispute between settlers and a local Indian lead to several deaths at Willamette Falls near Oregon City. After the deaths, a citizens committee of Willamette Valley residents met on 9 March 1844 to discuss forming a militia. The committee was chaired by W. H. Wilson with Keizur serving as the meeting secretary. The committee approved formation of a mounted rifle company to protect settlers. As a result, a militia company of 25 men, known as the Oregon Rangers, was organized. Keizur was elected captain of the company. Keizur was duly commissioned by the executive committee of Oregon's provisional government. This was the first military unit authorized and formed in the Oregon Country. The company met several times for training, but was not called into action.Carey, Charles H., \\"Indian Relations\\", General History of Oregon, Pioneer Historical Publishing Company, Portland, Oregon, 1922, p. 542.Grey, William Henry, A History of Oregon, 1792-1849: Drawn from Personal Observation and Authentic Information, Harris and Holman, Portland, Oregon, 1870, pp. 371-373. In 1846, a special citizens meeting was held at the farm of Daniel Waldo to discuss the need for a militia company. Keizur was elected chairman of the meeting. Attendees voted reestablish the Oregon Rangers mounted rifle company. Charles Bennett was appointed captain of the company. After the meeting, 45 attendees volunteered to serve in the company. Keizur signed the meeting minute which were published in the Oregon Spectator newspaper.\\"Willamette May 22, 1846\\", Oregon Spectator, Oregon City, Oregon Territory, 11 June 1846, p. 1.Brown, James Henry, Brown's Political History of Oregon, Lewis and Dryden Printing Company, Portland, Oregon, 1892, pp. 127-236. During the 1851‚Äì1852 session of the Oregon Territorial Legislature Keizur and two other citizen were appointed to a commission tasked with determining the route of a territorial road between Lafayette in Yamhill County to Salem in Marion County. It appears that Keizur was unable to participate in the commission since records show that another citizen ended up serving in his place. When the proposed route was finally announced in 1853, Keizur and other Marion County residents signed a petition against building the road along the proposed route. As a result of the protest, the road was not built.\\"Oregon Legislature, Monday, Jan. 17\\", Weekly Oregon Statesman, Salem, Oregon 29 January 1853, p. 2. Keizur's wife, Mary, died in 1853. Keizur died on 19 June 1871 in Marion County, Oregon. He was 78 years old at the time of his death.Lynn, Capi, \\"Keizer History Tour\\", Statesman Journal, Salem, Oregon, 2 August 2017. == Legacy == Keizur's service in the 1844 pre- territorial legislature helped lay the groundwork for Oregon's territorial government and eventual statehood. When he was elected captain of the Oregon Rangers, he became the state's first militia commander and thus the founding leader of what is today the Oregon National Guard. The Keiser post office was established in 1948, as a Salem delivery station. On 2 November 1982, the city of Keizer was incorporated and named in honor of Thomas D. Keizur. At the time, the city's population was 19,650. The city continues to grow. As of 2016, the estimated population of Keizer was 38,980.\\"About Keizer\\", City of Keizer, Keizur, Oregon, accessed 15 February 2018.\\"Keizer city, Oregon\\", Quick Facts, United States Census Bureau, Washington, District of Columbia, accessed 19 February 2018. In 2010, a large bronze statue of Keizur on horseback was installed at the Keizer Civic Center. The statue honors Keizur for his service in pre-territorial legislature and as commander of the state's first military organization. It also recognized him as the founding father of the city of Keizer. Keizur's last name is spelled incorrectly in various military documents, land deeds, state records, history books, and newspaper articles. Researchers have found 15 different spelling including Keizer, Keiser, Kaizur, Kaiser, Keysur, Keyser, Kizer, and Kisor. However, the correct spelling is Keizur. == References  External links == *Oregon Legislative Guide *City of Keizer‚ÄîT. D.

VAG is a wholly owned subsidiary of St√§dtischen Werke N√ºrnberg (Nuremberg Municipal Works), and a member of the Verkehrsverbund Gro√üraum N√ºrnberg (VGN; Integrated Transport Association of Greater Nuremberg). ==HistoryN√ºrnberg-F√ºrther Stra√üenbahn=== On April 12, 1881, entrepreneur Heinrich Alfes from Bremen received a charter for the manufacture and operation of a Pferdebahn, a horse- drawn streetcar. The first line began operation on August 25, 1881, on the route Staatsbahnhof (current Nuremberg Hauptbahnhof) - Lorenzkirche - Pl√§rrer - Bauerngasse. In 1883, the enterprise was reorganized into a private Aktiengesellschaft with the name N√ºrnberg-F√ºrther Stra√üenbahn-Gesellschaft, or Nuremberg-F√ºrth Streetcar Company. The company expanded to three lines, and between 1896 and 1898 all lines were electrified. ===Municipal Ownership=== In 1903, the company was taken over by the city of Nuremberg and operated under the name N√ºrnberg-F√ºrther Stra√üenbahn. . Under municipal ownership, the streetcar operation saw steady growth. Although growth slowed during the First World War and the Great Depression, by 1939 the network around Nuremberg and F√ºrth had reached 20 lines, including one express line. . Busses were introduced in 1923 and expanded to 60 busses by 1929. In 1934, all public works were combined under one organization, and the streetcar division was given the name St√§dtische Werke N√ºrnberg, Abteilung Stra√üenbahn, or Nuremberg Public Works, Streetcar Division. However, the streetcars continued to use signage with the name N√ºrnberg-F√ºrther Stra√üenbahn through 1981. In 1939, the public works were again reorganized as Werke und Bahnen der Stadt der Reichsparteitage N√ºrnberg, Stra√üenbahn (Utilities and Trains of the City of the Reichsparty Nuremberg, Streetcars). Immediately following the Second World War, the division was renamed Werke und Bahnen der Stadt N√ºrnberg, Stra√üenbahn (Utilities and Trains Nuremberg, Streetcars), and on December 1, 1945, it was combined into the St√§dtische Werke N√ºrnberg ‚Äì Verkehrsbetriebe (Nuremberg Municipal Works - Transport Operations). During the war, 95% of the overhead wires were destroyed, along with all of the depots. The streetcar network was rebuilt completely by 1955, and streetcars were supplemented with trolleybusses starting in 1948. ===Verkehrs-Aktiengesellschaft N√ºrnberg=== In 1959, the municipal utilities of Nuremberg were reorganized, and the Verkehrs- Aktiengesellschaft N√ºrnberg (VAG) was established as an independent enterprise, wholly owned by the St√§dtische Werke N√ºrnberg GmbH. The system busses started using the new VAG name immediately, although the streetcars still displayed the N√ºrnberg-F√ºrther Stra√üenbahn name until 1981. ==ServicesBus=== Nuremberg Bus NetworkAs of 2016, VAG operated 59 bus lines throughout Nuremberg. In addition to covering most areas within the city, 16 of the busses continue into neighboring areas including F√ºrth, Erlangen, and Schwabach. The city has designed many of the bus routes, and especially the Ring Lines, to feed commuters into other modes of public transportation such as streetcars, S-Bahn, and subway. leftOn weekend and holiday nights, VAG also operates the NightLiner in conjunction with the Erlanger Stadtwerke Stadtverkehr GmbH (ESTW), infra f√ºrth verkehr gmbh (infra), and the Omnibusverkehr Franken (OVF). 28 NightLiner lines depart from the central Nuremberg Hauptbahnhof throughout the city and the surrounding region. ===Trams=== Nuremberg Transport NetworkThe streetcar network of the VAG encompasses 5 lines and 79 stops over a track length of 36 km. ===U-Bahn=== The three subway lines operating in Nuremberg cover a track length of 36 km. All three lines meet at the central stations of Nuremberg Hauptbahnhof and Pl√§rrer. ==References * VAG web site (German language) Category:Transport in Nuremberg Nuremberg Nuremberg Nuremberg Nuremberg ","title":"Verkehrs-Aktiengesellschaft N√ºrnberg"},{"id":"56798566","text":"The De La Galette River (French: \\"Rivi√®re de la Galette\\") is a tributary of the southern shore of Gouin Reservoir (Bouzanquet Bay), flowing into the territory of the town of La Tuque, in the administrative region of the Mauricie, in Quebec, in Canada.

Nigerian-born, he caught the attention of recruiters with Basketball Without Borders and was offered a scholarship to play basketball in the United States despite not playing the game until he was 13. He is not related to Kelenna Azubuike, who played parts of four seasons for the Golden State Warriors and is currently the color analyst for their television broadcasts. ==High school career== Azubuike attended Potter's House Christian Academy in Jacksonville, Florida. His then assistant coach Harry Coxsome and his wife Donna took care of him and soon became his legal guardians.

Udoka started every game of the regular season but missed the Big 12 tournament after spraining his left MCL. He returned for the NCAA tournament until KU's loss to eventual champion Villanova in the Final Four. He averaged 13.0 points, 7.0 rebounds, 1.7 blocks, and led the nation with a 77% field goal percentage for the season. His field goal percentage broke the single-season record for Kansas and the Big 12 Conference. This high percentage was in part due to the majority of his field goals being slam dunks, which typically have a higher completion percentage than jump shots or layups. He had more dunks than any other college player going back to the 2009‚Äì2010 season. He was awarded All-Big 12 third team by the conference's coaches and second team by the AP. On 20 April 2018, Azubuike announced his intention to the 2018 NBA Draft. He did not initially hire an agent, which would allow him to return before the combine. Azubuike was one of a record- high 69 prospects invited to the NBA Draft Combine that year.

Usually the entire name is used again and again, but sometimes a root of a name may be reused in several different forms. A leading name could function as a sort of \\"moral property\\", where only those of the lineage had a right to use it and it was expected that nobody else would do so. Both the Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties of Frankish kings drew from a repertoire of names that were rarely or never used by other families. Names could be passed on from the paternal or maternal side, often depending on which ancestors were more prominent. The idea of tracing lineages and proposing genealogies based on analysis of leading names is old. In 1043, when Abbot Poppo of Stavelot opposed the marriage of the Emperor Henry III to Agnes of Poitou on grounds of consanguinity, he traced the ancestry of Henry's mother: \\"the descent of the genealogy is achieved through Mathildas and Gerbergas, in such a way that Mathilda, the daughter of Gerberga (with the same name as her grandmother) called her daughter by her mother's name, and she left her own name as an inheritance to her granddaughter.\\" ==NotesSources== * * Category:Onomastics ","title":"Leading name"},{"id":"56798688","text":"Alexis \\"Alex\\" Gravel (born March 21, 2000) is a Canadian major junior ice hockey goaltender who currently plays for the Halifax Mooseheads of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). Gravel was selected in the sixth round, 162nd overall, by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft. ==Playing career== Before being drafted into major junior hockey, Gravel played two seasons for the Missasauga Senators of the Greater Toronto Hockey League and was selected 20th overall in the second round of the 2016 QMJHL Entry Draft by the Halifax Mooseheads. Gravel began playing for the Mooseheads the following season, the 2016‚Äì17 season. In his first season with the team he played 50 games with 17 wins, 24 losses, and 3 overtime losses. Gravel had one shutout and had a (.894) save percentage and played 6 games in the playoffs for Halifax, the team was eliminated in the first round in 6 games by the Rouyn-Noranda Huskies. Gravel was a nominee for the Raymond Lagac√© Trophy, which is the award given annually to the QMJHL's best defensive rookie of the year. In his second season with the Mooseheads, Gravel found himself starting in fewer games and with a declining save percentage. He later admitted he was no longer enjoying the game, saying, \\"Mentally, I just wasn‚Äôt there. I think that screwed me a little bit.\\" Gravel was selected 162nd overall by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft. A summer of enhanced workouts, together with hands-on training with Blackhawks developmental goalie coach Peter Aubrey, helped to refocus Gravel's attention for the 2018‚Äì19 QMJHL season. Starting in 49 games for the Mooseheads, he finished the regular season with 33 wins and a .913 save percentage, leading the team to first place in the league's Eastern Conference. In the QMJHL President Cup playoffs, Gravel backstopped the Mooseheads to its best finish in seven seasons, winning 14 of 23 games en route to a 4‚Äì2 series loss to the Rouyn-Noranda in the league final. The two teams would meet again in the final of the 2019 Memorial Cup, the national championship of the Canadian Hockey League, by virtue of the Halifax's status as tournament host. While the Mooseheads would drop a 4‚Äì2 decision to the Huskies in the championship game, Gravel was awarded the Hap Emms Memorial Trophy as the tournament's best goalie, with a save percentage of .918 and a goals-against average of 2.78. Gravel was also named to the tournament all-star team. ==International play== Gravel was born in Germany but represents Canada in international competition. He was a goalie for Canada at the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics where he played in 4 games for Canada, earning a (.902) save percentage. Gravel also competed for Canada men's national under-18 ice hockey team and was named to the 2017 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament, a tournament not sanctioned by the International Ice Hockey Federation, winning gold with Canada, and defeating the Czech Republic 4‚Äì1. Gravel played only one game for Canada in the tournament, earning a (3.69) goals against average with a (.857) save percentage. ==Personal life== Gravel was born in Berlin, Germany but grew up in Asbestos, Quebec. He is the son of Francois Gravel, a former professional ice hockey goaltender who was selected in the 3rd round, 87th overall in the 1987 NHL Entry Draft by the Montreal Canadiens and also represented France in the 1998 Winter Olympics.

The lagoons eastern boundary is Spenard Road. To the south are single and multi-family homes, Hillcrest Drive and West Anchorage High School. The lagoon is bisected by Minnesota Drive, forming two distinct lakes. The lagoon, as well as its man-made islands and parks make up the Margaret Eagan Sullivan Park. Since 1975, the Municipality of Anchorage has designated the park a waterfowl sanctuary. ==History== In the early 1960s, the Municipality of Anchorage began implementing plans to protect the Chester Creek watershed, a system of creeks that carry rain and melt-water from the slopes of the nearby Chugach Mountains, incorporating the area into an urban renewal plan for the city in 1963. The railroad levee was built in 1968, and the city subsequently expanded the area by buying property along the areas perimeter in 1974. In 1975, the area was designated a bird sanctuary, and three man-made islands were completed. Also in 1975, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the Audubon Society planted native grasses in the area. In 1976, the city began forming plans to restore the natural habitat of the area, which was completed in 1977. In 1978, the lagoon was drained to allow crews to remove one of the three islands. Vandals targeted the lagoon in 1979, opening locks on the levee, and draining the lagoon. The city responded by installing a more secure system. On September 30, 1993, the lagoon and surrounding parkland were rededicated as the Margaret Eagan Sullivan Park, named after the late wife of former Anchorage Mayor George M. Sullivan. ==Recreational use== In addition to its function as a bird sanctuary and part of the local trail system, Westchester Lagoon is a popular recreation area. During the winter months, when the lagoon is frozen over, it is used as an ice skating rink, which is groomed and maintained by the city. A disc golf course runs through the lagoon area, and a snack bar operates during the summer months. ==Gallery== File:Aythya marila1.jpgA greater scaup swimming in Westchester Lagoon File:Anchorage skyline as seen from the Tony Knowles Coastal Trail.jpgThe Anchorage skyline, seen looking north from Westchester Lagoon ==References== Category:1963 establishments in Alaska Category:1968 in rail transport Category:1975 establishments in Alaska Category:1993 establishments in Alaska Category:Bird sanctuaries of the United States Category:Bodies of water of Anchorage, Alaska Category:History of Anchorage, Alaska Category:Lagoons of Alaska ","title":"Westchester Lagoon"},{"id":"56798720","text":"is the Head coach of the Aomori Wat's in the Japanese B.League. ==Head coaching record== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Aomori Wat's  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"2018  22913 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"5th in B2 Eastern---  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"- -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Aomori Wat's  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2018-19  601545 style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 6th in B2 Eastern---  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"- -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Aomori Wat's  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"2019-20  472126 style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 4th in B2 Eastern---  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"- - ==References== Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Aomori Wat's coaches Category:Japanese basketball coaches ","title":"Noriyuki Kitaya"},{"id":"56798722","text":"Philom√®ne Belliveau (1854 - 1940) was a Canadian artist of Acadian descent.

Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen defeated Democrat Gerald Richman in the runoff vote, 53.14% to 46.85%. Ros-Lehtinen replaced Claude Pepper, who died in office from stomach cancer. Changing demographics in Florida's 18th congressional district had moved the largely white district into a 40% Cuban American district. The election campaign followed this trend as the campaign was dominated by discussions of race after Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater declared that the district should become the \\"Cuban American seat\\". Democrat Gerald Richman ran a campaign with the slogan \\"This is an American seat\\" in response to Atwater's comments, and both Ros-Lehtinen and Richman appealed to their respective racial bases in the general. Ros-Lehtinen won a competitive campaign to flip the seat, and became the first Cuban American to serve in Congress. ==Background== United States Congressman Claude Pepper died in office from stomach cancer on May 30, 1989 after serving in the House for over a quarter century, opening up a special election to fill his seat. Pepper had previously served as a U.S. Senator from Florida as well and was seen as a lion of the U.S. Congress. Pepper's reputation and length of service had insulated him from the racial splits that existed in his district, and The New York Times noted that he had been able to bridge the gap inside of the district. The district had moved from a largely white district into a 40% Cuban American district. Florida Governor Bob Martinez announced the special election schedule the day after Pepper's burial. ==Republican primaryCandidates=== Declared * Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, State Senator * Carlos Perez, businessman and Republican Party activist * John Stembridge, former Mayor of North Miami * David M. Fleischer, insurance broker and former plumber ===Summary=== Early coverage on the Republican primary named State Senator Ileana Ros-Lehtinen as the favorite to win the Republican nomination. Jeb Bush managed Ros-Lehtinen's campaign. After Pepper's death, Republican National Committee chairman Lee Atwater declared that the seat should become a \\"Cuban American seat\\" and immediately caused controversy with the comment. Challengers other than Ros-Lehtinen included: Carlos Perez, a business owner who had been highlighted in Ronald Reagan's State of the Union address; David Fleischer, an insurance broker who decided to run after Atwater's comments; and John Stembridge, a furniture store owner who claimed that Pepper \\"was like an adopted father to me and I felt like he was personally grooming me to take his place\\". Ileana Ros-Lehtinen won the primary with more than 80% of the vote, winning every precinct and avoiding a runoff. \\"We're quite humbled and really flabbergasted,\\" Ros-Lehtinen said at her surprise of winning the primary by such a wide margin. ==Democratic primaryDeclared=== * Rosario Kennedy, Miami City Commissioner * Gerald Richman, Former President of the Florida Bar * Jo Ann Pepper, Niece of Claude Pepper and federal probation officer * Jeff Allen, Law school graduate * Bernard Anscher, Retired industrialist and philanthropist * Marvin Dunn, Psychologist and unsuccessful candidate for Mayor of Miami * Sonny Wright ===Withdrew=== * Jack Gordon, State Senator * Raul Masvidal, banker and unsuccessful mayoral candidate ===Summary=== The Democratic primary was much more chaotic than the Republican one. After Lee Atwater announced that the district should become a \\"Cuban American seat\\", early Democratic favorite Jack Gordon dropped out after two days, stating that he refused to run a campaign that would have to be about \\"stopping the Cubans\\". Rosario Kennedy, a Miami City Commissioner, was handicapped as the initial favorite. In a first-round upset, Gerald Richman, the former President of the Florida Bar, beat Kennedy by 146 votes. Both advanced to the runoff. The runoff campaign was dominated by controversial discussions of race. Richman repeatedly said, \\"This is an American seat\\" in reaction to Atwater's comments. Jo Ann Pepper, Marvin Dunn, and Sonny Wright, who split the African American neighborhoods in the district, all endorsed Kennedy. The Miami Herald endorsed Kennedy and called Richman's campaign \\"naked, deliberate, bigotry\\". Richman easily won the runoff over Kennedy, dominating in white and Jewish neighborhoods. The results split starkly among racial lines and after Richman's win, Kennedy refused to endorse him. ==General election== Ileana Ros-Lehtinen speaks in 1989 after her successful election. The racial themes from both primaries continued throughout the general election. Richman's campaign came under continued fire for his \\"This is an American seat\\" slogan, while Ros-Lehtinen's campaign was criticized for a Spanish language brochure which emphasized Richman's Jewish religion. Richman spent more than $300,000 of his own money on his campaign. Ros- Lehtinen called Richman and his campaign bigoted and refused to appear at any debates or events with him. A poll by The Miami Herald found that 28 out of every 29 Cuban American voters supported Ros-Lehtinen while 24 of every 25 Jewish voters supported Richman, regardless of normal political ideology and leanings. National Republicans came to support Ros-Lehtinen, including President George H. W. Bush who hosted a fundraiser for her campaign and appeared jointly with her. Ros-Lehtinen won the seat with a six point margin, 53 to 47 percent. Voter turnout matched strongly with ethnic lines. According to exit polling, approximately 60 percent of the district's Hispanic voters turned out, while only 40 percent of the Anglos and 34 percent of the African Americans. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen became the first Latina and the first Cuban American to serve in Congress after this victory. After the election, the Anti-Defamation League called for a \\"healing process\\" for the communities of the district and described the election as a \\"dark moment\\". Both campaigns were censured by the Fair Campaigns Practices Committee, a watchdog group, for the racially tinged campaigns they ran. ==References== Florida 1989 18 Florida 1989 18 1989 18 Florida 18 United States House of Representatives 18 United States House of Representatives 1989 18 ","title":"1989 Florida's 18th congressional district special election"},{"id":"56798774","text":"\\"Lyubo, bratsy, lyubo\\" (, Lovely, brothers, lovely) is a traditional Cossack song known in Russian and Ukrainian languages.

Midosi came to Frondoni so he would compose a song to go with a couple of verses of his own making for \\"an enthusiastic anthem\\". The music, that Fondoni wrote in its entirety on the same day, would become the song of the popular revolt in the spring of 1846, against the government of the Count of Tomar. According to Jo√£o Augusto Marques Gomes, the Maria da Fonte anthem was sung for the first time on 24 June 1846, a month after the main incidents of the revolt, in the house of the Marquess of Nisa, by an opera singer.

Niche at the columbarium of P√®re-Lachaise. Thomas William Marshall was born in 1875 in Donisthorpe, Derbyshire in England. He was the son of Robert Aldred Marshall (1852-1884) a wealthy mining engineer from Nottinghamshire who died in the Bullhouse Bridge rail accident, and Dorothy Ann Tarr (1852‚Äì1879). He is a first cousin of the rugby player Frank Tarr. Thomas William studied in both Oxford and in Cambridge. Wishing to become a painter despite his fragile health, he left England to live in Paris in 1897 and enrolled in the Acad√©mie Julian. There he met the Canadian painter Albert Henry Robinson, who would become his student and friend. In Paris he was reunited with his English friends, also painters, such as Ernest Yarrow Jones (1872‚Äì1951). As of 1900, he began to participate successfully in some Parisian exhibitions. His studio was located at 3 rue Campagne-Premi√®re, he then moved to 51 rue de S√®vres, and then relocated to 49 boulevard du Montparnasse. In 1904, he participated for the first time in the Salon d'Automne where he would show an average of five to six paintings or watercolours per salon, every year until 1913. He was named as a member of the Salon in 1908. During this time, he showed works at the Salon des Ind√©pendants in 1906 and then from 1908 to 1914. He also showed his works at the Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1911 and at the London Salon (of the Allied Artists Association) in London from 1908 to 1914. Thomas William Marshall was one of the founding members of the London Salon with Walter Sickert. Thomas William Marshall was a member of the Golf Club of Paris (Soci√©t√© de golf de Paris) and played at the when he started. Therefore, he produced many drawings and caricatures inspired by this sport. Due to his fragile health, he left for the C√¥te d'Azur and settled in Corse in 1908, where he produced a large part of his body of work (oil on canvas or on cardboard, watercolours and caricatures). He transferred works he had created in Corsica onto canvas:landscapes and scenes inspired by daily life on the island back to Paris for exhibition. These works gained him much praise from the art critics of that era. In 1910, Thomas William Marshall married Marie- Louise D√©sagullierRegistre de la Mairie du Luxembourg, VIe arr. de Paris, num√©ro 212/687, ann√©e 1910. who had been his companion and model for many years. He died prematurely from tuberculosis on in Paris, at the age of 38, at the height of his talent. He was cremated at cimeti√®re du P√®re-Lachaise and his ashes are resting at the columbarium (87th division, niche n¬∞ 2137). Wealthier than many of the contemporary artists of his time, he did not really need to sell much of his art to live ; as a result, he remained relatively unknown until his rediscovery by art critic in 1984. One of Thomas William Marshall's paintings, a landscape of Corsica painted in 1910, was selected by a specialized jury and art lovers, displayed at the Espace Pierre Cardin at the Champs-√âlys√©es and was reproduced in colour in an edition of the magazine Paris-Match in December 1984. Many exhibitions to honour his work followed: at the Salon des Ind√©pendants in Paris in 1986, at the Salon d'Automne in 1987 where an entire room was dedicated in tribute to him, and two personal exhibitions in Bastia in 1988 and in Villefranche-sur-mer in 1993. The Beauvais museum acquired a painting in 1987. Bastia and Villefranche-sur-Mer museums each have conserved one or more of his works in their public collections. == Works == Recognized by Jacques Foucart, general curator at the Paintings Department of the Mus√©e du Louvre, the pictorial work of the English painter Thomas William Marshall, is both inspired by the last sparkling embers of the XIXth century and by the end of Impressionism. Composed of numerous oil paintings and watercolours, of rare quality, his work can be added to the post-impressionist and symboliste movements. Also certain pieces could be considered neo-Japonard or nabis. Regardless of how one classifies it, his work remains deeply original. == Exhibitions  Salon d'Automne (1904‚Äì1913 and 1987) === Work exhibited at Salon d'Automne 1904 * 866.

Marshall is ultra-modernist in the perfect sense of the word ; he confines himself to smile at the retrograde mentality of those shocking brilliant initiatives and levelling common sense, ‚Äî Narrow mindset that predominant events, misunderstood, irritates. How Marshall is right to give up to their tenderness these supporters of landscapes made in rooms and this said, easel paintings - or bedside paintings! ... ¬ª (press clippings Le Lynx, 1907). * ¬´ William Marshall is also a truthful and a sad person who does not indulge himself the shortcoming of disguising anything: le Pont des Arts, le Pont Royal in winter, as we like it, appear to him clouded with smokes and mists rising from the river; the crowd with its familiar passers-by give them life from its perpetual back and forth. Marshall knows how to surprise the subtle soul of the cities and countrysides with their least favorable aspects in appearance. ¬ª (Leduc, Energie Fran√ßaise, April 21st 1907). * ¬´ Mr. T. Marshall understands post-impressionism from the more dignified and less fumiste point of view. The severe architectural lines of his finely-harmonized \\"Villefranche-sur-Mer\\" tell well giving a sense of permanence; \\"The Last of the Apple Blossom, Poigny\\" bold to the point of extravagance, suggests an explosion of vernal beauty, of youth and vigour. ¬ª (The Daily Telegraph, July 10th 1911). * ¬´ The work exhibited by M. Marshall affects a very special sobriety. Bords du canal Saint-Vinnemer (The banks of Saint-Vinnemer Canal), Villefranche, Verger (Orchard), are being looked at because of the simplicity in their production which do not impair in the least their effect. ¬ª (Boisard, Le Monde illustr√©, June 12th 1907). * ¬´ TWM has a series of excellent landscapes, flawlessly elaborated, very broad, especially the seascapes, with their very synthetic production, though very expressive: in Bastia et le Couvent de Saint Antoine √† travers les fourr√©s (Bastia and the Convent of Saint Antoine Through the Thickets), the horizon is as far as the eye can see, and a terribly hot atmosphere can be felt ¬ª (La Vie Mondaine, 1913). * ¬´ Elegant spirit, from which we sense the culture and the great sensitivity, T.W. Marshall transcends effortlessly, in a beautiful pictorial language, his nudes voluptuously discreet, his simple and noble figures, his interiors felted with shadows, his quivering landscapes. ¬ª (Marc Avoy, Salon d'automne, 1987). * ¬´ The lesson and the contribution of Thomas William Marshall, is that Nature is beautiful as it offers opportunities to be painted, that Life is good as it is source of beauty [...], that man is all greatness, freedom and hope [...] because art allows him with each morning, with each new painting, with each new look, to recreate the world's magnificence ! ¬ª (Jacques Foucart, Mus√©e du Louvre (The Louvre Museum), May 1993). == References  External links == * Albert H.

Music critic Johnny Rogan describes the song's use of string instruments and a \\"ghostly girl chorus\\" as giving it an \\"eerie effect.\\" Young biographer Jimmy McDonough remarks on the song's \\"sweet, sad countermelodies passing from strings to French horn with beautiful restraint.\\" According to music critic Nigel Williamson, the production by Jack Nitzsche helps give the song a sense of mystery. The song contains four verses but no refrain. The changes in mood and tone over the course of the song are reminiscent of Young's earlier song \\"Broken Arrow\\" that he wrote and performed as a member of Buffalo Springfield. Rolling Stone Magazine critic Gary Von Tersch considers \\"The Old Laughing Lady\\" to be the more effective of the two, because he considers it to be \\"tighter, more mature and [have] more of the quiet explosion to it that Young obviously intends. The themes of \\"The Old Laughing Lady\\" include love, death, alcoholism and alienation. The old laughing lady of the title can be a metaphor for either death or alcohol. The song describes how the old laughing lady affects the lives of those she interacts with. ==Writing and recording== \\"The Old Laughing Lady\\" was written earlier than most of the songs on Neil Young. According to Young, he wrote it one day on a napkin while drinking coffee in a coffee shop without knowing what prompted it. A version was recorded by Buffalo Springfield for their 1968 album Last Time Around in January 1968. An even earlier version was tried out during the sessions for Buffalo Springfield's earlier album Buffalo Springfield Again. In the version on Neil Young, Nitzsche used a vocal muting technique that makes Young sound \\"a million miles away, but right there.\\" ==Reception== Neil Young FAQ author Glen Boyd described \\"The Old Laughing Lady\\" as having \\"stood the test of time\\" since Neil Young was released. Pitchfork contributor Mark Richardson describes the song as having \\"echoes of the great music to come\\" from Young's later career. In 2014 the editors of Rolling Stone Magazine ranked it as Young's 63rd all time greatest song , describing it as \\"California psychedelia with the sun sucked out.\\" Young included \\"The Old Laughing Lady\\" on his 1977 compilation album Decade. A live version was released on Young's 1993 album Unplugged, although Rogan felt that version lacked the mystery and sadness of the original. ==References== Category:Neil Young songs Category:Songs written by Neil Young Category:1968 songs ","title":"The Old Laughing Lady"},{"id":"56799351","text":"is a former Japanese football player.

Orientation selectivity can also be expressed by simple cells if the orientation of a stimulus is orthogonal to the preferred degree of orientation, which results in the inhibition of impulse activity. ==Orientation testing== Single receptive field cells across the retina, LGN, and primary visual cortex are in a state of continuous neurotransmission. Impulse activity is the continuous state of regular and constant neurotransmission between neurons. Tests conducted by David H. Hubel and Torsten N. Wiesel (1968) utilized a single light dot presented within the visual field of a house cat to map out the location of a cell's receptive field within the cat's visual field. Orientation selectivity as it was first seen and measured in the cat's visual cortex via microelectrode analysis paired with visual stimulus. Once the receptive field of a cell had been completely mapped out, it was found that some of the simple cell receptive fields mapped out had a region which excited for a stimulus sandwiched between two inhibitory regions. These inhibitory and excitatory regions together formed a single receptive field selective for stimulus shape fitting within the excitatory region. Only a bar of light stimulus oriented at the correct angle and position within the receptive field covering only the excitatory region excluding the two inhibitory regions would express the greatest increase in the rate of impulse activity for that cell. Some layers of the striate cortex were found to contain orientation and direction selective cells. These cells were referred to as complex cells, and consisted of several orientation selective simple cells inputting into a single Complex cell. This was believed to result in a cell selective for direction and motion input. These receptive fields were called simple cell receptive fields, and were believed consist of single center-surround LGN input. ==References== Category:Visual cortex ","title":"Orientation selectivity"},{"id":"56799442","text":"Blessed Be Your Name may refer to: *Blessed Be Your Name: The Songs of Matt Redman Vol. 1, 2005 album *Blessed Be Your Name: The Hits, 2008 compilation album by Tree63 *Live Worship: Blessed Be Your Name, 2004 live album by Rebecca St. James *\\"Blessed Be Your Name\\" (song), a song from the 2002 album Where Angels Fear to Tread by Matt Redman, covered by tree63 on their 2003 album The Answer to the Question.

It is known only from a pair of specimens collected from the eastern and western sides of the Florida Peninsula.McEachran, J.D. and Fechhelm, J.D. 2005. Fishes of the Gulf of Mexico. University of Texas Press, Austin, USA. == Description == The orangebelly goby is short in length with an indented forehead, and as suggested by the name is primarily orange in colour. The dorsal fins are covered by yellow stripes, whilst the body ranging from the head to the base are covered in khaki stripes, some of which are comparatively longer in length. The species can be distinguished from close relatives by unbranched pelvic rays, the presence of elongated tips on four of the pelvic rays, a fifth vestigial pelvic ray, a bilobed tongue and scales beneath the leading dorsal fin. == Distribution and habitat == The two existing specimens originated from the Florida Middle Grounds in the Gulf of Mexico, and off the coast of Vero Beach. They tend to inhabit the demersal zone between the depths of 60 to 91 metres, and are often found on shell-hash bottoms with scattered rocks and sand in the vicinity of extant reef systems. These outlined locations are generalisations, as greater population enclaves must be recorded to establish a more specific range. == Behaviour == In association with other similar species of goby, it is probable that the fish is a planktivore. It would appear that there is no record of the species in the commercial trade market, as the pair caught in the late twentieth century remain the only documentation of the species to date.http://www.eol.org/pages/210205/overview == Population == The population of the species remains unknown, as it has only been recorded on two occasions. The nominal records indicate that the specimens were a male and a female, and due to their frequentation of deep subtropical waters, a greater concentration of the populace may be undiscovered at present. ==Threats== The species does not appear to be affected by the shrimp fishery industry, or the commercial pet trade. The only threat that may pose an issue to the orangebelly goby is the potential for predation from the invasive lionfish. The diminutive size of the fish is the primary threat, as juveniles and adults are both relatively small enough to form a portion of the diet of the lionfish. The coinciding habitation of the exposed demarsal zone exacerbates the potential for this risk. ==References== orangebelly goby Category:Fauna of the Southeastern United States Category:Fish of the Gulf of Mexico orangebelly goby ","title":"Orangebelly goby"},{"id":"56799467","text":"Cyrus Kingsbury (November 22, 1786 ‚Äì June 27, 1870) was a Christian missionary active among the American Indians in the nineteenth century.

Varnum, born in Dracut, Massachusetts on January 16, 1784, was one of ten children of Parker and Dorcas (n√©e Brown) Varnum. Her father would become an elder in the Pawtucket Congregational Church. It is not clear when and how she would meet Cyrus Kingston, but evidently the event occurred and a strong attraction ensued. By 1818, when Kingston was preparing to start building with the Choctaws in Mississippi, he had proposed to marry her. Although he wanted to return to New England for the wedding, the church would not allow him to leave his post in Mississippi for a long enough time. Sarah and Cyrus were determined not to wait, but decided to meet in New Orleans. Sarah made the long, arduous ocean voyage unaccompanied from her parental home, while Cyrus came from Tennessee on horseback. They were married in New Orleans on Christmas Eve, 1818. After the ceremony, Cyrus and Sarah made the trip back to Brainerd on horseback, spending their nights camping out and cooking their food over open fires. ==Ministry in Mississippi== In 1818, Kingsbury was sent to Mississippi by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and assigned to minister to the Choctaw Nation that lived there. His first activity was to establish Eliot Mission. Kingsbury selected a site on the Yazoo River, about southwest of Brainerd. During childhood, Cyrus had injured a foot when he stepped on a scythe. The injury never healed properly, causing him to walk with a noticeable limp for the rest of his life. Soon after he took up residence in the Choctaw Nation, the tribe gave him a Choctaw name, NachobaAnowa, that meant\\"Limping Wolf\\" in English.\\"Chuala Female Seminary/Pine Ridge Mission School.\\" Asylum Projects MediaWiki. Undated. Accessed March 30, 2018. ===Mayhew Mission=== In 1820, Kingsbury chose a location in the northeastern part of present-day Oktibbeha County, Mississippi that he deemed a suitable site for another mission. He described the location as, \\"... a point where the Ash Creek flows into the Tibbee Creek.‚Äù Cyrus named the site for the Mayhew family, another missionary family from Massachusetts. The Kingsburys, assisted by some other families and three unmarried women, started by building a boarding school, where they taught the Choctaws living around the mission to read, write, study the Bible and other subjects related to earning a living.\\"Remembering Mayhew.\\" Oktibbeha County Heritage Museum. Accessed May 23, 2018. The school opened on April 30, 1820 with twelve students who lived nearby. Enrollment increased soon to 18, with new students who came from elsewhere in the Choctaw Nation. A church building opened May 6, 1821, and became affiliated with the Tombigbee Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church.Johnson, Libba. \\"Lowndes County, Mississippi History and Genealogy Network.\\"2017. Accessed March 24, 2018. Kingsbury's influence on the Choctaw Nation could be described as spectacular. For example, the Choctaw chiefs began to solicit his advice on how to deal with officials of the Federal Government. They specifically asked him to accompany their delegation to negotiate the 1820 Treaty of Doak's Stand. He did so, and was soon appalled at the U. S. commissioners negotiating tactics, calling the discussions, \\"Whiskey Negotiations.\\" Kingsbury counseled the Choctaws to cease further negotiations until the commissioners stopped plying the Choctaws with liquor. The Choctaws did so, and the result was a more favorable outcome for the tribe. Meanwhile, Sarah Kingsbury bore two children, Cyrus and John P. Sarah contracted an unidentified illness and died at the mission five days later, on September 15, 1822. Sarah was buried in the mission cemetery, and Cyrus and the boys lived at the mission for a few more years. When the boys were old enough to go to school, Cyrus sent them back East to be educated. In 1824, Cyrus married Electa May. Well-suited to working as his partner as a missionary, she also saw to the raising of Cyrus' sons. Electa served with him until she died in July 1864.\\"Kingsbury, Cyrus.\\" In: Encyclopedia of Christianity in the United States. Volume 5. Kurian, George Thomas and Mark A. Lamport, eds. p. 1281.

In that year, the Choctaws at Mayhew Mission began their arduous trek to their new homeland in Indian Territory. Cyrus Kingsbury chose to accompany them all the way. Cyrus Kingsbury was one of four Mayhew missionaries credited with founding the First Presbyterian Church of Columbus, Mississippi in May, 1829. The other three were Thomas Archibald, Hilary Patrick and David Wright. Mayhew missionaries served the church until 1834. David Wright became the first permanent minister after the church built a sanctuary and obtained its charter in 1844.\\"A Brief History of the First Presbyterian Church, Columbus, Mississippi.\\" Undated. Accessed March 26, 2018. ===Other Choctaw missions in Indian Territory=== One source has claimed that Cyrus Kingsbury established Pine Ridge Mission in 1818, at a site north of Doaksville, and that the mission became the Choctaw Female Seminary in 1842.

In four days four races are rowed, a day a long one and a short distance. The Roeivierkamp has been organized by the Amsterdam Student Rowing Association Nereus since 1973 and is an official FISA competition. The matches are open for 'eights' (boats with eight rowers) and for 'double four with' (four rowers, each two belts, with mate / wife). It is a big event with (in 2013) around 3500 participants from various age categories and countries. All rowing clubs along the Amstel will open their grounds and club houses for visiting teams and a large team of volunteers will participate. There are four distances to row: 250 meters, 750 meters, 2500 meters and 5000 meters. The final score is determined by calculating the results back to a 250-meter time and adding to each other (comparable to the all-round classification in speed skating races). A team that is bad at a short distance, therefore, has to make up a lot on the long distance. On Saturday, the 2500 and 250 meters are rowed immediately after each other, on Sunday the teams row the 750 meters in the morning and the 5000 meters in the afternoon. The start of the short distances is at the Nieuwe Amstel bridge (between Ceintuurbaan and Ruyschstraat), where two teams are rowing together in the direction of Ouderkerk. The start of the long distances is at the Rozenoordbrug (2500 m) and the Grote Bocht (5000 m) respectively, here the teams start shortly after each other in the direction of Amsterdam. The finish of all distances is for the clubhouse of Nereus at the Amsteldijk at the Berlagebrug in Amsterdam. The teams can be recognized by their clothing and the blades of the belts. National rowers wear their Dutch shirt under the club jersey, white with an orange band on the arm. Traditionally, the supporters cycle with their team on long distances and encourage them loudly with special slogans. It is good practice that other road users give the cycling fans priority. The categories in which can be rowed at this tournament: Men, Light Men and Women 1st division 8+ (Senior A), 2nd division 8+ (Transition), 3rd division 8+ (Novices) and 4th division 8+ (Beginneling / first year) Ladies Seniors A 4x + Juniors Boys 8+ and 4x + Juniors Girls 4x + Other categories (such as veterans, clubs, boys / girls 16) can also participate in the competition, but do so over 3 distances. The 750 meters, seen as the heaviest distance, is skipped by these teams. == Radio H4K == Every year during the Heineken Roeivierkamp live report is done by the \\"Razende Reporters\\" that can be listened to via both the Internet and a temporary FM frequency. In addition to the live competition report, there is also an evening to listen to various interviews and the races of the past day are analyzed. ==External links== *Heineken Roeivierkamp (offici√´le site) Category:Rowing Category:Sports competitions in Amsterdam ","title":"Heineken Roeivierkamp"},{"id":"56799482","text":"Mary Kageyama Nomura (born September 29, 1925) is an American singer of Japanese descent who was relocated and incarcerated for her ancestry at the Manzanar concentration camp during World War II and became known as The songbird of Manzanar. ==Early life== Mary Kageyama was one of five children of carpenter Tomitaro Kageyama and his wife, dance teacher Machi Kageyama, immigrants from Japan who lived in Los Angeles. She learned Japanese opera music from her mother, and performed at the Koyasan Buddhist Temple as a four- year-old, but both her parents died by the time she was eight. She was raised by her older brother and sister, both teenagers at the time, who left their high school to keep the family together rather than letting the other children get sent to an orphanage. She formed a singing group with two of her siblings, \\"the Kageyama Trio\\", and at age 12 became the only child performer in a pre- war Japanese-American musical group for servicemen. She went to Venice High School. ==Manzanar== The family was taken to Manzanar in 1942, when Kageyama was 16. There, she graduated from Manzanar High School in 1943, and worked as a receptionist and clerk. She continued her music under the mentorship of Manzanar's musical director Lou Frizzell, who accompanied her while she sang at camp musical performances and recorded two songs. She also sang at the weddings and funerals held at the camp. It was during this period that she became known as the \\"songbird of Manzanar\\". ==Later life== After the war, Kageyama married Shiro (Shi) Nomura. Nomura had seen her perform at a Nisei festival before the war, but they first met at the camp. She continued singing, primarily at concentration camp reunions. Later in life, she jokingly gave herself the name \\"the Old Crow of Manzanar\\". In 2016, actor Cody Edison produced a short documentary film about her, Songbird of Manzanar. Nomura's daughter Lisa, son-in-law Gerald Ishibashi, and their children are all musical performers. Granddaughter Brittany Ishibashi is a television and film actress, and another granddaughter, Brooke Ishibashi, has performed professionally as an actor and singer in a lead role in the play Cambodian Rock Band. ==References *Mary Nomura interview, Manzanar National Historic Site Collection Category:1925 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American singers Category:Japanese-American internees Category:Japanese-American culture in Los Angeles Category:Singers from Los Angeles Category:American women musicians of Japanese descent ","title":"Mary Nomura"},{"id":"56799504","text":"is a former Japanese football player.

Mai is intrigued that Sakuta is the only one who can see her, as other people are unable to see her, even when she is dressing normally or attempting to stay away from celebrity life. Calling this phenomenon \\"Adolescence Syndrome\\", Sakuta decides to solve this mystery, while continuing to get closer to Mai and meeting other girls who suffer from \\"Adolescence Syndrome\\" as well. ==CharactersMain characters=== ; : :Harboring a bad reputation after allegedly hospitalizing three people, Sakuta attempts to keep a low profile until his meeting with Mai prompts him to investigate Adolescence Syndrome. His sister Kaede's Adolescence Syndrome affected him as well, leading to him suffering three cuts to his chest. Sakuta's life changes when he meets Mai and helps her overcoming her Adolescence Syndrome, which leads him into getting involved with other girls that suffer the same condition. : Sakuta is a nice and helpful person, but also very snarky. He's definitely blunt, honest and straightforward towards Mai, and prone to lewd jokes that even intimidate her, despite her tendency to tease the guy. Sakuta is a typically selfless light novel hero, and his Hero Syndrome is essentially a consequence of the Adolescence Syndrome that involved his sister Kaede first of all, and later all the other main girls of every arc. ; : :Tired from the pressures of her acting work, Mai decides to take a hiatus but suddenly realizes people are unable to acknowledge her existence, except Sakuta, who agrees to help figure out what's happening, all while she continues to get closer to him. She first meets Sakuta at a library, while she was wearing a bunny girl outfit to test if people would notice her. As time passes, more people start forgetting about Mai's existence until Sakuta himself is left to remember. Sakuta is able to restore Mai's existence and everyone's memories of her when he declares his love to Mai in front of the entire school. After that, Sakuta and Mai attempt to start a relationship, which is made difficult given Mai's acting work. Later, Mai is infected by her half-sister Nodoka's Adolescence Syndrome, causing both girls to exchange physical appearances. It is only when Sakuta helps both sisters reconcile that they return to normal. Mai is the focal character of the first light novel. :Personality wise, Mai is levelheaded, polite and very kind: she's helpful, denounces Sakuta's bad reputation as false and also has a very soft spot for Kaede. While she can be snarky, she's pure-hearted, and sometimes even shy around Sakuta's lewd jokes. Like Sakuta, she's also very selfless, sacrificing herself to save her boyfriend's life and becoming Shoko's heart donor. ; : :The focal character of the second light novel, Tomoe is a first year student at Sakuta's high school. She initially meets Sakuta at a park while he was trying to help a young girl look for her mother, which leads Tomoe to accuse Sakuta of being a lolicon. She is very self conscious and asks Sakuta to be her pretend boyfriend so her friends wouldn‚Äôt say anything bad about her behind her back. However, crazy accusations start up about her and eventually falls in love with him after seeing him defend her. Unfortunately, Tomoe's feelings for Sakuta cause the last day of their relationship to repeat itself. Sakuta confronts Tomoe about her feelings, which she confesses but ultimately he turns her down. Even so, they agree to be friends. ; : :The focal character of the third light novel, Rio is the sole member of the science club at Sakuta and Mai's high school and one of Sakuta's only friends. She initially believed Adolescence Syndrome is a myth until she suffers it herself. Due to lacking confidence in her appearance, a clone of hers appears with a different personality and who posts suggestive pictures of herself online to punish herself. The two Rios merge into one person again when Sakuta helps them both accept themselves and the friendships they have made. ; : :The focal character of the fourth light novel, Nodoka is Mai's half-sister and a member of an idol group. She swapped bodies with Mai due to her inferiority complex, but swapped back after realizing that she did not have to be exactly like Mai. The half-sisters only return to normal after reconciling. ; : : Sakuta's younger sister and another victim of Adolescence Syndrome, Kaede mysteriously began to suffer injuries after suffering online bullying and getting death threats on her cellphone that left her with a phobia of strangers. She only made a recovery after she stopped using social media or going to school. After that, she stays at Sakuta's apartment, with only her cat to keep her company. She is extremely fond of her brother and frequently climbs into bed with him while he is sleeping. It is later discovered that Kaede is suffering from dissociative disorder. She had forgotten who she was and became a completely different Kaede. She eventually regains her memories but forgets the events of the previous two years. Although Sakuta is saddened that the sister he has come to know has ceased to exist, he nevertheless accepts the return of his original sister and decides to help her regain her old life. Kaede is the focal character of the fifth light novel. ; : :The focal character of the sixth and seventh light novels, Shoko has the same name as Sakuta's first crush. She is a shy middle school student who bumps into Sakuta during a rain storm. It is later revealed that she is the Shoko that Sakuta met during his episode, but had moved away to recover from a heart transplant. After Kaede regains her memories, Shoko appears to Sakuta again and helps him move past his grief after losing the Kaede he had come to know over the past 2 years. When Sakuta calms down, Shoko departs, leaving her identity a mystery for the time being. ===Supporting characters=== ; : :Sakuta's best friend. He is dating Saki Kamisato. ; : :Saki is Y≈´ma's girlfriend. She hates Sakuta and wishes he would stop being Yuma's friend as his status as the class loner is making Yuma, and more importantly, herself less popular as well. ; : :Fumika is a reporter who is interested in Adolescence Syndrome and believes the scars on Sakuta's chest were somehow caused by it. ==MediaLight novels=== Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai is written by Hajime Kamoshida and features illustrations by Keeji Mizoguchi.

In 1762, 34 years after his death, he was adopted to his half-nephew Yi San by his father King Yeongjo and in 1776 was appointed to the title of Honor King, 48 years after his death. His other title was Prince Kyeongui(Í≤ΩÏùòÍµ∞ Êï¨Áæ©Âêõ). His real name was Yi Haeng (). His first name was Manbok(hangul:ÎßåÎ≥µ hanja:Ëê¨Á¶è). His courtesy name was Seonggyeong (). == Life == Hyojang was born the son of Yi Geum, Prince Yeoning and later Yeongjo of Joseon, and one of his concubines Lady Lee Jungbin of Hamseong (Ï†ïÎπà Ìï®ÏÑ±Ïù¥Ïî® ÈùñÂ¨™ Âí∏ÊàêÊùéÊ∞è), Changui-kung, Sunhwabang in Hanseong.10ÏÇ¥ Îïå ÏöîÏ†àÌïú Ìö®Ïû•ÏÑ∏Ïûê ÏÇ¨ÌõÑ ÏñëÏûê Ï†ïÏ°∞Í∞Ä ‚ÄúÏïÑÎ∞îÎßàÎßà‚Äù The Dongah Weekly 2010.12.27. He was born during the reign of his grandfather King Sukjong. His birth was not made public or reported in the news, because one year before his birth, his grandmother Lady Chol Sukbin died. His mother, Lady Lee Jungbin of Hamseong, was the daughter of Lee Jun-chul, a noble of Joseon. His first name was Man-bok, which was later changed to Haeng. In 1720, King Sukjong died due to dementia and Smallpox sequelae and was succeeded by his son Crown Prince Yi Kyun as King Gyeongjong. As Gyeongjong was childless, Prince Yeoning, Hyojang's father was appointed as Crown Prince. King Gyeongjong died in 1724 and Prince Yeoning was crowned as King Yeongjo of Joseon. Hyojang was then appointed as Prince Kyeongui and in 1725 was appointed to Crown Prince. In 1726, his father selected Lady Hyeon of the Pyungyang Jo clan, a daughter of vice prime- minister Cho Mun-myung and niece of Cho Hyon-myong, also a vice prime- minister, as Hyojang's wife. The two were married but with no issue. In 1728, Hyojang died suddenly in Gyeongbokgung at the young age of 9, after being ill for some months. The cause of his illness was unknown. The prince's death was devastating to his father King Yeongjo, who was sad for some months. Yeongjo then gave his son the posthumous epithet title Hyojang, therefore his title was Crown Prince Hyojang. Hyojang was buried at Mt. Ahyeon, between Yeonhee Kung and Yonsei University and Aeogae station. On January 26, 1729, his grave moved to Neungan-ri at Jori town in Paju.Î™ÖÎãπÍ≥º ÌíçÏàò Í∑∏Î¶¨Í≥† ÏôïÎ¶â Ohmynews 2004.09.24. === After death === In 1735, seven years after his death, his half-brother Sado was born and succeeded Hyojang as Crown Prince. In 1762, Sado was imprisoned in a wooden rice chest by the orders of his father King Yeongjo, and died 8 days later, leaving his son Yi San as the royal successor. King Yeongjo was concerned that Yi San, being Sado's son and successor, would be branded with the title of \\"Son of a prisoner\\" or \\"Son of a psycho\\" and thus become ineligible to succeed the throne, so on February 21, 1764, the King decreed that Yi San would become the adoptive son of the long-dead Crown Prince Hyojang.Ïù∏Ï†ïÏ†Ñ ÏõîÎåÄÏóêÏÑú ÏπúÌûà Ìñ•ÏùÑ Ï†ÑÌïòÎã§.

In spite of this, King Jeongjo did not change the laws of King Yeonjo.

The Pathway Home is a residential treatment program meant to help post-9/11 veterans struggling with PTSD and TBIs reintegrate into society. The shooter, Albert Wong, had attended the program until the home's executive director, Christine Loeber, dismissed him earlier in the week. == Location == The Pathway Home, was a treatment program run by a non- profit that leased part of a campus of the state-run Veterans Home of California-Yountville. The facility was secured by roaming unarmed 24-hour security personnel for the entire campus, with security cameras installed at The Pathway Homes front door, and hallways as well as a sign in desk. The program worked with veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars with PTSD. During the incident residents of the nearby veterans home were locked down after reports of an active shooter, and teenagers who were visiting the grounds were evacuated shortly after 2:30 pm. == Incident == A stand-off started at around 10:30 am when a gunman, later identified as Albert Wong, a 36-year-old U.S. Army veteran of the War in Afghanistan, entered the facility during a going away party. The first 911 call of the incident was received around 10:20 am, and by 10:22 am the dispatcher had named Wong as the perpetrator and that he was armed with a semi-automatic weapon and large quantities of ammunition. Wong initially released veterans and other staff members, holding only Jennifer Gonzales Shushereba, a psychologist, Jennifer Golick and Christine Lobber, the clinical and executive directors of Pathway Home respectively. Napa County deputies were some of the first to respond to the scene. At about 10 minutes after the initial 911 call Wong exchanged gunfire with Napa County Sheriff's Department Senior Deputy Steve Lombardi and then retreated into The Pathway Home building. After the shootout there was no further contact with Wong or any of the hostages, although three hostage- negotiation teams were on site. At around 6:00 pm, after negotiators from several agencies failed to contact him, California Highway Patrol officers entered the room and found everyone in it shot to death. His cell phone was later discovered in his parked car. Wong was found dead of a self-inflicted shotgun wound in the second floor room where he had killed the three female staffers. The Napa County Sheriff‚Äôs Coroner determined that Gonzales Shushereba was 26 weeks pregnant at the time of the incident and that her \\"unborn baby died due to lack of oxygenated blood caused by her mother's death.\\" State Senator Bill Dodd reported that it was reasonable to believe that the three hostages were killed during or shortly after the initial exchange of gunfire with officers. == Perpetrator == Albert Wong (36) had been struggling to readjust to civilian life in California after returning from a tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2013. During his service Wong was awarded an Army Commendation Medal, an Army Good Conduct Medal, and campaign stars for fighting global terrorism and for marksmanship. He had held a professional licenses as a security guard and security trainer, and a firearms permit through the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services from 2008. He was a resident of The Pathway House, for nearly a year of residential treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) until he was expelled for unspecified concerns about threatening behavior. A family member told reporters that Wong had reportedly told them that he was angry at staff members and wanted to get back at them after he had been found with knives at the facility and told to leave. Wong reported \\"wanted to get back at them, talk to them, yell at them, not to kill them\\". A family member of one of the victims, claimed \\"People were notified he was violent. Nothing was done. All the proper people were notified...the sheriffs department, the vets' health. Everybody knew.\\" == Aftermath == The Pathway Home is the subject of the 2014 documentary film, Of Men and War. After the shootings, The Pathway Home suspended operations indefinitely and its clients were placed with other programs. On August 31 its board members told reporters that the nonprofit plan to terminate the lease, as there was little belief they could effectively aid veterans in the location. The Three Brave Women fund was established and been used to distribute monetary aid to the families of the victims. == References == Category:2018 crimes in California Category:March 2018 crimes in the United States Category:Hostage taking in the United States Category:Murder‚Äìsuicides in the United States Category:2018 murders in the United States Category:Yountville, California Category:History of Napa County, California Category:Murder in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:2018 mass shootings in the United States Category:Mass shootings in the United States Category:Attacks in the United States in 2018 Category:Mass murder in 2018 ","title":"Yountville shooting"},{"id":"56799738","text":"The 2018 Copa do Brasil fourth stage was the fourth stage of the 2018 Copa do Brasil football competition.

Smelov was the founder of the ‚Äòunofficial photography‚Äô of the 1970s‚Äî1990s and is considered as one of the most outstanding Soviet underground artists. == Life and work == Boris was born in Leningrad, USSR. As a child he was engaged in painting and studied at the mathematical school in Leningrad. Boris had started showing an interest in photography at the age of 10 and began taking classes at Leningrad's Pioneers‚Äô Palace. He consciously began to take pictures at the age of 17. In 1968, at one of the meetings of the photo club of the Vyborg Palace of Culture, Smelov met Boris Kudryakov, who introduced him to the circle of Konstantyn Kuzminsky. At the request of Kuzminsky Smelov started shooting portraits of unofficial artists and writers. From 1970 to 1972 Smelov studied at ITMO University, from 1972 to 1973 at the faculty of journalism at the Leningrad State University. In the early 1970s, in addition to the city landscapes and portraits Smelov also started working with still live genre. At this time Boris was already working with two cameras ‚Äî ¬´Leica¬ª and ¬´Rolleiflex¬ª. In those years he did not have a personal laboratory ‚Äî Smelov developed the films and printed his photos in the Leonid Borganov's darkroom located at the Palace of Culture for workers of the food industry (DC ¬´Pishevik¬ª). Boris Smelov first received public recognition for his photography work in the 1970s. In 1974 he took part in the first exhibition of independent photography ¬´Under a parachute¬ª conducted at the apartment of Konstantyn Kuzminsky. That is when Smelov got his famous nickname, Petit Boris, invented by Kuzminsky while his comrade Boris Kudryakov was nicknamed Gran-Boris. In 1976, Smelov presented some of his photographs at the Vyborg District Palace of Culture. Due to nonconformist style of Smelov's works the Soviet authorities closed his exhibition and after that any participation in official exhibitions became impossible. Therefore, until perestroika Smelov participated only in illegal apartment exhibitions. In 1977, he received the Gold Medal for the reportage series at the 11th International Photo Salon in Bucharest. Later Smelov became largely associated with the Mitki group, an art movement emerged from Vladimir Shinkarev's literary work Mitki (1984-1990), which expresses the anxieties surrounding Perestroika in the 1980s. During Perestroika, Boris Smelov began to participate in exhibitions intensively in USSR and abroad including Great Britain, Germany, United States, Finland, Norway, among others. In 1991 he went to Washington, where he took part in the exhibition ¬´Changing Reality¬ª. Main theme of Smelov's work was Leningrad ‚Äî Saint-Petersburg. His name is associated with the notion of ‚ÄòSaint-Petersburg still life‚Äô. He was using old objects from Saint-Petersburg households to create still life images filled with deep nostalgia for the past. Smelov died at the age of forty-seven in 1998 in Saint-Petersburg. He was buried on January 24 at the Smolensk Orthodox cemetery. Boris Smelov's works can be found in private and public collections in Russia, USA, France, Sweden, Italy, Great Britain, Germany and Austria. His works are being compared with the pillars of the world photography such as works of Cartier-Bresson, Doyen and Curtis. ==Personal life== From 1974 to 1976 Smelov was in a relationship with clandestine street photographer Masha Ivashintsova, whose works were discovered by her relatives in the family attic and made public. Soon following his separation from Ivashintsova, Smelov began a relationship with a Russian painter, Natalia Zhilina. They married in the late 1970s in Leningrad. Boris Smelov adopted Natalia's children, Dmitry Shagin and Maria Snigirevskaya, who took interest in photography in 1979 thanks to her stepfather Boris Smelov, who had already been a recognized photographer by that time. ==Selected exhibitions== 2018, Hermitage, Saint- Petersburg, Russia 2017, Columbus Museum of Art, Columbus, USA 2012-2013, Frolov Gallery, Winzavod, Moscow, Russia 2012, Lumiere Brothers Center, Moscow, Russia 2012, Rosphoto, Saint-Petersburg, Russia 2012, FotoFest, Houston, USA 2012, Nailya Alexander Gallery, New York, USA 2011, Sputnik Gallery, New York, USA 2010, Photographic museum ¬´House Metenkova¬ª, Ekaterinburg, Russia 2009, Hermitage, Saint-Petersburg, Russia 2004, The State Central Museum Of Contemporary History Of Russia, Moscow, Russia ==References * Boris Smelov‚Äôs works * Leningrad‚Äôs Lost Photographer.

He was a member of the Grand Council of Fascism and served as Italian Minister of Finance from 1932-35 under Benito Mussolini. Jung was an important player in international finance during the interwar period, leading Italian negotiations with the United States over tariff questions, heading Italo- German economic talks with Hermann G√∂ring, and representing Italy at the London Economic Conference during which he was heralded in press reports for his diplomatic tact. Jung was ultimately sidelined by Mussolini due to his Jewish heritage, despite reports from the Organization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism that described him as a disciplined and loyal fascist. After the surrender of Italy, Jung briefly served as finance minister a second time ‚Äì in 1944 ‚Äì under Pietro Badoglio but was dismissed after three months following allegations concerning the extent and depth of his roots in the National Fascist Party. Though a fanatical fascist, Jung drew a sharp distinction between fascism and Nazism, once comparing the Nazi Party to a baby and later reportedly calling Adolf Hitler a \\"blockhead\\". An artillery officer in the Italian Army during both world wars, Jung commanded troops in both Europe and Africa. For various acts of bravery in combat, he was decorated with the Silver Medal of Military Valor on four separate occasions. He was created a knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy by Victor Emmanuel III. ==Early life== Jung was born in Sicily to a wealthy, Orthodox Jewish merchant family who had emigrated from Germany. As a young man, he undertook a business apprenticeship in London. ==CareerPrivate sector and military service=== Jung took over the family business of fruit importing and ran it to continued commercial success. He also served on the board of directors of the Bank of Palermo, in recognition of which he was, in 1906, invested into the Order of the Crown of Italy at the degree of Cavaliere. During World War I, Jung served in the Royal Italian Army's 25th Artillery Regiment, rising to the rank of captain and being decorated with the Bronze Medal of Military Valor which was, on application of Jung's commander, subsequently converted to the Silver Medal of Military Valor. ===Minister of Finance (1932 to 1935)=== Jung, who in 1922 had served as financial attache at the Italian embassy in Washington, D.C., was elevated to the Grand Council of Fascism in the summer of 1932 by virtue of his appointment as Minister of Finance; the senior ministers of the government were also de facto members of the Grand Council. Prime Minister Benito Mussolini reasoned at the time that \\"a Jew should be at the head of finance\\". As a senior minister in the cabinet, Jung was also a member of the Grand Council of Fascism, pictured here in 1936. During an official visit by Hermann G√∂ring to Italy, Mussolini assigned Jung to meet with the German minister, prompting David Schwartz of the Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle to write that \\"it must have been a lesson in tolerance\\". In May 1933, he represented Italy to the United States during tariff discussions and was feted with an official dinner at the White House by President of the United States Franklin Roosevelt. In a subsequent meeting with Mussolini, U.S. ambassador John W. Garrett reported that \\"he [Mussolini] was very gratified at the cordiality of Jung‚Äôs reception in America\\". As minister, Jung helped establish the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale. He was also the Italian delegate to the London Economic Conference and was credited in news reports with \\"keeping the conflicting elements of the parley from completely disrupting the conference\\". During the same Conference, he signed an agreement, sponsored by Galeazzo Ciano and at the time kept secret to the world, with the minister of China, T.V. Soong, that concluded the long lasting negotiations for the settlement of the Boxer Indemnity and the outstanding amount of the Skoda loan with Italy. Political views In a 1933 interview with the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Jung compared Nazism to Fascism by equating it to the difference between \\"an infant to a ten year-old boy\\". The following year he is on record as referring to Adolf Hitler as a \\"blockhead\\" and a \\"blatherer\\". While he declared there was no anti-semitism in Italy, Jung also dismissed the very existence of anti-semitism, explaining to Emil Ludwig his belief that it was a \\"doctrine upheld by those sub-Alpine peoples who could not write at the time Rome saw Caesar, Vergil, and August\\". ===Later years=== After being released from the cabinet Jung, then aged 59, volunteered for military service in Ethiopia ultimately commanding 6,000 men. By this point, Jung had stopped adhering to Judaism. In 1935, he was received into the Roman Catholic faith. Nonetheless, in 1939, with the enactment of the Italian Racial Laws, he was dismissed from military service. His personal appeals to Mussolini to grant him an exception went unheeded, despite supporting reports from the OVRA that described him as a disciplined and loyal Fascist. In February 1944, following the Armistice of Cassibile, Jung was again given charge of the finance ministry. The appointment of Jung met with concern from the United States, with the U.S. Army's Psychological Warfare Branch charging that Jung had deep Fascist roots that significantly predated his earlier service as finance minister, possibly extending to the March on Rome. Jung's second stint as minister was short-lived and he was dismissed after just three months. At his request, he was restored to his military rank and assigned, first, to the 184th Artillery Regiment Nembo in the Italian Co- belligerent Army, and then to the Folgore Mechanized Division. During his service in Africa, and his later service in Europe, he would receive a total of three additional Silver Military Medals of Valor. ==Personal life== At least two of Jung's brothers also served in the Royal Italian Army during World War I.

With his skating partner, Anastasia Mishina, he is the 2019‚Äì20 Grand Prix Final bronze medalist and 2019 Internationaux de France champion. On a junior level he is the 2019 World Junior champion, the 2018 World Junior bronze medalist, 2018‚Äì19 Junior Grand Prix Final champion, and 2019 Russian national junior champion. == Personal life == Galliamov was born on 28 August 1999 in Berezniki, Russia. == Career  Early years === Galliamov began learning to skate in 2005. He was a single skater until 2014, when he switched to pair skating and moved to Saint Petersburg. He and his first partner, Alexandra Polishchuk, skated together through the 2015‚Äì2016 season. He competed with his next partner, Nika Osipova, during the 2016‚Äì2017 season. === 2017‚Äì2018 season: Partnership with Mishina === Galliamov teamed up with Anastasia Mishina in February 2017. Coached by Nikolai Velikov and Ludmila Velikova, the pair won the junior title at the 2017 Golden Spin of Zagreb, their first international event. Mishina/Galliamov placed seventh at the 2018 Russian Championships and took silver at the junior event. In March 2018, they won bronze at the 2018 World Junior Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria. They were part of a Russian sweep of the pairs' podium, along with their training partners Polina Kostiukovich / Dmitrii Ialin (silver) and Daria Pavliuchenko / Denis Khodykin (gold). === 2018‚Äì2019 season: Junior World title === Mishina/Galliamov started their season by competing in the 2018 JGP series. At their first JGP event of the season they won the gold medal in Bratislava, Slovakia. They were ranked first in both the short program and the free skate and won the gold medal by a margin of more than 11 points over the silver medalists, their teammates Apollinariia Panfilova / Dmitry Rylov. At their second JGP event of the season they won another gold medal, now in Vancouver, Canada. Again they were ranked first in both the short program and the free skate, and again they beat the same silver medalists, Panfilova/Rylov. This time they beat them by about 10 points. Mishina/Galliamov also upgraded their earlier short program, free skate and combined total record scores. With two JGP gold medals they qualified for the 2018‚Äì19 Junior Grand Prix Final. Mishina/Galliamov made their international senior debut at the 2018 CS Alpen Trophy where they won the gold medal with a personal best score of 192.75 points. At the JGP Final Mishina/Galliamov won the gold medal after placing third in the short program and first in the free skate. They were part of a Russian sweep of the pairs' podium. Mishina/Galliamov beat the bronze medalists, Panfilova/Rylov, by about 4 points but the race for the gold medal was tight. Mishina/Galliamov won the gold medal by a margin of only 1.1 point over the silver medalists, their training partners Kostiukovich/Ialin. At this event Mishina/Galliamov also upgraded their junior-level pairs' record for the combined total (190.63 points) and free program (126.26 points). At the 2019 Russian Championships, they competed as seniors domestically, placing fourth in the short program with upgraded jump and throw content. They slipped to fifth place overall after placing fifth in the free skate when Mishina fell on the side-by-side combination jump attempt. Mishina/Galliamov subsequently won the Russian junior national title. Assigned to the 2019 World Junior Championships, Mishina/Galliamov placed third in the short program after Galliamov struggled on their side-by-side spin. They won the free skate, despite another fall by Mishina on the jump combination, and narrowly took gold over Panfilova/Rylov by a margin of 0.57 points. Galliamov said that being third after the short program had motivate them to perform better in the free. === 2019‚Äì2020 season: Grand Prix Final bronze === Mishina/Galliamov began their first full senior season on the Challenger series, competing and winning at the 2019 CS Finlandia Trophy after placing first in both segments. Making their senior Grand Prix debut at the 2019 Internationaux de France, Mishina/Galliamov were second in the short program behind Daria Pavliuchenko / Denis Khodykin. They won the free skate to take the gold medal, despite Mishina botching their planned three-jump combination. At their second Grand Prix, the 2019 NHK Trophy, they placed third in the short program after a jump problem from Galliamov. They were clean in the free skate, winning the bronze medal and qualifying for the Grand Prix Final. Competing at the Final, Mishina/Galliamov were fourth in the short program, skating cleanly but for their side-by-side spins not receiving a level due to errors. Third in the free skate, they won the bronze medal overall, the highest-ranked Russian team in the competition. Mishina/Galliamov ran into trouble in the short program at the 2020 Russian Championships, with Mishina falling on their throw triple flip, stumbling in the step sequence, and exiting the pair spin too early. Consequently, they placed eighth in the segment. The free skate proved much more successful, with them placing third, and rising to fourth place overall. She observed \\"we were not in a good mood, but we were able to recover.\\" === 2020‚Äì2021 season === In the spring of 2020, Mishina/Galliamov moved to train under Tamara Moskvina, the coach of numerous Olympic pairs champions, and choreographer Alexander Stepin. They were scheduled to compete in the second stage of the domestic Russian Cup, but had to withdraw after Galliamov contracted COVID-19. == Programs == (with Mishina) {class= style=text-align:center !

It combines the flag of Puerto Rico with two prominent elements of anarchist symbolism, the black flag and the circle-A. Anarchism as a social movement is one of the manifestations of the political left within the working classes of Puerto Rico, having its peak during the late 19th and early 20th century. Anarchism was predominantly present within, but not exclusive to, the working classes that emerged as the sociopolitical environment changed. The municipalities of Caguas and Bayam√≥n were the epicenters of the movement. It was also recorded in other industrial centers, such as Ponce, San Juan, Arecibo, Cayey, Cidra, Juncos, Vega Baja, Utuado, Lares, Yauco and Mayag√ºez. Despite sharing some core values, Puerto Rican anarchism was heterogeneous in nature. In general, Puerto Rican anarchism was distinctly anti-organized religion, in particular against the Catholic Church that had retained considerable influence since the beginning of Spanish colonialism. Following the Treaty of Paris, it also grew to oppose American sovereignty, as it perceived that the island was being forced into servitude with an Americanization initiative, leading to distinct antiauthoritarian stances against both foreign and local politicians, the wealthy higher classes and American labor unions. However, on principle (as an opposition to nationalism, which was viewed as a manner for the state to consolidate power) the anarchists opposed joining the independence movement. During the early 20th Century, anarchists were considered a small, but active, minority within the Puerto Rican left. The movement attracted women, particularly younger ones, who felt unsatisfied within what they considered a predominantly \\"patriarchal society\\". Initiatives were made to create schools for the uneducated fraction of the population. It also faced unique circumstances among the Latin American anarchist movements, operating under an American colonial administration (whereas all of the others operated in a post-colonial or neocolonial environment), by not conforming to particular ethnic groups and by lacking an influx of Spanish anarchists after 1898. They still opposed organizations that represented Spanish power, such as was the case in 1912, when they participated in an anti-Church campaign led by anti- clerical activist Bel√©n de S√°rraga. As part of their internationalist ideals, Puerto Rican anarchists would denounce the working conditions in places abroad, such as Tampa. Ultimately, defection of leaders and government intervention mined Puerto Rican anarchism. Some like Iglesias Pant√≠n did it early and formed an alliance with the AFL, eventually becoming a socialist senator in 1917. The union's ties with the AFL distanced it from the anarchist roots of Spanish syndicates, from which the local working class had been linked. The former formally adopted a liberal ideology that mirrored their associate. However, with it also came an anti-anarchist sentiment that was predominant within the higher echelons of the AFL. Romero Rosa moved away from anarchism as he made his move to party politics, being elected in 1904. On March 9, 1911, Vilar in representation of the CES lead the tobacco worker's strike at Caguas. During the late stages of the event, two wealthy citizens were shot. The colonial authorities responded by intervening with a number of anarchists, leading to reports of torture. The suspect was eventually tried and found guilty of first degree murder. Vilar was not accused in this case, but the colonial authorities decided to charge him for violating the public morality codes, after he denounced a case of child abuse by a member of the clergy. In 1915, Vilar died while serving the year sentence for which he was convicted. The event led to a crisis in which several leaders either migrated or left for more moderate causes. Another fraction of the Puerto Rican anarchists would migrate to political organizations, such as the Partido Socislista. Figures like Romero Rosa would be lost, in his case becoming increasingly conservative and abandoning his previous political stance. ==HistoryBackground and origins=== The first strike related to working conditions that is recorded took place at San Juan, then the capital of the Spanish colonial government, in 1848. Following the 1868 Spanish Republic and the abolition of slavery five years later, the economic changes pushed farmers to the urban centers of Puerto Rico creating a new working class composed by salaried plantation workers and \\"artisans\\" (craftsmen). Following the 1873 decree of free association by Primo de Rivera, tobacco workshops created recreation centers for the employees where liberal ideas were shared in plays held at gatherings (later classified as \\"a vehicle for class self- affirmation\\") and which led to the propagation of stances against what was perceived as work exploitation. This was followed by the systematic incorporation of mutual aid initiatives for collective well-being (such Santiago Andrade's Sociedad Amigos del Bien P√∫blico) and casinos, such as the C√≠rculo de Recreo y Beneficiencia. Camaraderie between the visitors to these groups allowed the systemic creation of a class identity, reflected in the emergence of cultural elements like Puerto Rican danza being born from it and initiatives to promote literacy (for which specific initiatives, like the Sociedad Protectora de la Inteligencia del Obrero, were created) and formal arts among its members. Later, the role of the lector (a literate speaker that was paid to read while the cigar rollers worked) was used to promote literacy and was also used in propagating leftist ideas, cooperativism and an open defiance to the authorities in order to preserve their autonomy. During the 1880s, following the abolishment of slavery a shift was seen with an increasing working class migrating to novel coffee plantations that were supplanting the sugar plantations of Spanish slavers. By 1890, lectores were known at San Juan, which being the capital and a port city, had access to a number of foreign publications where these concepts were discussed in detail. The labor movement, however, remained an emergent entity until late in the decade, and the development of local anarchist mirrored this tendency. At least ten working class newspapers would be created between 1874 and 1897, beginning with El Artesano. Most were published by region, with four appearing in Ponce and three in San Juan. Soon the educated sectors of this class began initiatives to educate illiterate individuals in the factories, mainly those devoted to the manufacturing of tobacco, where a \\"lector\\" or reader would read the local news and political/literary material sampled from the recommendations of a commission (Marx, Malatesta, Kropotkin, Bakunin, etc.) and chosen by the workers. They would later discuss the content within themselves. Groups that provided support in case of death or injury/illness were also organized. Cooperatives were first established during this timeframe. The sudden change in the landscape, however, created an over abundance of workers and not sufficient spaces to accommodate them. By the 1890s, strikes were being held to protest an increase in taxes. The appearance of anarchist newspaper Ensayo Obrero disturbed colonial governor Sabas Mar√≠n Gonz√°lez enough to write a letter to king Alfonso XIII of Spain, lamenting the impending expansion of anarchism through Puerto Rico. The functionary requested the Crown to pass laws that prevented the printed publication of the ideas. Santiago Iglesias Pant√≠n In 1896, Spanish-born anarchist Santiago Iglesias Pant√≠n -who claimed to had been involved in the anarchist movements abroad and that he had been forced to leave the Spanish possession of Cuba due to his involvement in their independence efforts- made a scale in Puerto Rico in a transatlantic voyage towards England. Once there, he decided to stay at San Juan, where he found ideological affinity with some of the residents. Towards the end of the decade, the first known copy of Mikhail Bakunin's Federalism, Socialism, Anti-Theologism was first recorded in Puerto Rico, being translated and reprinted locally at Mayag√ºez. This and other books were distributed along propaganda made by local prints and directed to the working class. At the moment, individuals like Ram√≥n Romero Rosa pushed these initiatives as an emancipative strategy. A literate segment of the class (led by figures such as Jos√© Ferrer y Ferrer) became increasingly radicalized and adopted the ideas of authors like Bakunin as they became freely available, leading the way for what would become the first groups identified with libertarian socialism. In 1897, Jos√© Ferre y Ferrer, Eusebio F√©lix, Fernando G√≥mez Acosta, Ram√≥n Romero Rosa and Eduardo Conde joined Iglesias in founding a CES called El Porvenir de Borinquen in San Juan, which would publish Ensayo Obrero, where they published from a variety of socialists stances including anarchism. Their bi-weekly reunions centered around these topics, backed by a growing library of anarchist and socialist literature. In 1898, Ensayo Obrero introduced female activist Dominica Gonz√°lez. By 1900, there were more than 30 CESs throughout Puerto Rico, with San Juan, Ponce, Cayey, Yauco and Mayag√ºez hosting more than one. These early anarchists believed that workers were intentionally being withheld an education and that patrons were limiting their free time and income towards this end in order to keep them disorganized. A strike led to the suspension of the lector, but additional pressure allowed the practice to continue. As CES distribution of publications and propaganda expanded, Esteban Rivera and Gabino Moczo made arrangements for a new institution where the materials were readily available and El Ensayo Obrero could be edited. After protests were held the day that Luis Mu√±oz Rivera swore in as prime minister of the new autonomic arrangement between Puerto Rico and Spain (February 11, 1898), the government and working class organizations were at odds. The Spanish authorities intervened with Ensayo Obrero, concerned with calls for a labor federation and international collaboration emerged from it. On March 25, 1898, a \\"proletariat meeting\\" was formally held led by Eduardo Conde, Ram√≥n Romero Rosa, Jos√© Maule√≥n, Jos√© Ferrer y Ferrer, Juan Cepeda, Emiliano Ramos and Santiago Iglesias Pant√≠n. Ensayo Obrero was fined, while Iglesias Pant√≠n was held and later arrested. Copies of Ensayo Obrero were expected to be sent to them for authorization, which the publishers often avoided resulting in fines and imprisonment for Ferrer and Iglesias. Ensayo Obrero remained neutral on the status of Puerto Rico, as Puerto Rico entered a new autonomy with Spain, the local anarchists took allied with the Autonomist movement in an attempt to reduce the foreign influence and sided with the eventual loser, Jos√© Celso Barbosa, since he proposed severing ties to the Spanish Liberal Party limiting the European presence more. The unexpected moderation of this editorial line was met with criticism from the more radical workers, who negatively called it a \\"conservative turn\\", while the editors began denying being labelled as anarchists in what they called a stereotypical and destructive sense. Regardless of this, the government withheld the publishing of Ensayo Obrero and jailed figures from the labor movement including Emiliano Ramos and Iglesias. ===Anarchists vs. American government=== Following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, autonomy was abolished in favor of a fully colonial administration. The situation worsened for the working class due to a rapid shift in the economic hierarchy, the devaluation of the Puerto Rican peso (later Puerto Rican dollar) and new cabotage taxes implemented by the American colonial government. The American Tobacco Company extended its presence in Puerto Rico, becoming the dominant organization within the local industry. The lack of local unions meant allowed it to supplant the traditionally independent artisan practice of cigar rolling with a systematic capitalist format which led to small cigar shops disappearing and experienced rollers being incorporated to the work force of these corporations and being given a limited role in a process that became increasingly focused on specific tasks. Local rollers, which had been historically self-reliant and had opposed oversight authority and forced structure, began adopting stances sympathetic to anarchism which were combined with the ideas imported from abroad. After being released by the new government Iglesias, who had been pro- American since his teen years, distanced more from the Puerto Rican independence movement. In turn, John Brooke blocked extradition requests from Spain. On October 20, 1898, the Federaci√≥n Regional de Trabajadores was formally organized under Sandalio S√°nchez. The former members of Ensayo Obrero would then fund the Federaci√≥n Regional de Trabajadores, in which anarchists such as Ramos gained leadership roles, which published El Porvenir Social. Like its predecessor, the organization failed to establish an ideological consensus and instead tried to establish links with labor movements of the United States and criticizing the Republican and Federal parties that had survived from the Spanish era and remained autonomist. These efforts lead to the recognition of their publication in the anarchist New York-based El Despertar. Led by Iglesias, the FRT was sympathetic to the Americanization process began by the United States, believing that the working environment there could be beneficial to the local labor movement, and began adopting American socialist initiatives. Following strikes within the tobacco industry of San Juan, the entity extended to Ponce, Carolina, Aguadilla and Fajardo including the typographic and dock workers (Muelle de Espig√≥n). Eventually further actions lead to a salary increase of 20-25%. Iglesias established an increasingly pro-annexionism stance with the FRT, which contrasted with their 1898 postures. El Porvenir Social would remain pro-Americanization, socialism and anarchism, publishing content from anarchist authors from abroad but exhibiting American symbolism. Meanwhile, Iglesias formed an alliance with Daniel de Le√≥n from the Socialist Labor Party, which sealed to establish a branch in Puerto Rico. The organization also introduced the celebration of May 1 to Puerto Rico, and in its first celebration workers carried the red flag. Leaders including Santiago Iglesias Pant√≠n and Ram√≥n Romero Rosa held reunions with military governor Guy Vernor Henry and San Juan mayor Luis S√°nchez Morales, in which they demanded eight-hour shifts among other benefits for the working class. Afterwards, a meeting was held outside the building where El Porvenir Social was published. Another was held at Mayag√ºez, in which Eugenio Mar√≠a de Hostos addressed the crowd. The pressure of these acts and similar events in at least seven more municipalities led to the passing of a compliant law on May 2, which proved ineffective in its application by the military government. As the group continued their criticism of local parties and promoted their support for annexation, the FRT began developing an internal schism as more of its members became sympathetic to the independence movement and nationalism in particular, citing the principles of \\"individual freedom\\" and \\"respect towards the motherland\\". This was complicated by some members siding with the Republican Party. This led to Iglesias, Romero and Conde's group to leave the FRT and create both the Federaci√≥n Libre de Trabajadores (FLT) on June 18, 1899. While adopting an offensive against the wealthy, the FLT was also critical of Puerto Rican nationalism, leading to arguments about Iglesias' status as a foreigner. Anarchists within the organization also faced threats of deportation. The FLT held two congresses on May 1, 1900, now composed by 30 workers unions and critical of the Foraker Act, they discussed the international scene, eight-hour shifts, propaganda and education among other topics. In 1900, the imposition of a foreign governor without democratic vote led to a series of events that concluded with a series of strikes, in which the authorities intervened against the FLT. Having been accused of being an anarchist and anti-American, Iglesias left Puerto Rico and began a drastic ideological shift within the FLT, which lead to ending its association with the SLP, and approaching the American Federation of Labor. Despite this, the FLT members that were left behind continued with their anarchist and pan- socialist stances, including Romero's La Miseria: Peri√≥dico defensor de la clase obrera, which openly made calls to keep worker associations libertarian and questioned the sponsored migration of Puerto Ricans to work in plantations in Hawaii and carnivals. Unsatisfaction with being represented by a Spaniard in the United States was present within some members of the FLT, while others questioned the agenda of the United States in Puerto Rico and denounced Americanization attempts, including Ferrer who lashed at the \\"American Colossus\\". Other members of the FLT such as Jes√∫s M. Balsac and Santiago Valle, began arguing for the use of the vote as a political tool to bring forth socialism by creating parties of their own. Several anarchists were skeptical of becoming involved in party-politics, considering them as nothing more than platforms for empty promises. Ideological mob violence began manifesting against anarchists and Severo Cirino was assaulted while working at the FLT headquarters. Strategic moves also abound and Venacio Cruz and Alfonso Torres began organizing a union at Caguas. May Day 1901 marked the final activities where anarchist stances were institutionally promoted by the FLT. Iglesias them began to move the FLT away from its previous stances by publishing a piece attacking anarchism as violent and archaic in the New York Journal and formally adopted trade unionism and officializing an association with the AFL, which actively opposed anarchists, within days as the materialization of his pro-Americanization stances. This piece was reprinted by La Miseria. Shortly afterwards, Iglesias reaffirmed his new posture and adoption of trade unionism by beginning arrangements to have the FLT an affiliate of the AFL, gaining influence by being named the AFL organizer for the Caribbean by Gompers and holding a meeting with Theodore Roosevelt. This led to conflict between both camps, centering around disagreements on these issues and the opinions about the United States colonial authority. Anarchists grew suspicious of Iglesias' motives, in part because he was being paid by the AFL and because his union leadership would work directly with the colonial governors, as a consequence they questioned his fidelity to the Puerto Rican work class and the wisdom of working with the state. Despite this anarchists would continue to use the FLT as a front to push their ideals, and Ferrer y Ferrer collaborated with Pablo Vega Santos to establish a subsidiary at Caguas. Others, like Cruz, would retain some presence in meetings. Iglesias would make his return to Puerto Rico by November 1901. The FLT experienced issues recruiting and began losing membership during the following years, only preserving a steady presence of carpenters and tobacco workers, which also complicates their coordination funding efforts. Both of these groups had retained their anarchist tendencies more than other offices, which clashed directly with the Iglesias leadership. Paca Escab√≠ would represent anarchists in the 1902 meeting. During the spring of 1902, both Romero Rosa and Fernando G√≥mez were attacked. Following a confrontation between Federals and Republicans, the FLT protested and in turn had several of its members arrested, including Romero Rosa and Corino. G√≥mez Acosta was also fired upon during an event, escaping harm. Anarchists were in turn accused of detonating a pipe bomb that resulted in a death at Humacao. This subordination lead to a move from anarchism to partisan socialism, it combined with unsatisfaction with actions of the colonial administration and resulted in members of the FLT seeking to remove anarchists from the organization. While admitting that not all of them where necessarily revolutionary socialists any longer, the leadership argued against expelling them. Anarchists would remain within the FLT, but published critical material promoting their own postures (in particular attacks on the Catholic Church and local politics) and reprinted foreign authors, with El Porvenir Social agglutination both the FRT and the FLT and holding association with anarchist groups throughout Ibero America (including Ciencia Social, La Revista Blanca, El Nuevo Ideal) despite also serving as the SLP's official paper. Content with anarcho-naturalist and anarcho-communist leanings was also published. The organization's base, however, drifted away from the formal standings of the organization and allowed enough room for anarchists to thrive in their methods to use it as a tool to promote their ideology among the workers. The arts ‚Äìplays, poetry, chorus and concerts ‚Äì were used to push the far left's concepts. Centers of study would serve to create a class of \\"organic intellectuals\\" that would then become involved in educating the illiterate, writing books/propaganda and hosting tribunes and discussions. Independent unions would emerge, but none grew powerful enough to be able to rival the FLT, instead infiltrating the ranks and creating splinter groups within it. On May 1, 1901, Palmiro de Lidia's Fin de Fiesta (under the guise of \\"socialist drama\\".) was highlighted in the festivities. Local anarchist plays would emerge, including Enrique Plaza's El Anarquista, Ram√≥n Romero Rosa's La Emancipaci√≥n del Obrero, Rebeld√≠as, Luisa Capetillo's En el campo, amor libre and Como se prostituyen los pobres, Jos√© Lim√≥n de Arce's Redenci√≥n, A. Mill√°n's El poder del Obrero (a.k.a. La mejor venganza) and J.M. Santiago's Los cr√≠menes sociales y Peluch√≠n el limpiabotas (a.k.a. La obra del sistema capitalista). Impromptu tribunes were organized in public plazas, but they frequently concluded in confrontations with the police. Anarchism grew increasingly popular among tobacco workers, but was also present among carpenters, barbers, binders, builders and shoemakers among other lines of work. The former were responsible for most strikes against the Trusts, and of distributing literature. They believed that strikes were the route to bring anarcho-communism by recovering the rights that they thought were appropriated by their patrons. These were still a minority and fell in conflict with other factions, in particular the workers affiliated with the Tobacco Workers International Union, who among other things accused them of being double agents tasked with destroying the unions from within. Shortly afterwards, the FLT was openly pushing candidates. Anarchists, however, were skeptical that the winners of the event would favor anything besides capitalism and began a campaign against political events. This stance lead to a direct confrontation between the movement and the United States authority in Puerto Rico, which they felt had allowed for an increased control by American corporative interests and the AFL. The FLT leadership supported an alliance between their Partido Obrero Socialist. In places like Caguas, the FLT subsidiaries were dominated by the distinctly anarchist nucleus such as Ferrer y Ferrer and Pablo Vega Santos. Juan Vilar's Solidaridad would become the first recorded anarchist group to operate independently. In 1903, Venacio Cruz published Fragmentos, where despite heavily reaffirming his anarchist postures in the poem \\"√âpoca Insana\\", he also offered respect to Ferrer y Ferrer and to Iglesias despite ideological differences. Escab√≠ once again represented the ideal at 1904 FTL meetings. She repeated this the following year, being joined by Marcela Torres de Cirino, in an effort to discourage the organization's involve with politics, a call that wasn't heard by the leadership. Meanwhile, Luisa Capetillo began writing at Arecibo and later she would take the role of lector. Luisa Capetillo. By 1904, the FLT was actively working with Partido Union and Romero Rosa ‚Äì having published the pro-suffrage, anti-authority, anti-capitalist and anti- colonialism work La cuesti√≥n y Puerto Rico ‚Äì won a seat as a delegate on the argument that workers could use their numbers to change these things. He would champion the eight-hour shift, and was in turn pressured to promote other initiatives such as the minimum working age for typographers. Rosa published Catecismo Socialista in 1905 in which he once again argued from an anti-state posture and concluding that only libertarian socialism or its counterpart, parliamentarian socialism, could solve Puerto Rico's issues. However, Rosa's political work angered some anarchists within the FLT, who used the Uni√≥n Obrera newspaper as a venue to vent these frustrations and label him a \\"sold out\\" and once again urged against becoming involved with political parties. In 1905, Balsac pressed for a variant of anarchism that he called \\"free socialism\\" in his Apuntes hist√≥ricos (de Mayag√ºez). This year was marked with strikes and the press, most notably La Democracia, began describing the strikers as uneducated being led astray by anarchists. Vega Santos retorted that they had become biased in favor of capitalism and the state, before criticizing that the government that considered itself democratic \\"threw strikers in jail\\". While Winthrop was increasingly concerned with the anarchist presence in the FLT, the strikes led to a 10-hour shift and a wage increase. This author also held the government-sanctioned carnivals in contempt and expressed being deeply disappointed that the working class would participate in them, a similar concern was shared by Fernando de Mantilla. Jos√© G. Osorio thought the same of taverns, distancing the Puerto Rican movement from the popular \\"beer halls\\" of their European counterparts. Publishing a book titled ¬°Solidaridad!, fellow anarchist Alfonso Torres labeled Americans as equal to the previous Spanish regime and dismissed the elections as a way to legitimize the representation of individuals that did not understand the conditions of the working class. Despite this, he felt that the FTL-AFL was the best way to push forward the union's social/economic agenda and eventual anarcho-communism, serving as a tool for their own goals. In letters published by anarchists during this year, they consistently labeled the United States as hypocritical for \\"claiming to be democratic\\" but utilizing the police to suppress strikes, one in particular comparing the modus operandi to Russia. Escab√≠ would echo Torres' comparison, but argued that the situation had actually worsened for the working class since the American invasion. Both authors would label the administration as mediocre and lashed against governor Beekman Winthrop, both of which were seen as an \\"imperialist\\" imposition. In 1906, the Caguas-Cayey Tobacco Company declared a strike, which was fueled by the anarchist media and soon extended to the Turina and Qui√±ones factories. The outcome of the protests was considered by the workers as a victory, which they touted in their newspapers, despite several being fired in the process. Confrontations continued, with Republicans emerging on behalf of the state, while arrests were ordered in response to publications. Puerto Rican anarchists actively monitored the international scene and reported on events such as Francisco Ferrer y Guardia's arrest on June 4, 1906. By this point his ideas had been actively adopted in the local community, being promoted by individuals such as Juan Vilar. In the anarchist center of Bayam√≥n, a street was named after Ferrer y Guardia. By 1906, an increasingly conflicted Rosa published an essay apologetic of anarchism (calling it \\"an ideal that is extremely honorable and good\\") titled \\"El poder de la amistad\\" as part of Entre broma y vera, where he also complimented Kropotkin. Later that year he tried running for the Partido Uni√≥n, which led to being expelled from the FLT, dying a year later. By publishing Hacia el porvenir Venacio Cruz made another anti-suffrage, anti-patriotism and anti- state plight, in the process attacking Romero Rosa. Between 1906 and 1907, anarchists tried to sabotage the impending arrival of the Cigar Makers International Union, which began receiving formal recognition on January of the latter year, believing that it could lead to an American monopoly. Writers including Venacio Cruz criticized the entity for charging a fee that was considered unacceptably high, and argued that workers would become indifferent towards unionism. The CMIU responded that such a stance compromised the entirety of unionism and accused him specifically of being a double-agent. Parallel to this, Pedro San Miguel, Pablo Vega Santos and Juan Vilar worked on the organization of the Great Assembly of Puerto Rican Tobacco Workers. Others wrote abroad lamenting a lack of eagerness for resistance. In 1908, an atheist library at Ponce distributed the work of Kropotkin among other leftists, despite not being strictly anarchist. As their agenda against American-style unionism and elections increased, anarchists would continue to chastise any worker that entered political contention and the FLT itself. Through Voz Humana the Caguas anarchists openly mocked any idea that the November elections would change anything. A generalized idea that workers were being duped into choosing between two dummy parties ‚Äì Partido Union and Republican ‚Äì in a divide and conquer strategy became prevalent within the group, who noted that ultimately the only real power lies in Washington. As the elections approached, Torres' La farsa electoral en Puerto Rico and Pol√≠tico, jam√°s were published. However, when the FLT ignored their plight and made a move to become a separate party. In October, Negr√≠n abandoned the union and formed his own, leading to a fight with the foreman of the Porto Rico American Tobacco Company in which he was non-fatally shot. At the elections, the workers running for the established parties fared well, but the FLT's experiment finished with 1% support. Torres criticized through the Eco del Torcedor. In December 1908, the editors of this publication would be fined following a trial for libel, due to their stances and they decided to relocate to Bayam√≥n before ceasing press. Resuming their conflict with Iglesias the following year, anarchists wrote abroad to call him a hypocrite and a sellout. Despite this, others also became involved with the FTL-sanctioned Cruzada del Ideal, a campaign to promote leftist ideals throughout Puerto Rico by using cultural and artistic displays. Among those involved was Torres. In 1909, San Miguel and Dieppa created a spiritual successor to El Eco del Torcedor, the tobacco workers' Nuevo Horizonte. Having already reached the adult population, Vilar began the first leftist school in Puerto Rico, distancing it from both public and Christian education. He was particularly critical of the children's religious beliefs and the recreation that they were exposed to at gaming parlors, publicly writing about it. Educational initiatives for both adults and children were focused at Bayam√≥n, Caguas and San Juan and their CESs. The execution of Ferrer y Guardia also inspired the anarchists like Vega Santos and Enrique G√≥mez to lash against public and Christian education, reflecting their intention to follow in the steps of his Modern School system. The establishment of the Centro Racionalista Juventud Estudiosa emerged as a consequence. (nombre completo) As the number of women workers grew, especially in the tobacco industry, the writings of Capetillo began to have an effect and by 1910 she had published a newspaper named La Mujer. That same year, anarchists led by Negr√≠n began a fundraiser for strikers at Tampa by themselves, following indifference from other working class groups. It was not until a Floridian letter complaining that the only help came from Bayam√≥n was published at Ensayo Obrero that others would join. Most of San Juan's Nuevas Ideas group were anarchists led by Severo Cirino and Alfonso Torrs, the latter of whom credited Vilar with inspiring the idea. Within a decade, the FLT membership had increased to 54 unions. During these years, the celebration of May 1 would retain far left influences. After the AFL adopted Labor Day, the FLT followed. Despite it being considered an \\"official celebration devoid of a revolutionary past\\", anarchist plays such as Pietro Gori's Primero de Mayo and Palmiro de Lidia's Fin de fiesta would be exhibited during them. When the Dr. Ruiz Soler Sanatorium was being constructed, the tobacco workers paid for a building for tuberculosis patients. They organized a number of funds that were redirected to other initiatives, such as students abroad. Their practice of donating money to fuel strikes elsewhere led to the creation of a blacklist to keep certain workers out of the factories. Within the first decade of American sovereignty, the workforce in cigar rolling increased nearly 200% as the ATC reached nearly 80% of the market. This facilitated the propagation of anarchist ideas among some workers, which came to resent American intervention in Puerto Rico. This early form of libertarian socialism coexisted with other socialist tendencies among the working class. In 1910, ¬°Solidaridad! became Trece de Octubre to honor Francisco Ferrer y Guardia and a meeting was held to commemorate his death where plays and artistic manifestations were organized. This was short lived, and within a year they were named Juventud Estudiosa. That same year, another activist advocated withdrawing the FLT from any electoral event, Antonio Qui√±ones R√≠os, and delegates supported the move ending their political incursion and providing a moral victory for anarchists. The Labor Day activities held at Caguas were hosted by Vilar and according to Vega Santos, were the largest working class gathering seen at the city up to that point. Despite this, a shortage of tobacco leaf and Vilar's health as he developed sharp stomach pains and blurred vision threatened the CES that year, forcing it to focus on innovative approaches including a band, a short-lived attempt to publish a paper and more plays. A conglomerate of groups joined to hold a meeting on the anniversary of Ferrer y Guardia's death, in which they advocated for the adoption of his education model. As Vilar worsened he received some aid, but soon afterwards this stopped coming and his wife also fell ill, infuriating the leader who wrote seven letters critical of the state of the working class and why he felt that they abandoned the CES during his illness. Responses to this were mixed, Enrique G√≥mez of the FLT accused him of misappropriating union funds, but colleagues in Bayam√≥n helped pay the treatment when he exhibited psychiatric symptoms. In 1911, J√≠menez, Barrios and Negr√≠n supported the strikes by publishing a specialized paper, ¬°La Huelga! √ìrgano Defensor del Movimiento. After leaving to New York in 1912, Capetillo continued writing to anarchist papers on the topic of anarcho- feminism. Parallel to this, Francisca Barrios wrote in the local and foreign anarchist press. ===The Ventura Grillo crisis=== The publications linked to Ferrer y Ferrer were clear in their anti-government stance, believing that any form of government was oppressive in nature, while also bearing characteristics of positivism in their belief that once the control was removed, everything would fall into place. Protests were promoted as the ultimate tool towards this goal, in particular general strikes, while bloodshed was discouraged. However, others like Capetillo had grown to accept retaliatory violence as unavoidable and justifiable, citing the deaths of Ferrer y Guardia and Sh≈´sui K≈çtoku as well as the Haymarket affair as examples were the confrontations with the government led to murders that were sanctioned as legal. In general she justified that only a minority of anarchists attacked first, while criticizing the Church and those involved in the 1898 French Revolution of perverting their ideals by using them as justification for killing. In March 1911 a black tobacco worker and anarchist named Ventura Grillo was involved in a strike and amidst the tensions assaulted the trio of √Ångel N√∫√±ez, Jos√© Mar√≠a Berr√≠os and Rafael Ceferinos. Attempts to have him interned in a facility for the mentally ill failed. However, the newspaper La Correspondencia publicly labeled him as insane. On March 9, 1911, Grillo decided to retaliate by firing a gun against Adri√°n P√©rez of E. Moreno and Co. in Caguas, also murdering an innocent bystander named Pedro Jos√© D√≠az who tried to help. In later writings, Santiago Iglesias tried to link the incident to an association between the target and the West Indies Corporation. Two days later Justo Andrade, a sympathizer of the state, responded by murdering striker Alfonso Reyes. In response, Centro 11 de Marzo -an anarcho-communist reunion center and library at Bayam√≥n- was created by a group led by Negr√≠n, Ram√≥n Barrios and Epifanio Fiz Jim√©nez. Grillo would confess that he was an anarchist and that others conspired with him, but defend himself by claiming that P√©rez had declined the strikers demands the previous day. These events created a crisis for Puerto Rican anarchism, since the police responded by multiplying their presence at Bayam√≥n and Caguas, while the reading of far-left literature was prohibited. Juan Vilar was arrested. The secret police under the orders of San Telmo breached the Centro 11 de Marzo and confiscated all literature and propaganda. Having offered strategic support to strikes among the tobacco workers, the intervention forced its closure. Juventud Estudiosa suffered the same fate. The processing of 33 arrested workers was overseen by prosecutor Acosta Quintero. As more buildings were breached in search of associates that had been declared fugitives such as Enrique Plaza, military governor Colton joined Telmo in entering Vilar's Centro de Estudios Sociales. Propaganda, literature and newspapers were confiscated. A joint effort by tobacco workers, the FLT, Federaci√≥n Espiritista and others provided food and legal defense to the arrested. Meeting with the military governor also took place. Acosta would label the suspects as an \\"anarchist cell\\" and the dismantled CES would be described as an \\"anarchist club\\". The prosecution argued that the CES had tried to manufacture dynamite sticks, but most were released. Vilar was briefly released, only to be arrested again. He would remain in custody along Grillo, even as the others were released, after the police failed to gather information of an \\"anarchist conspiracy\\". While the Tribunal Supremo granted him a release on habeas Corpus violation the state appealed and he remained in prison. At Caguas, Acosta charged him with \\"crime against honesty\\" for publishing an article linking a pedophile to the Church (republishing articles from the La Voz del Cantero newspaper). Vilar was found guilty, sentenced to remain in jail for eighteen months and fined on April 26, 1911. Grillo's trial began the following month and the defense cited \\"temporary insanity\\", exploiting the press portrayals which failed to convince a jury that convicted him on first degree murder charges. Colton would receive complaints of several of the arrested, who claimed irregularities with the process, illegal domicile searches, illegal interrogation, inhibition of legal aid, libel, assault and false imprisonment. While the colonial governor and general attorney Foster V. Brown conceded that Acosta had overstepped, they were apologetic about the situation and justified his actions. In June 1911, the appeal in Vilar's case was seen by the Tribunal Supremo, which ratified its previous stance that an habeas corpus violation had taken place. Anarchists would shift the focus of their activities to Bayam√≥n. Afterwards, Colton himself would speak ill of the Juventud Estudiosa CES and blamed it for Grillo's actions, all the while claiming that he would \\"not tolerate breaking the law or backstabbing plots from anarchists\\", emphasizing that \\"anarchy and anarchist societies have no room in this territory\\". The Grillo case would have a significant impact on the anarchists' propaganda, with the lector being controlled to prevent its propagation. However, anarchists and other radicals would continue their activism, attacking the corporations by using the legal system. When Andrades went on trial for the murder of Reyes, a group led by Negr√≠n served as witnesses, and the jury found the defendant guilty on November 3, 1911. That same month, however, St. Elmo placed T√≥mas Vega, Francisco Pag√°n and Luis Aguilar on trial at Bayam√≥n for pushing anarchist ideals in public, for which they were all fined. Vega Santos warned about an impending strike on the CES. The detective would focus on 11 de Marzo and Colton authorized the police to breach the building, which led to its permanent closure. Vilar tried appealing his charges on \\"honesty\\", a case which eventually found its way to the Tribunal Supremo with the collaboration of the FLT, which in November upheld the conviction of the Caguas court but reduced it by six months. His health worsened rapidly and Espiritistas including Juan Obrer and the editor of Iris de Paz magazine Ram√≥n Negr√≥n Flores began fund raising to help him. Vilar was released in 1912 and published P√°ginas libres, but his health issues prevented any significant contribution afterwards and he died on May 1, 1915. ===Work in exile and distantiation of leaders=== The upper echelons of the FLT did not use the events at Caguas to give exposure to the involved as symbols or \\"martyrs\\" for the cause, while the government stopped discussing them in their media, as a consequence of this anarchism would experience a sharp decline in support. Concurrent to this, the FLT's arguments for pushing trade unionism through political parties became more popular and anarchists lost more ground within the workers. The tobacco trust also decided to use the events as justification to ban those involved in the strike, crippling the movement by precipitating the migration of its leaders to diverse locations, including New York, Habana and Tampa. The anarchist migrators joined other leftists like Bernardo Vega. Joining those that left because of lack of work were the ones that intended to avoid the government, in total being the majority of the prominent anarchists. Despite their exile, they continued in communication with Puerto Rican colleagues and informed of their status. In example, after a strike erupted within the local sugar industry, an assembly to support the workers was organized by the exiles at Lexington Avenue, in which figure such as √Ångel Mar√≠a Dieppa, Rafael Correa, Herminio Col√≥n, Ventura Mij√≥n and Antonio Vega make appearances. They also mingled with foreign anarchist- friendly groups such as Industrial Workers of the World. At least a dozen, including figures like Dieppa and Plaza, would be active in participating in strikes held abroad. FLT-backed strikes still raged, between 1913 and 1914 tobacco workers protested, in 1915 agricultural workers destroyed plantations and the police responded by targeting them. As demands to congress for legislation that protected them fell short and the working conditions and wages worsened as foreign corporations took over the local industries, the union began looking at the possibility of going back to politics. In March 1915, the Partido Socialista was born and Iglesias Pant√≠n was named the president of this independent branch. Parallel to this, Severo Cirino denounced the measures that the government of Cuba was taking in the adjacent island. The PS distanced itself from anarchism, but their ideals still found their way into it. Affiliates Juan S. Marcano, Enrique Plaza and Jos√© El√≠as Levis Bernard employed anarchist symbology in their books. Actual anarchists, however, were divided with a group led Pablo Vega Santos distancing themselves from the posture, while others continued their campaign against party politics. Those that remained, in particular Dieppa, lashed against the new PS affiliates. Vega Santos responded by calling him a traitor and accused him of being a double agent for the wealthy. Dieppa countered by recalling that this was not the first time that Vega Santos had participated in political parties and that he was paid well for it. Despite this, in El porvenir social he would argue that even a \\"Republican socialist regime\\" would be better than the current state, but not as ideal as anarcho-syndicalism. In 1914, Capetillo joined the organized workers in Cuba, the following year becoming involved in a strike and endorsing a manifest created by the Federaci√≥n Anarchists de Cuba. In response to this, president Manuel Garc√≠a Menocal ordered her deportation. Despite this, Capetillo would remain in contact with Anarchists such as Jaime Vidal, who collaborated with her in Mi opini√≥n. When prominent anarchists like Jean Grave, Malato, Reclus and Kropotkin publicly supported the Allies during World War I, Puerto Rican anarchist Juan Jos√© L√≥pez rebutted the posture as \\"brainless\\", citing that it was disingenuous to believe that several of its members really opposed militarism or that a triumph would usher in an era of prosperity or democracy. He argued that in the end, all that it would bring was more homeless and more maimed individuals. Likewise, Dieppa lashed out against soldiers, calling them \\"the lowest slaves\\" and \\"[worse than] a eunuch\\" urging them to abandon enforcing the state and join the workers. This proved a departure from the influential postures of international anarchism in response to their own values. Upon returning from their exile, Capetillo and Dieppa, employing their connections in an attempt to aid a struggling anarchist movement. Now lacking a local press, they employed Cultura Obrera from New York to publish their propaganda, in exchange funding that paper. After the police interrupted a reunion at the Bayam√≥n FLT in February 1916, both sides clashed, leaving Negr√≠n wounded. At New York, Dieppa, Herminio Col√≥n and Mij√≥n supported the strikes happening within the sugar industry. During this time, Alfonso Torres, Alicea and Rafael Acosta collaborated with Vega. The legal imposition of the United States citizenship and later the military draft on Puerto Ricans marked 1917. Iglesias had used the FLT and PS to push for the first, while anarchists didn't take a posture on the issue. Consequently, they didn't publicly react to the Jones Act. Resident commissioner Luis Mu√±oz Rivera and other politicians lobbied in favor of extending selective service to Puerto Rico and Enoch Crowder granted it. Institutionally, the FLT supported it and as president of the PS, Iglesias Pant√≠n did as well. Anarchists, nationalists and independentists opposed the draft and campaigned against it. Jos√© M. Alicea was arrested during a month for refusing to register. After local legislation limiting speech and federal sedition laws were passed during World War I, Dieppa publicly attacked the authorities and was arrested, tough the case would later be decided in his favor. Pedro Calleja was detained while returning to Puerto Rico due to possessing Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), membership. As strikes continued to wage during the war, colonial governor Arthur Yager declared martial law and prohibited public demonstrations and leftist propaganda. As a result of disobeying and participating in a strikers meeting, Capetillo was arrested. Her treatment was protested by fellow anarchist Ram√≥n Barrios and sympathizer Epifanio Fiz Jim√©nez. During World War I, Bayam√≥n anarchists continued their activism. At the 1917 general elections, the PS recorded 14% of the vote, electing six members in the municipalities. With Iglesias also winning a seat in the Senate of Puerto Rico, this boosted his argument that this was the way to weaken capitalism. In 1918, the Grupo Souvarine and a CES was created. PS leader Rojas displayed signs of adopting several anarchist ideas, becoming interested in the Bolshevik Revolution, distancing himself from Iglesias and others within the FLT leadership. In January, the Bayam√≥n and Puerta de Tierra groups were collaborating in a strike within the tobacco industry. Negr√≠n and Barrios travelled to Cuba to coordinate with the groups there. Later, when the DOJ was investigating Florida-based Jos√© Mart√≠nez Gil, agent Byrd Douglas claimed that he collaborated with the duo. In November 1919, the Juan M. Alicea, Antonio Palau and Emiliano Ramos established El Grupo Soviet de Bayam√≥n. The hybridization of socialist and anarchist discourse continued, and by 1919 Marcano was labeling a number of international anarchists as \\"martyrs\\" a posture that he had also expressed in regards to Vilar, who was regarded as a \\"noble apostle\\". An agreement between the tobacco workers and the Trust was reached in 1917. However, two years later a joint effort in Puerto Rico, Cuba and Tampa responded with strikes after claiming that the accord was not being honored. Anarchist Alfredo Negr√≠n was sent to Havana along another delegate to work on propaganda and fuel the strike sentiment. However, they were arrested as soon as they reached port and following the intervention of the Socialist Party and the International Tobacco Union on their behalf, deported from Cuba. A meeting was held to denounce the situation. On February 23, 1919, the federal government breached the headquarters of El Corsario at Lexington Avenue on charges of intending to bomb Wilson and arrested, among others, Puerto Rican Rafael Acosta. In 1919, √Ångel Mar√≠a Dieppa published his take on the ideals of anarchism in El porvenir de la sociedad humana. In 1919, while continuing their activism at New York, Mij√≥n and Acosta collaborated with the newspaper El Corsario. Dieppa and Acosta did their part by supporting strikes in the city. Juan Alicea and his brother, Jos√©, created a network that distributed El Comunista between Puerto Rico and New York and to create ties between locals and foreign activists. Among its strategic moves beyond the boundaries of Puerto Rico, El Comunista supported the American Communist Party and economically supported the Russian Revolution. The IWW, which had ties to Puerto Rico through Domason N√∫√±ez, tried to unsuccessfully establish a local branch. Local anarchists expressed sympathies for their methods and Alfonso Torres defended the modus operandi of the \\"Wobblies\\" as \\"quicker and more economical\\", for which he was insulted by union leaders. In May Day 1920, the Bayam√≥n faction created El Comunista, having adopted the term comunista to describe their anarcho- communist leanings, which was distributed internationally and expressed moral support for the IWW. The paper was supported by the income of its distribution at San Juan, Cayey, Ponce, Utuado, Salinas, R√≠o Piedras, Caguas, Tos Alta, Manat√≠ and Cata√±o besides Bayam√≥n. The inauguration of the paper featured Sandalio Marcial attack the new education system, which anarchists believed promoted American militarism. This would be a talking point for other members, such as Antonio √Ålvarez and Manuel Garc√≠a, who criticized the formation of the Puerto Rico National Guard, which he expected to \\"repress\\" strikes. This went along a critic against president Woodrow Wilson for the US intervention in Central America and the Caribbean, which they considered \\"hypocritical\\", since the nation promoted itself as a defender of democracy. This group demonstrated their independence from the larger unions anarchists by directly attacking the FLT/AFL/CMIU, as they reflected the extent of that their alliance with groups from abroad -such as Tampa, Havana, Key West and Pinar Del R√≠o- by emphasizing their situation and fund raising for strikes. El Comunista allowed anarchists to directly attack the union leaders, in particular Iglesias Pant√≠n and Vega Santos, and to attack the Union Party for its pro-independence stance. Venacio Cruz used this juncture to counterattack for the FLT leadership having labeled him a \\"strikebreaker\\" (for protesting the fees of the foreign unions in 1905 and later in 1911 and 1914 for distancing from the institutional postures) on several occasions. Juan Ocasi√≥n called the former anarchists \\"submissive\\". Iglesias used the union organs to fire back and called them \\"strikebreakers\\" on the issue of Florida, also lambasting the IWW and accusing Palau of using the FLT to \\"draft dodge\\". In response, El Comunista published a piece by William Dudley Haywood, which questioned the FLT leaders by recognized the union's affiliates. When Iglesias compared Samuel Gompers to several leftist authors and activists, El Comunista mocked the idea and called him a \\"hack\\". The exchanges between Iglesias and El Comunista aggravated internal differences within the PS, which combined by the leader's support for Americanization gathered opposition from a group that included non-(and former) anarchists such as Plaza, Marcano and Rojas. At the 1919 convention, Iglesias was questioned about his changing stances on the war and military service. Palau had used this stance to argue that he had placed the union in the hands \\"of pro-war advocates\\" and to sell war bonds. The Independence of Puerto Rico was also discussed, with Torres cautiously arguing that it could be used to advance the worker's agenda. Rojas supported the stance, but Iglesias did not allow the status issue to be discussed. A then-liberal and independentist Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n approached El Comunista and despite speaking well of the work done by anarchists during decades also advocated that the colonial situation was preventing any radical ideas from flourishing and that they had to work within the electoral system while working in parallel to advance the conditions for a social \\"revolution\\" so that independence would not lead to the same elite taking over, only to be rebuffed by editor Ventura Mij√≥n who argued that they wouldn't \\"abandon [their] principles\\" and disregarded the political status issue by claiming that making \\"common cause with the American Communist Party\\" and the Third International was a quicker way to achieve their goals. The issue of independence would be touched in a pro-Soviet article by Amelio Moraz√≠n, who argued in favor of self- determination. Three months prior to the colonial suffrage, Rojas took over the FLT's Uni√≥n Obrera and offered a sympathetic posture, in response El Comunista ceased their attack on Iglesias. At the 1920 general elections, the PS recorded 23.7% of the vote, winning eight municipalities. The Red Scare was enacted in Puerto Rico as it was throughout the hemisphere. By September 18, 1920, El Comunista denounced that it had been denied second-class by the USPS, a common employment of the Espionage Act against far left propaganda during this period. In response, copies were distributed abroad using covert methods and carried by migrating activists. In July 1920, three issues of El Comunista were seized during a raid against IWW members at Arizona. Along this, the newspaper received an increasing amount of money from abroad. In December 1920, the United States Bureau of Investigation began an investigation on local leftist groups, including the local anarchists. When the relevant report was filed on January 31, 1921, Bayam√≥n was its main focus, under the pseudonym of \\"Communist Party of Porto Rico\\". This was coupled with the systematic layoff of workers that along foreign investors had contributed to create a $100 surplus for the paper and in February 1921, El Comunista published its last issue. As it came under federal scrutiny, the Bayam√≥n anarchist faction disappeared from the public. It was that same year, when the news of the Soviet suppression of Russian anarchists became widely known, that Caribbean anarchists distanced from them and their form of communism. ===Clandestinity and modern anarchism=== Even though no group publicly advocated in its favor during the unrest that lead to the resignation of Ricardo Rossell√≥ in July 2019, the circle-A was ubiquitously found among other protest graffiti painted throughout Old San Juan. Faced with more conflict with the government, anarchist activities in Puerto Rico were taken underground. Whereas they would rely on propaganda and newspaper during the movement's heyday, they would leave little to no paper trail behind after the events that unfolded during the 1920s. Capetillo died in 1922, an event that diminished the local anarchists due to her popularity. Alfonso Torres distanced himself from anarchism and went on to gain prominence within the PS. As their movement continued to lose momentum, others like Ram√≥n Barrios, also joined the party. Activism now focused abroad, with Dieppa and Marcial leading similar publications at New York. Meanwhile, Jos√© M. Alicea became involved with the Ferrer School. Others, like Emiliano Ramos, continued to contribute to publications abroad. Meanwhile, Dieppa continued to become involved with the Florida anarchists and as a writer, continued fostering his message. Emiliano Ramos continued his work as a writer for the IWW's Cultura Proletaria until 1931. In 1932, Ferrer y Ferrer published Los ideales del siglo XX, in which he distanced himself from his anarchist past and tried to push libertarianism as a superior alternative while also defending an annexationist posture. J.R. P√©rez's contribution in 1933 marked the final correspondence between the Puerto Rican anarchists and the IWW. In 1934, Ventura Mij√≥n participated in the formal foundation of the Puerto Rican Communist Party, with other vestiges of the movement being seen in the occasional public mention of anarchism, mostly emerging as a reaction to the Spanish Revolution of 1936. The rise of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party monopolized the revolutionary ideas in Puerto Rico. It was not until the 1960s that a silence of several decades ended, with the creation of the Taller Libertario Luisa Capetillo and their publication of their take on the namesake. Entering the following decade, and now with closer ties to the socialist ideals, the Uni√≥n de Socialistas Libertarios emerged from within the UPR and adopted a number of anarchist leanings such as publishing Bandera Negra on April 10, 1972, celebrating May Day and giving classes on the concept. During this time, the presence of anarchism was recorded within the students of the Universidad de Puerto Rico, but ultimately this resurgence vanished as other far left ideas were more popular. During this decade, \\"left libertarians\\" represented a percent within the Partido Independentista Puertorrique√±o (PIP). After the Luis Fortu√±o administration passed Public Law 7, which downsized the government and led to thousands of public workers being waved, anarchists made their presence known in a number of marches that followed. These individuals adopted a number of international icons, such as the black flag and the hymn La Internacional. Shortly before the 2010‚Äì11 UPR strikes, anarchist students would begin hosting lecture groups at the UPR, gathering a number of unaffiliated sympathizers together. In June 2009, Puerto Rico Libertario was created. The largest group to emerge was Acci√≥n Libertaria, which adopted a modified version of the flag of Puerto Rico among other symbology. La Acci√≥n Libertaria and Semillas Libertarias made use of the Internet ‚Äì through blogs and websites ‚Äì to disseminate information and propaganda. Besides the focus on anarchist education, these groups revived the use of plays. Acci√≥n Libertaria's stance is anti-state and anarcho-communist, while the second made emphasis on international libertarian collaboration. Besides the events that lead to the UPR strikes, other areas were the state \\"intrudes\\" in civilian affairs -such as the relationship between development and the expropriation of lands- are of interest to these groups. Another cell organized a conference of the North American Anarchist Studies Network, attracting a crowd of at least 200. A group known as C.C.C. held a number of activities. However, it disbanded after a year, while Acci√≥n Libertaria also saw a reduction on its membership. Other, independent groups continued appearing during the mid-2010s. A different modality, anarcho-capitalism, started gaining public exposure in the wake of the destruction that hurricane Maria caused at Puerto Rico. This was a direct consequence of the arrival of a large group of cryptocurrency investors, who when interviewed noted that they intend to create a hub named \\"Puertopia\\", from which they hope to implement their libertarian models. ==Philosophy and political stancesSelf-perception=== Despite heavy European influence, Puerto Rican anarchists considered their own conditions different from other places. In the words of Luisa Capetillo, they perceived themselves as \\"fair, equitative, humanitarian, amicable, [...] loyal [and] brave\\", among other things and considered their role as that of protectors and martyrs of a \\"universal fraternity\\". Both √Ångel Mar√≠a Dieppa and Juan Jos√© L√≥pez argued that anarchism was the way to \\"harmony\\", the first labeling it \\"perfect order without government\\" and the second a way for \\"new days, more environment, mate light, more teachings, more realities, more hope [and] a life of cooing and love\\". Local anarchists expressed their beliefs through pro-revolutionary poetry, stories and plays, all as a manifestation of the desire to abolish the higher classes as the means to secure a social equality. Both Juan Jos√© L√≥pez and Romero Rosa wrote fictionalized accounts of violence being used to bring fort a \\"social revolution\\". Initially the Puerto Rican anarchists used the red flag associated with socialism, despite belonging to their own subgroup and their collaboration being only on matters of common interests. ===Religion=== Luisa Captillo wearing men's clothing. Puerto Rican anarchists were distinctly anti-religion and pro-naturalism, with L√≥pez claiming that it would open the way to eradicating \\"the monopoly of instructive schools, with the free teaching of rationalism and humanities\\", free of what he considered \\"mystical ideas\\". Romero Rosa was the leftist standard bearer against the Catholic Church, attacking it in 1899 and again in 1904's La cuesti√≥n social y Puerto Rico where he attacked it as an \\"instrument\\" of capitalism. Ferrer y Ferrer considered the figure of Satan ideal, as he was \\"free and emancipated\\". Several considered the teachings of Jesus an early example of anarchic social communism, and argued that he was a rationalist teacher. Capetillo argued in favor of Espiritismo and also urged anarchists to study the writings of Krishna, Emperor Yao, Confucius, Philo and Jesus, in order to understand their ideas about love. Despite her support for Espiritismo, she urged not to become involved with organized religion. Capetillo's belief was influenced by the work of Leo Tolstoy and she believed that an anarchist life would result in the ideal outliving the physical body and being reborn through reincarnation. Vilar was also interested in Espiritismo and wrote on the individual's \\"essence\\" and physical/spiritual components of Nature, which was part of a reciprocal relationship in which spiritists also supported turning their center into \\"schools that followed rationalist and lay principles\\", his main protect. Besides their disdain for organized religion, both groups overlap on some issues during the early 20th Century, opposing the death penalty and the consumption of alcohol, as well as pushing for the involvement of more women in their initiatives. This lasted until 1911, when Espiritistas began to distance themselves from class issues. Others, like Juan Jos√© L√≥pez disregarded Espiritismo along the other religions. Despite a general anti- organized religion posture, the idealism of Puerto Rican anarchism led to a phenomenon where some adopted the practice of santos laicos or \\"secular saints\\", a monk-like life style that involved renouncing addictive substances like tobacco or alcohol and living their life to denounce them as vices that \\"corrupted\\" the working class and \\"brought misery\\". ===Progressivism=== Capetillo recognized the uncertainty of the future as abstract and \\"utopic\\" in nature, but goals and ideas as more concrete and practical. Despite this, some like Venacio Cruz considered the downfall of \\"bourgeois society\\" inevitable, and \\"complete liberation\\" only a matter of time. Others within the movement, like Fra Filipo, felt that only unions and syndicates would be able to accomplish this goal. Class war was seen as a facilitator for worker class opposition and the motivator of \\"revolutionary\\" ideals. Dieppa also believed that no matter how revolutionary their actions at the time were, they would seem unimpressive and \\"conservative\\" to future generations. This call was done despite knowing well that they were perceived discordantly by a large segment of the population, either as violent or as delusional. ===Political status of Puerto Rico=== A perception that the independence movement was being pushed onwards by members of the higher classes and had become elitist, as well as influence from the AFL and the idea that foreign involvement could help in local confrontations with patrons, moved the mainstream working class towards an annexationist approach as far as political status was concerned. As the devaluation of the Puerto Rican coin in favor of the USD resulted in most of the viable terrains being acquired by American interests, the AFL gained increasing influence over the local labor movement. Anarchists, however, grew increasingly uncomfortable with the \\"Americanization\\" efforts taking place on Puerto Rico and directed their suspicions at the AFL's role within them. As such, they adopted an anti-nationalist stance, but also remained distant from the annexationist ideas. They ultimately rejected all of the political status options offered to Puerto Rico, considering them unsatisfactory and unrevolutionary, instead promoting anarcho-syndicalism as the real solution. Sandalio Marcial attacked the Union Party on the topic, arguing that the institution did not argue in favor of removing power from the capitalists and that Puerto Rico would still remain economically tied to the United States, a type of \\"bourgeois independence\\". In 1914's , socialist Rojas argued that even if Puerto Rico became independent, the economy would be in the hands of \\"foreign capitalists\\" and argued that in order to overcome capitalism, patriotic ideas would need to be pushed out so that a unified front could emerge between all of the left's spectrum. ===Collaboration=== In Puerto Rico, the anarchist movement opposed the influence of the AFL, the politics of the United States, the influence of the Catholic Church and other institutions that they regarded as imposing on the freedom of Puerto Ricans. Alliances were promoted and in the long run, they created alliances with groups as diverse as the freethinkers and the Espiritistas (based on sharing a common interest in their opposition of the Catholic Church) with the posture of some like Capetillo facilitating these links. Vilar also participated in loose associations with members of the FLT and PS, collaborating in common interests. During the 1910s, Bayam√≥n anarchists collaborated with the New York-based Cultura Obrera and Brazo y Cerebro, which were also distributed locally among other foreign publications. During the 1920s, the Soviet- influenced El Comunista would publish articles that adopted an anarchist perspective and even feature Ventura Cruz as a collaborator, this before the confrontations between anarchists and Bolsheviks during the October Revolution. Puerto Rican anarchism is based both locally and in the states, depending on the migration waves throughout history. Early on, its members established themselves within the tobacco workers in New York, Florida and Cuba, where they became involved with local anarchist movements and collaborate with the publishing of propaganda. This characteristic allowed them to forge connections and create international networks within Latin America and the United States. Years after the Cuban-based newspaper ¬°Tierra! was closed down by its government, the Bayam√≥n-based El Comunista was created and gained visibility within the Spanish-speaking anarchists, becoming widely distributed locally and internationally. Local propaganda was influenced by a number of foreign books that were distributed in locales, activities and through mail and through formal distribution companies. Correspondence with foreign anarchists and publications further expanded the local ideal, which still exhibited deviations from the European ideas. Anarchist newspapers also collaborated in inter-municipal networks to share resources and content. Puerto Rican anarchists made use of leftist plays that were staged for the public and written abroad for similar purposes. This was one of several efforts of coordination with anarchist organizations in Latin America (i.e. Havana) and the United States (i.e. New York and Tampa), both due to cultural ties and the migration patterns. ===Democracy=== Among the more militant sector of anarchism, American democracy was treated as fraudulent and as a refuge for the affluent, calls were made not to participate in the elections. As the support for the United States grew among the working class, Juan Jos√© L√≥pez cautioned against it by citing incidents such as the Haymarket affair and its ramifications, Tampa cigar makers' strike and the confrontations between the federal government and the Industrial Workers of the World, the case of Sim√≥n Radowitzky, among other examples against the ideas of Republic- based democracy. He criticized the colonial administration for employing the police to counter strikes and called those that still believed in the American flag and constitution \\"fools\\", insinuated that the working class leaders had become tools and only served to discredit the class struggle. However, an internal dichotomy had emerged early on between figures like Alfredo Negr√≠n, Juan Vilar and Venacio Cruz, who at this point openly disregarded political parties and opposed the FLT and figures like Capetillo and Ferrer y Ferrer who saw some use in them. In respect to this, Ferrer y Ferrer pointed towards the tribal nature of non-working class political parties and accused them of favoritism and perpetuating the power of patrons, he also warned about benefits being offered to quell revolutionary ideas. Cruz equated politics to a \\"vengeful tribunal\\" that was established to keep an \\"iron grip\\" over the people and that the more that power is legitimized, the more the need for \\"slaves\\" would grow. Dieppa, in turn, argued the role of the \\"social contract\\" as a tool of capitalism and expressed that politics were used to deepen divisions that distracted from the \\"true freedom\\" of Puerto Rico. Romero Rosa accused politicians of only \\"trying to get a hold of the tit\\" and disregarding their constituents. C√°ndido Ruibola summarized the stance by stating that \\"as long as there are governors and governed, there can't be a [functional] society [...] since all rights are restricted\\". This antagonism extended to other elements that were believed to be collaborative of this beyond the government itself and patrons/business owners, such as the police. They also disregarded the Republican model as \\"absurd\\" and as just another form of authority equivalent to monarchies or even empires, also refusing to grant legitimacy to any Constitution. They also separated anarchism from socialism in their discourse and considered the latter inferior, criticized parliamentarian socialism, considering that it had grown obsolete and was inherently unbalanced, with individuals consuming more than they worked to produce. They saw the local Partido Socialista Republicano as only interested in winning elections, had grown conformist and lacking a revolutionary cause. In essence, they considered it an idea \\"of authoritarian legalism\\". Despite this, they still made references to the red flag -red specter or red struggle- despite this growing distanced from anarchism throughout the world and instead becoming a communist symbol. ===Social issues and gender roles=== In sociological terms, anarchists believed that wealth was unfairly distributed as a result of a lack of morals inherent to capitalism, which they equaled to feudalism and slavery in terms of depending of the \\"exploitation\\" of the lower classes. Capetillo labeled it \\"salaried slavery\\" and considered it even worse than the classical versions. Believing that most inmates ended as such due to lack of education or resources, they condemned the penitentiary system, considering it nothing but a form of punishment that didn't rehabilitate them. Anarchists actually lobbied for the abolishment of the system and its replacement with industrial schools. Prostitution was a contentious topic, which most anarchists considering it a manifestation of the \\"social condition\\", misery and outdated education and condemned its practice, all the while separating it from the women whom they considered were being exploited. Capetillo advocated anarcho-naturalist postures that argued for sexual liberalization. She was one of the few anarchists that saw prostitution as a way for both sexes to satisfy natural urges without the need for masturbation, which perceived as unnatural, and not as something necessarily negative. On the other extreme, Vilar despised prostitution, seeing it as another byproduct of capitalism. Marriage was also considered a form of slavery, claiming that it \\"caged\\" individuals and distracted them from their ideals, in practice preventing them from rebelling. Emiliano Ramos was another anarchist that advocated \\"free love\\". In this same line, anarchists believed that anyone that didn't believe in their concept of free love was either \\"hypocritical or ignorant\\". In regards to the role of women in society, Capetillo advocated that they should be able to become activists in her \\"utopia\\". Capetillo protested \\"enslaving\\" gender roles and argued that if women were supposed to teach children, it made no sense to only teach them how to do housework. Ultimately, she concluded that such a family was only possible in an anarcho- communist society. Dieppa was more paternalistic regarding the role of women in an anarchist society, where they would perform work adequate to them and focus on educating the children in their ways after pregnancy. ==Puerto Rican anarchist literature== Entering the 1890s, the Centro de Estudios Sociales, a distinctly leftist organization with heavy anarchist presence, was created as a propaganda tool where anarchist publications were available for free. The colonial government was vigilant of the entity. During this decade, Puerto Rican anarchists joined libertarian and pro-revolution socialists in the creation of a labor movement with the foundation of the Federaci√≥n Regional de Trabajadores and the Federaci√≥n Libre de Trabajadores. The tobacco industry was their main origin, with the municipalities if Caguas, Bayam√≥n and San Juan serving as their main bastions. This line of work also influenced the migration of these workers, along their ideology, to other locations in Latin America and the United States. Coming in contact with other anarchists abroad allowed the flow of information to and from Puerto Rico, leading to a symbiosis of information and identifying parallel issues. The FLT and FRT would publish two socialist publications, Ensayo Obrero and El Porvenir Social, which featured some anarchist authors. The former was edited by Ferrer, G√≥mez and Romero, adopting broad pro-socialist stances with an emphasis on anarchism, which were later adopted by the latter. In 1905, Juan Vilar published the first local anarchist publication, Voz Humana (1905‚Äì06) at Caguas. Bayam√≥n and Caguas would serve as base for the publications that followed during the following decade and a half. However, most of these were short-lived. Vilar also collaborated with anarchist publications from abroad, such as ¬°Tierra!, which would eventually find their way back to Puerto Rico. Local anarchists would also made use of other newspapers through correspondence, in which they attacked their opponents and exposed their visions for the future. Despite the FLT becoming affiliated with the AFL, anarchists would use their publications to publish their messages, but not without being critical of the first. Publications with ties to the freethinkers and Espiritismo were used. However, the international anarchist press was used prominently to coordinate. Papers such as El Despertar and ¬°Tierra! (since at least October 1903) formed part if this network, with the second being invested in and brought back to Puerto Rico after printing and distributed. Juan Vilar and Pablo Vega Santos lead funding efforts for at least 99 of ¬°Tierra!'s issues, which were headlined by Caguas and San Juan but included at least a dozen municipalities. During the 1910s, the Puerto Rican anarchists based in New York established a link with the publications Cultura Obrera and Cultura Proletaria property of Pedro Esteve, using both as outlets. Sympathizers in Puerto Rico would fund international anarchist initiatives. Local authors would write columns in these papers, creating links between groups. Tobacco factories, caf√©s and other working class establishments were used prominently in the distributions of these papers. Books also appeared, like Venacio Cruz's Hacia el porvenir and Luisa Capetillo's Ensayos libertarios (1907), Influencias de las de las ideas modernas (1910), Mi opini√≥n sobre las libertades, derechos y deberes de la mujer como compa√±era, madre y ser independiente (1911), Influencias de las de las ideas modernas (1916) and √Ångel Mar√≠a Dieppa's El porvenir de la sociedad humano (1915) defined the heterogenous ideals of Puerto Rican anarchism in written form. When writing their propaganda fliers/booklets and newspapers, anarchists were open about possessing subpar literacy, blaming societal norms for this and employing it as a method to distance themselves from the upper classes. In their works, Puerto Rican anarchists expressed the belief that science had become a tool for capitalism and only served the rich and powerful, also caricaturing the formally educated as pretentious and \\"evil\\", being capable of perceiving the evils of the world but not of doing enough to counter them. They also held the belief that even those workers that became fully literate would need extended exposure to the working class, or risk becoming assimilated into the ways of capitalist society. Early on, individuals like Romero Rosa and Ferrer y Ferrer were responsible for collaborating with several newspapers, while others such as the working class La Miseria allowed space for anarchists despite a possessing broader scope. In April 1901, they published an article attributed to Charles Pelletier and which directly defends anarchy, as well as poetry praising the philosophy. In 1902, Pedro Goyco published the satirical El An√°rquista joining organized groups such as ¬°Solidaridad! (Ferrer y Ferrer, et al.) and their Adelante newspaper. The latter would then become Voz Humana in 1904, published by the same \\"center for social studies\\" in Caguas, and was open about its anarchist leanings to the extent of offering the work of several authors along the subscription. This paper encouraged the Caguas-Cayey Johnson tobacco factory strike by publishing a manifesto drafted by the employees. This move led to protests in other factories, namely Turina and Qui√±ones. Voz Humana made a number of approaches abroad, collaborating with the Catalan ¬°Salud y Fuerza! and contacting the adjacent El Productor Libertario, as well as a number of Spanish newspapers including Tierra y Libertad, El Porvenir del Obrero, El Proletario and La Voz del Cantero. Its closest international contact was with ¬°Tierra! from Havana, which had subscribers in at least eleven Puerto Rican municipalities. In exchange, authors like Juan Osorio, Alfonso Torres and Paca Escab√≠ wrote for the Cuban newspaper. Ferrer y Ferrer would also be involved in 1904‚Äì06's Humanidad Libre (along founder Juan Vilar, Prudencio Rivera Mart√≠nez, Tadeo Rodr√≠guez and Pedro San Miguel), Hijo del Pueblo (along Venacio Ort√≠tz) and Avante (along Vilar, Rivera, San Miguel, Rodr√≠guez, Antonio Arroyo and Pablo Vega Santos). Voz Humana's tendency to publish earnings, spendings and subscriber lists provided enough information for the use in police raids, ergo, using pseudonyms (such as Ferrer y Ferrer's \\"Rabachol\\") and systematically creating several newspapers became a common practice that served as a way to avoid government censorship or starting a new publication after the former one ran out of funding. Other works include Juan Jos√© L√≥pez's Voces libertarias and Juan Vilar's P√°ginas libres. Other sources would also contribute to the spreading of anarchist literature. A number of publications unrelated to the philosophy, like El Combate, La Sotana and El Obrero Libre gave their ideas space for articles. By 1909, the tobacco workers introduced the newspaper Nuevos Horizontes. That same year, members of the FLT began publishing Luz y Vida magazine, publishing the work of Juan Montseny Carret and covering figures like Francesc Pi i Margall and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, among other working class topics. In 1910, a group that included San Miguel and Rivera Mart√≠nez founded the Club Ideas Nuevas, a repository of liberal literature, and adopted the magazine. In 1920, the anarcho-communist publication El Comunista began being published in Bayam√≥n, finding its way to international anarchist organizations. Following the Red Scare, the American colonial administration intervened with this group, amidst a reactionary popularization among Latino anarchists in the United States that had resulted in investment coming from abroad. The move concluded in the closing of the newspaper and the destabilization of the Puerto Rican anarchist movement. ==Legacy and influenceAcademic study=== Anarchism in the Caribbean as a whole remained unpopular among historians until the 1990s. While the local labor movement had been studied and documented for decades, mentions of the role of anarchists within it were scarce, brief and/or negative. In literary works, anarchism has been used as a replacement for disorder, as was the case of Concepci√≥n G. de Font's Anarqu√≠a Monetaria which had related to coin exchange and had little relevance to the political definition of the term. When covering a series of strikes held by the Republican Jos√© Maule√≥n, Fernando J. Mat√≠as employed the term despite the disorder being in support of a political party in an antithesis of the local practices of the anarchism movement. Cartoonish depictions of anarchists were also present in books, as was the case in Planta Maldita (authored by socialist activist Jos√© El√≠as Levis Bernard). The local movement did get occasional mentions in work published abroad, such as Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed. The exploits of Capetillo also gathered attention and she remains the most studied figure within the labor movement of Puerto Rico, gaining the nickname the \\"Red Emma Goldman of the Caribbean\\". Local academics in general, did not cover anarchism in their works. However, foreign authors did mention it, such as Max Nettlau in his 1927 piece Contribuci√≥n a la bibliograf√≠a anarquista de la Am√©rica Latina hasta 1914, in which Voz Humana is discussed as a libertarian publication. In Historia social latinoamericana Carlos Rama made passing reference to the International's presence in the Caribbean. This author later collaborated with √Ångel J. Cappelletti in El anarqu√≠smo en Am√©rica Latina which analyzes Puerto Rican anarchism and traces its roots to similar Spanish movements, also discussing their anti-American postures as consequence of the direct relation with capitalism. In Anarquistas en Am√©rica Latina David Vi√±as discusses local anarchism and granted some credit to the literates, besides the working class, in its creation. In his book The Cuban Revolution: A Critical Perspective, Sam Dolgoff cites this as an example of \\"how little it is known about the anarcho-syndicalist origins of the labor and socialist movements in the Caribbean area\\". During the 1970s, while the local economy has shifted from agrarian to increasingly industrial, some Puerto Rican academics incorporated the ideology to their curriculum, but faced opposition by the dominant Marxist leanings present within the community and was locked in an ideological dispute with it. Most of these works questioned the historical narrative that had been adopted since the beginning of that century (which persists today) and introduced the working class as a historical presence that had been omitted, in part due to individuals like Salvador Brau, Jos√© Juli√°n Acosta or Cayetano Coll y Toste belonging to a wealthier class. √Ångel Quintero Rivera's Lucha obrera en Puerto Rico combined with a series of relevant works, which were the basis to create a local study of the history of the working class. The American interventionism in Latin America also emphasized a sociocultural stance among the local pro-independence and socialist groups that influenced this process and facilitated the creation of revisionist academic groups. C√©sar Andreu Iglesias felt that anarcho- syndicalists were the first ideological influence in the Puerto Rican working movement, citing other examples in Latin America. However, √Ångel G. Quintero felt that there were deeper circumstances that allowed for this ideology to take hold. Gervasio L. Garc√≠a traces this to socialist libertarian tendencies among the tobacco workers and the \\"proletarianization\\" of cigarmakers. In Apuntes para la historia del movimiento obrero puertorrique√±o, Juan √Ångel Sil√©n cited some early anarchist work and argued its place in local history. The centralization of Iglesias Pant√≠n's role and the claim that the American invasion ignited the organization of the working class would remain the predominant posture among local historians until the 1970s, when institutions like the Centro de Estudios de la Realidad Puertorrique√±a (CEREP) and individuals like Am√≠lcar Tirado Avil√©s established that there already were stages of proto-organization prior to it. During the 1980s, Rub√©n D√°vila Santiago published works documenting and supporting libertarian socialism from a cultural perspective, Teatro obrero en Puerto Rico (1900-1920) and El derribo de las murallas: Or√≠genes intelectuales del socialismo en Puerto Rico. This author's work on the labor movement included Ram√≥n Romero Rosa's play Rebeld√≠as and a couple written by Capetillo. In Historia cr√≠tica, historia sin coartadas: Algunos problemas de la historia de Puerto Rico, Gervasio L. Garc√≠a argumentes that anarchism had been relevant until the end of the 19th Century and lost by the 20th. In 1990, Norma Valle Ferrer published a feminist take on the life of Luisa Capetillo, Historia de una mujer proscrita, establishing parallels between her and Emma Goldman. Two years later, Julio Ramos published Amor y an√°rquia: Los escritos de Luisa Capetillo. Garc√≠a and √Ångel G. Quintero discussed the influences of international anarchism and socialism during the early stages of the literate working class in 'Desafio y solidaridad: Breve historia del movimiento obrero puertorrique√±o (1997). In her collaboration for 1998's Identity and Struggle and the Margins of the Nation-State: The Laboring Peoples of Central America and the Hispanic Caribbean Eileen J. Findlay offers an insight on gender perception within anarchists of the early 20th Century. In general, Puerto Rican anarchism was avoided by historians in favor of positivist approach that emphasizes select figures instead of movements. During the 1970s, the first attempts to create a parallel narrative were made. In 2005, Carmen Centeno A√±eses published Modernidad y resistencia, a study of working class literature from the early 20th Century. unlike others that preceded her, she included Venacio Cruz in her research. In 2008, Arturo Bird Carmona published an analysis of early 20th Century tobacco workers at Puerta de Tierra titled Parejeros y desafiantes, including an ongoing dichotomy between union and anarchist workers. He documented the impact of pre-Partido Socialista anarchists within the tobacco workers of Puerta de a Tierra in San Juan. In 2013's Black Flag Boricuas, author Kirwing R. Schaffer summarized the environment at Puerto Rico as \\"twentieth-century anarchists dealing with twentieth-century colonialism\\". In this respect, the author considered that \\"the anarchist experience in Puerto Rico was unique in the Americas\\", since they faced a colonial government (and hence a double fight against local and American interests) instead of a national government. Upper class teen aged girls that came in the contact with anarchist literature became the symbol used in books and plays to portray a social \\"awakening\\". ===Popular culture=== Since the 1890s and following the turn of the century, the local media used \\"anarchism\\" as a negative term, as something foreign (one, in particular, cites the \\"miserable\\" parts of Paris, London or Madrid as its source), self- destructing, capable of destroying Puerto Rican society and preventing its development. Even publications linked to the working class were involved in this tendency. Nowadays, the perception of anarchist as destructive remains within the conservative media, as was the case of El Vocero extrapolating the main motivation of the 2010‚Äì11 UPR strikes to it. Others, such as centrist El Nuevo D√≠a, have used the term as a substitute for \\"chaos\\". Prior to this, the 1892 publication El Eco Proletario: Semanario consagrado a la defensa de la clase obrera promoted the creation of unions, but advocated against strikes and was skeptical about anarchism . Within the left, it fared better. Anarchist-friendly newspapers included Voz Humana, El Eco del Torcedor, El Sentinela and Nuevo Horizonte. The FLT's Luz y Vida also published their pieces. In El Centinela, Severo Cirino advocated and republished the idea about \\"class parties and workers unions\\" that came from Europe. In 1910's Vida nueva socialist Jos√© El√≠as Levis Bernard portrays his ideas of anarchism through the car√°cter of \\"Lis√≠ Archeval\\". Likewise -while members of the PS- Juan Marcano and Magdaleno Gonz√°lez still wrote positively about anarchism in 1919's P√°ginas rojas. Despite leaving anarchism for socialism, Plaza depicts a sympathetic depiction of anarchy in 1920's ¬°Futuro! in the form of main character \\"Rosa\\". In recent artistic manifestation, vocalist Ren√© Per√©z of Calle 13 has self-identified as anarchist in his single Mis disculpas, having also previously touched on the topic in another song, Vamos a Portarnos Mal. ==See also== *Anti-authoritarianism *Libertarianism ==References== Footnotes Bibliography * * Category:History of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico Puerto Rico ","title":"Anarchism in Puerto Rico"},{"id":"56799910","text":"Bogdan Aleksandrovich Bliznyuk (born March 31, 1995) is a Ukrainian basketball player for Kyiv-Basket of the Ukrainian SuperLeague.

The Northern Front covered the area between Pskov and Vyatka. It bordered the Eastern Front of the Red Army along the Balakhna - Yarensk - Glazov - Cherdyn, Cherdyn line. The Front headquarters were located in Yaroslavl. The Northern Front was replaced by the Western Front on 19 February 1919. == Operations == The North-eastern and Northern area of the Northern Front, had no continuous line of defense, as natural conditions made combat operations impossible in most areas. Operations were mainly conducted along main transport communication lines (rivers and roads). The 6th Army conducted an active defense along the Vologda - Arkhangelsk - Kotlas - Northern Dvina line. The strategic task of the army was to prevent the joining of the armed forces of the White Movement in the North and the East of Russia. The 7th Army conducted defensive battles on the outskirts of Petrograd in the Inter-District area, on the Karelian Isthmus and the Narva - Pskov line. In January 1919, during the Battle of Shenkursk, the 6th Army stopped the advance of the enemy and created favorable conditions for a counter-offensive against Arkhangelsk.

She has primarily directed documentary films about human rights, women's rights, secularism, and criticism of religion. == Biography  Career until 2011 === Nadia El Fani was born to a French mother and a Tunisian father. Her father B√©chir El Fani was one of the leaders of the Tunisian Communist Party after independence. He appeared in her film Ouled Lenine. She is the sister of cinematographer Sofian El Fani. She began working in cinema as an intern in 1982 in the film Misunderstood by Jerry Schatzberg, shot in Tunisia. Next she became assistant director and worked with, amongst others, Roman Polanski, Nouri Bouzid, Romain Goupil and Franco Zeffirelli. In 1990, she directed her first short film and created her first video production company in Tunisia, Z‚ÄôYeux Noirs Movies, to produce and direct her films in this country. Being close to Tunisian militant feminist groups, she began making documentaries in 1993 with Femmes Leader du Maghreb and Tanitez-moi. El Fani relocated to Paris in 2002, during the postproduction of her first long fiction film, Bedwin Hacker. She wanted to escape the regime of Ben Ali, Tunisian society which she felt was becoming more conservative due to the pressure of Islamists, and the threats she received for two controversial scenes in Bedwin Hacker. Thereafter she directed several documentaries, including Ouled Lenine in 2008. In the autumn of 2009, El Fani was diagnosed with breast cancer, and began chemotherapy treatment, causing hair loss. === Neither Allah nor Master controversy === El Fani discusses the Neither Allah nor Master controversy at the Secular Conference 2014 in London. The 2011 documentary Neither Allah nor Master (Ni Allah ni Ma√Ætre, a play on the Ni dieu ni ma√Ætre slogan coined by French socialist Louis Auguste Blanqui in 1880), in France released under the title La√Øcit√©, Inch'Allah ! (\\"Secularism, God willing!\\"), describes the events leading up to the Tunisian Revolution and those directly following it, focusing on the role of Islam in the public sphere. In the film, El Fani states that the fall of Ben Ali should not only bring about political freedom, but also religious freedom. She defends la√Øcit√© (secularism), and warns against the threat of Islamism. In late April 2011, El Fani was invited by Hannibal TV to discuss her new film on television in a studio with 500 people. She reported that the message of her film was well-understood, and there was no hostility from the audience in the room. Although she confirmed she was an atheist herself, she claimed that Neither Allah nor Master was \\"not anti-religious\\", but a defence of separation of religion and state. At the time of the interview, she was bald because she was still undergoing chemotherapy. An edited shorter version of the interview went viral online shortly after, causing an Islamist backlash. During the film's premiere in April 2011 in Tunis, dozens of Islamists attacked the cinema, breaking down the door shouting Allahu akbar! with black flags and effectively preventing the screening. Islamist lawyers filed complaints against her film. El Fani received numerous death threats for being an atheist and bald, and was the target of massive defamation on social media. One person on social media promised 200 million dinars to whoever would kill her. She decided to flee Tunisia and once again return to France to escape persecution and imprisonment. Her film premiered in France on 21 September 2011 with the title La√Øcit√©, Inch'Allah !, and she received the Prix internationale de la la√Øcit√© for it. She was also recovering from her cancer, joking that \\"The Revolution was the best of the remedies\\". Although she hoped to return to Tunisia \\"to live there and finally be free\\", she was afraid to go and that her passport would be confiscated. === Career after 2011 === El Fani directed M√™me pas mal in 2012. In it, she compares her personal struggle with breast cancer to the political struggle against Islamic fundamentalism. After Tunisian FEMEN activist Amina Tyler was arrested for posting a nude photo of herself online in 2013, El Fani was one of many who supported her. She shared an image of herself on Facebook with a statement on her chest: ‚ÄúMy body belongs to me and is not the source of anyone‚Äôs honour.‚Äù In 2013, she co-directed Nos seins, nos armes !, a documentary about the FEMEN movement for France 2. On 2 June 2017, the six complaints lodged against her in 2011 following the broadcast of her film Neither Allah nor Master were dismissed. In November 2017, she returned to Tunisia to present her film M√™me pas mal. It was the first time in six years she had been to Tunisia and seen her father, during which all her films had been banned by the state. == Filmography == Nadia El Fani speaks about her work and the audiences' reactions at the Secular Conference 2017. * 1990: Pour le plaisir (\\"For the Pleasure\\", short fiction film) ‚Äì director * 1992: Fifty- fifty mon amour (\\"Fifty-fifty My Love\\", short fiction film) ‚Äì director * 1993: Femmes Leader du Maghreb (\\"Women Leader of the Maghreb\\", long documentary film) ‚Äì director * 1993: Tanitez-moi (long documentary film) ‚Äì director * 1995: Mon c≈ìur est t√©moin (\\"My Heart is My Witness\\", Qu√©b√©cois-Tunisian long documentary film by Louise Carr√©) ‚Äì producer * 1998: Tant qu'il y aura de la pelloche (\\"As Long As There Is Film\\", short documentary film) ‚Äì director * 2003: Bedwin Hacker (\\"Bedouin Hacker\\", long fiction film) ‚Äì director, screenwriter and producer * 2005: Unissez-vous, il n'est jamais trop tard !

He is best known as the official who presided at the trial of the Scillitan Martyrs, dated to 17 July 180. His complete name is attested in inscriptions as Publius Vigellius Raius Plarius Saturninus Atilius Braduanus Caucidius Tertullus. His origins are not known for certain, although G√©za Alf√∂ldy believed he came from the Greek-speaking part of the empire.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand unter der Antoninen (Bonn: Rudolf Habelt Verlag, 1977), p. 320 Bernard R√©my claims that based on the elements in his name Saturninus is related to Herodes Atticus.R√©my, Les carri√®res s√©natoriales dans les provinces romaines d'Anatolie au Haut-Empire (31 av. J.-C. - 284 ap. J.-C.) (Pont-Bithynie, Galatie, Cappadoce, Lycie-Pamphylie et Cilicie) (Istanbul: Institut Fran√ßais d'√âtudes Anatoliennes-Georges Dum√©zil, 1989), p. 311 Only portions of the cursus honorum of Saturninus, drawn from various sources, remain. His earliest recorded office, based on an inscription on a statue base found at Troesmis was as legatus or commander of Legio V Macedonica. It had been thought this brief inscription was evidence that he had been governor of Moesia Inferior, but Alf√∂ldy has shown that it is more accurately interpreted as evidence for his command of the V Macedonica.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, pp. 365-367 Both R√©my and Alf√∂ldy date his commission as extending from the year 159 to 162.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 299 Another post he is attested as holding is governor of the imperial province of Lycia et Pamphylia, which R√©my dated from 162 to 164. His term as suffect consul followed. The latest office Saturninus is recorded as holding was one of the apices of a successful consular career, proconsular governor of Africa, which was in 180/181; since a senator was eligible for this office about fifteen years after his consulate, his consulate can be estimated to have been around the year 165.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 180 It was during his tenure in Africa that he presided over the trial of the six African Christians known as the Scillitan Martyrs in Carthage.An account of the trial is preserved in the Passio Sanctorum Scillitanorum, translated by J. Stevenson and W.H. C. Frend, A New Eusebius: Documents illustrating the history of the Church to AD 337 (London: SPCK, 1987), pp. 44f His life after he stepped down from the governorship is unknown. == References == Category:2nd-century Romans Category:Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Category:Roman governors of Lycia et Pamphylia Category:Roman governors of Africa ","title":"Publius Vigellius Saturninus"},{"id":"56800329","text":"The house-museum and memorial complex of Huseyn Javid () is a memorial museum dedicated to the Azerbaijani poet and playwright, Huseyn Javid.

It was contested between six teams; Canada, Hong Kong, Oman, Papua New Guinea, the United States and tournament hosts Namibia. It formed part of the 2017‚Äì19 cycle of the World Cricket League (WCL) which determined the qualification for the 2023 Cricket World Cup. The final and third-place playoff match were granted One Day International (ODI) status by the International Cricket Council. Namibia won the tournament, after they beat Oman by 145 runs in the final. It was Namibia's first win in an ODI match, and it was the first ever ODI match played by Oman. ==Summary== Hong Kong and Papua New Guinea finished in the bottom two places in the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier, therefore relegating them to the Division Two tournament and losing their ODI status in the process. They were joined by Canada and Namibia, who finished third and fourth respectively in the 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Two tournament, and Oman and the United States, who won promotion from the 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Three tournament. Following the conclusion of the tournament, the World Cricket League was replaced by the ICC Cricket World Cup League and the ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League. The top four teams joined Scotland, Nepal and the United Arab Emirates in the 2019‚Äì22 ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 and gained ODI status. The bottom two teams progressed to the 2019‚Äì21 ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League, along with other teams from the World Cricket League. The United States were the first team to be promoted, after they beat Hong Kong by 84 runs in the fourth round of matches. Oman were also promoted in the same round of fixtures, after they beat tournament hosts Namibia by four wickets. In the final round of matches, Namibia and Papua New Guinea secured promotion with big wins. Canada won their final match, against the United States, but finished narrowly behind Papua New Guinea on net run rate and were relegated to the ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League, along with Hong Kong. Following the round-robin matches, Canada played Hong Kong in the fifth-place playoff, the United States played Papua New Guinea in the third-place playoff, and hosts Namibia faced Oman in the tournament's final. Claire Polosak was appointed as one of the on-field umpires for the final, becoming the first woman to stand in a men's ODI match. ==Teams== Six teams qualified for the tournament: * (9th in the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier) * (10th in the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier) * (3rd in 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Two) * (4th in 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Two) * (1st in 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Three) * (2nd in 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Three) ==Preparation== The United States took part in a one-week tour to Antigua, playing five matches, starting on 10 February 2019. USA Cricket also looked at arranging warm-up fixtures against Australia and Pakistan, followed by two Twenty20 International (T20I) matches against the United Arab Emirates, and some 50 over matches in the UAE during March 2019. Oman hosted a Twenty20 International (T20I) quadrangular series followed by three List A games against Scotland in February 2019, before taking part in an eight-team T20 tournament in Kenya during March 2019. Canada played practice matches in Sri Lanka and South Africa before naming their final squad. Papua New Guinea and Hong Kong were both aiming to regain ODI status after losing it at the conclusion of the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. Canada were attempting to regain ODI status that they had lost in 2014, and had recruited the experienced Monty Desai to help guide them back to the top tier of Associate cricket. Hosts Namibia had been regulars in the top divisions of the World Cricket League, but their only previous ODIs were back in 2003, and they had faced a lack of international cricket in the months prior to the tournament in relation to their opponents. The United States were competing in Division Two for the first time, and were a team on the rise following a change in administration. Oman's form had fluctuated since qualifying for the 2016 World T20, the low point coming when they were bowled out for just 24 runs in a List A game against Scotland in February 2019. ==Squads== {  width=\\"100%\\" - ! width=33%  ! width=33%  ! width=33%  - valign=top * Davy Jacobs (c) * Bhavindu Adhihetty * Navneet Dhaliwal * Nikhil Dutta * Romesh Eranga * Ruvindu Gunasekera * Dillon Heyliger * Nitish Kumar * Hiral Patel * Cecil Pervez * Ravinderpal Singh * Rodrigo Thomas * Srimantha Wijeratne * Saad Bin Zafar valign=top * Anshuman Rath (c) * Ahsan Abbasi * Tanwir Afzal * Tanveer Ahmed * Jamie Atkinson * Mohammad Ghazanfar * Babar Hayat * Aizaz Khan * Ehsan Khan * Scott McKechnie * Ehsan Nawaz * Kinchit Shah * Jhathavedh Subramanyan * Shahid Wasif valign=top * Gerhard Erasmus (c) * Jan Frylinck (vc) * Stephan Baard * Karl Birkenstock * Jean Bredenkamp * Jan-Izak de Villiers * Zane Green (wk) * Zhivago Groenewald * Jean-Pierre Kotze * Tangeni Lungameni * Bernard Scholtz * JJ Smit * Christi Viljoen * Craig Williams * Pikky Ya France - ! width=33%  ! width=33%  ! width=33%  - valign=top * Zeeshan Maqsood (c) * Khawar Ali (vc) * Fayyaz Butt * Sandeep Goud * Aqib Ilyas * Kaleemullah * Bilal Khan * Suraj Kumar (wk) * Sufyan Mehmood * Moonamchery Michal * Mohammad Nadeem * Khurram Nawaz * Jay Odedra * Badal Singh * Jatinder Singh valign=top * Assad Vala (c) * Charles Amini (vc) * Simon Atai * Sese Bau * Kiplin Doriga * Jason Kila * Nosaina Pokana * Damien Ravu * John Reva * Lega Siaka * Chad Soper * Tony Ura * Norman Vanua * Anthony Vare valign=top * Saurabh Netravalkar (c) * Karima Gore * Elmore Hutchinson * Aaron Jones * Nosthush Kenjige * Ali Khan * Jannisar Khan * Jaskaran Malhotra * Xavier Marshall * Monank Patel * Timil Patel * Roy Silva * Jasdeep Singh * Steven Taylor * Hayden Walsh Jr. } ==Points tableFixtures== The following fixtures were confirmed in January 2019. ===Round- robin=== \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- ==Playoffs== The final and third-place playoff matches were given ODI status by the ICC, with the fifth-place playoff being a List A match.

Webb in 1970. It is endemic to the state of Durango in Mexico. Not much is known about the lizard at present, as it appears to be simultaneously rare and rather secretive in nature. == Description == The Bols√≥n night lizard is predictably small, due to its behaviour and habitat. They tend to be around 6 centimetres in bodily length, with a similar tail length proportionate to body size. The body is primarily covered by scales, totalling 50 in the dorsal region, featuring leopard print markings of a dark brown pigment across the back. The species can be distinguished from close relatives through fewer rows of dorsal scales, a decreased number of upper- labials, a lack of dark peppering on the stomach, fewer femoral pores, a narrower head to body ratio and an attainment of reduced eventual size at the end of maturation. == Distribution and habitat == The species are prevalent in the state of Durango, in particular the area around the township of Pedrice√±a. They have also been reported in the nearby Canon San Fernandes protected reserve, and have been observed crossing State Highway 40. The lizard inhabits fissures in adesitic rock outcrops, predominantly within areas dominated by yucca vegetation. Physiographically, the area falls within the boundaries of the Bols√≥n de Mapim√≠ and the Chihuahuan Desert. == Population == The population of the species is currently unknown, but the lizard seems to be quite rare. The lack of accurate population data can generally be attributed to the secretive nature of the species, creating issues in regards to collecting and examining specimens. During the initial survey of 1969, researchers located ten male and female individuals including the holotype, and recent coloured photographic evidence from 2007 proves that the species is still extant in the original location of surveyal. ==Threats== The only apparent threat to the lizard is the disturbance of the habitat in which it resides. The habitat is not particularly wide-ranging in size, and is concentrated to only a fairly localised area. However, due to a lack of knowledge regarding the species, it is impossible to determine the impacts of habitat encroachment until a later interval. == References == Category:Night lizards Category:Lizards of North America Category:Reptiles of Mexico Category:Endemic fauna of Mexico Category:Reptiles described in 1970 ","title":"Bols√≥n night lizard"},{"id":"56800486","text":"Nototeuthis is a monotypic genus of squid, in the family Neoteuthidae. The only species in this genus is Nototeuthis dimegacotyle . This species is characterised by short tentacular clubs, less than 40% of the length of the mantle, and relatively long fins, which are approximately 60% of the mantle length. The tentacle clubs have two greatly enlarged suckers on distal portion of the manus, which distinguish N. dimegacotyle from other members of the Neoteuthidae. Few specimens of this species are currently known. Specimens have been collected from the south eastern Pacific Ocean, off Chile, between the Southern Subtropical and the Antarctic Polar frontal zones.

For his meritorious feats within the genre that he dominates, the imitation and impersonations of stars, he has been proposed to venture into the famous Guinness Book of Records, not only in one but in two categories: 1- For being able to become the biggest number of known music icons, both Latin and Anglos, (around 50), in the shortest amount of time, (in just one minute and a half), without losing continuity in their representations, something that he was able to demonstrate in the tests carried out before the representatives of the mentioned book or entity. 2- For being the only artist who has taken the genre of impersonation to the largest number of important stages in the world, using this activity as the central axis of a show, something that has never been done in such a way or magnitude. Several facets converge in him: \\\\- That of the person and the celebrity, \\\\- The artist and the creative, \\\\- The visionary businessman and the executive, -And that of the social and solidarity activist. ==Early life== Sabala used to work in a circus named El Circo De Los Muchachos (The Boys' Circus).

He completed 9900 km of coastal polar ocean rows. Most of his pioneering rows were completed in the Arctic in a primitive open boat with no cabin or crawl space. He was the first recorded polar ocean rower, as the earlier Antarctic expedition by Ernest Shackleton predominantly relied on sails and used oars only to a marginal degree, therefore not meeting the criteria of ocean rowing. alt= == Birth of the passion == Eugene Smurgis worked as a physical education teacher in Perm Oblast. From there he undertook his first long distance rowing voyage to Lipetsk. By the summer of 1967 aboard his newly made boat \\"MAX-4\\" together with Valery Lyutikov, he rowed down the Kama and Volga Rivers of Russia, and up the Don. After the voyage he realized that full-time teaching was not compatible with his newly discovered ultra-endurance passion. He quit teaching to become a commercial hunter and woodcutter. For the rest of his life, he would follow the same basic pattern of rowing summers and working winters. == Ultra-endurance river rowing == Over the next twenty years, Eugene Smurgis rowed 36,700 kilometers of inland waterways, navigating all the major rivers and lakes of Russia, and later Siberia. In 1971, he went alone, crossing part of the Caspian Sea in thirteen days. In 1976 he went solo for twenty-six days. Two years later, he rowed north to the Kara Sea, alone that time for 40 days and 40 nights, all in a boat with no cabin, and no crawl space. == Beginning of the off-coast ocean rowing == In 1986, together with his 15 years old son, he embarked on his longest adventure yet, 4,800 kilometers over 44 days. The Smurgis team rowed the Amur River, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Sea of Japan, finishing in Vladivostok. In 1987 he rowed 1,400 more kilometers on the White Sea and the Onega River. == First encounter of the Arctic == In 1988 he voyaged to the northern Siberian community of Tiksi at 72 degrees north latitude, \\"ice and pale blue water\\" to commence the around-the-world expedition. Although he often had to drag his boat, now Pella-Fiord, over rough pack ice, he reached Khatanga, 1300 kilometers away, in 30 days. == More pioneering in the Arctic Waters == In 1990, he rowed the waters around Cape Chelyuskin, reaching a latitude of 77 degrees north, and finished at Dikson, reputedly the coldest place in Asia. His total for the second leg was 2,100 kilometers in 65 days. Within this expedition he established the 27-year standing record of 'the Northernmost Latitude reached by a rowing vessel'. On 30 September 1992, Eugene, again together with his son, Alexander reached Murmansk, an ice-free port and the largest city above the Arctic Circle. Since leaving Dikson, father and son had covered 2,500 kilometers in 43 days. Next they rowed Murmansk to London, whose distance was 4,000 kilometers, much of it spent above the Arctic Circle. In total, the row was 88 days. == Last quotes == \\"It has been a constant battle against the weather,\\" Eugene told an interpreter upon arrival in London, \\"but at no time did we allow ourselves to feel afraid.\\" With a touch of national pride, he added, \\"The boat was made by craftsmen from the Urals, so we knew it would get us through even the worst storms.\\" Before his son, Alexander was detained as an illegal immigrant by English authorities, a BBC interview asked about the voyage so far, in which he responded to the question: \\"How tough was it?\\", with a shake of his head and a mumbled,\\"Very difficult.\\" Eugene, now left alone to his plan of continuing the journey West, was advised by the coast guard to stay inland and row the canals. He responded, however: \\"I don't want to soak my oars in fresh water anymore. I am an ocean rower now.\\" Kenneth Crutchlow, head of Ocean Rowing Society, who together with Vanya Rezvoy researched the life of Eugene, commented: \\"His diary supports the impression of a man lacking the gene for fear.\\" Crutchlow also mentioned that due to financial difficulties Eugene had to ration his food on daily basis. In one of the last journal entries quoted in Crutchlow's book The Ocean Rowers, Eugene wrote: \\"my spirits are usually high. But once it gets dark, my spirits go down with the temperature. But it will be fine. The biggest ventures in life are hard, but you must do them all the way to the end.\\" Crutchlow concluded that: \\"Eugene had a bulldog grip on his expeditions\\". He rowed into a storm at the Bay of Biscay and at the age of 56, and for the first time in his life, lost a battle with a storm, which he sometimes reported in his journals to have been the only guests celebrating his birthdays with him, during his 20-year pattern of embarking on a rowing expedition every summer. == Legacy == The boat of Eugene is exposed in the garden of the Maritime Museum of La Tremblade, in Charente-Maritime, France. A Library in Lipetsk, Russia is dedicated to and named after Eugene Smurgis, containing a small museum displaying his photographs and expedition maps. A Memorial stone erected in honor of Eugene Smurgis is located in Kilkee, Ireland In 2010 a French writer Annie H√©ral-Vieau wrote a book about Eugene, titled, \\"Eugene Smurgis, the ocean rower\\" 20 years later, ocean rowing expedition \\"Old Pulteney Row to the Pole\\" attempted a coastal Arctic ocean row. The team of 6 rowed 202 nautical miles (a distance 26 times shorter than Eugene Smurgis Arctic rows) in 40 days (speed several times slower than Eugene Smurgis solo rows). == References  External links == * Eugene Smurgis all routes table Category:1936 births Category:1993 deaths Category:Ocean rowers Category:Russian explorers Category:Explorers of the Arctic Category:Russian male rowers Category:Sports world record holders ","title":"Eugene Smurgis"},{"id":"56800647","text":"One True Love may refer to: * One True Love (2000 film), American film * One True Love (2008 film), Philippine film * One True Love (TV series), Philippine television series * One True Love (song), by The O'Kanes ","title":"One True Love"},{"id":"56800660","text":"Indo-Israeli Centre of Excellence for Animal Husbandary & Dairying, Hisar, will be built by Haryana State in collaboration with MASHAV.

It was built between 1484 and 1489 during the reign of Ottoman Sultan Bayezid II (r. 1481‚Äì1512). The -long and -wide bridge was constructed in ashlar. It spans the Kƒ±zƒ±lƒ±rmak River with 19 pointed arches, of which today only 15 arches are visible due to sedimentation on the river bank. It is the longest stone arch bridge built in Anatolia during the Ottoman Empire era. The bridge is named after the 15th- century local Turkish saint Koyunbaba. An inscription in Ottoman Turkish alphabet gives the beginning and completion dates of the construction in Hijri year as 889 and 894 without naming the architect. ==Restorations== The bridge saw many restorations. In the 1960s, the original ashlar pavement was replaced with -thick concrete and covered with asphalt. In the 1980s, the facades of the bridge were plastered with compounded mortar and slurry was used in the mortar joints. Over time, the mortar on the facades crumbled. The latest restoration work aiming to reinstate its original state began in July 2014, and continued until 2017. After removal of the mortar on the facades in the first instance, the bridge was closed to motor traffic and pedestrians for further restoration work in November 2015. ==References== Category:Arch bridges in Turkey Category:Stone bridges in Turkey Category:Bridges completed in 1489 Category:Ottoman bridges in Turkey Category:Buildings and structures in √áorum Province Category:Road bridges in Turkey Category:Bridges over the Kƒ±zƒ±lƒ±rmak ","title":"Koyunbaba Bridge"},{"id":"56800702","text":"Each country's final squad has to comprise 23 players.

Within the concept of the proposed epoch of anthropocene, these measures are those specifically of humanity's impact on Earth's geology and its ecosystems. In the concept, the Great Acceleration can be variously classified as the only age of the epoch to date, one of many ages of the epoch ‚Äì depending on the epoch's proposed start date ‚Äì or a defining feature of the epoch that is thus not an age, as well as other classifications. Environmental historian J. R. McNeill has argued that the Great Acceleration is idiosyncratic of the current age and is doomed to halt in the near future; that it has never happened before and will never happen again. However, climate change scientist and chemist Will Steffen's team have found that evidence is inconclusive to testify or rule out such a claim. Related to Great Acceleration is the concept of accelerating change. While not explicitly commenting on whether the Great Acceleration as a whole is set to continue into the near future, the common implication is that the particular trend of accelerating progress will not cease until technological singularity is achieved, at which point technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unfathomable changes to the Earth and sometimes even the universe itself. Therefore, while adherents of the theory of accelerating change do not comment on the short-term fate of the Great Acceleration, they do hold that its eventual fate is continuation, which also contradicts McNeill's conclusions. ==Overview== In tracking the effects of human activity upon the Earth, a number of socioeconomic and earth system parameters are utilized including population, economics, water usage, food production, transportation, technology, green house gases, surface temperature, and natural resource usage. The Anthropocene is typically depicted as following the Holocene, to emphasize the central role of humankind in geology and ecology. Since 1950, these trends are increasing significantly if not exponentially. ==Data classification categories== The international Geosphere-Biosphere Programme has divided and analyzed data from years 1750 to 2010 into two broad categories, each with 12 subcategories. The first category of socioeconomic trend data illustrates the impact on the second, the earth system trend data. ===Socioeconomic trends=== Socioeconomic Trends category of the Great Acceleration of the Anthropocene from 1750 to 2010.

In keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria, patients suffer from periodical transient inflammation of the corneal endothelium and stroma, leading to short term obscuration of vision and, in some patients after repeated attacks, to central corneal stromal opacities. Approximately 50 known cases have been reported in the literature. The disease so far has only been described from Finland, but exome databases suggest it may be more widely distributed in people of European ancestry. Keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria is thought to belong to cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes. ==Presentation== Patients experience repeated unilateral attacks of keratitis 1 to 6 times per year, beginning at the age of 5 to 28 years. Men and women are equally affected. Attacks get less severe and less frequent in middle age. No seasonal variation has been reported. The symptoms are redness of the eye, pain, and photophobia. The attack may be associated with anterior chamber flare. These symptoms disappear in 1 to 2 days, but blurred vision may last for a few weeks. During the acute symptoms, a slit lamp shows pseudoguttae, dark patches in the corneal endothelium, thought to represent patchy corneal endothelial swelling. The endothelium appears normal between attacks. The attack can be misdiagnosed and treated as an acute iridocyclitis. Visual acuity transiently deteriorates during the attack. A typical corneal opacity of the patient with keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria. Older patients may show faint to definite central, horizontally oval, bilateral stromal opacities. The opacities may be associated with decreased visual acuity, but they have not been severe enough to need corneal transplantation. ==Genetics== Keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning an affected individual must inherit only one mutated allele from one parent. The protein, cryopyrin is coded for by the gene NLRP3, located at 1q44. The disease is frequent in Finland, and this population has a common mutation D21H accounting for all reported cases in this population. It has not been described in any other populations. However, the mutation was found in exome databases at a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.023% and in the Finnish and at an MAF of 0.0090% in aggregated non-Finnish European populations. ==Diagnosis== Upon clinical suspicion, diagnostic testing will consist of identifying cornea pseudoguttata by using a specular microscope or confocal microscope. Molecular genetic testing is also an option. ==Treatment== Patients have reported benefit from immediate treatment of their attacks with a topical corticosteroid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) applied a few times a day for up to one week. Some patients have found more benefit from an oral NSAID. ==Prognosis== The repeated corneal inflammation over time can lead to reduced visual acuity. ==History== Keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria was first described in 1964 by Olavi Valle (1934-2013), a Finnish ophthalmologist with an interest in hereditary eye diseases. He reported this disease as keratitis fugax hereditaria in a family with 10 affected members over 4 generations. Two decades later, a second Finnish family with 21 affected members in 5 generations was reported by other Finnish ophthalmologists who highlighted transient corneal endothelial changes, and proposed the term keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria. ==References External links == Category:Autoinflammatory syndromes Category:Autosomal dominant disorders Category:Disorders of sclera and cornea ","title":"Keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria"},{"id":"56800826","text":"Modupe Omo-Eboh (1922‚Äì25 February 2002) was a Nigerian lawyer and jurist who was the country's first female judge. ==Early life and education== Modupe Akingbehin was born in Lagos State in 1922.

He was one of The Cradock Four who were murdered during Apartheid by members of the South African Security Police on 27 June 1985. Mkhonto attended Macembe Lower Primary, Akena Primary and Sam Xhali Secondary School. Matthew Goniwe was one of his teachers at Sam Xhali. Due to financial constraints, Mkhonto left school after he passed his junior secondary certificate. After he dropped out of school, he established a soccer club in his community. He also became politically active due to the influence of Goniwe. ==Political life== Mkhonto found employment working at a depot in Cradock for the Department of Railways and Harbours. He subsequently joined the railway workers union. His work at the union had attracted the attention of the security police who conspired with his employers to fire him on spurious charges. He was dismissed from work in 1983 as he was accused of being a communist who arranged political meetings during working hours. His wife was also fired from her job at a hair salon on the pretext that her husband was a communist. In 1983, the Cradock Ratepayers Association (CRADORA) was formed which advocated for the rights of residents to negotiate against unfair increases in rent. This organisation was affiliated with the United Democratic Front (South Africa). He became a senior office bearer for CRADORA as well as the chairperson of the Broad Forum which consisted of CRADORA executives and leaders from other organisations in Lingelihle. Mkhonto was detained and assaulted by the security police on several occasions. He would be taken to the Cradock security police headquarters where he was assaulted and beaten, then released. He laid a charge against the police but this was never investigated. During the Freedom Charter celebrations on 26 June 1983 in Lingelihle community hall, Mkhonto spoke on behalf of CRADORA, focusing his speech on the future of the new South Africa which would respect rights to own land and proper compensation of workers for their labour. ==Death and honours== On 27 June 1985, Mkhonto left for a UDF meeting with Goniwe, Fort Calata and Sicelo Mhlauli in Port Elizabeth. The four were never seen alive again. Mkhonto‚Äôs body was the first to be found in Bluewater Bay near Port Elizabeth. It was found 1 km from the burnt car in which they had been travelling. He was found burnt, handcuffed and tied with a rope with gunshot wounds to his dead and stab wounds to his chest. A two-year inquest started in 1987 under the Inquest Act No 58 of 1959. The Cradock Four were buried in Cradock on the 20th of July 1985 at a mass funeral. Speakers at the funeral included Beyers Naud√©, Allan Boesak and Steve Tshwete gave keynote addresses. A message from the then president of the ANC Oliver Tambo was read. In 2006, he was conferred by the Presidency of South Africa with the Order of Luthuli in Silver for ‚Äúoutstanding contribution and dedicating his life to a free, just and democratic South Africa‚Äô‚Äô. A memorial was erected in honour of the Cradock Four. ==References * About the Cradock 4 * The story behind the Cradock 4 picture * The Cradock 4 28 years later Category:1951 births Category:1985 deaths Category:Anti-apartheid activists Category:Xhosa people Category:Members of the Order of Luthuli ","title":"Sparrow Mkhonto"},{"id":"56800862","text":"Kara Solmundson (born 20 July 1975) is a Canadian badminton player.

It is known only from three examples collected in Myanmar, including a recent specimen from 2010. == Description == The Burmese keelback water snake is relatively small in size, and grow to a maximal length of between 4 and 6 centimetres. The body is elongated with a moderately long tail, and is covered by keeled scales on the dorsal section. == Distribution and habitat == The species is endemic to Myanmar, and is believed to have an extensive habitat extending across the interior of the country. The snake has been known to frequent wetlands and freshwater streams surrounding the Irrawaddy River floodplain, designating it as both terrestrial and aquatic, and is therefore believed to be extant at a low altitude. == Behaviour == Due to status as a water snake, it is believed to be semi-aquatic, inhabiting both wetlands and river systems. The species is believed to be non-venomous, but due to a lack of encounters this has not been confirmed by herpetologists to date. If this hypothesis is proved correct, it is likely the bite of the snake would only cause mild swelling and localised pain. == Population == At present, the population of the species is unclear due to the wide range of their habitat, and size and trends are currently unable to be determined. However, the snake is known to be rare, as only a single specimen was discovered in 2010 during a twelve-year survey in Myanmar. ==Threats== The area surrounding the Irrawaddy River has undergone intensive deforestation and land conversion for cultivation and agriculture. The extent of the impact upon the species, if any, remains unknown despite the continuance of the changing nature of the landscape. ==References== Category:Reptiles described in 1871 Category:Reptiles of Myanmar Category:Xenochrophis ","title":"Xenochrophis bellulus"},{"id":"56801084","text":"Juglans regia Zijing() is a cultivar of walnut developed in Beijing, China,china.com,\\"Ëµ∞ËøëÁ¥´‰∫¨Ê†∏Ê°ÉÊ†ë ËÅÜÂê¨Â•πÁöÑÊïÖ‰∫ã\\";accessed 10 March 2018. expanded breeding upon the basis of the mother trees of Purple Leaved Walnut, which was founded in the depths of mountains, , Mentougou District, Beijing in 1998.cnpvp.gov.cn,\\"‰∏≠Âçé‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂíåÂõΩÂõΩÂÆ∂Êûó‰∏öÂ±ÄÊ§çÁâ©Êñ∞ÂìÅÁßç‰øùÊä§ÂäûÂÖ¨ÂÆ§Êûó‰∏öÊ§çÁâ©Êñ∞ÂìÅÁßç‰øùÊä§ÂÖ¨Âëä\\";15 August 2016;accessed 10 March 2018.

It was on a straight course 400 yards long, with the hare being drawn along the ground at the end of a cord, which was wound around a windlass. The venture did not appeal to the public because although the fastest greyhound would always win, the cleverest (best tracker) did not. In 1890 a patent was taken out for a circular greyhound racing track but was never put into practice, due to the patent owner not having financial backing. Five years later a mechanical lure was used in Ireland and again failed. Thirty years later, in 1925, Charles Alexander Munn, an American businessman, who had seen greyhound racing in the United States came over to the United Kingdom and teamed up with Owen P Smith and George Sawyer for the rights to promote the British greyhound racing as an alternative to coursing which was the primary form of greyhound racing in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Munn met with Major L. Lyne Dixson (a leading figure in British field sports) and the pair decided to find other supporters despite the fact that the General Strike of 1926 was looming. The two men eventually met Brigadier- General Alfred Critchley, who in turn introduced them to Sir William Gentle JP. Eventually they raised ¬£22,000 and formed a company called the Greyhound Racing Association Ltd, or GRA for short. When the GRA were deciding where to situate a new stadium they thought Manchester was an ideal place because of its sporting and gambling links. The company constructed the first custom- built greyhound stadium near the city centre and called it Belle Vue Stadium, where the very first race around an oval track in Britain was held on 24 July 1926 at 7.30pm. With over one million people unemployed and the first general strike in history taking place and troops had been deployed to trouble spots throughout Britain. Greyhound racing offered an affordable day out, away from all of the issues and as a result greyhound racing underwent remarkable growth over the next decade. Only 1,700 people attended the first meeting at Belle Vue and they watched six races with seven dogs in each race. A greyhound called 'Mistley' won the first ever race over 440 yards, running the quarter- mile flat course in 25.00 seconds, Mistley romped home eight lengths clear at 6‚Äì1. Fifty years later a stand was named after Mistley. Belle Vue ran many races with seven runners per race but after the formation of the National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) in 1928, the maximum number of dogs per race was limited to six, although this rule was to change several times during the century. The colours of the racing jackets that night were - trap 1-red, 2-blue, 3-white, 4-green, 5-black, 6-orange & 7-red and white. Racing was very erratic compared to today because the greyhounds lining up were various mixes of former coursing hounds with no experience of oval racing except for a scattering of trials. Winning distances for the six races were 8, 1, 12, 10, 5 & 2 lengths. The GRA actually lost ¬£50 on the first night because of the small attendance but the following week the crowds turned out in force; more than 16,000 people attended the meeting and within a short space of time \\"going to the dogs\\" became a national pastime. From the first meeting in July to the day the GRA closed for the winter break just three months later on 29 October, over 11,000 racegoers (per meeting) had paid to watch each of the 37 meetings. During those meetings there had been 221 races. The consortium repaid a ¬£10,000 bank loan and shares in the new company rose from their initial value of one shilling to ¬£37 10s. Two Belfast bookmakers called Joe Shaw and Hugh McAlinden visited Belle Vue during 1926 with the intention of gaining ideas to start track racing in Ireland. The greyhounds themselves were generally supplied by coursing trainers, owners and breeders such as Sidney Orton, a Norfolk farmer who sold 17 greyhounds to Belle Vue for ¬£170. A brindle greyhound called Mutton Cutlet, whelped in March 1921, had contested the Waterloo Cup in 1923, 1924 and 1925 and finished runner up in the Waterloo Plate in 1924. In 1926, he was brought by Tom Morris, keeper of the Irish Stud book. Morris put him to stud, demanding a fee of 10 guineas. Mutton Cutlet became the first major breeding sire (male parent) in track racing. ===Tracks=== *Belle Vue (opened 24 July) ===Competitions=== * None started == References == Category:Greyhound racing in the United Kingdom Category:1926 in British sport ","title":"1926 UK &amp; Ireland Greyhound Racing Year"},{"id":"56801155","text":"is a former Japanese football player.

The film is a dramatization of real-life events which climax in April 2015, when the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company, based underground in the Hatton Garden area of central London, is burgled by four elderly men, all experienced thieves. The film was directed by Ronnie Thompson and stars Larry Lamb, Matthew Goode, and Joely Richardson. The film had its West End of London premi√®re at the Curzon, Shaftesbury Avenue, on 11 April 2017. ==Synopsis== Larry Lamb plays the 76-year-old Brian Reader, taking the lead among the four \\"codgers\\" who carry out the operation, with the title of Guvnor, while the other three at the sharp end of the raid are Danny Jones (Phil Daniels), Terry Perkins (David Calder), and Kenny Collins (Clive Russell). Apart from more routine thievery going back at least to his first conviction in 1975, Reader had previously laundered the proceeds of the Brink's-Mat robbery of 1983. The burglars enter the underground premises over an Easter bank holiday weekend through a lift shaft, then drill through the thick walls of the vault with an industrial power drill, proceeding over the following two days to rifle through dozens of deposit boxes. The burglar alarm goes off, but the police decide not to attend. The robbery remains undetected until staff return to work the following week, and newspapers are soon calling it the biggest theft in English history, as the total stolen has a reported value of up to ¬£200 million ‚Äî although the gang of seven (who have a combined age of 448) don't believe it. Matthew Goode plays the organiser of the robbery, known only as XXX, while Joely Richardson is Erzebet Zslondos, a glamorous Hungarian mobster who is pulling the strings, complete with an exotic accent and remarkable set of costumes. A subplot centres on Zslondos and a corrupt policeman, DCI Frank Baskin (Mark Harris). After an efficiently carried-out operation, the haul is divvied up, the Flying Squad of the Metropolitan Police (\\"the Sweeney\\") is called in, led by DCI Emma Carter (Sarah-Jane Crawford), and the insurers offer rewards for leads to crack the crime. Six weeks later, acting on information received, nine men are arrested, including Reader. Later, four other men are pulled in and charged with conspiracy to commit burglary. They then face the challenge of what (if anything) to say under questioning and the dilemma of whether to reveal the hiding places of the missing loot. Almost a year after they hit Hatton Garden, all but one of the men are found guilty and go to prison, Reader getting six years. Most do not take up the offer of shorter sentences for returning millions still unrecovered. The leader, referred to in the film as \\"XXX\\", escapes justice ‚Äî which at the time of shooting matched the story of the real-life Michael Seed (known as 'Basil'). Seed was later found guilty of both burglary and conspiracy to burgle, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the former and eight years for the latter, the two running concurrently. ==Cast== *Matthew Goode as \\"XXX\\" *Larry Lamb as Brian Reader *Joely Richardson as Erzebet Zslondos *Stephen Moyer as Marcus Ford *Warren Brown as Trotter *Clive Russell as Kenny Collins *Phil Daniels as Danny Jones *David Calder as Terry Perkins *Jack Doolan as Judas-Jack *Sarah- Jane Crawford as Detective Chief Inspector Emma Carter *Tony Fadil as Police Officer *John Alford as Prison Guard *Craig Russell as Prison Officer *Mark Harris as DCI Frank Baskin *Sam Adewunmi as Isaac *John Bagenal as Carl Doyle *Duncan Casey as David *David Garlick as Paul Reader *David Goodman as Zoltan *Connor Heath as Freddie *James Helder as Kelvin ==Production== It was announced on June 2016 that Larry Lamb, Matthew Goode, Joely Richardson, and Phil Daniels had taken leading roles in the low budget film. ==Reception== In negative reviews The Guardian called the film \\"a piece of geezer nostalgia\\" with a \\"wocka-wocka retro-funk score\\", but suggested that Phil Daniels might deserve an award for uttering the line ‚Äúthe biggest bling blag in history‚Äù. It also took the view that the film failed to keep faith with its grey power ethos by parachuting in an attractive young leader for the much older gang (Matthew Goode), who was simply an invention. The Daily Telegraph deemed the film a Guy Ritchie pastiche and commented that \\"This is entirely, even aggressively un-cinematic, and after a while begins to feel like a bizarre, Brechtian joke at the audience‚Äôs expense: vast expanses of the film are, quite literally, just boring.\\" Metros review found the production slow and clich√©d and suggested that \\"this is a film that ultimately proves to be every bit as opportunistic as the raid that initially inspired it.\\" The film magazine Empire was more positive, ==See also== * King of Thieves ‚Äì a 2018 film based on the same events. *Heist film ==References * *The Hatton Garden Job ‚Äî Official Trailer on YouTube Category:2017 films Category:2017 crime thriller films Category:2017 action thriller films Category:2010s heist films Category:British films Category:British crime thriller films Category:British heist films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in London Category:Films shot in London ","title":"The Hatton Garden Job"},{"id":"56801387","text":"Albert Reuss in 1915 Albert Reuss (2 October 1889 ‚Äì 4 November 1975) was an Austrian-born British painter and sculptor. He was born in Vienna and fled to Britain in 1938 following the Anschluss, Adolf Hitler‚Äôs annexation of Austria to the German Reich. In the process, Reuss lost many members of his family, and the reputation he had built up as an artist in Vienna. He continued to work as an exiled artist, but his style changed dramatically, reflecting the trauma he had suffered. Several provincial galleries in England hold his work, most notably Newlyn Art Gallery in Cornwall, the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the √ñsterreichische Galerie Belvedere (the Belvedere Gallery) and the Albertina both in Vienna, and the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in Israel. ==Life== https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KRIjHAAACAAJ&dq;=albert+reuss&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjPp9zn45vbAhVN7FMKHSinAOsQ6AEIKzAB Albert Reuss 1889-1976: An Introduction by John Halkes, Newlyn Orion, 1980, based on an unpublished autobiography by Reuss held at Newlyn Archive Biography in English by Widder Gallery, Vienna ===1889‚Äì1922: Early years in Vienna=== Albert Reuss was the son of Hungarian Jews, Ignaz Reisz (1855‚Äì1911) and Sidonia n√©e Freund (1861‚Äì1928). Ignaz was a Fleischhauermeister and Fleischh√§ndler, a master butcher and meat trader. The couple at some stage moved to Malacky, in former Hungary, now Slovakia, where their first three sons were born. In the late 1880s, the family moved to Vienna, where Albert was born, followed by a further six children, three of whom died in infancy, leaving seven surviving children in all. The family name Reisz was changed by the Austrian authorities to Reiss. From a young age, Albert became estranged from his family. A frail, sickly and vulnerable child, he seemed neither to fit into nor to belong to the family into which he was born. He suffered from ill-health and had considerable difficulties with social interaction throughout his life. He was introduced to the world of art by a rich uncle, Baron Andreas Ritter von Reisinger, who was married to his father's sister, and who appears to have instilled in the young boy a lifelong inferiority complex. Albert's artistic abilities emerged when he was only five years old, and at the age of 14, he applied, unsuccessfully, to the Akademie der bildenden K√ºnste Wien. Unable to pursue his dream of becoming an artist, he was obliged, on leaving school, to assist his father as a butcher. Given his delicate disposition and artistic sensibilities, working at the butchery was not an effective fit. There followed a series of equally unsuitable jobs, including salesman, childminder and actor, all of which ended in dismissal. These repeated experiences of rejection only added to his lack of self-worth. He became determined to teach himself by copying the Old Masters in the Belvedere Gallery and managed to gain several commissions for these paintings, as well as some commissions to paint portraits. Albert Reuss in his studio, 1918 At the beginning of the First World War, he was obliged to undertake military service, but was allowed to do this in Vienna, due to his poor health, avoiding frontline duty. In 1915 he met his future wife, Rosa Feinstein (1891‚Äì1970), the daughter of Benjamin Feinstein, a merchant, and his wife Hinda n√©e Prechner. Benjamin was born in Warsaw, Poland, which was at that time under the rule of Imperial Russia, making him and his family technically Russian. Rosa offered Albert the acceptance and encouragement he so desperately needed. Their marriage lasted for 55 years, and throughout that time she acted, in effect, as his agent and manager. The couple were married in December 1916, but shortly after, Albert contracted tuberculosis and spent 18 months in a sanatorium. He took advantage of his confinement by drawing portraits of fellow patients, from which he began to establish a reputation as a portrait artist. Once he had recovered, the couple moved to an apartment at M√∂llwaldplatz 3, Vienna IV, where Albert established his studio, and in October 1922 they converted to Christianity. Also at this time, Albert started to use the surname \\"Reuss\\", though this change of name was not officially recognised until 1931. A young student, Sylvio Metzger, also moved into the apartment and developed a lifelong friendship with Albert and Rosa. A large body of correspondence between Sylvio and the couple has survived, and is stored, along with much other documentation, at \\"basis wien\\" in Vienna.The Estate of Albert Reuss ===1922‚Äì1938: Artistic development=== During the 1920s, Reuss gradually established himself as an artist, working initially in portraiture, then developing an individual style of line drawing, which he called his linear work. In 1922, he exhibited a portrait at the Vienna Secession, (also known as the Union of Austrian Artists), and had his first solo exhibition at the W√ºrthle Galerie in 1926. In 1930, a newspaper proprietor sponsored him to spend a year in Cannes, where he completed forty portraits and landscapes in oil, following which, he had a second solo exhibition at the W√ºrthle Galerie in 1931. His exhibitions received good reviews in the Viennese press. Reuss subsequently became a member of the prestigious artists' association, the Hagenbund, with whom he exhibited on a number of occasions during the 1930s. From 1926 to 1938, Reuss taught at the Fachlehranstalt f√ºr das Kleidungsgewerbe (The Specialist Teaching Institute for the Clothing Industry). In 1934, he also started working as a sculptor, creating, among other things, portrait busts of the Viennese councillor Johann Grassinger and of the actress Maria Eis, as well as a study of his wife Rosa, now in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art. Throughout this period, the couple developed a middle-class lifestyle, and filled their flat in Vienna with numerous books, artefacts and artworks, including two works by Egon Schiele. Thus, by 1938, Reuss had become an established and relatively prosperous painter and sculptor in Vienna. However, this period coincided with the rise of Hitler and the Nazi Party, and by this time, it became clear that Albert and Rosa would have to flee their home country. ===1938‚Äì1947: Flight from Vienna and first years in England=== Following the Anschluss, the annexation of Austria to the German Reich in March 1938, the Reusses packed up all their possessions, including Reuss's artworks, into 38 crates and left these in storage, but almost everything was confiscated by the Nazis. With the help of Cornishman and Quaker, John Sturge Stephens (1891‚Äì1954), they escaped from Vienna to England, where they arrived in Dover penniless and empty-handed in August 1938. They had with them 10 Reichsmark (equivalent at the time to about ¬£1 sterling), the maximum cash allowed to emigrants by the German authorities. Some members of the Reiss family were not so fortunate: Albert's brother Julius and his family and his sister Ernestine and her husband Roman Torn were murdered in the Holocaust. Reuss's remaining siblings emigrated to the United States. After a brief stay in London, the Reusses were invited by John Sturge Stephens to his cottage in St Mawes, the springboard of their future life in Cornwall. Now in their late forties, they were obliged to build a new life and career from scratch. This proved to be a struggle, despite the significant help and support they received from numerous benefactors. Two local female painters in St Mawes offered Reuss the use of their studio, and in October 1938, a first exhibition was held there, followed by another exhibition at Lanham's Gallery in St Ives, Cornwall in December 1938. A third exhibition took place in August 1939 in Truro, Cornwall. However, after England's declaration of war against Germany in September 1939, Reuss was briefly interned as an \\"enemy alien\\" in June 1940 at a detention centre in Shropshire, which greatly distressed him. Following his release in August 1940, Albert and Rosa moved to Cheltenham, where they remained for the next eight years. A fourth solo exhibition took place in 1940 in Cheltenham, followed by a fifth in 1944, Reuss having produced over 200 paintings in the corner of his small living room. He also obtained a job as an art teacher at Dean Close School, an independent school in Cheltenham, which helped him to become more financially self-reliant, and to supplement his income as an artist. In 1947, Albert and Rosa Reuss were finally granted British nationality. ===1948‚Äì1975: The Mousehole years=== In 1948, the Reusses moved to Mousehole, a fishing village in Cornwall, three miles beyond Penzance. Here they established the ARRA Gallery. Two flats (one to rent out), together with a studio and gallery, had been built for them by painter Ruth Adams (1893‚Äì1948), whom they had first met in 1938 at Lanham's Gallery in St Ives. Ruth was an ardent admirer of Reuss and was determined to bring her friends back to Cornwall, but she died in an accident just four weeks after their arrival, having left ARRA to the Reusses in her will. This inevitably caused gossip, and the entire episode was a most inauspicious way for Albert and Rosa to begin their new life in the village. Whereas they had been well accepted in St Mawes and Cheltenham, here they were largely to remain outsiders, despite a number of important new friendships. Much to his chagrin, Reuss's attempts to join the Penwith Society of Arts were unsuccessful, as is evident in correspondence with founding member Peter Lanyon. Nevertheless, now 60 years of age, Reuss continued to paint for the rest of his life, supported by the many friends and admirers he and Rosa had made over their first few years in England. Whilst Albert painted, Rosa managed the ARRA Gallery together with their friend, Jeanne Day, and in collaboration with the Arts Council of Great Britain, hosting local artists such as Mousehole-born Jack Pender (1918‚Äì1998) and Alexander Mackenzie (1923 -2002) of the St Ives School. The gallery eventually closed in 1956. Between 1945 and 1956, Rosa also organised numerous solo exhibitions of her husband's work in municipal galleries throughout England, particularly in the North, where many galleries still hold his works. From 1953, Reuss held regular one- man shows at the renowned O‚ÄôHana Gallery in London. Jacques O'Hana was an international art dealer specializing in the French Impressionists. He was a colourful, larger-than-life character, who became Reuss's friend and mentor for the next 20 years until O'Hana's death in 1974. Once ARRA closed, and there were no further exhibitions in the provinces, the couple started to experience considerable financial difficulties. They managed to obtain compensation for victims of political persecution and a small pension from the Austrian Government. They received additional financial support from Reuss's younger brother, Max Reiss, with whom Albert had a difficult relationship. Albert and Rosa's last few years were also plagued by ill-health, with repeated hospital stays for both of them. In January 1970, Rosa died. She had spent her entire life caring for and supporting her husband and ensuring that he remained in touch with the outside world. Albert was inconsolable, but struggled on alone for a further five years, still painting. He became concerned about his artistic heritage, fearing that his paintings could be destroyed after his death. He entered into a lengthy correspondence with the Austrian Press Secretary and later Deputy Ambassador in London, Dr Ingo Mussi (1935‚Äì2012), who arranged, with Jacques O'Hana, for some of Reuss's works to be sent to international galleries in Vienna and Israel. Following O'Hana's death in 1974, almost 200 works, including paintings, sculptures and drawings, remained in the London gallery. Ingo Mussi arranged, with the permission of the dying artist, for these to be sent to Vienna to be curated by an organisation called Euro Art. In September 1975, Euro Art hosted an exhibition held on the premises of the Bawag Foundation, which had been established in 1974. Bawag was a bank which had close ties with the Social Democratic Party (SP√ñ) and the Austrian Trade Union Federation (√ñGB). The bank actively sponsored the promotion of Austrian contemporary art and culture, and Albert Reuss's works were thus amongst the first to be exhibited by the Foundation, in full collaboration with the Socialist government of that time. The exhibition was called Bilder der Einsamkeit ‚Äì Albert Reuss (Pictures of Loneliness ‚Äì Albert Reuss), and was opened by the Education Minister Dr Fred Sinowatz, who was later to become Austrian Chancellor from 1983 to 1986. In his dying moments, Albert Reuss was finally able to experience success and recognition in his home country. He died on 4 November 1975 at the age of 86 years after a brief stay at a care home in Truro. Reuss was a complex individual. A tall, slim, handsome man, he could often appear aloof, even arrogant. Despite his Viennese elegance, he sometimes behaved irrationally, for example he wrote a number of highly inappropriate letters to the very people who were trying to help him. Yet despite his eccentricities, and at times his unacceptable behaviour, he could also be most charming and had a remarkable capacity to draw people to him, even those he offended. He and Rosa were genuinely loved by a large number of people who were prepared to go to great lengths to help and support them. ==Works== Illustrates 69 paintings by Reuss owned by Newlyn Art Gallery, pp.82‚Äì87, 210 Illustrates 77 Reuss paintings owned by several English galleries Illustrates 27 Reuss paintingshttps://www.tuttartpitturasculturapoesiamusica.com/2011/09/albert- reuss-1889-1976-austria.html Italian site illustrating several Reuss paintingshttp://en.wahooart.com/@/AlbertReuss American site illustrating 77 Reuss paintingshttps://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Uk5dswEACAAJ&dq;=albert+reuss&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwi_qJW205vbAhXSjVkKHQN4D6YQ6AEIMDAC Recent Paintings by Albert Reuss, O'Hana Gallery, 1970 During the early 1950s, when Reuss was exhibiting in galleries in the North of England, he occasionally gave talks in an attempt to explain his work. An article was published on 11 November 1951 (newspaper unknown) entitled Artist Comes to ‚ÄòExplain‚Äô where Reuss is quoted as having described three stages in the development of his art: ‚Ä≥Gateshead's Shipley Art Gallery ... includes pictures representing each of the three important stages through which Reuss's artistic life has passed from early pencil drawings, in which his striving after the essence of his subject was first observable, through the translation of this essence into oils, then to his later more uncompromising works.‚Ä≥ His earlier linear work of the 1920s was characterised by drawings which used a few brief pencil strokes to invoke recognisable images. This gave way to detailed and colourful oil paintings of landscapes, still lifes and figures, influenced by the expressionist Carinthian school of painting. This was a style he first developed during his period in Cannes, using a palette knife and ‚Äúiridescent and opalescent colour‚Äù, for example The Carinthian Family (Die K√§rntner Familie) (1932, private collection). This body of work was well received by the Viennese art critics of the 1930s, but following his exhibition in Vienna in 1975, his earlier work was described as \\"conventional\\", whilst he was thought to have \\"found himself\\" during his exile in England. Indeed, following his exile, there was an immediate change in Reuss's work into a style which could loosely be called Surrealism; his oil paintings now became simplified and muted with much cooler colours. Figures often looked sad or listless, or were portrayed with their backs turned. Compare for example Woman Reading with Mother-In-Law's Tongue, a portrait of Rosa (1935, Newlyn Art Gallery) with Woman Reading (1942‚Äì1947, Newlyn Art Gallery). After moving to Mousehole in 1948, bleak landscapes started to appear, with broken fences and walls, and trees stripped of foliage. The art critics of the 1950s commented in particular on the beauty and simplicity of these paintings, the economy of line, and the artist's considerable draughtsmanship. Some also saw in Reuss's work a certain spiritual quality. In later years, Reuss's paintings became ever more desolate, and the figures started to disappear. Where figures were present, these looked abandoned, like flotsam on the beach. This is particularly evident in Figure and Tree Stump originally titled Self-Portrait in the Open (1967, Newlyn Art Gallery). Often random objects such as corrugated iron and boulders appeared in the landscape, and sometimes even penetrated into rooms, for example Interior II (1971/72, Newlyn Art Gallery). An apt description of Reuss's post-Vienna work appears on the Kunsthandel Widder Gallery's websiteViennese gallery specialising in exile art > Reuss‚Äôs artistic output is very much informed by his biography. Objects, > floating relinquished through space and having lost any foothold, > predominate his imagery‚Ä¶ Ripped out of their natural context, those objects > tell the story of a voyage, of a kind of abandonment of an object that does > not fit in its new environment. In Reuss's artwork, style and choice of > subject-matter invoke an association with Surrealism. Dali and Chirico are > but the two most important artists [who] bring to mind Reuss's artwork. > Reuss's depiction of people has a similarly estranged air about them as > those of his objects. Taken out of context, of time, of place, the pictured > people appear oddly strange. Melancholic and lonely, but also calm and > gentle, Reuss's creations remind the viewer of the art of Josef Floch. > Analysis of Reuss's work There can be no doubt that these works were an expression of Reuss's mental state, of the extreme melancholy and despair that he had suffered throughout his life, but most especially the trauma he had experienced as a consequence of his exile, culminating in the Pictures of Loneliness of his final years. ==Estate== During the last few months of Reuss's life, Dr Mussi urged the ailing artist to appoint an heir, and to make it clear to whom he wished to leave his life's work. He suggested the possibility of leaving it to a public collection in Austria. Frail and confused, Reuss did not understand what was needed, and probably thought that by sending the bulk of his works to Vienna, he was doing just that. Consequently, there was no specific clause in his will naming an heir for his artistic works, though he was clear concerning his other assets, having written his will some years earlier with Rosa. All his artwork therefore went to the named residuary beneficiary, Miss Norette Reed, who had been a friend of Albert and Rosa for many years, and was an ardent admirer of Reuss's work. Norette was not expecting this gift, and in fact had donated her own collection of 31 Reuss paintings to the Newlyn Orion Gallery (now Newlyn Art Gallery) in June 1975, a few weeks before Reuss's death, specifying that this was to be kept as a permanent collection and not for sale. This became known as the Norette Collection. She now inherited those paintings still remaining at ARRA, Reuss's studio and home in Mousehole, as well as those which had been transferred to Vienna. She was happy for the works in Vienna to remain there, as this had clearly been Reuss's wish, but resolved in June 1977 that she would also donate to the Newlyn Orion all the unsold works which she had inherited, both those in Vienna as well as those which had remained in England. However, in January 1979, Reuss's works still in Vienna were unexpectedly returned to Cornwall. John Halkes, the director at that time of the Newlyn Orion, was delighted with these new acquisitions, some of which were from Reuss's Vienna period. In an interview with Susan Soyinka, Reuss's biographer, in October 2016, he said: \\"I thought the sensible thing to do was to cream off some of the better ones and add them to the Norette Collection ... Meanwhile ‚Ä¶ we didn‚Äôt have storage ... so (the remainder) were steadily exhibited and sold over the years.\\" The remaining works, available for sale, now became known as the Vienna Collection, which in later years was retitled the Reuss Collection. John Halkes was keen to honour Norette Reed's expressed wishes to raise Reuss's artistic profile and to ensure that a biography would be written. True to his word, he mounted several exhibitions during the 1970s and 1980s, not only at the Newlyn Orion but also at galleries in Plymouth and Bristol. In 1984, Halkes gave Reuss's written estate to a young German art student, Lioba Reddeker (1961‚Äì2011), who intended to write a biography, but was unable to complete this. Following her death, the entire documentation, including Lioba's research papers, was passed to ‚Ä≥basis wien‚Ä≥, a database of Austrian artists which she had founded. Norette Reed died on 10 June 1991 and bequeathed one third of her residual estate to the Newlyn Orion. When John Halkes left the gallery in 1990, Reuss's works were put into storage and, apart from a further exhibition in 1992, were rarely seen for almost three decades. ==The future of exile art== In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the ‚Äúlost generation‚Äù of emigrated artists, including Reuss, in Austria and Germany, and indeed there are a number of galleries in Vienna and Berlin which specialize in exiled artists. Reuss's work featured in two hugely successful exhibitions called Die Uns Verliessen (The Ones Who Left Us), held in Vienna in 1980, and Art in Exile, held in 1986 in several venues in Europe, including London. More recently, his works have featured in the Leopold Museum in the 2007 exhibition Zwischen den Kriegen. √ñsterreichische K√ºnstler 1918‚Äì1938 (Between the wars: Austrian artists 1918-1938), in 2015 as part of The Bigger Picture at the Penlee House Gallery and Museum in Penzance, and in 2016 at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Israel. His work is also represented in Thomas B Schumann's large collection of exile art in Germany, and Herr Schumann used one of Reuss's paintings, The Art Critic, on the cover of a book published in 2016, Deutsche K√ºnstler im Exil 1933 bis 1945, (German Artists in Exile 1933 to 1945). Monica Bohm Duchen, the organiser of the 1986 Art in Exile exhibition, is in the process of organising a major national event called Insiders/Outsiders, an exciting nationwide arts festival planned for 2019 to celebrate the extraordinary contribution of refugees from Nazi Europe to British culture. There are plans to exhibit some of Reuss's work at a few galleries in Cornwall as part of this project. ==Solo exhibitions== * 1926, 1931: W√ºrthle Gallery, Vienna * 1938: St Mawes, Cornwall * 1938: Lanham's Gallery, St Ives, Cornwall * 1939: Gas Company Showroom, Truro, Cornwall * 1940, 1944: Cheltenham Art Gallery and Museum, Gloucestershire * 1945: Royal Birmingham Society of Artists, New Street Gallery, Birmingham * 1945: Laing Art Gallery and Museum, Newcastle upon Tyne * 1945: Salford Museum and Art Gallery * 1947: Turner House Gallery, Penarth, Wales * 1948: Royal Cornwall Polytechnic, Falmouth, Cornwall * 1949, 1951, 1956: Studio ARRA, Mousehole, Cornwall * 1950: Wolseley Room, Hove Public Library, Brighton, Sussex * 1950: Public Library, Museum and Art Gallery, Darlington, North East England * 1951: Bankfield Museum, Halifax, West Yorkshire * 1951: Shipley Art Gallery, Gateshead, North East England * 1952: Public Library and Museum, South Shields, North East England * 1953: Victoria Park Museum, Keighley, West Yorkshire * 1953: Batley Art Gallery, Batley, West Yorkshire * 1956: Heffer Gallery, Cambridge * 1953, 1954, 1956, 1958, 1962, 1964, 1966, 1968, 1970, 1973: O'Hana Gallery, London * 1974, 1979, 1980, 1983: The Newlyn Orion, Penzanze, Cornwall * 1975: Pictures of Loneliness, Bawag Foundation, Vienna * 1977: Preston Art Gallery, Lancashire * 1982: City Art Gallery, Plymouth, Devon * 1985: Gallery Kuckucksm√ºhle, Hilter, Germany * 1989: Ginger Gallery, Bristol * 1992: Newlyn Art Gallery, Penzance, Cornwall * 2017: Newlyn Art Gallery, Penzance, Cornwall ==Group exhibitions== * 1922: Vienna Secession, Vienna * 1925, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1935, 1935: Hagenbund, Vienna * 1932: Chicago International Exhibition, United States * 1940: Artists' International Association, London * 1950: Artists of Fame and Promise, Leicester Gallery, London * 1955: Friends of Israel, Ben Uri Gallery, London * 1956: St John's College, Oxford * 1956: Royal Academy of Arts, London * 1963: Academy of Fine Arts Vienna * 1968: Marc Serfaty Gallery, Los Angeles, United States * 1971: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Israel * 1962 to 1973: Yearly Christmas exhibitions, O‚ÄôHana Gallery, London * 1978: New Arts Centre, Sloane Street, London * 1997: Austrian Gallery Belvedere, Vienna * 2007: Between the Wars: Austrian Artists 1918‚Äì1938, Leopold Collection, Vienna * 2015: The Bigger Picture, Penlee House Gallery and Museum, Penzance * 2016: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Israel ==Works in public collections England === * Newlyn Art Gallery, Newlyn, Penzance * Cheltenham Art Gallery & Museum, now The Wilson, Cheltenham * Darlington Art Gallery * Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne * Salford Museum and Art Gallery, Greater Manchester * Shipley Art Gallery, Gateshead * Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery * Bradford Museum and Galleries * British Museum, Print Cabinet, London * Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge * Royal Pavilion and Museums, Brighton and Hove * Victoria and Albert Museum, London ===Austria=== * √ñsterreichische Galerie Belvedere, Vienna * Albertina, Vienna ===Israel=== * Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Israel ===United States=== * Cleveland Museum of Art, United States ==Acknowledgements== * Albert Reuss's biographer, Susan Soyinka, carried out her research at the institutions listed in the external links below * She also interviewed people who had known Albert Reuss, including his niece in the USA * Documents originally written in German were translated into English by Margret Vince ==References== * * ==Further reading== * Aurenhammer, Hans and Gertrude, Das Belvedere in Wien: Bauwerk, Menschen, Geschichte (The Belvedere in Vienna, Building, People, History), Anton Schroll & Co., Vienna and Munich, 1971 * Baum, Elfrieda, Catalogue for exhibition: Die uns verlie√üen: √ñsterreichische Maler und Bildhauer der Emigration und Verfolgung (The Ones Who Left Us: Austrian Painters and Sculptors of Emigration and Persecution), √ñsterreichische Galerie im Oberen Belvedere in Wien (Belvedere Gallery in Vienna), 1980 * Barron, Stephanie, Exiles + √âmigr√©s: The Flight of European Artists from Hitler, Angeles County Museum of Art, 1997 * Behr, Shulamith and Malet, Marian, Arts in Exile in Britain 1933‚Äì1945: Politics and Cultural Identity (The Yearbook of the Research Centre for German and Austrian Exile Studies), Brill/Rodopi, 2005 * Bohm-Duchen, Monica and Dobson, Zuleika, Catalogue for exhibition: Art in Exile in Great Britain 1933‚Äì1945, Arkwright Arts Trust, 1986 * Brinson, Charmian and Dove, Richard, (eds.), German- speaking Exiles in the Performing Arts in Britain after 1933 (The Yearbook of the Research Centre for German and Austrian Exile Studies), Rodopi, 2013 * Cesarani, David & Kushner, Tony, (eds.), The Internment of Aliens in Twentieth Century Britain, Routledge, 1993.

He is the 2020 European silver medalist, the 2020 Russian national silver medalist, and the 2018 World Junior silver medalist. == Personal life == Danielian was born on 17 December 2003 in Volgograd, Russia. He is the youngest of three children. He is of Armenian descent. == Career  Early years === Danielian began learning to skate in 2008, after an ice rink opened near his home in Volgograd. In 2016, he moved to Moscow and joined CSKA Moscow. Marina Selitskaia and Elena Buianova became his coaches. === 2017‚Äì2018 season === In September 2017, Danielian competed at his first Junior Grand Prix (JGP) assignment, placing seventh in Zagreb, Croatia. In February 2018, he won the bronze medal at the 2018 Russian Junior Championships. In March, Danielian competed at the 2018 World Junior Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria. He won the silver medal, behind teammate Alexey Erokhov, after placing eighth in the short program and second in the free skate. === 2018‚Äì2019 season === Danielian started his season by competing in the 2018 JGP series. At his first JGP event of the season he placed fifth in Ljubljana, Slovenia. At his second JGP event he placed fourth in Yerevan, Armenia. Danielian next competed at the 2018 Tallinn Trophy, where he won gold medal. Though only fifth at the 2019 Russian Junior Championships, Danielian was nevertheless sent to the 2019 World Junior Championships. This happened because junior champion Daniil Samsonov was not age-eligible to compete internationally and fourth-place finisher Erokhov subsequently withdrew. At the Junior Worlds Danielian placed ninth in the short program, fifth in the free skating and fourth overall, with a new personal best score of 220.68 points. === 2019‚Äì2020 season === Competing on the Junior Grand Prix, Danielian won silver medals at both JGP Russia and JGP Croatia, ending up as first alternate to the Junior Grand Prix Final. Making his senior international debut on the Challenger series at 2019 CS Golden Spin of Zagreb, he placed fourth. Competing at the 2020 Russian Championships at the senior level for the first time, Danielian was only thirteenth in the short program, but skated a clean free program, winning that segment outright amidst rough performances from those who placed ahead in the short program. As a result, he rose to the silver medal position. Danielian's performance earned him a berth at the 2020 European Championships, where he placed third in the short program despite stepping out of his triple Axel. He said that he \\"owed myself a decent short program after Nationals.\\" Fourth in the free skate, he nevertheless won the silver medal overall, saying it was a \\"big surprise to win a medal at my first Europeans. I‚Äôm happy and even more motivated to skate.\\" Danielan was assigned to compete at the 2020 World Championships in Montreal, but these were cancelled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. == Programs == {class= style=text-align:center !

She studied painting at the Camberwell School of Art, London, graduating BA (Hons) in 1986. She obtained an MA (History of Art) in 1994 and taught art at the University of Malta. She spent periods of her life in Berlin and West Cork, Ireland.

She spent the final years of her life working from her studio in Floriana. During the final months of her life she was active in protesting against Malta's planning authorities, arguing that construction works taking place next door to her residence were having a negative impact on her quality of life, further exacerbating her illness and confining her to her bedroom, as well as negatively impacting the cultural heritage of the area. == Works == Isabelle Borg regularly exhibited her work both in Malta and internationally, in Ireland, England and Germany, amongst others. Her work was exhibited at the National Museum of Fine Arts in Malta. She participated in various group exhibitions and had her research published.

Born in Middlesboro, Kentucky, Cadle was a graduate of Middlesboro High School and the University of Tennessee. As an amateur golfer, Cadle won the Kentucky State Amateur tournament three times, in 1966, 1967 and 1969, playing on three different Bluegrass State courses. He made his PGA Tour debut in 1974 at the Bob Hope Desert Classic and joined the tour full-time a year later. His best finish in the 1970s was a tie for third at the 1979 Greater Hartford Open. He would record the second and final third-place finish of his career a year later at the 1980 Greater Milwaukee Open. In 1980 he would also finish 57th on the money list, making $75,265, his best placing ever. The best finish of his career was again at the 1983 Greater Milwaukee Open. Cadle shot a final-round, 8-under-par 64 - including four birdies in his final six holes - to force a sudden-death playoff, which he lost to Morris Hatalsky on the second hole.

It grows to a mantle length of roughly 220mm and the maximum mantle length recorded in males is 207 mm while the females are slightly longer at 227 mm. It fourth left arm is hectocotylized and has 19-22 suckers in two series in its basal two-thirds where there is a weak protective membrane and there are two pointed knobs rather than suckers on its tip where the ventral protective membrane is more developed than that on the dorsal side. the largest suckers on the tentacular clubs have either a smooth margin or they have a single large tooth. The smaller suckers may have more teeth. The apparatus for locking the funnel organ to the mantel is forked towards the front and is fused to the rear, but only in individuals who have a mantle length over 9mm. There are small subcutaneous photophores on the underside of mantle, head and of the third and fourth arms, while the fourth arms have a large oval photophore at their bases and another hallway to their tips. The ventral surface of mantle has 2 stripes of luminous tissue extending along almost its entire length with two large, oval-shaped luminous patches at the end of each mantle strip closest to the head. The fins are heart-shaped and taper to a point. The larvae have dispersed large brown chromatophores while in the juveniles these are crimson and brown. The species is bioluminescent. ==Distribution== The striped flying squid is distributed in the southern oceans and in the North Pacific Ocean but it is absent from the North Atlantic Ocean. In the southern South Pacific it is occurs between 20¬∞S and 35¬∞S in the west and it is found from 13¬∞S to 43¬∞S in the east; in the southern Indian Ocean it occurs north to 15¬∞S and south to 34¬∞S and in the southern South Atlantic Ocean between 10¬∞S and 36¬∞S. In the North Pacific Ocean it occurs from the southern Kuril Islands to western North America as far south as Mexico, between 10¬∞N to 40¬∞N. ==Habitat and biology== The striped flying squid is found in the epipelagic and upper mesopelagic zones, occurring from near the surface to a depth of 400 m. It lives in open waters mostly over depths of over , and it appears to be nektonic rather than benthic. Subadults and adults have been recorded at the surface at night, but only rarely. They spend the day at depths greater than 50 to . They are low to moderately abundant; they are most numerous in the South Pacific Ocean between 30¬∞S and 40¬∞S. Males reach maturity at 95 to 185 mm mantle length, normally at age 180 to 270 days, and females mature at 102 to 200 mm mantle length when they are aged 220 to 240 days. This varies widely over the squid's range and they grow larger at lower latitudes. The maximum life span is one year. In the lower latitudes they spawn throughout the year but in the higher latitudes it is restricted to the spring and summer. The male's spermatophores are 11.2 to 15.8 mm in length, in the Needham's sac of mature males there may be up to 150 of them although more usually between 70 and 100 are present. The egg size is 0.8 to 1.0 mm, and each female may have between 300,000 and 625,000 ova, with the oviducts of mature females holding about 17 000 ripe eggs, probably more. ==References== Category:Squid Category:Molluscs described in 1915 Category:Monotypic mollusc genera Category:Bioluminescent molluscs ","title":"Striped flying squid"},{"id":"56801577","text":"Kollam Diocese is one of the 30 dioceses of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church.

FIVA's Events Commission collaborated with the European Commission to create a freely downloadable Driver's Code for general guidance of historic vehicle users, and also has devised a code for the safe promotion of rallies or mildly competitive events. The Technical Commission works to support the preservation of as many historic vehicles as possible, by cataloguing them with FIVA's Vehicle ID-card. FIVA has forged links with UNESCO and has persuaded the European Commission to accept that historic vehicles represent an important part of industrial heritage. FIVA has further linked up with the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), to promote the interest of historic cars in more sporting arenas, and with the F√©d√©ration Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), to help achieve similar objectives for motorcycles.

Anna Liddiard (29 April 1773 ‚Äì October 1819) was an Irish romantic poet whose work draws on themes of patriotism, Irish culture and history, landscape, and human relations. ==Life== Jane Susannah Anna Wilkinson was born in County Meath. She was the daughter of Sir Henry Wilkinson, of Corballis. She married Rev. William Liddiard (1773‚Äì1841) on 12 February 1798, an Anglican clergyman of Wiltshire who was a poet, artist and retired army officer. He was the vicar of Culmullen, Co. Meath from 1807-1810, and then in the united parish of Knockmark from 1810-1831. Liddiard had one son, Henry Liddiard, born in 1800. He inherited the rectory of Knockmark. Liddiard's death date is not officially recorded, but she appears to predeceased her husband, as he remarried in 1822. She appears to have died at Corballis, with The Bristol Mercury reported her death as 30 October. ==Poetry and writing== Liddiard dedicated her book of Poems to her husband, published in Dublin in 1809. The couple moved to Bath in 1811, living there for 2 years. Whilst there she published The Sgelaighe or A tale of old in 1811, supposedly drawing on an old Irish manuscript. She describes her return from Bath to Ireland in Kenilworth and Farley Castle (1813). This book is addressed to the Ladies of Llangollen, whom she visited. In 1816, she published a tale in verse called Evening after the battle, which was published along with her husband's Mont St Jean, both pieces are based around the battle of Waterloo. An anonymous work Mount Leinster (1819) is usually ascribed to Liddiard, but could have been written by her husband. Liddiard's verse is patriotic and romantic, in particular her poem Addressed to Albion and Conrade. Both Liddiard and her husband advocated for religious tolerance, with the work Mount Leinster blaming the 1798 Rebellion on the Penal Laws. == References == Category:1773 births Category:1819 deaths Category:People from County Meath Category:18th-century Irish poets Category:18th-century Irish writers Category:18th-century Irish women writers Category:19th-century Irish poets Category:19th-century Irish writers Category:19th-century Irish women writers ","title":"J.S.

It is the first installment not to include any percussion instrument at all and Cage's first composition to be based fully on chance operations. It is also the second march in the set of Imaginary Landscapes, after Imaginary Landscape No. 2 (March No. 1). It was composed in 1951. == Composition == As Cage's compositional style developed, he found that, in order to circumvent the listener's wish to find any emotional appeal to music, the composer himself had to detach from his own work and should not have any control on the composition, that is, he had to remove any personal trait that identifies him as a composer. At this time, in 1951, he was also working with his Music of Changes, which was another great step towards chance operations in composition. The first performance of this composition took place at the McMillin Theater at Columbia University, New York, with Cage himself conducting, on May 2, 1951. The first performance was marked by its low dynamic level (partly due to the fact that the performers were using portable radios), clear distinction of sound events and a thin texture, which was seen as a flaw by the audience. Moreover, the late hour at which it was performed meant that the radios would not pick up much non-static sound, as most radio stations were no longer broadcasting during the night. However, according to Cage himself, the Imaginary Landscape No. 4 \\"was certainly not a rabble-rouser\\". This was not Cage's last composition to include radios, as he also did it in Speech 1955, Radio Music and Music Walk. In reference to this, he commented: \\"It is thus possible to make a musical composition the continuity of which is free of individual taste and memory (psychology) and also of the literature and 'traditions' of the art. The sounds enter the time- space ... centered within themselves, unimpeded by service to abstraction\\". It was dedicated to Morton Feldman and was published by Edition Peters. == Structure == This piece consist of only one movement and the average duration for it is 4 minutes. It is scored for 12 radios, each radio calling for two performers, and a conductor. Its score looks like a conventional score, with the slight difference that here a half inch equals a quarter note. However, accelerandos and ritardandos are also present in the score. It is prefaced by an extensive explanation on the indication of durations, station tunings, dynamics (numbers ranging from 3 to 15, 3 being turned on but inaudible, 15 being maximum volume). According to Cage, all of these performance parameters were determined by chance operations, rather than conscious decisions. Each radio requires two performers to use it: one for tuning and the other for the amplitude and timbre changes. This way, what is being publicly broadcast at the time and place of the performance becomes the sonic material of the music, which can be anything, from music and talk to white noise between stations. As in the case of Imaginary Landscape No. 2 (March No. 1), this is no conventional march and has no traits that would identify it as such. To Cage, who was not particularly fond of radios, this was not a piece to be listened to, but rather an exercise in abandoning preferences, erasing all will from the piece and, therefore, the very idea of success. == Recordings == The following is an incomplete list of recordings of Imaginary Landscape No. 4 (March No. 2): * The Maelstr√∂m Percussion Ensemble recorded of the piece. The recording took place between May 28 and June 1, 1995 and was released by Hat Hut. * The Italian Ensemble Prometeo recorded this piece in 2009.

It is also known by the alternative title of Dangerous Business, the title of the novel on which it is based. It follows a New York businessman who inadvertently becomes involved in the criminal activities of a covert escort agency. The film holds the record for the longest transfer from banned status to original release in United Kingdom history, having been rejected for cinema release in 1930, and remaining unreleased there until 2003. ==Plot== Maude Lindsay operates the Lindsay Social Bureau, which is a covert front for a \\"party girl\\" escort agency that caters to high-class playboys attempting to close business deals. Jay Rountree, the son of a bottle manufacturer, is engaged to marry his secretary, Ellen Powell, a former party girl, whose roommate, Diana Hoster, secretly works as a party girl. Around Christmas time, Jay and his friends crash one of the girls' parties, where he meets Leeda Cather, the daughter of a formerly-prominent New York family who has gone destitute. A drunken Jay spends the night with Leeda, awaking in her room the next morning, where she exclaims that he \\"ruined her\\" the previous night. When Leeda's \\"mother\\" confronts the two in bed, Leeda claims she eloped with Jay the night before, a story which he goes along with. Leeda then suggests to Jay that the two marry that afternoon. When news of their elopement makes the papers, Leeda calls her ex-fianc√© Paul Newcast, a businessman who was hesitant to marry her. Happy to be free of the obligation, he gives Jay's father a business contract, as well as sending Leeda $5,000. Jay overhears the conversation and confronts her, but she insists the marriage benefits him and his father's business. At a Christmas Eve dinner at his family's home, Jay tells his father about Leeda's deception, after which she states she pressured Paul into signing the contract, and threatens to implicate Jay and his father in a public scandal. Meanwhile, Ellen learns of Jay and Leeda's relationship, and is persuaded to attend one of Maude's parties. Police subsequently arrive at Leeda's apartment to investigate the party girl racket, and make a deal with her if she cooperates with the investigation. Leeda excuses herself to the bathroom and flees via a fire escape, during which she falls several stories. Jay arrives just before Leeda dies from her injuries, and she remorsefully instructs him to save Ellen from the party being raided by police. Jay manages to arrive at the party just before the police, and explains to them that he and Ellen are not involved in the party girl racket. Maude attempts to convince police that Ellen is in fact a party girl, but her secretary, Miss Manning, attests that Ellen has never worked for her. After the police depart, Jay proposes to Ellen, to which she agrees. ==CastProduction== During the production of the film, actor Paul Bern dated Loff, Barrie, and Prevost, the film's three principal female stars. ==Release== Party Girl premiered in New York City on New Year's Day 1930, expanding on January 25. Due to its themes surrounding sexuality, the film was banned in some U.S. cities, such as Birmingham, Alabama. ===Home media=== Alpha Video released Party Girl on DVD on April 25, 2006. ==ReferencesSources== * ==See also== *List of banned films ==External links== * Category:1930 films Category:1930 crime films Category:English-language films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American crime films Category:Tiffany Pictures films Category:Films about prostitution in the United States Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by Victor Halperin Category:Films made before the MPAA Production Code Category:Films originally rejected by the British Board of Film Classification Category:Obscenity controversies in film ","title":"Party Girl (1930 film)"},{"id":"56801803","text":"Mary Ellice Thorn Hearn M.D. F.R.C.P.I. (1891‚Äì1969) was a gynaecologist and first female fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. ==Early life and education== Hearn was born on 25 February 1891 to William Edward Ashley Cummins (1858‚Äì1923), Professor of Medicine at University College Cork, and Jane Constable Cummins (n√©e Hall) in Cork. They had five daughters and six sons. Geraldine Cummins was a playwright. Jane Cummins was a squadron officer in the WRAF during the second world war and became a medical doctor. Iris Cummins was an engineer. Two of her brothers also became doctors, and one, N. Marshall Cummins, was involved in setting up the first blood transfusion service in Cork. ==Education== Hearn began to study medicine in UCC, however she left in 1911 to get married. With the encouragement of her husband, she returned to UCC, and graduated with an MB, B.Ch., BAO in 1919 with first-class honours and a distinction in medicine despite having had her son who also attended her conferring ceremony. Hearn went on to gain her MD in 1922, when she was awarded first place and a special distinction in the examination. ==Work== Hearn worked as house surgeon and house physician for the Cork North Infirmary in Cork until 1922 when she was appointed to the Victoria Hospital Cork in 1922 as an honorary anaesthetist. The following year she joined the staff as assistant medical officer and then as the medical officer. Hearn was running a private gynaecological practice near Shandon, Cork during this time as well as working with the Lapp's Charity, Cork. In 1922 Hearn got membership of the RCPI, and on 18 October 1924 became the first woman to become a fellow of the college. Hearn maintained her qualification through postgraduate courses held in London every year until 1968. An interesting side note about her is that her letter returning her fee for successfully sitting the membership examination for the RCPI was travelling through the GPO when it was damaged by the Irish Civil War. It nevertheless was delivered to her, despite the damage, stamped with the note \\"Salved from GPO Dublin\\". Hearn gave dedicated service to the Victoria, serving on the board from 1938 and actively involved in the running of the hospital. Hearn showed great ability to attract donations to the hospital organising fund-raising events, both for the hospital and for her community. This made her famous among her colleagues. Her most popular annual fund-raiser was the tea and entertainment for outpatients at Christmas. She also held appointments as the medical officer to the Rochelle School, Cork, and Midleton College, as well as that of honorary visiting physician to Lapps Charity in Cork. Outside of her medical career, Hearn was a keen hockey player and represented Ireland from 1908 to 1912. ==Family== Hearn's husband was Robert Thomas Hearn, the Church of Ireland bishop of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross. They married in September 1911. He died in 1952. She had two children with him. Her son, Robert, who went to her graduation, also became a doctor and worked as a GP in Rugby, England. Her daughter, Ellice, studied law and became a barrister in London. who was made CBE for her work as a parliamentary draughtsman. ==Death== She lived on St Patrick's Hill in the centre of Cork and died 3 June 1969 after a brief illness, at the Victoria Hospital. The memorial fund in her honour was used to create a nurses' library. The RCPI's study and research room in Kildare Street is named the Hearn Room in her memory. == Further reading == *Medical Directory (1930) *N.

H. Bartlett of the Willey House, Crawford Notch. Once the home of Ethan Crawford, it later became a tourist attraction following a storm in 1826 which resulted in the deaths of the Willey family and others. stereoscopic slide of the Willey House by Kilburn Brothers, ca. 1872 The Willey House at Crawford Notch in the White Mountains of New Hampshire is associated principally with a tragedy of August 28, 1826, in which seven members of the Willey family and two other people died. Out of that event came a boost to the nascent tourism industry of the area. == Background == The Willey House was originally known as Old Notch House and had been built in 1793. Ethan Crawford acquired it in 1823 for use as an inn to accommodate his growing business as a mountain guide, and in 1826 it was occupied by a family headed by Samuel J. Willey Jr. == 1826 disaster == Northern New England experienced a drought in the summer of 1826, which ended with the arrival of a terrific storm on the evening of August 28. Flooding followed, with the valley at Crawford Notch being one place that suffered the consequences. All but two of the bridges on the turnpike that ran through the notch were destroyed, trees suffered a similar fate and the high sides of the valley were gouged by swollen streams and landslides. The Willey House was a scene of desolation due to the effects of an avalanche on a mountain behind it. The house, however, had survived in an island of calm because the surging debris split either side on a low ridge and then unified again beyond it. Local residents, including Ethan Crawford and the Reverend Benjamin G. Willey, Samuel's brother, visited the house in the aftermath of the storm. It was empty, with signs that there may have been a rapid departure from it, such as unmade beds, clothes strewn around and ashes in the fireplace. There was an open Bible on the table. A search of the devastated area over the next few days revealed the bodies of the Willey parents, two of their daughters and two hired hands; the remains of the other three Willey children were never found. Some livestock had also been killed, including those in a now-destroyed stable. There followed various theories as to what had happened, the most likely of which is that the occupants abandoned the property as the avalanche approached but in doing so, in darkness, they unwittingly put themselves in the path of it around the point where the flow reunited. == Tourist attraction == News of the disaster spread, initially through many regional newspapers, and also through media such as Theodore Dwight's guidebook, The Northern Traveller. People began to visit the site, drawn to the scene of devastation, human tragedy and the miraculous survival of the structure itself. As well as boosting a nascent tourist industry in the area, in which the Crawford family had already been playing a significant part, it became a source of inspiration for artists and writers. The peak on the western wall of the notch became known as Mount Willey. Dona Brown believes that the artist Thomas Cole and other visitors, such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, used the interest in the tragedy to further their careers, deliberately painting and writing about an area that had suddenly gained national attention. Ethan Crawford, too, exploited it by, for example, ensuring that the Willey House was well signposted. The Crawfords had been directly affected by the storm, with Ethan's property suffering 1000 of damage and his father's farm being wrecked almost beyond repair, but they were also affected in a positive manner with the subsequent influx of tourists. In 1828, Ethan began construction of a new inn, called the Notch House, at the northern end of the notch, appointing his brother Thomas to run it. The business opened in 1829 and attracted many notable people, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau and Daniel Webster. Hawthorne was inspired by the Willey tragedy to write a short story titled \\"The Ambitious Guest\\" in 1835, while Cole noted in his diary that \\"The site of the Willey House, with its little patch of green in the gloomy desolation, very naturally recalled to mind the horrors of the night when the whole family perished beneath an avalanche of rocks and earth.\\" Horace Fabyan, who was a merchant and a speculator in the emerging tourism industry, took control of the Willey House in 1845 and converted it into a 50-bed hotel. Visitor interest in the effects of the disastrous storm waned over time, despite the efforts of people such as Benjamin Willey to maintain and profit by it by offering guided tours of the house for a fee. It had become old news and nature had taken it course to cover much of the scenic damage. The site of the house and the landslide is now an interpretive center within Crawford Notch State Park. == See also == *White Mountain art == References  Further reading == * Category:Natural disasters Category:1826 in New Hampshire Category:White Mountains (New Hampshire) Category:Tourism in New Hampshire Category:1826 deaths ","title":"Willey House, New Hampshire"},{"id":"56801841","text":"The discography of the Levellers, a British rock band, consists of 11 studio albums, three live albums, four compilation albums and 34 singles.

Her indictment has been described by modern-day scholars, such as Lizanne Henderson, as the earliest and most comprehensive record of witchcraft and fairy belief in Scotland. ==Accusations of witchcraft== Jonet Boyman lived in the Cowgate of Edinburgh, and was said to have been from Ayrshire. She was married to William Steill. In early modern Scotland married women did not change their surnames.Jenny Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community (London, 1981), p. 30. She was alleged to have predicted the death of Regent Moray who was assassinated in January 1570, and her accusation was the first to be made in connection with a political conspiracy. She told her interrogators that she made contact with the supernatural world at a well on the south side of Arthur's Seat a hill close to Edinburgh. There she conjured spirits who would help her heal others. Sometimes she worked cures by washing the patients's shirt at the well at St Leonards. She was condemned as: > ane wyss woman that culd mend diverss seikness and bairnis that are tane > away with fairyie men and wemen > a wise woman that could heal diverse illnesses and children taken away by > fairy men and women. Jonet Boyman was executed on 29 December 1572. ==Personal life== There is little information available concerning Boyman's personal life; however the trial record shows her as living in Cowgate, a street in Edinburgh. No indication is given of her age but she was married to William Steill. ==References Notes =Citations=Bibliography=== * * * Category:1572 deaths Category:People executed for witchcraft Category:People from Edinburgh Category:16th-century Scottish women ","title":"Janet Boyman"},{"id":"56801905","text":"Hatheburg (also Hatheburch) (* 876 in Merseburg; ‚Ä† on 21 June after 909) was a Frankish queen, the first wife of Henry the Fowler, later king of East Francia (Germany). After their marriage was dissolved, Hatheburg became abbess of a convent. == Family == Hatheburg was the daughter of Erwin of Mersburg, who possessed property in Hassegau and Friesenfeld. The name of Hatheburg's mother is Wendilgarde and her mother's sister, Hildegard, was married to Thietmar, Count of Merseburg, who was Henry the Fowler's military tutor (vir disciplinae militaris peritissmus). Erwin had no sons and Hatheburg and her sister were the heirs to his property. == Life == Hatheburg was married around 890, for the first time, to a man whose name is not known. She was widowed shortly afterwards, and entered a monastery where she took the veil. According to the chronicler Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg, \\"burning with youthful love\\", Henry wanted to marry Hatheburg because of \\"her beauty and the usefulness of her inherited wealth\\".Warner, The Chronicon of Thietmar of Merseburg, I, ch. 5, p. 70. Hatheburg and Henry married in 906, and Henry gained control of Hathburg's inheritance.*906: Henry's marriage to Hatheburg, RI II,1 n. c, in: Regesta Imperii Online Because Hatheburg had taken the veil, and the couple married without dispensation, their marriage was condemned by Bishop Sigismund of Halberstadt.Waitz, Heinrich I., p. 316. The couple were threatened with excommunication at a church synod. According to Thietmar, Henry was \\"disturbed by such talk\\" and decided to approach the emperor, Conrad I of Germany for help.Warner, The Chronicon of Thietmar of Merseburg, I, ch. 6, 71. Conrad ensured that the sentence of excommunication was deferred, and the couple remained married. Yet by 909, Henry began to burn \\"for the beauty and wealth\\" of another woman: Matilda of Ringelheim.Warner, The Chronicon of Thietmar of Merseburg, I, ch. 9, p. 74. Henry declared his marriage to Hatheburg has been unlawful, due to her prior vows as a nun, and the couple separated. Hatheburg returned to the convent, where she became abbess, and Henry married Matilda.909: Henry's marriage to Matilda RI II,1 n. f. in Regesta Imperii Online == Children == Probably in 906 Hatheburg gave birth to Henry's son, Thankmar.Warner, The Chronicon of Thietmar of Merseburg, I, ch. 9, 74. Because the validity of Hatheburg and Henry's marriage was questioned, so was Thankmar's legitimacy. ==NotesReferences== * Gerd Althoff: Adels- und K√∂nigsfamilien im Spiegel ihrer Memorial√ºberlieferung.

Cats at the sanctuary After the excavation of the temple ruins in 1929, feral cats were drawn to the area, sheltered by Roman pillars and fed by locals. In the 1950s, an actor named Antonio Crast found the old warehouse where archeologists of the 1920s stored their tools. It was there that he began feeding the feral cats. The keys to the warehouse were passed down until they landed in the hands of the founders of the sanctuary‚Äîone of them being Lia Dequel. Since then the shelter has grown, with volunteers coming every day of the week to feed, care for, and vaccinate the cats. More cats at Torre Argentina The shelter's main goal is sterilizing the cats. They spay and neuter cats in order to control the feral cat population. Not only do they spay and neuter cats in their own colony, but they also focus efforts on spaying and neutering and vaccinating cats of other colonies. They have, in the last decade, managed to reach out to 27,000 colonies of cats. They also have many cats up for adoption. They hope to find loving homes for many of the felines in the sanctuary. On average, the sanctuary finds loving homes for 125 cats a year. In their headquarters the shelter provides a home for handicapped and elderly cats, who are less likely to be adopted. The shelter is open to visitors every day. People can come in to meet the cats, and to browse souvenirs made by the volunteers at the shelter. All proceeds go towards the cats there, and donations, like these, allow the shelter to stay in operation. In 2012 the shelter faced closure when national archaeological officials demanded that the cat sanctuary be evicted from the ruins. Over 30,000 signatures were collected for petitions in favor of preserving the cat sanctuary and keeping it running. Despite a compromise, the sanctuary still lives with the threat of an eviction‚Äîrelying on donations more than ever in order to keep their home at Torre Argentina. In 2019, the podcast This is Love visited Torre Argentina and spoke with co-founder Silvia Viviani for their episode, \\"Silvia and the Cats.\\" ==References *Cat Flap Fitter Website *Colonia Felina Di Torre Argentina Website Category:Organizations with year of establishment missing Category:Animal welfare organisations based in Italy Category:Organisations based in Rome Category:Animal shelters Category:Domestic cat welfare organizations ","title":"Torre Argentina Cat Sanctuary"},{"id":"56801918","text":"An≈æe Tomiƒá is a Slovenian journalist best known for his podcast network Apparatus.

Its historic parish church on Linlithgow High Street is a Category B listed building. ==History== The church's origins as an organisation date back to 1912, when a group of local Episcopalians formed a group called the St Peter's Episcopal Mission. In its early years, the congregation had no permanent building, and at first used a variety of locations around the town: the Court Room of the Burgh Halls, a closed public house and an assortment of shops. They secured the use of a hall on the High Street, only for it to be requisitioned by the army in 1914. They then used the defunct Craigmailen United Free Church, but were forced to vacate the building due to dry rot. The congregation also used rooms owned by the Scotch Girls Friendly Society, then a room at the Palace Hotel. This situation lasted until 1924, when the congregation's Priest-in- Charge, Rev W.S. Snow, reported their plight to the Bishop of Edinburgh, G.H.S. Walpole. The bishop put down ¬£100 to purchase a site on the High Street, and promised a further ¬£500 towards the cost, this to come from a speaking tour he was about to give in the USA. Even with this, the first plan of architect J.W. Todd proved too costly, and the congregation could not have afforded the ¬£1600 bill. A less ambitious ¬£1000 design was later adopted. The church was required to slot into a space measuring just 26 feet in width. The church's unusual Byzantine design was chosen at least in part because it would alleviate the problem of letting sufficient light into such a narrow space with taller buildings on either side. The founding stone was laid by Colonel Maclaren of the Craigs on 18 May 1927, and the church was completed almost exactly a year later. Despite the fact that the congregation had always been named St Peter's, Bishop Walpole dedicated it to St Mildred, with whom his late wife had shared a name. The name reverted to St Peter's in 1978, though St Mildred is still featured on one of the stained glass windows in the sanctuary. ==Organisation== The church is linked with St Columba's Church in nearby Bathgate. ==References== Category:Churches completed in 1928 Category:Episcopal church buildings in Scotland Category:Category B listed buildings in West Lothian Category:Listed churches in Scotland Category:Christian organizations established in 1912 ","title":"St Peter's Church, Linlithgow"},{"id":"56801998","text":"The University of Kansas' men's basketball team plays at the Division I level of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) in the Big 12 Conference.

Geologically the mine is located in Paleozoic sedimentary rocks of the Karoo Supergroup. There are records of ore analyses from these deposits dating back to 1782 or 1792.https://www.saimm.co.za/Journal/v086n04p097.pdf Henry Lichtenstein visited the site in 1805 and they were again explored during the office of Governor Janssens. In 1856 A. Wyley reported 'a considerable amount of underground exploration without any apparent measure of success'. Nonetheless the deposits were again examined between 1924 and 1931. These revealed small veins and deposits of ore, with no lode or body of ore promising commercial success. The dolomitic limestone carrying the ore is in the shape of a simple syncline, both legs dipping towards the Maitland River. The trough of this syncline was regarded as the most promising site, but after much drilling did not fulfil expectations. The ore consists of argentiferous galena, chalcopyrite and chalcocite with malachite and azurite, in irregular stringers and elongate nodules, indicating development of minerals along crush zones. During the era of muzzle-loaders lead was processed in the Transvaal, the lead coming mostly from near Argent, where a smelter was constructed between 1889 and 1893. These deposits were mined until 1957, when operations ceased. The production of lead was negligible until 1980, when the Black Mountain Mineral Development Company near Aggeneys commenced mining and South Africa became a net exporter. Other deposits were mined in the Marico district, at Edendale near Pretoria, and at the Balloch Mine at Niekerkshoop in the Cape Province, and a zinc-lead mine at Pering, 75 km from Vryburg. ==References== Category:Lead mines in South Africa ","title":"Maitland Mines"},{"id":"56802102","text":"Semaco \\"Zak\\" Moradi (born 30 December 1990) is an Kurdish, Irish Hurler who plays as a left corner-forward for the Leitrim senior team.

She was known for her leather work and repouss√© metalwork. She was known for her writings on the history of costume and costume design. ==Early life and education== Mary Galway Houston was born 27 July 1871 at Coleraine Academical Institution, Coleraine, County Londonderry. She was the daughter of Thomas Galway Houston, headmaster of Coleraine Academical Institution, and Maud Steen Houston (n√©e Millar). She attended the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art, winning a number of prizes in final year. She exhibited leather work, repouss√© metalwork, lace and crochet designs as well as drawings at the Royal Dublin Society (1894-1896) and at the first exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland in 1895. She entered the Royal College of Art in London in 1896, regularly exhibiting with the English Arts and Crafts Society and the Royal Academy of Arts from 1901. During this time, she entered numerous national competitions, with her submissions often used as illustrations in art magazines. Houston was a gold medallist for the 1898 competition to design the modelled leather cover for the Kelmscott Chaucer. ==Artistic career== Houston became increasingly lauded for the leather work, exhibiting leather bookbindings and embossed-and-modelled leather panels from 1898 to 1903. She wrote an article on embossed and chased leatherwork in the Art Workers' Quarterly (1903) which was illustrated with her set of four relief panels scenes from Homer. Houston also undertook work in other media including needlework, and working silver, copper, and tin in repouss√© metalwork. At the 1899 English Arts and Crafts Society exhibition she exhibited an art-nouveau silver mirror-back, and at the 1900 Paris exhibition with a three-piece toilet in beaten silver. All of her early work is predominantly in art nouveau, with her moving to a more Celtic style from around 1900. These Celtic designs drew on Irish myth and legend, drawing on ancient Celtic and medieval Irish prototypes. In 1900 The Studio magazine commissioned her to create two silver cups to accompany an article calling for the improvement of the design of sporting trophies and sups. This was her first attempt at metal working in the round, and she drew inspiration from the Dunvegan Cup and Methers, an ancient three-handled vessel. Though she was based in London, Houston continued to exhibit at the RDS and the annual exhibitions of the Irish Decorative Art Association. In 1903, she designed a tapestry panel of A voyage to Tir-na-noge for the Dun Emer Guild, and in 1904 created a tooled leather album cover which was presented to James Brenan upon his retirement. From 1903, Houston taught at the Camberwell School of Art in London. ==Writing== Houston developed an interest in the history of dress and costume design and went on to publish A technical history of costume in three volumes: Ancient Egyptian, Assyrian, and Persian costumes and decorations (1920, co-authored with Florence S. Hornblower), Ancient Greek, Roman, and Byzantine costume and decoration, including Cretan costume (1931), and Medieval costume in England and France: the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries (1939). ==Published books== *Ancient Egyptian, Assyrian, and Persian costumes and decorations (1920) *Ancient Greek, Roman and Byzantine costume and decoration (1931) *Medieval costume in England & France, the 13th, and 14th and 15th centuries (1939) *Ancient Egyptian, Mesopotamian & Persian costume and decoration (1954) ==Later life== Towards the end of her life, Houston rarely exhibited. Her final publication was in 1954, with a second edition of the revised and retitled Ancient Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Persian costume. It is believed she moved back to Ireland some time after this point. Houston's exact death date and place of death are generally stated to be unknown, but she appears to have died in Coleraine on 24 April 1962. ==References== Category:1871 births Category:1962 deaths Category:People from Coleraine, County Londonderry Category:20th-century Irish women artists Category:Arts and Crafts movement artists Category:Irish designers Category:Alumni of the National College of Art and Design ","title":"Mary Galway Houston"},{"id":"56802107","text":"is a comedian from Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture.

The Woman of Bletchley Park were a secret team put together by the British government, made to sign a Secrets Act confirming that they would not tell anyone about their work there. During her time at Bletchley, Ruth Bourne's job was not only to work on the German code, but to be a bombe operator. She was one of the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRENs) responsible for dismantling the bombes wire by wire after the war had ended in 1945. ==Recruitment and role== Aged 17 at the time, Ruth was a trainee member of the Women's Royal Naval Service when she was told that she would be joining the Women of Bletchley Park. She was offered to sign a contract that tied her into endless hours of work, no social life and no way to exit once she had agreed. Ruth was recruited to be a member of the team at as part of the SDX special duties. Bletchley Park workers consisted of two different teams the 'y station', the women responsible for picking up the German Enigma code and the 'x station', those who were responsible for bombe operation, like Ruth herself. ===The job=== The majority of the women recruited had no previous experience of bombe operation and were going in to the job blindsighted. The workers were only shown a few machines for training purposes on recruitment of the job. They were told not to ask any questions. The role itself included \\"preparing the machines each day, turning the drums on the front and plugging up the boards at the back according to settings laid out in a menu\\". While Ruth was a checker she would be in charge of waiting for information to come through as 'confirmed'. When this happened she would then have to make a call to report the stop on the code menu which would be checked by other members of Bletchley. Ruth's job meant that she was on her feet all day and there was little time for breaks. There was a term 'mustard', that meant the workers at Bletchley Park were told what they were going to do without any discussion or choice of their own. From the very first day of her work as a bombe operator to when her time at Bletchley ended, Ruth did what she was told on demand. Despite the little amount of agency the workers had at Bletchley, Bourne says herself that it was very satisfying to know that we were helping to break German codes. Her work as a bombe operator began in early 1944 and continued until the end of the war in 1945. ==After the war== In 1945 when World War II ended, all of the workers of Bletchley Park were told that they must continue to keep their work there a secret. It was not until 1974, when the book The Ultra Secret was published, that she, along with other Bletchley Park workers, were able to tell their families about their involvement in bringing down Nazi Germany. Ruth described what it was like when the news finally broke saying that \\"you got so used to not talking to anyone\\" that even after they were allowed to disclose their roles she still would not talk about her experience in depth. ==References== Category:1926 births Category:Date of birth unknown Category:Bletchley Park women Category:Living people ","title":"Ruth Bourne"},{"id":"56802405","text":"The list of shipwrecks in April 1841 includes ships sunk, foundered, wrecked, grounded, or otherwise lost during April 1841. ==1 April2 April3 April6 April7 April8 April9 April10 April11 April12 April13 April15 April16 April17 April18 April19 April20 April21 April23 April24 April25 April26 April29 April30 AprilUnknown dateReferences== 1841-04 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in April 1841"},{"id":"56802436","text":"Sh≈çko, Shoko or Shouko (written: ÁøîÂ≠ê, ËÅñÂ≠ê, Á••Â≠ê, ËçòÂ≠ê, ÊäÑÂ≠ê, Ê∏âÂ≠ê, ÊòåÂ≠ê, ÊòåÂ∑±, Â∞öÂ≠ê or Âå†Â≠ê) is a feminine Japanese given name.

According to Barack Obama, he intends for his foundation to be central to many of his post-presidential activities, which he sees as having the potential to be more consequential than his time in the White House. On September 25, 2018, an IRS report revealed that the Foundation no longer identified any possible mega-donors. In 2018, contributions and in-kind gifts totaled $164.8 million, according to its filed annual report in June 2019‚Äî a drop of $67.8 million from the record $232.6 million in 2017.

In May 2015, the Foundation, along with Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, announced the development of the Center and its location in the Jackson Park neighborhood of Chicago's South Side. On February 26, 2019, Chicago residents voted to require a community benefits agreement in order to make the Center official, something to which the Obama Foundation has objected. ==My Brother's Keeper Alliance== The My Brother's Keeper Alliance (MBK Alliance) is a program inspired by President Obama's My Brother's Keeper Challenge that he started through the White House in 2014. Its purpose is to address challenges and opportunity gaps that boys and young men of color face, providing support through mentoring, education, job training, and other activities. In 2017, MBK Alliance was moved into the Obama Foundation. ==Scholarship== In February 2018 the Foundation announced it had begun a scholarship program at the University of Chicago. The scholarships are awarded to 25 American and international master's students in the Harris School of Public Policy in an effort to cultivate leadership through the Presidential Center. It covers the students' tuition and living expenses while they work with the foundation and take classes. ==References * Category:501(c)(3) organizations Category:Barack Obama Category:2014 establishments in Illinois Category:Organizations based in Chicago ","title":"Obama Foundation"},{"id":"56802444","text":"Tom√°s Mart√≠n Molina (born 12 April 1995) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Brown. ==Career== Molina started his career with Hurac√°n.

He developed through the academy of Hamburger SV and has represented Germany at youth level. ==Club careerHamburger SV=== Early career Vagnoman joined Hamburger SV in 2010, and went through the different youth levels at the club. In February 2018, following impressive performances in the youth teams, newly appointed head coach Bernd Hollerbach promoted him to the HSV first-team squad for the forthcoming campaign. On 10 March 2018, Vagnoman made his first-team debut in the Bundesliga match against Bayern Munich. He came off the bench in the 70th minute, replacing Walace in a 0‚Äì6 home loss. He became the youngest player to ever play in the Bundesliga for Hamburger SV when he debuted at the age of 17 years and 89 days. Under new coach Christian Titz, Vagnoman did not make more first-team appearances that season. However, he made 20 appearances in the Under-19 league for HSV, scoring two goals. 2018‚Äì19 season Prior to the 2018‚Äì19 season, Vagnoman signed a new two- year contract with Hamburger SV, making him a permanent part of the first-team squad before his eighteenth birthday. Before the winter break, he made four appearances in the 2. Bundesliga for the club, making one start. Coach Titz and his successor, Hannes Wolf, preferred G≈çtoku Sakai and Douglas Santos on the two back positions during this period. In the latter part of the season Vagnoman saw slightly more playing time. He ended the season with 11 league appearances for the first team, adding to that another seven appearances and one goal for the reserves in fourth tier Regionalliga Nord. 2019‚Äì20 season At the beginning of the 2019‚Äì20 season, Vagnoman was benched under new head coach Dieter Hecking and mostly appeared for the reserves. As part of the Hamburger SV II team, he made three appearances in the Regionalliga Nord in which he scored three goals. After regular right-back Jan Gyamerah suffered a fibular fracture in mid-September, Vagnoman replaced him in the starting lineup in the following league game and made five straight appearances, in which he scored one goal. In October, he suffered a foot injury in a DFB-Pokal matchup against VfB Stuttgart which ruled him out for several months. In his absence, Khaled Narey took over as the third player to appear at right-back before Jordan Beyer arrived on loan during the January transfer window. In April 2020, Vagnoman recovered from his injury, and signed a four-year contract extension during the COVID-19 league suspension. When the league was resumed in mid-May, Vagnoman returned to the starting lineup as a right-back in a 2. Bundesliga match against SpVgg Greuther F√ºrth. ==International career== Eligible for both Germany and Ivory Coast, Vagnoman has represented Germany at every age group from under-17 to under-20 level. In October 2017, he was included in the squad for the 2017 UEFA European Under-17 Championship as an alternate to the injured Kilian Ludewig. He made three appearances in the tournament for the under-17s. In March 2018, Vagnoman made one appearance for the German under-18 team, and played another two matches for the German under-19 team in November 2018. He ended as runner-up to the Fritz Walter Medal in August 2019 in the under-19 category, behind Nicolas-Gerrit K√ºhn. Since September 2019, Vagnoman has been part of the Germany under-20 team. ==Personal life== Vagnoman was born and raised in Hamburg, the son of an Ivorian father and a German mother. ==References *Profile at the Hamburger SV website * Category:2000 births Category:Living people Category:German footballers Category:Germany youth international footballers Category:German people of Ivorian descent Category:Association football defenders Category:Hamburger SV players Category:Bundesliga players Category:2.

In 1959 he was assistant curator of vertebrates, subsequently curator of ornithology, in 1975 regional director in Bulawayo, and finally associate ornithologist, and as of 2012 a natural history librarian in Norfolk.The Museums Renowned Past Curators Irwin worked closely with Constantine Walter Benson, an authority on central African birds. Together, they expanded the bird collection of the Natural History Museum of Zimbabwe until it became the largest both in Africa and in the southern hemisphere. It currently housed over 90,000 specimens from Zimbabwe and neighbouring countries and is one of the museum's greatest resources. In 1981, Irwin published his best known work The Birds of Zimbabwe, but he had previously published the Bibliography of the Birds of Rhodesia in 1978, and co-authored A Checklist of Birds of Southern Rhodesia (with Reay Smithers) in 1957 and The Birds of Zambia (with Constantine Walter Benson) in 1971. He contributed also to The Birds of Africa series (with Emil K. Urban, Stuart Keith and C.

He failed to win as a two-year-old but improved to become one of the best in England in 1921. He won the 2000 Guineas, St James's Palace Stakes and Eclipse Stakes as well as finishing second in the Epsom Derby and fourth in the St Leger. After his retirement from racing he became a successful breeding stallion whose offspring included April the Fifth and Mon Talisman. ==Background== Craig an Eran was a bay horse bred in the United Kingdom by his owner Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor. He was sent into training with Alec Taylor, Jr. at his stable at Manton, Wiltshire. He was from the sixth crop of foals sired by Sunstar who won the 2000 Guineas and the Epsom Derby in 1911 before his career was ended by injury. Craig an Eran's dam Maid of the Mist was a daughter of Sceptre and an influential broodmare in her own right, who also produced the Epsom Oaks winner Sunny Jane. Her other descendants have included Buchan, Commanche Run, Full Dress, Swiftfoot and One in a Million. ==Racing career1920: two-year-old season=== Craig an Eran ran twice as a juvenile, beginning his track career by finishing second in the Salisbury Racecourse Foal Plate in spring. At Royal Ascot in June he finished unplaced behind Alan Breck in the New Stakes. ===1921: three-year-old season=== Alec Taylor, Jr, who trained Craig an Eran On 29 April Craig an Eran (ridden by Jack Brennan) started at odds of 100/6 (approximately 16/1) in the 113rd running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse. Humorist started favourite while the best fancied of the other 24 runners included Monarch (Middle Park Stakes), Alan Beck, Polemarch and Lemonora. Inside the final furlong Humorist held the lead but the complexion of the race changed in the final strides as Craig an Eran and Lemonora overtook the leaders. Craig an Eran crossed the line three quarters of a length ahead of Lemonora with Humorist the same distance away in third. After the race the colt assumed the position of favourite in the ante-post betting for the Derby. On 1 June Craig an Eran started 5/1 second favourite behind Leighton in a 23-runner field for the Epsom Derby. He produced a sustained run in the straight but was beaten a neck by Humorist after a \\"battle royal\\" with three lengths back to Lemonora in third. Frank Bullock, who had ridden the colt in 1920, took over from Brennan when Craig an Eran was dropped in distance for the St James's Palace Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot and won at odds of 1/8. The form of the British Classic Races was franked in late June when Lemonora won the Grand Prix de Paris, the most valuable race in the world at that time. One day later however, it was announced that Humorist had died in his stable. On 15 July Craig an Eran was matched against older horses in the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Stakes and, with Bullock in the saddle, won at odds of 2/7 favourite. He was followed home by Braishfield (Sussex Stakes) and Pompadour (third in the 1000 Guineas), giving Alec Taylor a 1-2-3 in the race. On 7 September Craig an Eran started 1/4 favourite for the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse and was reportedly regarded as a \\"certainty\\". He moved up to dispute the lead in the straight but failed to stay and finished fourth behind Polemarch, Franklin and Westward Ho!. Excuses were offered for the colt's defeat: it was reported that Taylor had been unable to train the horse to peak fitness on the prevailing hard ground and that Craig an Eran had been bumped by Westward Ho! in the straight. The latter claim was refuted by the jockeys involved in an enquiry by the racecourse stewards. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Craig an Eran an \\"average\\" winner of the 2000 Guineas. ==Stud record== Craig an Eran remained in training as a four-year-old but in April 1922 it was decided to retire the colt from racing and put him to stud at fee of 250 guineas. He was employed a breeding stallion in England, before moving to France. The best of his offspring included April the Fifth, Mon Talisman and the Grand Prix de Paris winner Admiral Drake. Craig an Eran was euthanised on 22 October 1945. ==Pedigree== *Though his dam Maid of the Mist, Craig an Eran was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Bend Or, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree. ==References== Category:1918 racehorse births Category:1945 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 16-h Category:2000 Guineas winners ","title":"Craig an Eran"},{"id":"56802613","text":"Carmen Brussig (20 May 1977) is a German judoka who has won numerous tournaments including Paralympic and world championship gold. Brussig was born in Leipzig with visual impairments and competes in B2 classification events. She made her Paralympic debut at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, winning a bronze medal in the under 48 kg weight class. She lost in the quarterfinal to Russian judoka Victoria Potapova but won the repechage against Cuban Maria Gonzalez to claim the bronze. Four years later, in the London Games, Brussig claimed gold by beating Potapova in the quarterfinal and Yuliya Halinska in the semifinal. This put Brussig into the final for the first time where she faced and defeated Lee Kai Lin. When defending her title at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro she won the semifinal against Halinska but then lost in the final to world champion Li Liqing, earning herself a silver medal. Brussig's judoka career outside the Paralympic Games has also seen her achieve great successes. She has won eight international tournaments between 2001 and 2014, along with six silver and three bronze medals. Brussig lives in Switzerland and competes in national Swiss tournaments, finishing in the top three eight times between 2005 and 2014. In 2015 she won the world championship in her weight category for the third time, having achieved the same feat in 2006 and 2007. Brussig is 15 minutes older than her identical twin sister, Ramona Brussig, also a medal-winning judoka. The pair won Paralympic gold within 15 minutes of each other in London 2012, with Ramona competing in the heavier under 52 weight category. Both sisters are listed amongst the most promising German medal candidates for the 2020 Summer Paralympics in Tokyo, resulting in them being given financial support in their endeavours.

The statue portrays Douglass in the middle of a speech, with one arm outstretched, and a copy of his autobiography under the other arm.

Like most of State Islamic University, State Islamic University of North Sumatra is also a college education provider in addition to Islamic studies. ==History== When IAIN of North Sumatra was established in 1973, its main mission was to serve as an Islamic university institution that transmitted Islamic knowledge in the sense of 'ul√ªm d√Æniyyah. Along with the knowledge development and the needs of national development, then in the era of the 1990s, IAIN SU entered a new phase which was characterized by the provision of a wider mandate. Furthermore, entering the era of the 2000s, IAIN SU enters a more developed stage that is not just a wider mandate, but also has to lead to scientific integration. This development was then followed up by the transfer of institutional status of IAIN of North Sumatra to State Islamic University of North Sumatra (Universitas Islam Negeri Sumatera Utara). Furthermore, it is in line with this change that the study of knowledge at IAIN has changed from monodiscipliner to interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary. Thus, the vision and mission of knowledge in UIN SU has also been changed, in accordance with the changes and the development of present social life. From a paradigm point of view, UIN SU uses the living system as a paradigm master, which aims to expand ideas and simplifies the process of combining different kinds of knowledge into one container. ==CampusesCampus I=== Campus I is located in Jalan IAIN No.1 Medan 20235.

Avila spent more than two decades using the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 to increase election fairness for minority voters. But as several court precedents weakened the federal Voting Rights Act, Avila conceived of state voting rights acts as a way to again strengthen minority voting rights. Thus Avila crafted the California Voting Rights Act that was enacted in 2001. Avila brought lawsuits that set important voting rights precedents. He also served as president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and directed the National Voting Rights Advocacy Initiative at Seattle University School of Law. Among the many honors he received recognizing his work, he was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1996. ==Early life and education== Joaquin Guadalupe Avila was born in Los Angeles, California and grew up in Compton. His father was a foundry worker. He earned his B.A. in political science at Yale University in 1970 and received his J.D. degree from Harvard University Law School in 1973. He was an editor of the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review. ==Career== After obtaining his law degree, Avila worked briefly on voting rights litigation in California before relocating to Texas. There, Avila worked as a staff attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and quickly rose in the organization, eventually becoming its president and general counsel. He served as president and general counsel of MALDEF from 1982 to 1985, during which he had a hand in over 70 voting rights cases. After leaving MALDEF, Avila moved to Fremont, California where he successfully argued important voting right cases, including Gomez v. the City of Watsonville, in which the city's at-large elections for city council diluted the voting power of the city's Latino residents in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965. He successfully argued two voting rights cases before the United States Supreme Court. Avila drafted the 2001 California Voting Rights Act (CVRA), which made it easier for plaintiffs to challenge at-large election systems by eliminating one of the criteria required to challenge such systems under the federal Voting Rights Act. The law also required the government to pay the legal fees of plaintiffs who successfully challenge an election system under the law. In 2003 he authored a UCLA law school report which called for the amendment of the state constitution to allow millions of non-citizen adults to vote in local elections. Avila later served as practitioner in residence and director of the National Voting Rights Advocacy Initiative at the Seattle University School of Law. ==Awards and honors== Avila's work has been recognized by awards that include: * MacArthur Foundation Fellowship \\"Genius Grant\\" (1996) * State Bar of California Loren Miller Legal Services Award (2001) * Vanguard Public Foundation Social Justice Sabbatical * League of United Latin American Citizens President's Award (2012) * Mexican government Ohtli Award (2011) * Harvard Law School Association Award (2012) * Seattle University School of Law Latino Amicus Award (2012) ==Personal life== Avila was married to Sally Cabaruvias, and lived in Compton, California, with whom he had three children, Joaquin Jr., Salvador and Angelique He died of cancer at his home in Shoreline, Washington. ==References== Category:1948 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Lawyers from Los Angeles Category:People from Compton, California Category:People from Shoreline, Washington Category:Texas lawyers Category:American legal scholars Category:American civil rights lawyers Category:Yale University alumni Category:Harvard Law School alumni Category:Seattle University faculty Category:MacArthur Fellows Category:American people of Mexican descent Category:Deaths from cancer in Washington (state) ","title":"Joaquin Avila (lawyer)"},{"id":"56802832","text":"Silvia Levenson (born 1957, in Buenos Aires, Argentina) is a contemporary artist and political activist working in glass. Originally a graphic artist in her native Argentina whose work, both artistic and political, was in direct conflict with the dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla, she found herself and her young family immigrating to Italy in 1980. Glass soon became the new medium in which she could best express her feelings of exile, oppression and personal tragedy. == Biography == Silvia Levenson was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1957. Born into a time when political and social activism was encouraged, she began protesting on behalf of the Buenos Aires poor as early as 14. By the time she was 16 she was married and before her 20th birthday she was a mother. It was during this time that the political climate in Argentina began to change with the military taking control of the government under Jorge Rafael Videla, the senior commander of the Argentine Army. Between 1976 and 1984 more than 30,000 people disappeared and were later killed, including members of Levenson's own family. At the age of 23 she fled to Italy with her husband and family. It was the tragic events of this time that ultimately influenced and continues to influence Levenson's artistic practice. == Further reading == * Levenson, Silvia.

Lorenzi works on auditory perception. == Biography == Lorenzi obtained a PhD in experimental psychology from Universit√© Lyon 2 in 1995 for his work on \\"Codage de la modulation d'amplitude dans le syst√®me auditif: exp√©riences psychoacoustiques et mod√©lisation physiologique\\" (coding of amplitude modulation in the auditory system: psychoacoustical experiments and physiological modelling). He then spent a year as a postdoc at the Applied Psychology Unit in Cambridge, UK, where he worked with Roy D. Patterson on the perception of click trains. The following year, he moved to the Glasgow branch of the MRC Institute of Hearing Research where he worked with Stuart Gatehouse. Back in France, he became Lecturer (Ma√Ætre de Conf√©rences) at the Universit√© Paris Descartes. He obtained his Habilitation √† Diriger les Recherches in 2000 and became Professor in 2001. During this period, he is a member of the Laboratoire de Psychologie de la Perception where he worked on the creation of the √âquipe Audition which becomes physically located at the ENS. In 2011, his affiliation officially changed to the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, where he was Director of Scientific Studies until 2020. Lorenzi became a fellow of the Acoustical Society of America in 2008. == Research == Sounds such as speech are decomposed by the peripheral auditory system of humans (the cochlea) into narrow frequency bands. The resulting signals convey information at different time scales to more central auditory structures. A dichotomy between slow \\"temporal envelope\\" cues and faster \\"temporal fine structure\\" (TFS) cues has been proposed to explore several aspects of auditory perception including speech intelligibility in quiet or against competing sound sources. Starting from the late nineties, Lorenzi conducted a research program on auditory perception combining signal processing, psychophysical, electrophysiological and computational methods based on this envelope/TFS dichotomy. He examined the role of these two cues in sound discrimination and identification and auditory scene analysis, how these cues are processed at each stage of the auditory system, and the effects of peripheral (cochlear) or central damage, ageing and rehabilitation systems (e.g., hearing aids or cochlear implants) on the perception of these temporal envelope and TFS cues. His early work on the perception of temporal-envelope information corroborated the existence of tuned (selective) modulation filters at central stages of the human auditory system, consistent with the notion that the auditory system computes some form of modulation spectrum of incoming sounds. He then showed that dynamic information in sounds not only is carried by so-called first- order characteristic of sounds (e.g., onset and offset cues, slow amplitude modulations composing the envelope of sounds), but also can be carried by temporal variations in ‚Äúsecond-order‚Äù characteristics such as the temporal- envelope contrast (depth). His psychophysical conducted on normal-hearing people and patients with cochlear or brain lesions is consistent with the idea that, as in vision, nonlinear mechanisms along the auditory pathway generate an audible distortion component at the 2nd-order AM frequency in the internal modulation spectrum of sounds. His more recent work on the perception of TFS information suggested that TFS cues convey as much spectro-temporal information as temporal-envelope cues do for complex sounds such as speech. He also showed that TFS cues are less vulnerable than temporal envelope cues when sounds are masked by competing sounds such as noise or presented at high intensities, and may play a role in robust sound coding at the low (brainstem) level. His work conducted with people with sensorineural hearing loss and computational models of auditory perception showed how cochlear lesions may alter the neural representation of TFS cues in the early stages of the auditory system, even in regions of the pure-tone audiogram where hearing is clinically considered as normal. == See also == * Temporal envelope and fine structure == References == Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Auditory scientists Category:Fellows of the Acoustical Society of America Category:French psychologists Category:√âcole Normale Sup√©rieure faculty ","title":"Christian Lorenzi"},{"id":"56802937","text":"Jim Powers (born 1958) is an American professional wrestler.

Based on the Admiralty type , the Llewellyn class were constructed of wood and used for the removal of magnetic influence mines. Two were built in Quebec, with the eight constructed on the Western Coast of Canada. Mostly used as guard ships during the war, only three of the ten remained in Royal Canadian Navy service following the war, with the last being discarded in 1957. Following naval service, vessels of the class ended up in commercial service, with some becoming fishing vessels, cargo ships and one a floating restaurant. Six of the ten ships were lost in commercial service. ==Description== Based on the Admiralty type s, the Llewellyn class were built with wooden hulls for deployment against magnetic influence mines that would detect a steel hull passing nearby and detonate. The minesweepers had a standard displacement of . They were long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of . The Llewellyn class were powered by a diesel engine driving one propeller shaft, rated at . This gave the minesweepers a maximum speed of . The Llewellyn class were armed with four machine guns placed in two twin mounts. At some point, their armament was changed to one 0.5-inch machine gun placed amidships and twin machine guns on the bridge wings.

Llewellyn and Lloyd George were both commissioned on 24 August 1942 at Quebec City and escorted a convoy from Quebec City to Sydney, Nova Scotia before arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia. Both vessels' names begin with a double \\"l\\", a reflection of their minesweeping gear. They would be the only two vessels that began their names as such, as the eight minesweepers constructed in British Columbia did not follow this pattern. During the Second World War, Llewellyn and Lloyd George operated out of Halifax performing sweeps of the approaches to Halifax Harbour. Following the war, Llewellyn became the guard ship for the Royal Canadian Navy reserve fleet at Halifax. Taken out of service on 14 June 1946. Llewellyn was recommissioned on 25 July 1949 as tender at Saint John, New Brunswick associated with the naval reserve division , primarily used for training. That summer, the ship made a tour of Newfoundland, after it became the 10th province of Canada. Llewellyn was tender to in 1951.. The ship was decommissioned again on 31 October 1951. Sold 1957 for commercial use. Renamed Llewellyn II, the fishing vessel foundered off Cape Breton Island on 28 October 1960. Following war, Lloyd George was used as a bathythermograph survey vessel until 16 July 1948 when the ship was decommissioned. Lloyd George was sold on 14 May 1951 to become a floating restaurant at Bridgewater, Nova Scotia. The hulk was abandoned ten years later. The British Columbia- built minesweepers all joined the fleet in 1944 and patrolled between Esquimalt and Prince Rupert, British Columbia, joining either escort force until the end of 1945. All eight were decommissioned and seven were sold to commercial interests. The vast majority of them had eventful fates. Daerwood was sold for commercial use on 30 December 1946. The vessel caught fire and sank at Bridgetown, Barbados on 13 October 1973. Cranbrook was purchased by a Nanaimo towing firm in November 1947. In 1950 the vessel's registry disappeared from Lloyd's Registry. Coquitlam was sold in October 1946 and renamed Wilcox. The ship went aground on 17 June 1954 on Anticosti Island and written off. Kalamalka was sold in 1946 for conversion to a fishing vessel. The ship burned and sank while fishing in Wallis Bay, British Columbia on 18 March 1968. Lavallee was sold on 13 November 1947 to become fishing vessel of the same name. The ship burned and sank near Burgeo, Newfoundland and Labrador on 1 March 1967. Rossland was sold to Vancouver towing company in 1946 and renamed La Verne. In 1971, the vessel was resold to a US buyer. St. Joseph was sold for commercial use and was a Mexican-flagged cargo vessel until the ship's registry was deleted in 1988. Revelstoke was the only British Columbia- built vessel to be kept following the war. Revelstoke sailed to Halifax and served as tender to HMCS Stadacona and before being decommissioned for the final time on 23 October 1953. The vessel was sold in 1957 and renamed Shirley Ann in 1959. Shirley Ann caught fire and sank off Newfoundland on 12 October 1979. ==CitationsSources== * * * Category:World War II minesweepers of Canada Category:1940s ships ","title":"Llewellyn-class minesweeper"},{"id":"56803062","text":"Lee Min-a (born 8 November 1991) is a South Korean footballer who plays as a midfielder WK League club Incheon Hyundai Steel Red Angels and the South Korea national team. ==Club careerIncheon Hyundai Steel Red Angels, 2012‚Äì2017=== After playing for Yeungjin College from 2010 to 2012, Lee joined Incheon Hyundai Steel Red Angels in the WK League.

It was the first edition of the British Open, having been rebranded from the International Open the previous year. It was the fifth ranking event of the 1984‚Äì85 snooker season, preceding the 1985 World Snooker Championship. In the best-of-23- final, South African player Silvino Francisco defeated Canadian Kirk Stevens 12‚Äì9. It was the first major professional snooker tournament without a British player in the final. The event featured a total prize fund of ¬£250,000 with the winner receiving ¬£50,000. The highest of the event was made by Alex Higgins, who compiled a 142 in his last-16 match against Cliff Thorburn. ==Overview== The 1985 British Open was held between 17 February and 3 March 1985. The qualifying competition took place across venues in London, Bristol and Stockport. The first round took place in Chesterfield, whilst the remaining rounds took place at the Assembly Rooms, Derby. The qualifying and first rounds were played as best- of-11 . The following rounds, from last 32 to quarter-finals, were played as shorter best-of-9-frames matches because of television scheduling. Broadcaster ITV were concerned about the prospect of large overtime payments for their staff if matches overran, and also requested that the afternoon matches started at 2:00 pm rather than the originally scheduled 1:00 pm, to avoid higher payments to lighting technicians that would have been due if the lighting was switched on before that time. The decision by snooker governing body the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) to cut the length of matches in response to ITV's request was publicly criticised by WPBSA board member Barry Hearn, who was also the manager of prominent player Steve Davis. The event was sponsored by ICI Paints Division and was known for sponsorship purposes as the 1985 Dulux British Open. It took the place of the non-ranking 1984 International Masters tournament on the professional snooker calendar. ===Prize fund=== The prize fund for the event was ¬£250,000, with the winner receiving ¬£50,000. * Winner: ¬£50,000 * Runner-up: ¬£30,000 * Semi- finals: ¬£17,500 * Quarter-finals: ¬£9,000 * Last 16: ¬£4,625 * Last 32: ¬£2,000 * Last 64: ¬£750 * Highest break (televised stages): ¬£5,000 Alex Higgins (142) * Highest break (pre-televised stages): ¬£5,000 Steve Davis (129) * Total: ¬£250,000 ==Tournament summary== In the first round, Bill Werbeniuk, 14th in the world rankings, was beaten 1‚Äì6 by Bob Chaperon. Malcolm Bradley, in his first season as a professional player, beat David Taylor 6‚Äì3. Bob Harris, who to that point had made little impact as a player, beat world number six Eddie Charlton 6‚Äì3 after being 1‚Äì3 behind. Jimmy White was 3‚Äì1 ahead of Tony Jones but the match went to the deciding frame before White won, 6‚Äì5. Another first- year professional, Danny Fowler, beat Rex Williams, the former world billiards champion, 6‚Äì3. A third new professional, Tony Chappel, led reigning world champion Steve Davis 5‚Äì4, before Davis prevailed 6‚Äì5. The television stages of the event began in the second round. Steve Newbury, in his first season as a professional player, recorded a 5‚Äì3 win over former world champion Terry Griffiths in the last 32. Other players unexpectedly losing in the second round were Willie Thorne, who lost 0‚Äì5 to Murdo MacLeod; Ray Reardon, who was wearing spectacles for the first time in a match and who was beaten 4‚Äì5 by Dave Martin after leading 4‚Äì1; and Jimmy White, who lost 4‚Äì5 to Silvino Francisco. Only seven of the top sixteen seeded players progressed into the last 16 of the competition. In the last 16, Alex Higgins was level at 2‚Äì2 with Cliff Thorburn, then made a total clearance of 142, the highest break of the tournament, and went on to win 5‚Äì2. In the match between Eugene Hughes and Murdo MacLeod, neither player made a break of 30 or over as Hughes won 5‚Äì2. Kirk Stevens won his quarter-final against Dennis Taylor by winning five straight frames after trailing 0‚Äì2, and went on to beat Davis 9‚Äì7 in the semi- final to reach his first ranking tournament final. In the other semi-final, Francisco was never behind Higgins in frames, and won 9‚Äì7. With the South African Francisco and the Canadian Stevens contesting the final, it was the first snooker ranking tournament where there was no British player in the final. The next time there was a ranking final with no British players was the 2009 Grand Prix. Francisco beat Stevens 12‚Äì9 in the final to win the title. The final was played across three sessions, with an afternoon and evening session on Saturday 2 March followed by a session on Sunday 3 March. Francisco took a 5‚Äì0 lead in the final, before Stevens won the last two frames of the first session to make it 5‚Äì2. In the second session, Francisco increased his lead to 6‚Äì2 with a on the in the eighth frame. A few frames later, he made his lead 9‚Äì4 due to another fluked pink ball. In the frame following this, Stevens compiled the highest break of the final, 108, which left Francisco 9‚Äì5 ahead at the end of the first day. The following day, Stevens took the first three frames of the third session of the final to trail by just one frame. However, Francisco won the next two frames to lead 11‚Äì8. Stevens won frame 20 from 47 points behind, but Francisco took the next to gain victory. The winner's prize money of ¬£50,000 was a new record amount for snooker tournaments. It was Francisco's only ranking tournament win. ==Main draw== The main draw for the tournament was held with a total of 64 participants.

He served as an artillery officer during World War II and later took part in the Vietnam War as deputy commander of XXIV Corps. ==Early career and World War II== Clifford B. Drake was born on November 7, 1918, in New York City, but his family moved to Los Angeles, California, where he attended high school in 1935 and then the University of California (UCLA), earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Physics in June 1940. While at UCLA, he was a member of a Reserve Officers' Training Corps unit and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Coast Artillery Reserve Corps. Drake resigned his reserve rank in order to accept an appointment as second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps on July 1, 1940. He was sent to Officer Candidates School at Quantico, Virginia, for further officer education. After a three- months course there, he was attached to the Marine detachment aboard the battleship USS California. While serving on the California, Drake was present at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during the Japanese attack. He was officer of the deck on that day and was relieved by Ensign Herbert C. Jones around 7:30 am. Drake went for breakfast and heard explosions and the engines of the attacking Japanese aircraft 20 minutes later. The general quarters alarm then summoned the crew to battle stations, and Drake went to the foretop of the ship, where he directed its defense. Ensign Jones was later killed by a bomb explosion and received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions on California. The damaged and partially flooded California settled into the mud with only her superstructure remaining above the surface. Drake was subsequently transferred to 3rd Defense Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Robert H. Pepper and continued in the defense of Pearl Harbor. He showed great organizational skills and was promptly promoted to the rank of first lieutenant following the attack. Drake was then attached to the Marine detachment aboard the transport ship USS Argonne for a brief period, before he was posted to the staff of Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, Commander, South Pacific Area. While in this capacity, Drake was promoted to the rank of captain in May 1942 and also served in this command under Admiral William Halsey during the Solomon Islands campaign. He was ordered back to the United States in early 1943 in order to attend the Army Field Artillery School at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. He completed the course in June 1943 and was promoted to the rank of major at the same time. Ordered to Camp Pendleton, California, he was attached to the newly activated 14th Marine Artillery Regiment as executive officer of 1st Battalion. His regiment was subsequently attached to the newly created 4th Marine Division under Major General Harry Schmidt as its main artillery component. The 14th Marines later relocated to Camp Dunlap for further training and Drake received word of its upcoming combat deployment to the Pacific: the Marshall Islands. The main target of the landing for the 4th Marine Division, was Roi Namur atoll, which served as a large air base and center of air activity in the Marshall Islands. With the securing of that atoll, Allied forces would have a new base for future offensives in the Pacific. Drake and his 1st Battalion deployed their 75mm Howitzers on the island of Ennubirr in the evening of January 31, 1944. They landed on Blue Beach 4 at 5:00pm and provided support fire for the advancing Allied units. The atoll was declared secure on February 2 and 1st Battalion was ordered to serve as a garrison unit until February 29. The 1st Battalion then rejoined rest of the regiment, which had in the interim been ordered to Maui, Hawaii, for rest and further training. In mid-May, the 14th Marines were ordered back to the combat area, when they received orders for the forthcoming assault on Saipan in the Marianas. Drake landed with his battalion on Yellow Beach and participated in combat against enemy until July 9, 1944. Following the capture of Saipan, the 4th Marine Division was ordered to take part in the landing on near Tinian on July 24. The 1st Battalion was the first artillery unit ashore and immediately commenced a barrage of gunfire. During the morning of the following day, Japanese artillery hit the command post of the 1st Battalion and almost wiped out the unit's command structure, including its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Harry J. Zimmer. Drake took charge and supervised the evacuation of wounded and dead. He reestablished the battalion's command post and continued in its mission, providing artillery support to the 25th Marine Regiment. He led the battalion until the end of hostilities on August 1 and subsequently returned to Maui, Hawaii during the first week of August. For his actions on 25 July, when the battalion's command post was shelled, Drake received the Legion of Merit with Combat \\"V\\" and Navy Presidential Unit Citation. While in Hawaii, Drake assumed command of the 2nd Battalion, 14th Marines and took part in several ship-to-shore maneuvers until January 27, 1945. The 2nd Battalion subsequently sailed for its new destination, Iwo Jima. Drake went ashore with his battalion in the evening on February 19, 1945, and immediately deployed his howitzers. which began firing the same evening during the advance of the 25th Marines. Drake was later decorated with the Bronze Star Medal with Combat \\"V\\" for his service on Iwo Jima. He also received the Navy Unit Commendation. ==Postwar service== The 14th Marines returned to the United States in October 1945 and following the disbandment of the regiment at the end of November of that year, Drake was transferred to the Marine Corps Base San Diego, where he remained until April 1946. He was subsequently ordered to nearby Coronado Base, as an artillery instructor within Troop Training Unit, Pacific Fleet under Major General Harry K. Pickett. He later served as assistant chief of staff for personnel within this command. Drake was transferred to Washington, D.C., in March 1948 and appointed administrative assistant and aide to the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arthur W. Radford. He continued in this capacity under Admirals John D. Price and Lynde D. McCormick and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in August 1949. He also earned a Master of Arts degree in education from Stanford University in June 1951 and subsequently joined the 2nd Marine Division at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Drake served under Major General Edwin A. Pollock as assistant chief of staff for personnel and then as commander of the 4th and later 3rd Battalions, 10th Marine Regiment. He finished his tenure with the 10th Marines as regimental operations officer in October 1953 and subsequently served as head of Enlisted Coordinator Section, Personnel Department at Headquarters Marine Corps. In November 1956, Drake was ordered to England as a student in the Joint Service Staff College in Latimer, Buckinghamshire. Upon graduation in June of the following year, he became the Marine Corps representative to the British Joint Service Amphibious Warfare Center at Poole, Dorset. He was promoted to colonel in September 1957 and returned to the United States in April 1959. One month later, Drake was appointed executive officer of the personnel division at Headquarters Marine Corps and served in that capacity under Major General August Larson until July 1961, when he was ordered to the Far East. He subsequently assumed duties as commanding officer of the 12th Marine Artillery Regiment, 3rd Marine Division and served in that capacity until August 1962. Upon his return stateside, Drake attended National War College in Washington, D.C., and graduated in June 1963. His next duty brought him to Quantico, where he was named director, Marine Corps Command and Staff College. ==Vietnam War== Drake was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in January 1966 and appointed director, Marine Corps Reserve at Headquarters Marine Corps. He was responsible for the administration of all reserve marine troops, which were used as reinforcements for combat units in Vietnam. He was promoted to the rank of major general on August 2, 1967. Drake served in that capacity until April 1968 and received his second Legion of Merit for his service there. He was subsequently ordered to Vietnam, where he assumed duties as deputy commander of XXIV Corps under Lieutenant General Richard G. Stilwell. He served in that capacity during the Tet Offensive and was decorated with Distinguished Service Medal for his service during that period. He also received the Air Medal for his participation in observation flights over the combat area as well as several decorations from the Government of South Vietnam. In June 1969, Drake was relieved by Major General Edwin B. Wheeler and returned to the United States, where he assumed duties as assistant chief of staff for operations at Headquarters Marine Corps. He served in that capacity until October 1972, when he retired from the Marine Corps after 32 years of active service. During his retirement ceremony, Drake received his third Legion of Merit. ==Retirement== Drake settled in Alexandria, Virginia, where he lived with his wife Margery Forbes Jones. The couple had two children: Christopher, born in 1950, and Carolyn, born in 1951. He died on October 25, 1994, in Seminole, Florida. ==Awards and decorations== Here is the ribbon bar of General Drake: { - colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" 21px 22px22px -    -    -    -    -    - } {  - !1st Row colspan=\\"6\\" align=\\"center\\" Navy Distinguished Service Medal colspan=\\"6\\" align=\\"center\\" Legion of Merit with Combat \\"V\\" and two \\" Gold Stars - !2nd Row colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Bronze Star Medal with Combat \\"V\\" colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Air Medal colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Navy Presidential Unit Citation - !3rd Row colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Navy Unit Commendation colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" American Defense Service Medal with Base Clasp colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" American Campaign Medal - !4th Row colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with one silver 3/16 inch service star colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" World War II Victory Medal colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" National Defense Service Medal with one star - !5th Row colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Vietnam Service Medal with three 3/16 inch service stars colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" National Order of Vietnam, Knight colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Vietnam Navy Distinguished Service Order, 1st Class - !6th Row colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Navy Gallantry Cross with gold anchor colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" Vietnam Campaign Medal } ==See also== *Battle of Tinian *Marine Corps Reserve *XXIV Corps ==References== : Category:1918 births Category:1994 deaths Category:Military personnel from New York City Category:University of California, Los Angeles alumni Category:Stanford University alumni Category:National War College alumni Category:United States Marine Corps generals Category:American Marine Corps personnel of World War II Category:United States Marine Corps personnel of the Vietnam War Category:Recipients of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal Category:Recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:Recipients of the National Order of Vietnam Category:Recipients of the Gallantry Cross (Vietnam) Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Service Order (Vietnam) ","title":"Clifford B.

Prior to this year-long collaboration, the co-authors had only met twice. The premise of this project was to test firsthand how well one could get to know someone through reading their data. Postcards were exchanged between them on a weekly basis with the data being represented through a drawing on one side and a detailed key or legend on the other. A few of the topics include: A Week of Negative Thoughts, A Week of A Workspace, and A Week of New Things. The project has surface similarities with the quantified self projects like designer Nicholas Felton's annual reports that quantify and represent life events like number of books read or place visited, but is more personal and less analytical, with hand-drawn illustrations replacing computer generated charts. It \\"paints a human portrait with data.\\" Dear data is also, in a way, the opposite of Big Data, it is composed of representations little data about on the minutiae of individuals' lives.

The season consisted of nine pairs of triathlon races for both a men's and women's competition, as well as three mixed relays, beginning on 2 March in Abu Dhabi, and concluding on 16 September with the grand final at the Gold Coast. Mario Mola and Flora Duffy began the season as defending champions from the 2017 season. Mola would go on to defend his title and win the men's series for the third time in as many years, becoming the second-most successful triathlete at the world triathlon series after fellow countryman Javier G√≥mez. Duffy's season however would be plagued by injuries, leading to an inability to defend her title despite winning two races early in the season. The eventual winner, Vicky Holland, captured the women's series by moving into first place only after the final race of the series. The most notable event of the year was in Bermuda where the Norwegian team completed the first men's podium sweep, with race winner Casper Stornes having only competed in two prior WTS races. ==Overview== The ITU World Triathlon in Leeds. === Calendar === The 2018 ITU World Triathlon Series visited nine cities, and incorporated the three events of the inaugural Mixed Relay Series in Nottingham, Edmonton, and the Mixed Relay world championship in Hamburg. {  - !Date !Location !Type - March 2‚Äì3  Abu Dhabi Sprint - April 28‚Äì29  Bermuda Standard - May 12‚Äì13  Yokohama Standard - June 7  Nottingham Mixed relay - June 9‚Äì10  Leeds Standard - July 14‚Äì15  Hamburg Sprint/Mixed relay - July 27‚Äì29  Edmonton Sprint/Mixed relay - August 25‚Äì26  Montreal Standard - September 12‚Äì16  Gold Coast Grand Final } === Point System === For every race a triathlete finished, they received points based on their position across the line. For a normal world series event, first place was awarded 1,000 points and every subsequent place was awarded 7.5% less, for the first forty triathletes; for the grand final, 1,200 points were awarded, once again decreasing by 7.5% for each place, but this time awarded down to 50th. However, if a triathlete finished outside the time cut (more than 5% longer than the winner's time for men, 8% for women), they received no points even if they finished in a scoring position. A triathlete's final score was the sum of their points from the grand final and their best five race scores of that year. ==ResultsMedal summary=== Men { - Abu Dhabi width=220 width=220 width=220 - Bermuda width=220 width=220 width=220 - Yokohama width=220 width=220 width=220 - Leeds width=220 width=220 width=220 - Hamburg width=220 width=220 width=220 - Edmonton width=220 width=220 width=220 - Montreal width=220 width=220 width=220 - Gold Coast width=220 width=220 width=220 - colspan=4 bgcolor=#d6d6d6 - !Overall !width=220 !width=220 !width=220 } Women { - Abu Dhabi width=220 width=220 width=220 - Bermuda width=220 width=220 width=220 - Yokohama width=220 width=220 width=220 - Leeds width=220 width=220 width=220 - Hamburg width=220 width=220 width=220 - Edmonton width=220 width=220 width=220 - Montreal width=220 width=220 width=220 - Gold Coast width=220 width=220 width=220 - colspan=4 bgcolor=#d6d6d6 - !Overall !width=220 !width=220 !width=220 } Mixed relay { - Nottingham width=220 Kirsten Kasper Eli Hemming Katie Zaferes Matthew McElroy width=220 Non Stanford Tom Bishop Vicky Holland Jonny Brownlee width=220 Cassandre Beaugrand Pierre Le Corre Mathilde Gautier L√©o Berg√®re - Hamburg ITU.

Obama selected the artist, as well as the dress by the brand Milly by fashion designer Michelle Smith. Obama's face is stylized in shades of gray, an artistic technique known as grisaille, a key theme in works by Sherald, and the background is a simple blue evoking American folk art. Rather than focusing on an individualized glamor, the dress dominates the work as a mountain-like triangle. The dress is a variation on a halter gown from the Spring 2017 collection, with a modern geometric pattern that Sherald said reminded her of the works of 20th century Dutch painter Mondrian and the African-American quilting tradition of Gee's Bend, Alabama. Together with Kehinde Wiley's portrait of her husband Barack Obama, the paintings were first exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery on February 12, 2018. The unveiling led to thousands of visitors lined up at the entrance, and a threefold increase in visitors compared to the previous President's Day Weekend. == Parker Curry photograph == Shortly after the painting was put on display, a photograph of a two-year-old African-American girl, Parker Curry, staring at it in awe, went viral on social media. The photograph was taken by Ben Hines of North Carolina.

In 1932, market studies showed that there was an interest in 10-inch diameter glass skillets. However, at that time, stove manufacturers were producing 6-inch and 8-inch electric ranges. When these glass skillets were set upon a 6- or 8-inch heating element, a hot spot would develop in the center of the skillet while the rim remained cold, and the skillets were prone to breakage due to thermal stress. Even though the expensive 10-inch skillet molds had already been made and the market studies showed that consumers wanted them, this demonstration of the 10-inch skillets' failure led to the recommendation that 6-inch skillets be produced. == References == Category:Home economists Category:American designers Category:Syracuse University alumni Category:Corning Inc.

He then changed his mind and decided to shoot anyone he encountered, believing that he would not be a burden to his family in prison. After trying and failing to commit suicide, he pointed his gun at a mother with a child, but decided not to shoot them. He then saw Idy Diene, a Senegalese trader, and shot him three times in quick succession. Pirrone then turned himself in to the police. A medical team managed to revive the victim, who died forty minutes later. The crime scene was cordoned off by the police. ==Suspect== The shooter, identified by the police as Roberto Pirrone, explained to the police that he wanted to kill himself for economic reasons while breaking into tears. A farewell note to his daughter was found in his home in the Oltrarno district not far from the bridge. The police confirmed that there was no racist intent in the perpetrated murder. Pirrone was an arms collector and leftist militant. During a search of his house, the Italian police discovered numerous weapons and relics of the former Soviet Union. ==Reactions== The Senegalese community in Florence protested against the shooting, believing that it was racially motivated. A group of Senegalese immigrants went to the Florentine town hall to confront the mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella. The police intervened in riot gear to contain the protest. The mayor condemned the murder and extended the support of the city to the victim's family and the broader Senegalese community. He further condemned the violence and rioting. The mayor visited the scene of the murder, where he was attacked by protestors. Demonstrations against racism have been promoted by the Senegalese community and leftist extremists in many Italian cities in reaction to the murder.

The race, known as the \\"test of the champion\\", is the final leg in the American Triple Crown. It is a Grade I stakes race with a purse of $1.5 million, open to three-year-old Thoroughbreds. The race took place on June 9, 2018, and was broadcast on NBC starting at 4 p.m. EDT. Justify won the race with a time of 2:28.18, becoming the thirteenth American Triple Crown winner. ==Field== Entries for the Belmont were taken on June 5, followed by the post position draw. Justify was attempting to become the first horse to win the American Triple Crown since American Pharoah did so in 2015. He faced horses that he had previously beaten in the Kentucky Derby or Preakness, plus a few \\"new shooters\\" who did not compete in those races. His major competitors included: *Bravazo ‚Äì sixth in the Kentucky Derby, second in the Preakness, winner of the Risen Star Stakes *Tenfold ‚Äì third in the Preakness *Hofburg ‚Äì seventh in the Kentucky Derby *Vino Rosso ‚Äì ninth in the Kentucky Derby, winner of the Wood Memorial *Noble Indy ‚Äì 17th in the Kentucky Derby, winner of the Louisiana Derby *Free Drop Billy ‚Äì 16th in the Kentucky Derby, winner of the Breeders' Futurity *Gronkowski ‚Äì a multiple stakes winner in Europe (and named after Rob Gronkowski, who became a part-owner) *Blended Citizen ‚Äì winner of the Peter Pan Stakes Audible, who finished third in the Kentucky Derby and would have been one of Justify's top competitors in the Belmont, was not considered for the race. Although the two colts have different trainers, they share common ownership (WinStar Farm, China Horse Club, Starlight Racing and Head of Plains Partners), leading some to conclude that the owners did not want to increase the pressure on Justify in his Triple Crown bid. ==Race description== The 2018 Belmont Stakes was run on June 9 over a fast track before a sold-out crowd of 90,327. The New York Racing Association had decided to cap admission for the race after logistical difficulties at the 2014 event. The on-track handle, or total amount bet on the race, was $16,159,584, up from 2017 but somewhat less that bet in 2014 and 2015 ‚Äì the last two Belmonts where the Triple Crown was on the line. The all-source handle for the race was $72,702,815, up sharply from 2017 but down compared to the record set in 2014. The race was broadcast by NBC. Justify wins the Belmont Stakes to become the 13th Triple Crown winner. Having drawn post position one, Justify risked getting trapped on the rail if he started poorly. Instead, he broke well and jockey Mike Smith sent him to the lead with a quick opening quarter of 23.37. Meanwhile, the eventual runner-up Gronkowski started poorly and trailed the field. Justify then slowed down the pace as they moved around the first turn, leading by two lengths over Restoring Hope. None of the other jockeys chose to challenge Justify for the lead, so he settled into an easy stride down the backstretch, completing the opening mile in 1:38.09. Around the far turn, Restoring Hope started to tire while Vino Rosso mounted a drive to move into second place. From farther back, Gronkowski and Hofburg also started closing rapidly. Despite drifting out slightly in the stretch, Justify held off the challengers to win by lengths over Gronkowski with Hofburg another lengths back in third. Justify completed the mile and a half in 2:28.18. The win made Justify the 13th winner of the American Triple Crown, and just the second horse to accomplish the feat while still undefeated, joining 1977 winner Seattle Slew. It was the second Triple Crown win for Baffert, who also trained American Pharoah. ==Results== {class=\\"sortable \\" ! scope=\\"col\\" Finish ! scope=\\"col\\" '''''' ! scope=\\"col\\" Horse ! scope=\\"col\\" Jockey ! scope=\\"col\\" Trainer ! scope=\\"col\\" Morning line odds ! scope=\\"col\\" Final odds ! scope=\\"col\\"Margin (lengths) ! scope=\\"col\\" Winnings - !1  1  Justify    align=center4-5 align=center0.80 align=center align=center$800,000 - !2  6  Gronkowski    align=center12-1 align=center24.75 align=center align=center$280,000 - !3  4  Hofburg    align=center9-2 align=center5.20 align=center align=center$150,000 - !4  8  Vino Rosso    align=center8-1 align=center7.50 align=center align=center$100,000 - !5  7  Tenfold    align=center12-1 align=center10.70 align=center align=center$60,000 - !6  3  Bravazo    align=center8-1 align=center8.00 align=center align=center$45,000 - !7 2  Free Drop Billy    align=center30-1 align=center32.25 align=center align=center$35,000 - !8  5  Restoring Hope    align=center30-1 align=center37.50 align=center align=center$30,000 - !9 10  Blended Citizen    align=center15-1 align=center23.90 align=center align=center - !10  9  Noble Indy    align=center30-1 align=center23.80 align=center54 align=center - } Track: Fast Times: mile ‚Äì 23.37; mile ‚Äì 48.11; mile ‚Äì 1:13.21; mile ‚Äì 1:38.09; miles ‚Äì 2:02.90; final ‚Äì 2:28.18.

It is located in the Kola Bay of the Barents Sea, 2.5 km northeast of the city of Polyarny, and 35 km north of Murmansk. There is an important archaeological site on the island. Settlers arrived to this area about 3,500 years ago, or earlier. ==Area status== The island is a protected area, which is under the protection of the Murmansk biological station.(in Russian) –ö–æ–ª—å—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫, 1930 // Kola Almanac, 1930 In 1910 a lighthouse was built on the island.(in Russian) –ú–∞—è–∫ –ë–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π –û–ª–µ–Ω–∏–π In 1950-2006, there was a town here that was called Mayak Bolshoi Oleny. ==Archaeology== In 1925, the Olenostrovsky burial ground of the early metal era was discovered here, which was excavated in 1928 by A.V. Schmidt, and in 1947-1948 by N.N. Gurina. Excavations uncovered 23 burials in shallow pits; among them were the burials in wooden boxes, as well as those using tarred leather wrappings. There are two instances of cremation. The inventory includes tools made of stone and bone, such as arrowheads, daggers, awls, needles, and fish hooks. A copper arrowhead, and a sculpture of the head of an elk were found. 5 fragments of \\"wafer\\" ceramics were also found. ==Dating== Earlier it was thought that the Olenostrovsky site belonged to the middle of the I millennium BC. But new radiocarbon dates were obtained for two graves on the island. The new dates are centred around 1500‚Äì1400 BC. The organic preservation is very good. ==Recent exploration== In 2001, four additional clusters of human bones and artefacts were discovered in the eastern part of the burial ground. Also, 59 fragments of Asbestos-ceramic were collected, showing broad analogies in the territory of Karelia and the Kola Peninsula (where this type of ceramics is usually dated to the second half of the 3rd millennium BC). Asbestos-ceramics of the early 'Lovozero Ware' type were found on the Island.Murashkin, A.I., Kolpakov, E.M., Shumkin, V.Ya., Khartanovich, V.I. & Moiseyev, V.G.

According to scientists, the greatest genetic similarity with samples from the Island was shown by modern Siberian populations, mainly in the Yenisei River basin. Presumably, the population of the Island arrived to the Kola Peninsula 3,500 years ago from Central Siberia, but then the traces of this migration faded away, thus not being reflected in the gene pool of modern populations of the Kola Peninsula.Khartanovich V.I., Moiseev V.G., Report to the International Scientific Conference \\"Archeology of the Arctic\\" November 19‚Äì23, 2017 Salekhard ==See also== *Kola Peninsula ==NotesLiterature== *Khartanovich V.I., Moiseev V.G., Report to the International Scientific Conference \\"Archeology of the Arctic\\" November 19‚Äì23, 2017 Salekhard *Khartanovich V.I., Moiseev V.G.

He grew up with his 4 siblings in a teacher's family in the Gro√üfeldsiedlung in Vienna.. From 1985 to 1991, he studied at the University of Music and Performing Arts. == Early writing == Martin Horv√°th began publishing short prose, essays, and other works in literary magazines and anthologies in 1989. === Buchkultur === Buchkultur is an Austrian literary magazine that published its first issue in 1989 and still publishes today. It began as a quarterly magazine that included book reviews, author interviews, information on book markets, etc. In its first issue, the magazine describes itself as a cross between a literary magazine and a classifieds publication for book stores. It says that part of its mission is to introduce its readers to more Austrian authors. Michael Horv√°th, Martin Horv√°th‚Äôs brother, began with the magazine as the editor for the section on international book markets. Martin Horv√°th was a member of the editorial staff from 1989-1992 and was published by the magazine frequently. During his years in New York City, he was the magazine‚Äôs New York correspondent. === Jenseits des Schlussstrichs - Gedenkdienst im Diskurs √ºber √ñsterreichs nationalsozialistische Vergangenheit === This publication was the culmination of the Austrian Heritage Collection project, begun in 1996 and which was a collaboration of the Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service and the Leo Baeck Institute (New York City). The project had two goals: first, to document the stories of Austrian Jews who were expelled from Austria and who then emigrated to the USA, and second, to engage young Austrians in dialogue with former Austrians. Horv√°th participated in the data collection, conducting interviews and analyzing surveys. The book was published in 2002 by Horv√°th, Anton Legerer, Judith Pfeifer, and Stephan Roth. Horv√°th, in addition to editing the volume, also contributed an essay titled ‚ÄúEine Art Wiedergutmachung: Begegnungen mit ehemaligen √ñsterreicherinnen in New York‚Äù (‚ÄúA Kind of Making-Up: Encounters with Former Austrians,‚Äù English translation not available.) === Other publications === ‚ÄúDer Tod der Euridice.‚Äù Blut in der Bassena.

(A charity, SOS Mitmensch, began a campaign to change the name in 2012.) It was published by German publisher dtv in 2012 and is Horv√°th‚Äôs debut novel. The novel centers around Ali, a 15-year-old asylum seeker living on the juvenile floor of an asylum home in Vienna, Austria. Ali speaks every language he encounters in the home, observes more events than are humanly possible, and delivers commentary upon all he hears and sees. Ali introduces the reader to a host of residents on the juvenile floor and the stories of how they arrived. Throughout the book, the reader learns of the various fates of these characters. In 2005/06, Horv√°th completed training as a refugee assistant as part of his research for this novel. The subjects of immigration, asylum, etc., are important to him, and he intended to write a book with a message. He says, ‚ÄúIn Austria, we‚Äôve gotten used to foreigners being vilified, that politicians appeal to the lowest instincts. That makes me angry.‚Äù Although an Austrian himself, Horv√°th published the book with a German publisher, because Austrian publishers turned it down. The book received generally positive reviews from various newspapers and online literary platforms, e.g.,. It was often labeled a picaresque novel and sometimes compared with Grimmelshausen‚Äôs Simplicius Simplicissimus. On Goodreads, it received 3.94/5 stars, with 17 ratings. On Lovely Books, a German online reading platform, it averaged 4/5 stars, with 24 ratings. On amazon.de, 4/5 stars, 16 ratings. All ratings as accessed March 7, 2018. === Future works === Horv√°th plans to write more (28) and in 2013/14 he began work on his second novel. == Letter to Amazon == Horv√°th was one among a long list of authors (including Nobel Prize-winner Elfriede Jelinek) who wrote an open letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Amazon German CEO Ralf Kleber, protesting how Amazon dealt with contract issues with the Sweden-based publisher Bonnier Group, which included Aladin, arsEdition, Berlin Verlag, Carlsen, H√∂rbuch Hamburg, Piper, Thienemann-Esslinger, and Ullstein. The letter, dated 2014, claims that Amazon was boycotting authors whose books appeared under these publishers, by not keeping enough copies in storage. Books from these publishing houses, according to the signatories, were being delivered slowly and omitted from Amazon‚Äôs recommendations. The letter further accused Amazon of giving the impression to customers that it didn‚Äôt interfere with book sales in this manner == Music == Horv√°th plays the double-bass. and violon.

Between 2012 and 2014, San Marino sent Valentina Monetta to the contest on three consecutive occasions, which made her the first singer to participate in three consecutive contests since Udo J√ºrgens, who competed in 1964, 1965 and 1966 for Austria. Her entries in 2012 (\\"The Social Network Song\\") and 2013 (\\"Crisalide (Vola)\\") also failed to qualify San Marino to the final. However, in 2014, Monetta managed to bring San Marino to the final for the first time where she placed 24th with the song \\"Maybe\\". In 2015, the nation once again failed to qualify to the final with the song \\"Chain of Lights\\" performed by Anita Simoncini and Michele Perniola. In 2016, San Marino failed to qualify with \\"I Didn't Know\\" sung by Turkish performer Serhat. In 2017 San Marino sent Valentina Monetta again, but this time she performed together with an American singer Jimmie Wilson. Their song \\"Spirit of the Night\\" failed to qualify and placed last in their semifinal scoring just 1 point. The Sammarinese national broadcaster, San Marino RTV (SMRTV), broadcasts the event within San Marino and organises the selection process for the nation's entry. SMRTV confirmed San Marino's participation at the 2018 Eurovision Song Contest on 17 October 2017. == Before Eurovision == On 21 January 2019, the Sammarinese broadcaster announced that Serhat was selected internally to represent San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019, in Tel Aviv, Israel. Serhat participated again for San Marino, in the 2016 contest held in Stockholm, Sweden. He performed the song \\"I Didn't Know\\" and failed to qualify for the final receiving 68 points. The Sammarinese broadcaster announced that Serhat's song for the 2019 participation will be released on 7 March 2019. == At Eurovision == According to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the \\"Big 5\\" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) are required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progress to the final. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot. On 28 January 2019, a special allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show they would perform in. San Marino was placed into the first semi-final, to be held on 14 May 2019, and was scheduled to perform in the second half of the show. Once all the competing songs for the 2019 contest had been released, the running order for the semi-finals was decided by the shows' producers rather than through another draw, so that similar songs were not placed next to each other. San Marino was set to perform in position 17, following the entry from Greece. ===Semi-Final=== San Marino performed seventeenth and last in the first semi-final, following the entry from Greece. At the end of the night, San Marino was announced as one of the ten countries to have qualified for the grand final, making it only the second time they reached the final and their first qualification since 2014. After the show, Serhat appeared at a press conference with the other nine finalists to draw which half of the final he would participate in. San Marino was drawn to perform in the first half of the final. It was later revealed that San Marino placed eighth in the semi-final, receiving a total of 150 points: 124 points from the televoting and 26 points from the juries. ===Voting=== Voting during the three shows involved each country awarding two sets of points from 1‚Äì8, 10 and 12: one from their professional jury and the other from televoting. Each nation's jury consisted of five music industry professionals who are citizens of the country they represent, with their names published before the contest to ensure transparency. This jury judged each entry based on: vocal capacity; the stage performance; the song's composition and originality; and the overall impression by the act. In addition, no member of a national jury was permitted to be related in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they cannot vote impartially and independently. The individual rankings of each jury member, as well as the nation's televoting results, were released shortly after the grand final.

Braga. ==CareerInternacional=== Born in S√£o Jos√© do Norte, Rio Grande do Sul, Murilo played once as a substitute for Sociedade Esportiva e Recreativa Caxias do Sul in the 2012 Campeonato Ga√∫cho before joining Sport Club Internacional of the same league. He made six appearances as they won the 2014 title, and scored once in a 2‚Äì1 win at Esporte Clube Passo Fundo on 26 January. In late September 2014, Murilo signed a two-year contract with Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A club Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas. The team were runners-up in the 2015 Campeonato Carioca, though his input was just two substitute appearances; that September he was loaned to Maca√© Esporte Futebol Clube for the S√©rie B season, playing just three games from the bench. Murilo returned to his home state in January 2016, joining Clube Esportivo Lajeadense on loan for the Campeonato Ga√∫cho season. After their relegation, he headed to Joinville Esporte Clube for three months on 4 April. The team finished as runners-up in the Campeonato Catarinense, and he scored in a 1‚Äì1 draw at Esporte Clube Comercial (MS) in the first round of the Copa do Brasil on 21 April (2‚Äì1 aggregate win). ===Juventude / Nacional=== In December 2016, Murilo left Internacional for Esporte Clube Juventude in the same state. He played seven games in the 2017 Gauch√£o season, scoring the only goal of a home win over Ypiranga Futebol Clube on 12 February. On 9 June 2017, Murilo moved abroad for the first time, loaned to C.D. Nacional who had recently been relegated to Portugal's LigaPro. He was the Madeiran club's second top scorer behind Ricardo Gomes ‚Äì fifth overall ‚Äì with 13 goals as they won promotion as champions; this included braces with a late equaliser in a 3‚Äì3 draw at Acad√©mico de Viseu F.C. on 18 February and in a 6‚Äì0 home win over FC Porto B on 7 March. ===Braga=== On 1 July 2018, shortly after Nacional's promotion, Murilo signed a five-year deal with fellow Primeira Liga club S.C. Braga. He scored his first goal for them the following 18 January in a 3‚Äì0 win on his return to the Est√°dio da Madeira, having previously played seven minutes in the league all season. Sporting Gij√≥n (loan) On 31 January 2020, Murilo was loaned to Spanish club Sporting de Gij√≥n until the end of the season.

Growing up she was known as a bookworm, \\"artsy,\\" \\"the new wave chick,\\" \\"wanna-be white,\\" and \\"from the 'hood\\" until graduating from the arts-target high school that she attended. That intersectionality grew to be reflected in the concepts she works with in her artwork. She graduated from Fashion Institute of Technology in 1995 with an associate degree in illustration. In 2002 she was an artist in residence at Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. In 2005 she participated in Bronx AIM, a program that exposes and educates emerging artists. She earned her MFA in 2008 from Mason Gross School of Art at Rutgers University. == Career == Raimundi-Ortiz's early work often examined pop, hip-hop and comic culture, depicting famous people (like Celia Cruz) or her own epic characters (like Wepa Woman and Chuleta) in mural form. But her most notable work is multi- disciplinary or performance-based such as RicanStruction that was featured in Performa '05 Biennial creating a pop-up stereotypically Nuyorican beauty parlor. Another of her more interactive performance works was featured in \\"The Post Millennial Black Madonna,\\" an exhibition at Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts in 2007. In 2011 Raimundi-Ortiz performed her Hush series in New York City and at Gyeongnam Art Museum in South Korea. In response to the Pulse shooting, she held a calavera making workshop in Orlando that culminated in a Dia de los Muertos ofrenda. This shrine was exhibited in the National Museum of Mexican Art in Chicago in 2016. Raimundi-Ortiz had work in Silos, an exhibition at American University in 2016. She was a 2016-17 recipient of a Franklin Furnace Fund. Raimundi-Ortiz is a professor at University of Central Florida. === Ask Chuleta === Wanda Raimundi-Ortiz Ask Chuleta, Biennial Culture, 2010 02 Raimundi-Ortiz's performative and political web series, Ask Chuleta, premiered in 2009. This series consists of short YouTube videos where her comical yet poignant Bronx-based Latina, doobie- wearing character, Chuleta, demystifies and critiques contemporary art and its context. She unpacks identity politics, access and stereotypes through this character. Some of the themes of these videos include, color field painting, post-modernism, Pollock and Kahlo, and Abstract Expressionism and the \\"white cube\\". Art critic Benjamin Genocchio says, \\"It is like a cross between Robert Hughes‚Äôs TV series ‚ÄúThe Shock of the New‚Äù and a novel by Oscar Hijuelos.\\" This work was shown at the Jersey City Museum, amongst other places. === Reinas === In Raimundi-Ortiz's Reinas series, she explores the archetypical queen character by developing her own version, adorned in invented regalia inspired by personal fears and challenges including \\"Garbage Queen.\\" This series consisting mostly of performance ephemera and photographic portraits was exhibited in New Jersey at The Gateway Project as part of (em) POWER DYNAMICS: Exploring the Modes of Female Empowerment and Representation in America. === Piet√† === Raimundi-Ortiz's performance series Piet√† centers around the concept of radical empathy. In these performances she embodies a character in the place of Michelangelo's Mary, but instead of holding the dying Jesus, she invites the public, one at a time, to be embraced by her in his place. She created this work to offer an exchange of mourning in response to contemporary global strife and identity-based violence. Through touch, she wants to reach empathy. The first iteration of this performance took place in Knowles Chapel at Rollins College in 2017 where she held thirty-three visitors who identified as part of marginalized communities, each for thirty-three seconds. For this first iteration she collaborated with the University of Central Florida gospel choir, designer Kristina Tollefson and local dj, DJ Stereo 77 to enrich the experience. For the second iteration of her Pieta, Raimundi-Ortiz exhibited at The National Portrait Gallery in Washington DC later the same year, hosting Howard Gospel Choir, costume design by Kristina Tollefson and DJ Stereo 77 as her soundtrack. == References  External links == * Raimundi-Ortiz, Wanda. \\"After Orlando, a Local Artist Works to Overcome the Numbness,\\" Hyperallergic.

It is situated in the Parinacochas Province, Puyusca District, and in the Paucar del Sara Sara Province, in the districts of Pausa and Sara Sara.escale.minedu.gob.pe - UGEL map of the Parinacochas Province (Ayacucho Region) == Geography and geomorphology == Sara Sara lies in the Parinacochas and Paucar del Sara Sara Provinces of the Ayacucho Region, Peru. The town of Pausa lies away from the volcano, and agriculture occurs in the valleys of the area. The mountain was worshipped by local populations in and before Inca time, and the Inca performed human sacrifices on it. The volcano is high. It consists of a complex of lava domes and lava flows superposed on older stratovolcanoes. The vents are aligned in north-northeast-south-southwest direction and are accompanied by lateral lava domes. These vents were the source of lava flows and block-and-ash flows generated by the collapse of lava domes. A pyroclastic cone of recent age is found on the mountain. Glacial cirques are found on Sara Sara's western and eastern flanks. == Geology == Sara Sara is the northernmost volcano of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes. The volcano is part of a long, fault-controlled chain of volcanoes, which includes Cerro Grande, Yarihuato, Puca Ccasa, Sara Sara, Puca Puca and Cerro Que√±uapunco. The basement is formed by Precambrian and Paleozoic rocks, which are covered by Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments and volcanites. During its history, Sara Sara has produced andesite, dacite and trachyandesite, with dacite predominating during Quaternary eruptions. Phenocrysts in the rocks include hornblende and plagioclase, and both their quantity and chemistry varied between various stages of activity. Quaternary moraines and Holocene active and inactive rock glaciers have been described and mappedDornbusch U (1997) Geomorphological investigations on the late glacial glaciation in the western Andes of South Peru between 14¬∞25‚ÄôS and 15¬∞30‚ÄôS, inferable climatic conditi ons and their comparison with newly compiled data on the recent distribution of temperature, precipitation and snowline altitudes in south Peru south of 12¬∞S.

Precipitation is seasonal and mostly falls during summer, at higher elevations in the form of hail and snow. Trees grow at lower elevations, while only ichu and quinua are present above . Alfalfa and maize are cultivated at lower altitudes. == Eruption history == Sara Sara was active in the form of the lower Barroso and Lampa Volcanics. A first stage built up the paleo-Sara Sara edifice in the form of columnar jointed lava flows; a date obtained on this stage is 1.62 million years ago. The Lampa Volcanics were erupted by lateral vents northeast of the volcano and later buried by its eruption products and exposed by the Huanca Huanca river. During the Quaternary, explosive eruptions in a lava dome complex formed a pyroclastic fan which was later in part buried by lava flows. Fresh lava and pyroclastic flows imply recent activity, with two pyroclastic flows dated to 44,500 and 49,200 years before present. Sara Sara is currently classified as a dormant volcano. Future eruptive activity could generate lahars, lava flows, Plinian eruption deposits and pyroclastic flows. Aside from Pausa, other towns and Lake Parinacochas (an important source of water for the region) are located close to the volcano. Hot springs are found northeast of Sara Sara in the Quilcata valley and close to the town of Chacaraya, implying the presence of a shallow magma chamber. == Archeology == The Spanish priest Cristobal de Albornoz noted in 1583 that Sara Sara was one of the most important sacred places in the southern part of Peru, with 2,000 colonists sent by the Inca emperor for its service. The American archaeologist Johan Reinhard surveyed a site on its summit in 1983 and he and Peruvian archaeologist Jose Antonio Chavez led a team that uncovered more than a dozen statues and a female Inca mummy (later nicknamed Sarita) on the summit in 1996. Their expedition was transmitted \\"live\\" over the Internet. The findings made on Sara Sara are currently stored at the Museo de Santuarios Andinos in Arequipa. The archaeological group of Sara Sara was recommended to be declared a National Cultural Heritage in 2003.El Peruano, Normas Legales, p. 243765, May 8, 2003, Lima File:Le volcan Sarasara et le lac Parinacochas.

She studied acting at the Cleveland Playhouse. She was a radio performer in Chicago and New York City in the 1930s and 1940s. She performed in a number of radio shows, including dramas, comedies, and variety shows. During the late 1930s, Winkler was considered one of radio's top stars. == Personal life == Winkler married her Rosemary co-star George Keane in January 1948 at Fort Lee, New Jersey. When Keane was forced to give up his role due to illness, Winkler gave up her role as well and they both moved to Europe. == Career == Winkler's radio career began in Chicago in the 1930s. In the early 1940s, Winkler relocated from Chicago to New York City. In New York, Winkler continued to build her performance career, appearing in shows such as Attorney at Law, Abie's Irish Rose, Joyce Jordan, M.D., and Rosemary. By the mid-1940s, Winkler had become one of the most successful radio performers in the country. An article in Billboard magazine published in December 1944 considered Winkler to be the fourth highest paid woman in radio and called her a \\"heavy dough collecting\\" soap player. In the late 1940s, Winkler became involved with New Stages, Inc., a collective of radio professionals. In 1947, Winkler was listed as a member the New Stages, Inc. project; a project composed of radio professionals who were also shareholders that sought to advance models of broadcasting. The following year, New Stages, Inc. developed radio and television packages to be sold and Winkler was listed as part of the permanent acting company. Winkler served as a committee member on the board of directors for New Stages, Inc. until fall of 1948. == The House Un-American Activities Committee and Red Channels == In 1955, Winkler was named as a member of the Communist party in a witness hearing for the House Un-American Activities Committee. George Hall, an actor who admitted being a member of the Communist party, named Winkler along with seven others, including Winkler's husband George Keane. Hall stated that Winkler was a member of a \\"Midtown Branch\\" of the Communist party that met in New York in 1946 and 1947. Prior to Hall's testimony Winkler had not been officially mentioned in connection with HUAC or the Communist party. == Sensory Awareness and Later Career == Winkler was listed in Red Channels in 1950. Unable to continue to work in broadcasting, she went on to have a career as a sensory therapist. Following the recommendation of her psychiatrist, Clara Thompson, Winkler took classes with Charlotte Selver, a German therapist who coined the name \\"sensory awareness\\" to describe her approach. Influenced by Selver, Winkler went on to develop a successful career in sensory awareness. Winkler was known as innovator in the study of sensory awareness and taught courses privately and at the Human Relations Center of the New School of Social Research in New York City. == Radio Roles (Partial List) == * Lights Out (1935 - 1939) * Fantasies from Lights Out (1945) * Lone Journey (1940-1943, 1946-1947, 1951-1952) * Attorney at Law (1938) * Romance (1943-1944) * The O'Neills (1934- 1942) * Grand Hotel * The Chicago Theater of the Air (1940-1955) * Abie's Irish Rose (1942-1944) * Curtain Time (1945-1948) * This Life Is Mine (1943-1945) * Edgar A.

Esposito served as leader of the Kings County Democratic Committee from 1969 to 1984. As a leader, he was known as a political fixer, and honored loyalty, running a citywide patronage system involving gratuity exchanges that ultimately resulted in multiple municipal corruption scandals. Following the election of Ed Koch to the mayoralty in 1977 (an outcome facilitated by Esposito's surreptitious support, which was obscured by mutual agreement due to Koch's political origins in the postwar \\"Reform Democrat\\" movement), Esposito emerged as New York City's preeminent political leader and de facto shadow mayor, with a sphere of influence that encompassed such disparate figures as Bronx political eminences Stanley M. Friedman, Stanley Simon and Ramon S. Velez; Brooklyn Assemblymen Stanley Fink (who also served as Speaker of the New York State Assembly at the peak of Esposito's influence) and Anthony J. Genovesi; Queens Borough President Donald Manes; Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden; Brooklyn Representatives Shirley Chisholm and Fred Richmond; conservative fixer Roy Cohn; real estate developers Fred and Donald Trump; and American Mafia members Anthony Scotto and Paul Vario. Critics called him a \\"medieval king holding court with his barons by sections of the press\\". Although he ensconced himself in the tradition of urban \\"Regular Democrat\\" machine politics ‚Äî and in contrast to many of his successors ‚Äî Esposito personally identified as a political liberal, frequently speaking of his admiration for George McGovern (whom he supported at great political risk in the 1972 United States presidential election) and Eleanor Roosevelt.https://www.google.com/books/edition/Ed_Koch_and_the_Rebuilding_of_New_York_C/yRo2AAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv;=1&dq;=%22meade+esposito%22+%22george+mcgovern%22&pg;=PA1911&printsec;=frontcover He played an integral role in passing New York City's first LGBT rights bill.https://www.gaycitynews.com/lgbtq-rights-in-brooklyn-back-then/ As the apex of his power coincided with historic population declines in New York stemming from decades-long white flight, Esposito moved beyond his white ethnic base in southeastern Brooklyn to collaborate with leaders of nascent African American and Hispanic and Latino American communities throughout the borough, such as City Councilman Samuel D. Wrighthttps://www.google.com/books/edition/Brownsville_Brooklyn/DeuimfpD1BYC?hl=en&gbpv;=1&dq;=%22sam+wright%22+%22meade+esposito%22&pg;=PA255&printsec;=frontcover and his successor, Enoch H. Williams.https://www.rollcall.com/2004/09/08/owens-unhappy-last-hurrah/ By the early 1980s, several Brooklyn-based elected officials with national ambitions ‚Äî including Elizabeth Holtzman, Steve Solarz and Chuck Schumer ‚Äî had either directly repudiated or distanced themselves from Esposito's influence, although Jack Newfield and Wayne Barrett reported that Schumer met publicly with Esposito for lunch on at least one occasion.https://www.google.com/books/edition/City_for_Sale/Z34MAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv;=1&bsq;=schumerhttps://www.politico.com/states/new- york/albany/story/2010/11/steve-solarz-1940-2010-and-the-making-of-senator- schumer-067223 In 1983, investigations into his activities mounted, prompting his retirement in January 1984. Three years later, he was convicted of bribery in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, having given Bronx Representative Mario Biaggi a spa vacation in Florida. As a result of this and other scandals (including Manes' suicide and Friedman's conviction on federal corruption charges) amid the political emergence of reform-minded rivals David Dinkins and Rudy Giuliani, the Esposito machine effectively collapsed. During this period, several fledgling African American politicians also withdrew their support, precipitating the 1990 election of Clarence Norman Jr. as county chairman of what had descended into a \\"largely vestigial structure\\".https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/02/nyregion/democratic- leaders-demise-followed-his-organizations-slide.html Esposito was respected and feared for his street-style management, intimidation tactics and criminal connections. He became known for running politics similar to a junket. ==Early life== Amadeo \\"Meade\\" Esposito was born in the subsection of Ocean Hill, Brooklyn (alternatively characterized as part of Bedford-Stuyvesant or Brownsville) in 1907. He was the son of Giuseppe and Felicia Esposito. His grandfather came to America from Italy in 1885. His father followed his grandfather in 1900 and arrived in America at the age of 18. Giuseppe became a saloon owner. Meade lived with his two sisters above the saloon. Meade claimed to have been working since he was child. Esposito grew up in Brownsville (then a predominately Jewish neighborhood with smaller Irish and Italian populations) and received his nickname \\"Meade\\" during elementary school. He briefly attended Park Slope's Manual Training High School, now known as the John Jay Educational Campus, but dropped out at the age of 14. He married at the age of 18 and became a father by 19. ==Politics== After dropping out of high school, Esposito found employment at an insurance business operated by Jim Powers, a former United States Marshal and local Democratic leader. There, Esposito met Hyman Schorenstein, another Brooklyn Democratic leader who went on to secure the presidential nomination for Al Smith at the party's 1928 Democratic National Convention. Schorenstein's blunt, transactional management style would profoundly influence Esposito. At the age of 18, Esposito \\"got a couple of dozen of the guys together\\" and started the Progressive Democratic Club on Fulton Street. During the Great Depression, he worked as a beer salesman and bail bondsman. He met many of his future connections through his bondsman business. Esposito cultivated ethnic and community ties that encouraged more Italian Americans to move into politics. He launched the career of Abe Stark (who served as New York City Council President from 1954 to 1961 and Borough President of Brooklyn from 1962 to 1970) and assisted in electing longtime New York State Assembly member Alfred Lama (best known for co-founding the Mitchell-Lama Housing Program). In 1958, Esposito ran for district leader and co‚Äêleader in Canarsie with Shirley Weiner. They narrowly lost; however, Esposito's surreptitious influence continued to grow. Throughout the 1960s, Esposito personally selected many judges and politicians in Brooklyn. In 1969, he became chairman of the Kings County Democratic Committee. Robert F. Wagner Jr. called him a \\"new breed of party leader\\". Herman Badillo, a critic of Esposito, called him \\"an old-line boss\\". Esposito's connections with known Mafia members was common knowledge. He grew up with Mafia associates and bailed many of them out during his years as a bail bondsman. In 1972, during a federal investigation into the Lucchese crime family, Esposito's name was frequently mentioned in a bugged junkyard trailer used as an office by Paul Vario. Politicians traded favors and gifts with Esposito for political influence and positions. By 1983, investigations into his activities were growing. Despite claiming he would never retire, Esposito left his position as leader of the Kings County Democratic Committee in January 1984, leaving the position to incumbent Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden. Nevertheless, Esposito continued to retain tremendous \\"behind- the-scenes\\" influence in New York City politics after his retirement. In the fall of 1985, during an FBI investigation into the Genovese crime family, Esposito was heard speaking with gangster and lifelong friend Federico \\"Fritzy\\" Giovanelli. This led to a direct wiretap of Esposito's phone. Later in 1985, Esposito was recorded speaking with Bronx Rep. Mario Biaggi, claiming to have \\"made\\" 42 judges in Brooklyn. Esposito was found to be involved in bribery with Biaggi, having given him a Florida vacation in return for government assistance in a financially troubled drydock firm that owed Esposito's insurance company $280,000. Esposito was found guilty in 1988, put on probation, sentenced to community service and fined $500,000. Biaggi was sent to jail and lost his seat in Congress. In 1989, Esposito faced additional charges of bribery and tax fraud; however a federal judge determined Esposito was too sick and elderly to maintain a proper defense. ==Personal life== Esposito was known for his \\"blunt, warm and earthy\\" nature. He frequently smoked cigars and kept a baseball bat under his desk to symbolically enforce power. Donald Trump, whose family's real estate business frequently interlocked with elements of the Brooklyn Democratic machine, respected Esposito and his management style. Esposito had a daughter, Phyllis. ===Death=== Esposito was battling bladder and lung cancer. He died of a blood infection at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset on September 3, 1993. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:New York (state) Democrats Category:Politicians from Brooklyn Category:American political bosses from New York (state) Category:American people of Italian descent Category:Politicians of Italian descent Category:1907 births Category:1993 deaths Category:20th- century American politicians ","title":"Meade Esposito"},{"id":"56804560","text":"The African trident bat (Triaenops afer) is a species of bat found in Africa. ==Taxonomy and etymology== It was described as a new species in 1877 by German zoologist Wilhelm Peters.

Anushka Reddy, daughter of Telugu industrialist Krishna Kanth \\"KK\\" Reddy returns home after spending seven years in the US. Siddhant Sinha is a budding lawyer, belongs to middle-class Kayastha family from Bihar, and is the son of lawyer Prabhakar Sinha who was KK's legal advisor, right-hand man, confidante, and best friend. Siddhant and Anushka are childhood friends, who broke up seven years earlier due to misunderstandings. Siddhant's father helps KK out of any disasters in both business and personal issues. Prabhakar owes KK, who helped him 18 years ago, and also values his friendship with KK. Siddhant joins his father at the Reddys' company where Anushka has joined as the head of Human Resources. When an accident happens to KK's rival company, said company's owner, Sumit Goyal, insists it was sabotage done by KK's company, in order to win back a certain deal KK lost. Though KK's company is able to the clear the investigation, Prabhakar has a nagging theory that perhaps KK had something to do with the incident. Prabhakar dies while trying to investigate the details of the deal and the accident. Doctors confirm his death was due to sudden cardiac arrest caused by acid reflux. ===15 days later=== After Prabhakar's death, Siddhant starts to work full time for KK's son and Anushka's twin brother, Karthik and tries to mend his relationship with Anushka. As they get closer, Siddhant also starts investigating his father's death after finding a suspicious phone number from his father's mobile phone call history. The number leads him to Dinesh Swamy, Vice President of Goyal's aircraft company. He is shocked to discover that Swamy died exactly like Prabhakar shortly after Prabhakar's death. Meanwhile, Anushka's father is trying to convince her to marry. KK brings Nupur Srivastava as a prospective bride for Karthik. During Karthik's wedding preparations, KK gets impressed by Nupur's politician cousin, Vedant. KK asks Anushka to accept, but since she loves Siddhant, she does not want to. Siddhant also loves Anushka, but during investigation he was shocked to know that his father was murdered by his best friend KK by poisoning him via 25 years of KKR Corporation Book. So he decides it is best to keep Anushka out of the picture as he wants to take revenge to her father. Meanwhile, Karthik works closely with Purva, Siddhant's sister, in KK's company. Karthik starts to develop a physical attraction towards Purva but tries not to act upon it. Siddhant wishes to ruin KK and his business, therefore, he creates major misunderstandings between KK's business partners often referred to as \\"SHARK\\" and creates rifts between KK's family. Meanwhile, KK is finally seen admitting his involvement in Prabhakar's death when he is by himself. Misunderstandings increase between Siddhant and Anushka, therefore, she decides to agree to marry Vedant. Siddhant on the other hand finds out that Vedant is only marrying Anushka for money and power reasons for his career and does not love her. Siddhant decides he wants both his love and revenge, so on Anushka's engagement day, he openly declares his love for Anushka. Although he is met with disapproval, KK says that his happiness lies in Anushka and lets them get engaged. After the ceremony, Siddhant tells KK about how he knows KK is the reason behind Prabhakar's death and that he will take revenge for that. Siddhant quits his job at Reddy Corporation and decides to go solo. He finds out that Reddy Corporation has been very sexist towards women and fires every woman who gets pregnant and asks for maternity leave. Siddhant finds over 300 cases such as this and decides to represent them all in court, pro bono In order to prevent Siddhant and Anushka from marrying, KK threatens Gayatri, Siddhant's mother, to stop Siddhant from marrying Anushka. Despite his mother's reluctance and KK's planning, Siddhant and Anushka get married. As KK's initial plan fails, he decides to go to Plan B, by framing Siddhant with the murder of Hira Sanyal, H of SHARK. Siddhant and Anushka finally get married, but she learns about how Siddhant believes KK killed Prabhakar. Siddhant and Anushka decide to not move their relationship forward until Siddhant is able to prove KK guilty. Meanwhile, Karthik and Purva start to talk more and get closer. One day, Nupur sees a suspicious message on Karthik's phone, from Purva and starts to suspect them. Karthik and Nupur have an argument, in which he declares his love for Purva, and KK hears this. Purva and Karthik talk and Purva finds out the truth behind Prabhakar's death. Purva also declares her feelings for Karthik. Karthik goes to declare his love for Purva to Sinha family. Siddhant beats Karthik and Gayatri slaps Purva. Finally, Anushka learns the truth about her father.

Page moved back to England in 1901 after suffering from malaria, but returned to Africa, relocating to Fort Jameson in Northern Rhodesia in 1907 to join his sister Grace and her husband farming cotton and tobacco. Page married Elsie Harris in Salisbury in Southern Rhodesia on 4 June 1910, having met her in Long Sutton in 1902. The following year the couple created their own farm on virgin land, which was named Kapundi. They went on to have two daughters, born in 1911 and 1913.

Todd studied radio broadcasting at Columbia University before going to work for CBS Radio. Todd was forced to resign from CBS after she was subpoenaed by, and testified before, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1950. Todd died in Bath, Maine. == Education and Career == Todd attended high school in Buncombe County, North Carolina, and attended the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill from 1924 to 1927 but did not receive a degree.[1] She moved to New Orleans and worked as a bookkeeper and secretary before returning to North Carolina in 1928, when she began work as a secretary in the Department of Conversation and Development. Todd worked as a secretary n North Carolina, California, Tennessee, and Washington, D.C. from 1928 to 1938. Her secretarial and stenography work occurred alongside her involvement with the Communist Party and labor organizing efforts. Todd's radio career began in 1940 when she worked as writer at the WBT radio station in Charlotte, North Carolina,[1] eventually also working as a director and producer there. After moving to New York City in 1941, Todd studied radio broadcasting at Columbia and in June 1942 began a position at CBS radio. Todd joined the CBS production department as an assistant director.[2] Todd continued to work at CBS until 1950 and was active in the Radio Director's Guild. In 1948, Todd was nominated for an executive post with the Radio Director's Guild as a councilor-at-large and was also nominated for secretary of the Radio and Television Director's Guild in 1949.[3][4] During her career at CBS Todd worked as an assistant director for the Radie Harris program, an interview show, directed the Arthur Godfrey Show, and served as assistant director of network operations.[5] [6] She also was the producer of Joyce Jordan, Girl Interne. CBS requested and accepted Todd's resignation in 1950 due to her refusal to answer questions during her appearance before the HUAC.[7] == Politics == Todd's affiliation with the Communist Party and labor organizations began when she became acquainted with Kenneth McConnell while working at J. Walter Thompson Advertising Company Francisco in the late 1920s. Todd married McConnell, a political activist, in 1930 and they moved to Chapel Hill in 1931. McConnell was recruited into the Communist Party in 1935 and Todd joined as a member of the Communist Party sometime in the mid-1930s.[1] When McConnell was assigned to Knoxville by the Communist Party, Todd applied for a clerk position at the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). While working at the TVA, Todd recruited members for the Communist Party. Following her divorce from McConnell in 1937 and subsequent marriage to Merwin \\"Pat\\" Todd, an electrician, Todd moved to New York City in 1938 then back to North Carolina in 1940.[6] In 1940, Todd was listed as one of forty-five suspected Communist Party members employed by the TVA in a letter sent to the chair of the TVA by J. Edgar Hoover.[1] An internal TVA investigation could not confirm that Todd was a member of the Communist Party.[1] In 1950, she was identified by William Remington in his testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee After Todd invoked the Fifth Amendment, refusing to answer questions in a HUAC hearing, she ceased working for CBS on May 15, 1950. CBS described the separation as a \\"requested and accepted\\" resignation, while Todd described it as \\"my summary dismissal\\". ==References== * Purcell, Aaron (2014). White Collar Radicals.

He met Glenway Wescott who was to be friend or partner for the rest of their lives in 1919. In the 1920s Wescott and Wheeler were working in Germany and France. With an inheritance from his family, Wheeler bought a small printing press, and with Barbara Harrison, established Harrison of Paris, specializing in limited-edition books; they published in total thirteen books, including two works by Wheeler's partner, Glenway Wescott. In 1934 they moved the press to New York City. The last book published by Harrison of Paris was Hacienda by Katherine Anne Porter. Text copied from Barbara Harrison Wescott, see that page for attribution In 1935 Wheeler was employed by New York's Museum of Modern Art. He was on the Library Committee and in three years he was Director of Membership and the following year Director of Publications. In 1940 MOMA created the role of Director of Exhibitions and Wheeler was the first person to hold the post. In 1944 he became one of MOMA's Trustees and later he sat on the Executive Committee, the Exhibitions Program Committee, and also the Coordination Committee. After the war in 1948, Wheeler was leading the Exhibitions and Publications, the outreach programs and the library. For over ten years, photographer George Platt Lynes had a relationship with Wheeler and Glenway Wescott. Both Paul Cadmus, Conversation Piece (1940), then Jared French, Glenway Wescott, George Platt Lynes and Monroe Wheeler made a triptych portrait of Wheeler, Wescott and Platt Lynes. When We Were Three: The Travel Albums of George Platt Lynes, Monroe Wheeler, and Glenway Wescott, 1925-1935 was published in 1998. Another of Wheeler's lovers was Christian William Miller. When Lloyd Wescott, Glenway's brother, moved to a farm in Union Township in 1936, Wescott, Wheeler and Lynes took over one of Lloyd's farm's houses and named it Stone-Blossom. In 1959, when Lloyd Wescott acquired a farm near Rosemont in Delaware Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey, Glen Wescott moved into a stone house named \\"Haymeadows\\" on his brother's land. In 1987, Glen Wescott died of a stroke at home.

It is a privately owned Grade II* listed building. It is constructed of red brick in two storeys in a double-pile plan form with a gabled peg-tile roof with attics. The front facade has nine bays with a parapet. The central bay projects and is surmounted by a pediment. The house was built c.1720 in place of an original Elizabethan house and offers good views across the valley of the Belchamp Brook to the village of Bulmer. The interior panelling is Elizabethan or Jacobean, probably from the original building. Numerous family portraits by well-known artists decorate the walls. The surrounding parkland, significantly reduced in size since 1741, is itself Grade II listed. ==History== The estate and original house was bought from Sir John Wentworth by John Raymond in 1611. Members of the Raymond family have lived in either the previous or the present hall since then. Oliver Raymond, the son of John Raymond, lived in the previous hall in the 1600s and was Member of Parliament for Essex in the First Protectorate Parliament in 1654 and re-elected in 1656 for the Second Protectorate Parliament. Samuel J. St. Clere Raymond died at the present hall in 1900 after inheriting it 6 years previously. He was succeeded by Samuel Philip St. Clere Raymond and he by Michael Murray John Raymond, M.C.

She creates works in video, sculpture, and installation, and has played a significant role in the development and institutionalization of new media in Vancouver. == Artistic career == Wyngaarden has worked in various artist-run centres in Vancouver as a bookkeeper, editor, grant writer, administrator, photographer, fundraiser, and artist. Her video-based installations and single channel videotapes explore feminist themes, issues of gender, sexuality, technology, and the ways in which history and social conditions have complicated women's rights. She juxtaposes technological media with human subject matter to extend the interpretive possibilities of her work. Wyngaarden's work also addresses cross-dressing either overtly or subtextually, in order to deconstruct stereotypes and power relations. Employing lived experience, queer theory, and \\"forgotten\\" history and cultural mythology, her video installations also create an arena for queer representation. == Artworks  As A Wife Has A Cow === Originally installed in 1985 and remastered in 2015, the work is a video portrait of the life of a rancher named Keely Moll. Exploring her confidence and life through her perspective, this work shifts the Western gender paradigm of a man in the landscape by restituting female imagery. Her view is accompanied by a complex network of family relations, the land, labour and community; aspects that the Western Front Gallery has considered \\"facets of a life well lived.\\" === Apollo's Kiss/Matricide: An Allegorical Landscape === Originally installed in 1991 and remastered in 2015, Apollo's Kiss/Matricide: An Allegorical Landscape is a lightbox photograph taking inspiration from Aeschylus's Oresteia, spotlighting the tragic fate of Cassandra. Her representation of the female protagonist challenges the dominant male order. The market value of this work is estimated at $2,500. === Forged Subjectivity === Forged Subjectivity is an exhibition employing multiple screens, photo-transparencies, paintings, medical artifacts, and text to expose the compulsory nature of identifying and institutionalizing sexual difference, and the consequent perpetuation of gender roles. Constructing a fictional biography of a cross-dressing Member of Parliament named John White, n√©e Eliza McCormick, Wyngaarden erodes masculine and heterosexual influences in the writing of history. John White's life is used as an entry point into the examination of the omission of cross-dressed women and lesbians from collective history. === The Fragility of Origins === The Fragility of Origins is a 1994 video-based installation focusing on women's bodies in relation to art, historical practice, and other theoretical discourses. Through the combination of video, baroque painting allusions, photography, and text, Wyngaarden critiques many postmodern positions at a moment where marginalized subjects are becoming authors themselves. == Notable Exhibitions == * 1985 - As A Wife Has A Cow, Time Based Arts, The Hague & Kunstuitleen-Delft, The Netherlands. * 1986 - As A Wife Has A Cow, Luminous Sites, Vancouver, BC. * 1988 - Blurred Lines In The Vernacular, Arts Science and Technology Centre/ Or Gallery, Vancouver, BC. * 1988 - As A Wife Has A Cow, A Space, Toronto, ON. * 1989 - As A Wife Has A Cow, Kamloops Art Gallery, Kamloops, BC. * 1991 - Apollo's Kiss/Matricide: An Allegorical Landscape, UBC Fine Arts Gallery, Vancouver, BC. * 1993 - Forged Subjectivity, Presentation House, North Vancouver, BC. * 1994 - The Fragility of Origins, Western Front Society, Vancouver, BC. ==Awards== She received the VIVA Award in 1998, from the Jack and Doris Shadbolt Foundation for the Visual Arts. ==Permanent collections== Wyngaarden has work in the permanent collections of The National Gallery of Canada, The Canada Council Art Bank, 49th Parallel Gallery in New York, and The California College of Art. == References == Category:Canadian women artists Category:Canadian video artists Category:Canadian sculptors Category:Canadian installation artists Category:Artists from Vancouver Category:LGBT artists from Canada Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Cornelia Wyngaarden"},{"id":"56804765","text":"The 1999 Grote Prijs Jef Scherens was the 33rd edition of the Grote Prijs Jef Scherens cycle race and was held on 5 September 1999.

Like many similar organizations in other states, the league's goal was to secure voting rights for women. When the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1920, enabling women to vote in all states, the Equal Suffrage League dissolved and was reconstituted as Virginia League of Women Voters, associated with the national League of Women Voters. The 19th Amendment was not ratified in Virginia until 1952. Lila Meade Valentine was the first presidentBernice Colvard. 2009.

The League of Women Voters of Virginia Education Fund. and Kate Waller Barrett was vice president. Adele Goodman Clark served as the secretary for one year and headed the group's lobbying efforts in the Virginia General Assembly. Other cofounders included Nora Houston, Ellen Glasgow, and Mary Johnston. == History  Founding === The Equal Suffrage League of Virginia was formed out of a series of meetings in November 1909 at the home of the Anne Clay Crenshaw, daughter of Kentucky suffragist Mary Jane Warfield Clay. Located at 919 West Franklin Street in Richmond, the home is part of the West Franklin Street Historic District and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.National Register of Historic Places, Crenshaw House, Richmond, VA, 127-0228-0029, 2010. https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/VLR_to_transfer/PDFNoms/127-0228-0029_Crenshaw_House_2010_NR_FINAL.pdf Crenshaw House at 919 West Franklin Street in Richmond, site of the first meeting of the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia in 1909. The minutes of the first meeting on November 20 describe the attendees as \\"women interested in the formation of the Virginia Suffrage League\\" At a second meeting held one week later, officers and a board of directors were elected. Among the original eighteen founders were Lila Meade Valentine (president), Kate Waller Barrett (vice president), Adele Goodman Clark (secretary), Nora Houston, Ellen Glasgow, and Mary Johnston. In the first year, the league enrolled 120 members, mostly in Richmond. The majority of its members were socially prominent women. On January 21, 1910, the league hosted their first major public event, a guest lecture by Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. === Opposition === By 1909 when the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia was founded, the national suffrage movement had gained considerable traction. The movement lagged behind in Virginia as elsewhere in the South where both supporters and opponents sought to safeguard white dominance. Anti-suffragists argued that extending the vote to women would threaten white hegemony by giving more African Americans the right to vote while supporters of woman suffrage countered, not by condemning white supremacy, but by arguing that woman suffrage would not have a significant racial impact at the polls.Lebsock, Suzanne. \\"Women Suffrage and White Supremacy: A Virginia Case Study.\\" In Visible Women: New Essays on American Activism. Edited by Nancy A. Hewitt and Suzanne Lebsock, 62‚Äì100. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1993. === Growth === Although affiliated with the National American Woman Suffrage Association from the early days, the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia found itself struggling to catch up to the progress of the national movement. Where the NAWSA had moved on to lobbying and direct political activism, the Virginia movement had to focus on education and awareness. Effectively, the ESL was about 20 years behind the national movement, which meant the state initiative was off to a slow start. Early efforts of the group included canvassing, distributing leaflets, and public speaking events. Leaders across the state visited women‚Äôs colleges, schools, fairs, and union meetings. In Richmond, a group of businessmen were encouraged to join the effort and founded the Men‚Äôs Equal Suffrage League of Virginia. These efforts paid off in a rapidly expanding movement. By 1914, the league included 45 chapters across the state, a number that increased to 115 by 1916. In 1919, ten years after the founding, the ESL reached 30,000 members. By this time, efforts toward changes in the state constitution intensified with the ESL actively lobbying for an amendment to the state constitution that would permit women to vote. === Failure and success === Disbanded shortly after the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia was reconstituted as the Virginia League of Women Voters. Their stated purpose was to register women voters, to educate them on the issues, and to advocate for social reform. With the passage of the 19th Amendment, women in Virginia gained the right to vote, but the amendment was not ratified by the Virginia General Assembly until 1952. == Notable members == *Adele Goodman Clark *Mary Johnston *Lila Meade Valentine *Elizabeth Langhorne Lewis ==References Further reading == * Colvard, Bernice.

He has been described as \\"the heir to Mordechai Ben David\\". ==Early life== Shmiel Ber Weber was born in 1984 and grew up in a Pupa Hasidic family in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He began singing at the age of 9 although his career did not start until the release of his first album in 2007. ==Musical career== As a singer and songwriter, Weber is self-taught. His stage name, \\"Beri Weber\\", was coined by fellow singer Lipa Schmeltzer. He began singing professionally under the guidance of producer Naftali Schnitzler, and then became a member of the Shira Choir before going solo. In 2016 Weber released the album Agudah Achas which was generally well acclaimed by critics. In 2017 he produced a music video of the song \\"Rabi Shimon\\" from the album Agudah Achas in honor of Rabi Shimon bar Yochai and the festival of Lag BaOmer. Later in the same year he released a single \\"Vtaher Libeiunu\\" in advance of the festivals of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Weber's 2018 single \\"Kerestir\\" also went with the Kerestir Challenge, this calling for people to film themselves performing a section of the tune. The challenge was described by Matzav as \\"going viral\\" among the Jewish community. ==Teaching career== Weber is the rosh yeshiva of Yeshivas Kochvei Ohr, a program for boys aged 15 to 19. Located in a rural area near Monsey, New York, the yeshiva is geared for Hassidic students who have been expelled from regular yeshivas and wish to rebuild their connection to Torah and Judaism. ==Personal life== Although he was raised in a Pupa Hasidic family, in later life Weber moved away from Pupa and now identifies with the Breslov Hasidic movement. As a Breslover he travels to Uman, Ukraine, on Rosh Hashanah and leads the prayer service for several thousand worshippers. He is also a student of Rabbi Yitzchok \\"Itche\\" Meyer Morgenstern.

Friedemann-S√°nchez attended La Universidad de los Andes in Bogot√°, Colombia from 1982 to 1985. After increasing tensions due to an unnamed civil war, Friedemann-S√°nchez left Colombia and moved to the United States. She went on to received a B.F.A. degree from the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles, California (1986‚Äì94), and an M.F.A. degree from New York University (1997). She lived in New York City, New York for 21 years, and in 2011 she moved to Lincoln, Nebraska where she is currently based. ==References External links == * Podcast: Nancy Friedemann-S√°nchez on \\"In The Moment\\" with host Lori Walsh, Show 497, from January 17, 2019 * Video: Nancy Friedemann-S√°nchez's Artist‚Äôs Talk, Kentler International Drawing Space, Brooklyn, New York, from 2017 Category:Artists from New York City Category:Living people Category:1961 births Category:Artists from Lincoln, Nebraska Category:New York University alumni Category:Otis College of Art and Design alumni Category:People from Bogot√° ","title":"Nancy Friedemann-S√°nchez"},{"id":"56804867","text":"El Cid Campeador, Balboa Park ==Public art collections== * Stuart Collection ==Outdoor sculptures== Woman of Tehuantepec, Balboa Park * Bow Wave * Breaking of the Chains * Dream * El Cid Campeador * Fallen Star * Fountain of Two Oceans * Guardian of Water * Morning * Shedding the Cloak * Statue of Alonzo Horton * Statue of Benito Ju√°rez * Statue of Ernest W.

He was most notable for his service as Surgeon General of the United States Army. ==Early life== Charles Sutherland was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on May 10, 1831, the son of Mary (Read) Sutherland and Joel Barlow Sutherland. Charles Sutherland was educated at private schools in Philadelphia, and attended Jefferson Medical College. He received his M.D. degree in 1849, and became a physician. ==Start of career== In 1852, Sutherland joined the United States Army as a contracted assistant surgeon. Sutherland passed his 1853 examination for appointment in the Army, and received his commission as a first lieutenant in the Medical Corps. Sutherland served initially at Fort Monroe, Virginia and Jefferson Barracks, Missouri. After assisting to combat a cholera outbreak at Jefferson Barracks, Sutherland traveled west with the surveying party that decided upon the location for Fort Riley, Kansas and began construction of the post. Following the Fort Riley expedition, Sutherland was assigned to duty in New Mexico, and served at posts including Fort Webster, Fort Fillmore, Fort Craig, Fort Stanton, and Fort Marcy. Sutherland served in New Mexico during the period when use of the Santa Fe Trail enabled white Americans to begin settling the Southwestern United States, and he took part in military actions against the Apache and Comanche tribes of Native Americans who resisted. Sutherland was promoted to captain in 1857. Immediately prior to the American Civil War, Sutherland served at Fort Moultrie, South Carolina, followed by postings to Fort Davis and Fort Duncan in Texas. ==Civil War== At the start of the American Civil War, soldiers loyal to the Confederate States of America took over U.S. Army posts in Texas, and Sutherland narrowly escaped capture. He made his way to New York with other U.S. Army soldiers who had been stationed in Texas, and then received orders to take part in the expedition to garrison Fort Pickens on Santa Rosa Island near Pensacola, Florida. Possession of this post was important to the war effort because it demonstrated that the Union maintained a presence in the southern states while also contributing to the Union's effort to blockade the southern ports. Confederates unsuccessfully attempted to take the fort in 1861's Battle of Santa Rosa Island, an engagement in which Sutherland was a participant. In April 1862, Sutherland was promoted to major and assigned to Fort Warren, Massachusetts, where Union soldiers guarded Confederate prisoners of war. Later that year Sutherland traveled west, and was assigned as chief medical purveyor for Union Army units in and around Corinth, Mississippi. He subsequently established medical supply depots in Columbus, Kentucky and Memphis, Tennessee, followed by setting up army field hospitals in Mississippi and Tennessee, as well as a floating hospital on the Mississippi River which was used by the Army of the Tennessee during the Vicksburg Campaign. During the Siege of Vicksburg, Sutherland served on the staff of Army of the Tennessee commander Ulysses S. Grant as assistant medical director and inspector of camps and transports. He took part in the Battle of Jackson and the Battle of Champion Hill, and was commended by Grant for effective medical support and efforts to improve camp hygiene, which caused the number of illnesses and deaths from malaria, smallpox and other diseases to be lower than had been the case in previous campaigns. After the fall of Vicksburg, Sutherland was assigned as medical director for the Department of Virginia and North Carolina, with responsibility for medical support to units in the field, five rear area general hospitals. In the spring of 1864, Sutherland was appointed chief medical purveyor for the Army of the Potomac and the Army hospitals in and around Washington, DC. His assignment was later expanded to included hospitals in and around Annapolis, Maryland, and he remained in this position until the end of the war. Following the Confederate surrender, Sutherland was praised by the Secretary of War for his successful acquisition, storage, and dissemination of more than $4 million in medical supplies and equipment (over $60 million in 2018). In 1865, he received brevet promotions to lieutenant colonel and colonel in recognition of the superior service he rendered throughout the war. ==Post-Civil War== After the war, Sutherland was appointed as chief purveyor of the medical supply depot in Washington, and he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1866. He later served as chief purveyor of the New York City medical supply depot, and he remained in this position until 1876. In June 1876, Sutherland was promoted to colonel and assigned as medical director of the Division of the Pacific. He held this position until 1884, when he was assigned as medical director for the Division of the Atlantic. ==Surgeon General== Sutherland was promoted to brigadier general in December 1890 and appointed as Surgeon General of the United States Army, succeeding Jedediah Hyde Baxter. During his tenure, the Medical Department began the procedure of providing doctors instruments at the medical facilities where they worked, rather than issuing them personal equipment for which they were individually accountable. He also oversaw the organization of enlisted Medical Corps soldiers into detachments, and created the first Medical Corps school for enlisted soldiers at Fort Riley, Kansas. In 1893, Sutherland retired and was succeeded by George Miller Sternberg. ==Retirement and death== In retirement, Sutherland was a resident of Washington, DC. He died there on May 10, 1895, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Section 1, Graves 152 A-B. ==Family== Sutherland's first wife was Kate Brewer (1837‚Äì1866). In 1869, he married Elizabeth Wirt Brewer (1847‚Äì1918), the sister of his first wife. Charles and Elizabeth Sutherland were the parents of seven children. In Sutherland's 1895 obituaries, their ages were reported as ranging from nine to 24, and their names were given as Lucy, Edith, Catherine, Douglas, Roy, Malcolm, and Agnes. ==ReferencesNewspapers=== * * * ===Books=== * * ===Internet=== * Category:1831 births Category:1895 deaths Category:Military personnel from Philadelphia Category:People from Washington, D.C.

Although it is included in the Kansai dialect group, it shares much of its vocabulary with Ch≈´goku group. It can be further subdivided into the and the . ==Outline== The Bansh≈´ dialect is flanked by the Tajima, Okayama, Tanba, and Settsu dialects, the last two being closely related to the better-known Kyoto and Osaka dialects, respectively. In addition, the dialect, spoken between Kobe and Himeji, is distinct from the dialect of the prefectural capital. For this reason, Ry≈çji Kamata regards the Bansh≈´ dialect as the most representative of Hy≈çgo Prefecture, where Japanese transitions between the Kansai dialect group in the east and the Ch≈´goku group in the west. The Bansh≈´ dialect's subdivisions correspond well to the various river basins over which it is spoken. In particular, the Western Bansh≈´ dialect area comprises the Ibo River basin and the cities of Tatsuno, Aioi, Ak≈ç, and Shis≈ç and the towns of Taishi (Ibo District), Kamig≈çri (Ak≈ç District), and Say≈ç (Say≈ç) on the Chikusa River basin, and the Eastern Bansh≈´ dialect area comprises the basins of the Kako, Ichi, and Yumesaki Rivers. Although Himeji City is generally considered part the Western Bansh≈´ (geopolitical) area (see for example Harima Province#Modern usage), its subdialect is best classed with the Eastern Bansh≈´ group. Owing to the increased economic intercourse between the coastal region of the Eastern Bansh≈´ (geopolitical) area and the Osaka area, as well as the former's consequential urbanization and industrialization (see Coast of Harima Industrial Area), the coastal Eastern Bansh≈´ dialects have been influenced by the Osaka dialect. The Funasaka Pass that marks part of the boundary between Hy≈çgo and Okayama Prefectures also marks the furthest western extent of the Western Bansh≈´ dialect group, and upon crossing over the pass, one encounters the Okayama dialect of the Ch≈´goku dialect group. However, the zone of contact between the Okayama dialect and the aforementioned subdialects of the City of Ak≈ç and of the towns of Kamig≈çri and Say≈ç has some distinctive features (as a result of dialect mixture). The Bansh≈´ area is also in contact with Awaji Island across the Akashi Strait, but that island's Awaji dialect shares common features instead with such as the Kish≈´ and Awa dialects, and is quite distinct from Bansh≈´. ==Segmental phonology== :Where a gloss is given for either only Bansh≈´ dialect or standard Japanese, the other gloss is identical to the given one. Like other Kansai dialects, the Bansh≈´ dialect has a minimal length restraint of two moras for phonological words. Therefore, words that are underlyingly one mora are realized with a long vowel in isolation; for example, /ki/ (\\"tree\\") and /me/ (\\"eye\\") are pronounced [kiÀê] and [meÀê], respectively, in isolation in Bansh≈´ dialect (but cf. forms with a following particle, which is considered part of the phonological word; for example with the nominative case particle =ga: ki=ga ‚Üí [ki.ga] and me=ga ‚Üí [me.ga], with no vowel lengthening), but [ki] and [me] in standard Japanese, which lacks the minimal length constraint. In contrast, long vowels in some grammatical forms, including the volitional and the infinitive of adjectives, are shortened (the latter only for adjectives of root length at least two moras); for example, Bansh≈´ dialect has ik-o=ka (\\"go.=\\") and hay-o nar-u (\\"fast. become.\\") for standard ik-oo=ka and haya-ku nar-u, respectively (see \\"'\\" for more information on the second example, which involves a euphonic change followed by monophthongization followed by vowel shortening). Also, the western subdialects have the monophthonization /ai/ to /ee/. As in the Tanba dialect, alternations between the phonemes /d/ and /z/ are seen before all vowels. For instance, ademichi (\\"footpath between rice fields\\"), denbu (\\"all\\"), sendai (\\"garden\\"), and atsu-i=do (\\"hot.=\\") for standard azemichi, zenbu, senzai, and atsu-i=zo, respectively. There is also some alternation with these phonemes and /r/; for example, see=‚àÖ raite-ik-o (\\"Keep up the hard work!\\", lit. \\"spirit= take out.\\") for standard see=‚àÖ dasite-ik-oo (again, this example features a euphonic change in addition to the phonological change; see below). ==Prosody== : Throughout this section (including the table): H = high tone, L = low tone, F = falling tone, R=rising tone. Where accent descriptions come in pairs separated by a tilde, the one to the left is the form found in isolation and the one to the right is the form with an attached particle =ga (for nouns) or in the nonpast form (for verbs and adjectives), with the dash separating the noun from the particle or the verbal/adjectival root from the affix, respectively. For forms without a tilde-marked separation, an added particle or affix has the same tone as the last mora of the noun or verbal/adjectival root, and the noun or verbal/adjectival root's pitch contour is not affected by the addition. Descriptions separated by slashes are non-distinctive variations. { style=\\"float:right; margin:0px 0px 3px 7px;\\" + Accent systems of the Bansh≈´ dialect !rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"Accent classrowspan=\\"2\\"Example wordscolspan=\\"2\\"Keihan typecolspan=\\"3\\"Tarui type - !KobeOnoTaishiKamikawaSay≈ç - !rowspan=\\"6\\"2-mora nouns2.1ame (\\"candy\\") kama (\\"kettle\\") colspan=\\"2\\"HHcolspan=\\"3\\"LH/HH - !2.2kami (\\"paper\\") kawa (\\"river\\") colspan=\\"5\\"HL - !2.3ike (\\"pond\\") iro (\\"color\\") colspan=\\"5\\"HL - !2.4kama (\\"sickle\\") hashi (\\"chopsticks\\") LH~LL-HLHcolspan=\\"3\\"LH/HH - !2.5aaki (\\"autumn\\") ame (\\"rain\\") colspan=\\"2\\"LF~LH-Lcolspan=\\"2\\"LF~LH-L/HF~HH-LHL - !2.5bkumo (\\"spider\\") koe (\\"voice\\") colspan=\\"2\\"LF~LH-LLF~LH-L/HF~HH-Lcolspan=\\"2\\"HL - !rowspan=\\"2\\"1-mora verbsHtob- (\\"fly\\") ki-(\\"wear\\") colspan=\\"5\\"H - !Lkir- (\\"cut\\") mi- (\\"see\\") colspan=\\"2\\"R~L-Hcolspan=\\"3\\"H - !rowspan=\\"2\\"2-mora adjectivesHaka- (\\"red\\") ama- (\\"sweet\\") colspan=\\"2\\"HLcolspan=\\"3\\"LF~LH-L/HF~HH-L (elderly speakers: LF~LH-L) - !Lshiro- (\\"white\\") atsu- (\\"warm\\") colspan=\\"2\\"HLcolspan=\\"3\\"LF~LH-L/HF~HH-L (elderly speakers: HL) } The subdialects spoken in the southern and eastern parts of the Bansh≈´ (geopolitical) area, which comprises the cities of Akashi, Kakogawa, Takasago, Miki, Ono, Kasai, Nishiwaki, and Kat≈ç, the towns of Inami, Harima, Fukusaki, and Ichikawa, the city of Himeji (excepting the vicinity of the Hayashida-ch≈ç district) and the southern part of the town of Taka, use a Keihan type (wordtone and accent) pitch accent system. Among these, Himeji, Akashi, and others use a system identical to that of Kobe (see the table at right), while the accent used in the vicinity of Nishiwaki and Ono differs in that unaccented low-tone nouns (like those in class 2.4, and also usagi (\\"rabbit\\") and midoriiro (\\"green\\")) have a pitch rise between the first and second moras rather than between the penultimate and ultimate moras (so for instance, usagi and midoriiro are LLH~LLL-H and LLLLH~LLLLL-H in the Kobe-type subdialects but LHH and LHHHH in the Ono-type subdialects). The Ono-type accents represent an older form of the Keihan-type accent. On the other hand, the subdialects of the northern and western Bansh≈´ (geopolitical) area, which comprises the cities of Aioi, Ak≈ç, Shis≈ç, and Tastuno, the towns of Kamikawa, Taishi, Kamig≈çri, and Say≈ç, the vicinity of the Hayashida-ch≈ç district of Himeji, and the northern part of Taka, use the Tarui type accent system. In the Keihan system, 2-mora nouns can begin with either high tone (classes 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3) or low tone (classes 2.4, and 2.5), but this opposition has been lost in the Tarui type accent (high and low tones on the first mora are in free variation). Even within the same cities and towns, there are variations by neighborhood and age, the younger generation's speech has been influenced by the standard Japanese used in the media, so while we speak of a single \\"Tarui type\\" accent system, in fact there is great diversity within that system. 2-mora nouns of the classes 2.2 and 2.3 have merged in the Keihan type system; the notation 1/23/4/5 is used to express this. The Tarui type accent of Taishi, described in the table and also employed in areas such as Ak≈ç, Tastuno, and Aioi, would then be represented 14/23/5. This is said represent the most original Tarui type accent. The accent of Kamikawa (14/235b/5a) has split the original 2.5 class, with nouns such as aki (\\"autumn\\"), ame (\\"rain\\"), ase (\\"sweat\\"), and ayu (\\"sweetfish\\") in the 2.5a class and nounslike kumo (\\"spider\\"), koe (\\"voice\\"), saru (\\"monkey\\"), and tsuru (\\"crane\\") in the 2.5b class. Generally it is thought that the pitch contour of the 2.5a class is the original, and that the nouns of the 2.5b class diverged from it. The accent of Say≈ç (14/235), also used in places such as Shis≈ç, differs from the others by the presence of a high tone on the first mora of class 2.5a and 2.5b nouns; this accent system is also used in the non-Bansh≈´ dialects of the cities of Tanba in Hy≈çgo Prefecture and Fukuchiyama in Kyoto Prefecture, as well as that of the Ikuno-ch≈ç neighborhood of the city of Asago. The Kamikawa subdialect is believed to be in the process of abandoning its own system in favor of the 14/235 system as well. Especially among young people in the 14/235 region, a trend towards a high tone on the first mora of class 2.4 nouns is seen, perhaps due to influence from the accent system of Standard Japanese. That is to say, these regions are in the process of adopting the system of the (non- Bansh≈´) dialect of the Asago-ch≈ç neighborhood of Asago City (1/2345). Young people even in other (non-Bansh≈´) regions where the Tarui type accent is used are being influenced by the accent system of the standard language, and as a result the number of people in those areas who do not follow the patterns of the chart is increasing. In regions using the Keihan system, there is a distinction made between 1-mora H- and L-verbs, as shown in the chart. Tarui type regions lack this distinction, pronouncing both classes the same (with the sole exception of the verb or- (\\"exist-\\"), which is F~H-L in both areas). In the Keihan type regions, the pitch contour of 2-mora adjectives is the same as in places like Kyoto, namely HL. Tarui type regions, on the other hand, have the same pitch contour for such adjectives as in the Tajima and Okayama dialects, with either LH~LH-L or HH~HH-L in free variation. Elderly speakers of the Western Bansh≈´ dialect still preserve the distinction between H- (LF~LH-L) and L-adjectives (HL). In recent years, that distinction is in decline, with their merger into LF~LH-L that started among young people steadily becoming mainstream. ==Grammar== :Where a gloss is given for either only Bansh≈´ dialect or standard Japanese, the other gloss is identical to the given one. ===Conjugation=== There is a tendency, especially prominent with upper monograde verbs like mi- (\\"see\\") and 2-mora lower monograde verbs like uke- (\\"receive\\"), for verbs of the monograde class to be conjugated using the quadrigrade pattern; some speakers have fully migrated all monograde verbs to the quadrigrade class: * der-e der-e=‚àÖ yu-u=n=des-u=kedo, nakanaka dera- na-i=n=des-u (\\"No matter how many times [I] said 'Come out, come out!', [he] didn't,\\" lit. \\"come out. come out.= say.===, by no means come out.==\\") for standard de-ro de-ro=to yu-u=n=des-u=kedo, nakanaka de-na-i=n=des-u * motto naka=i tsumer-i=i (\\"Squeeze in tighter!\\", lit. \\"some more inside= cram.=\\") for standard motto naka=e tsume-te (lit. \\"some more inside= cram.\\") (in the Bansh≈´ form, the construction + =i, a light command form usually reserved for monograde verbs and broadly equivalent to the standard use of the gerund in the same way, is used for tsumer-, a quadrigrade verb, reflecting its origin in the mongrade verb tsume-, seen in the standard example) * ota-hen=ka. kato-o=ni kukutt-oka-na ots-u=zoo (\\"Do [you] mean [that] to fall [off]? [Because] if [you] don't fasten [it] tightly, [it] will!\\", lit. fall.=. tight.= fasten.do in advance fall.=) for standard ochi=ya shi-na-i=ka. kata-ku kukutt-oka-na-i=to ochi-ru=zo (lit. \\"fall. do.=. tight. fasten.do in advance.= fall.=\\") The -ba ending of the provisional form fuses with the realis stem, with the final -e of that stem being deleted and the initial -b- of the provisional ending either changing to a palatal glide, as in ik-ya (\\"go.\\") and yoker-ya (\\"good.\\") for standard ike-ba and yokere-ba, respectively, or disappearing entirely, as in ik-a and yoker-a. However, in the modern Eastern Bansh≈´ dialect, the conditional form + -tara is often used in place of the provisional: * yom-a yom-e-n=koto na-i (\\"[You] ought to be able to read [that] if [you] try,\\" lit. \\"read. read.= exist-\\") for standard yome-ba yom-e- na-i=koto=mo na-i (lit. \\"read. read.== exist-\\") A merger of the conclusive and adnominal for adjectival nouns is also heard: * honma=ni tassha=na=naa (\\"[You]'re really in good health, huh?\\", lit. \\"truth= healthy==\\") for standard hontoo=ni tassha=da=ne (lit. \\"truth= healthy==\\") == Grammatical aspect=Copula and sentence-final particles=Other aspects of grammar=Representative expressionsVocabulary=Grammar=Model sentencesWell-known speakersReferencesNotesSee also== *Dialects spoken adjacently: **Kansai dialect group - Kobe dialect, Tanba dialect, Awaji dialect **Ch≈´goku dialect group - Tajima dialect, Okayama dialect ==External links== *What's Bansh≈´ dialect? - A series of articles from the Kobe Shimbun *Bansh≈´ Dialect Research Society - Official blog of the organization, whose purpose is to preserve the dialect for posterity Category:Hy≈çgo Prefecture Category:Japanese dialects ","title":"Bansh≈´ dialect"},{"id":"56804947","text":"The list of shipwrecks in December 1841 includes ships sunk, foundered, wrecked, grounded, or otherwise lost during December 1841. ==1 December2 December3 December4 December5 December6 December7 December8 December9 December10 December11 December12 December13 December14 December15 December16 December17 December18 December19 December20 December21 December22 December23 December24 December25 December26 December27 December29 December30 December31 DecemberUnknown dateReferences== 1841-11 Category:December 1841 events ","title":"List of shipwrecks in December 1841"},{"id":"56804991","text":"Monster Beach is an Australian television film created by Bruce Kane, Maurice Argiro (who also created Kitty Is Not a Cat) and Patrick Crawley, which premiered on Cartoon Network on 31 October 2014.

Her work has been exhibited in Canada, the United States, and Sweden. == Background == Eleeshushe and her husband, the sculptor and printmaker Parr (1893-1969), lived a traditional nomadic lifestyle with their nine children, both biological and adopted. The couple settled in Cape Dorset Northwest Territories (now Nunavut), Canada in 1961, after her aging spouse suffered declining health and fell victim to frostbite, resulting in partial amputation of his right foot. Eleeshushe's children Nuna (b. 1949), Eepervik, and Quvianatuliak Parr (b. 1930) are also artists in Cape Dorset. Parr's grandson, Peter Parr (b. 1970), is also an artist. == Artistic career == Eleeshushe began drawing during the formative years of Cape Dorset's printmaking. One of the more prolific Inuit artists she left over 1,000 prints in the archives of the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative. Her drawings were included in the annual Cape Dorset Graphics Collection from 1966 to 1969. In 1970, the WBEC changed the name of its annual 'graphics' collection to 'print' collection. This 83 print collection, the 11th, was the last collection for Eleeshushe Parr. The collection opened on October 31 at 50 galleries, with the official opening at the Quest in Victoria, British Columbia. Eleeshushe also occasionally made carvings, and was recognized by her community for her designs and her ability to sew traditional skin garments with inset patterns. Prints, such as \\"Boy Playing With Dogs\\" (1966), demonstrate Eleeshushe's typical depictions of animals, Inuit people and elements of life in Northern Canada. In this specific work, a young Inuk boy plays with dogs, simulating a hunting scene where the dogs represent game and the boy is about to harpoon. The imitation of hunters is an important element in the education of boys. The stencilled drawing has soft shapes of little detail except for the boy's and animal's eyes, mouth and nose. == Exhibitions == * 1993 - \\"Strange Scenes: Early Cape Dorset Drawings,\\" McMichael Canadian Art Collection, Kleinburg, Ontario * 1989 - \\"Inuit Graphic Art from Indian & Northern Affairs Canada,\\" Winnipeg Art Gallery, Winnipeg, Manitoba * 1985 - \\"Alaska Eskimo Dolls/Inuit Prints, Provincial Museum of Alberta,\\" Edmonton, AlbertaEleeshushe Parr * 1983-85 - \\"Grasp Tight the Old Ways: Selections from the Klamer Family Collection of Inuit Art,\\" Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, Ontario == Collections == * Winnipeg Art Gallery * Art Gallery of Ontario * McMichael Canadian Art Collection * Cape Dorset Print Collection == References  Further reading == * Duval, Paul and McMichael Canadian Collection.

Her primary themes include the power of nature, femininity, and migration, which have been subjects of many of her shows. She frequently utilizes natural elements, often recycled waste materials and primarily organic ones, in her installations. One of her best-known works is \\"Paisajes\\" in which she camouflages herself and uses her own figure as a canvas for body painting. == Education and Career == Born in Lima, Paredes has lived outside of Peru since her youth. She studied Plastic Arts in the Universidad Cat√≥lica de Lima, in the Cambridge Arts and Crafts School in England and the Scuola del Nudo of the Academy of Fine Art in Rome. She completed residencies at the University of Pennsylvania and the Banff Centre of Canada. During the 1970s, as a student in Lima, Paredes engaged in intense political activism which caused her to be exiled from Peru, along with her husband. She lived in Mexico for 5 years and in Costa Rica for almost 25 years. She currently lives and works in San Jos√©, Costa Rica and in the United States, in Philadelphia,. Collectively she has shown her works in various biannual shows such as the Havana Biennial, Venice Biennale or the Bienal de Arquitectura de Canarias. She has been an invited international artist in the Feria FIA de Caracas in 2008. Her works have been exhibited in places such as the Tabacalera Promoci√≥n del Arte (Madrid, 2015), the Hermitage Museum, the Vladimir Palace (Russia, 2013) and the Museo de la Fotograf√≠a (Colombia, 2013). == Work == Paredes herself is often the central subject not only of her performances but also of her photographs and art, and yet, frequently she is not recognized and appears hidden among the natural materials that she uses, or appears blended and transformed into folds of fabric. In her photographs Paredes camouflages herself as animals or mythological beings, often surrounded by backgrounds of ornamental flowers. She is primarily known for her permanent photo series \\"Paisajes\\" in which she explores the juxtaposition of her body with patterns and the surfaces beneath it. These photographs are composed by way of the selection of a structured background, such as a paper floral tapestry, and her intricate painting of her body so that it matches. The inevitable outlines of her form for the most part encircle her and manifest themselves, depending upon the angle of the camera. In some cases, only a shock of dark hair reveals that a person is in the photograph. Reviews of her shows have stated that Paredes intentionally puts the viewer off-balance by \\"erasing the line between body and background, throwing what‚Äôs real into question in both the artist and her backdrop, and Paredes rips off the stable ground beneath her viewers‚Äô feet\\". Mar√≠a Jos√© Monge, Curator of Visual Arts of the Museo of the Banco Central of Costa Rica, explains that during the time that Paredes lived in Costa Rica she began the precedent of the developing object works and installations, using natural resources as primary source material and in the use of the body itself as a reference and expressive medium. (\\"En el per√≠odo que Cecilia vivi√≥ en Costa Rica sent√≥ precedentes en el desarrollo de obras objetuales e instalaciones, en el empleo de recursos naturales como materia prima y en el uso del cuerpo propio como referente y medio expresivo‚Äù) As themes of migration and displacement dominate her work, along with the use of natural elements, when asked about the impact of physical location on her art, Paredes replies that: \\"...Costa Rica, for example, gives you exuberant nature, whereas Peru gives you the highlands as a predominant image so you have to attend to those influences. Pennsylvania gives me wonderful forests, for example. It‚Äôs one of the most serene and beautiful places I have been to and I‚Äôm very attached to it.\\" Among her artistic influences are Remedios Varo and Leonora Carrington who Paredes refers to as \\"sus madres\\" (\\"her mothers\\"). She explains that \\"They opened the door to show me that everything is possible, everything is makeable.\\" (Ellas -explica- me abrieron la puerta para decirme que todo es posible, todo es factible). She also recognizes in her work the influence of Kiki Smith, Louise Bourgeois, William Kentridge and Anselm Kiefer. One of Paredes' photographs has been used as cover art for a reprint of the Brian Moore novel Judith Hearn, which was later republished and produced as a stage play and film \\"The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearn\\". Paredes' works served as the inspiration for Argentinean actress and singer M√≠a Maestro in her 2014 music video \\"Blue Eyed Sailor\\", directed by Guillermo Navarro and Juan Azulay. == Personal life == Paredes is married to the composer and University of Pennsylvania professor Jay Reise. She has collaborated with him, incorporating video into live musical performances, such as The Gift to Urashima Taro. == Recent exhibits == * 2016 \\"El perpetuo Errante\\", Museo Banco Central, Costa Rica * 2015 Tabacalera Promoci√≥n de Arte, Madrid, Espa√±a. * Bienal de La Habana 2015.

She lives and works in Montr√©al, Quebec. == Life and education == Bischoff received a Fine Art Diploma in 2012 from McEwan University, Alberta, Canada. She holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Visual Art from Emily Carr University of Art + Design, where she was named valedictorian of her 2015 undergraduate class. She is currently pursuing a Master of Fine Arts at Concordia University in the department of Intermedia (Video, Performance, and Electronic Arts). == Work == Bischoff's artistic practice, primarily in performance, video, and text, responds to the complexities of female sexuality and is influenced by her research engaging with archives. Bischoff's archival research led to the Rereading Room, an exhibition of the Vancouver Women's Bookstore's inaugural 1973 catalogue. The Rereading Room initially was at exhibited at 221A in 2016-17 and, in 2018, was included in the Beginning with the Seventies: GLUT at the Morris and Helen Belkin Gallery. Also in 2018, Bischoff participated in the group exhibition SOOT, emerging from her publication of the same name. SOOT is a recount of Bischoff's experiences having been employed at a retail sex shop in Vancouver. In 2017, Decoy Magazine published Happenstance, a series of temporary artworks by eleven artists including Bischoff, who worked in public spaces in the city of Vancouver. For this project, Bischoff explored the senses as her main theme for her work thrum. She performed her piece by walking across and interacting with the Granville Bridge in a time-based performance. Bischoff has been critical of Wikipedia's gender imbalance and has worked with the Morris and Helen Belkin Gallery to address it through their annual Art+Feminism Wikipedia Edit-a-thon. == Major works == Alexandra Bischoff, Rereading Room: The Vancouver Women's Bookstore (1973-1996), 2016-18, texts chosen from the 1973 Vancouver Women's Bookstore catalogue.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. ==Description and history== Spring Valley Township Bridge No. E-31 is located in a rural setting of southwestern Turner County, on 447th Avenue between 290th and 291st Streets, about west of Viborg. It is a three-arch stone structure, built out of native granite and quartzite, mostly of rubblestone with shaped voussoirs. Each arch spans about and rises about . The spandrel walls rise to form low parapets on the sides, topped with concrete coping and extended to flared wing walls. One of the central piers has had its base reinforced by concrete blocks. This bridge is one of 180 stone arch bridges built in Turner County as part of New Deal-era federal jobs programs. The county administration was able to build stone bridges at a lower cost than then-conventional steel beam bridges because of the availability of experienced stone workers, and the federal subsidy to the wages they were paid. The county was responsible for supervising the work crews and providing the building materials. This bridge was built in 1938 by a county crew to a standardized state design. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Turner County, South Dakota *List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in South Dakota ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Turner County, South Dakota Category:Bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in South Dakota Category:Bridges completed in 1938 Category:Transportation in Turner County, South Dakota ","title":"Spring Valley Township Bridge No. E-31"},{"id":"56805151","text":"Jodl is a surname.

Cork to William Edward Ashley Cummins (1858‚Äì1923), professor of medicine at University College Cork, and Jane Constable Cummins (n√©e Hall). They had five daughters and six sons. Geraldine Cummins was a playwright. Jane Cummins was a squadron officer in the WRAF during the World War II and became a medical doctor. Mary Hearn was a gynaecologist and fellow of the RCPI. Two of her brothers also became doctors; one, N. Marshall Cummins, was involved in setting up the first blood transfusion service in Cork. ==Education== Cummins began to study in UCC in 1912. At that time there were 78 women students out of the 420 students enrolled. She graduated with an engineering degree in 1915. During her time in engineering Cummins was editor of the Journal of the Engineering Society While she was in college, Cummins was on the Ireland hockey team. She earned her first ‚Äòcap‚Äô for hockey in 1914 and lead the college hockey team to victory in the Munster cup. The Irish hockey team toured the US in 1925 with Cummins as the captain. With the team she went to the White House at the invitation of Calvin Coolidge. ==Work== Cummins worked for the Royal Arsenal with the munitions factory at Woolwich, London and then the Vickers factory at nearby Erith as well as in a shipyard in Scotland during the First World War between 1915 and 1916 before returning to Cork. Initially there she found it hard to find work. In 1924 she founded a private practice in the city and worked there until 1927 at which time she was appointed to the Irish Land Commission in Dublin. She moved to Dublin and although she visited, she never returned to live in Cork. She retired from the Land Commission in 1954. In 1927 Cummins became the first woman member of the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland. She was a Council member of the Women's Engineering Society having joined at the organisation's inception. In December 1919, Cummins wrote an encouraging article in the very first edition of the society's The Woman Engineer journal. Based on her own Irish university experience, it laid out the practicalities of studies as well as social interactions likely to be encountered by a woman thinking of training as a civil engineer. The following year, she had another article published, this time in the Practical Engineer magazine, entitled \\"The Suitability of Women for the Engineering Industries\\" Twenty years later, in 1940, she wrote a lively piece on Women Engineers Overseas - in Eire for The Woman Engineer journal on her experiences as one of the earliest women engineers in Ireland. In this article, she recounted a tale of encountering the \\"oldest Inhabitant\\" of a very rural area, a proud owner of two fine horses, who on discovering \\"you must be an engineer, so would ye mind mending the electric light in the mare's stable?\\" ==Death== She died 30 April 1968 in Dublin == Further reading == * Photo of Iris Cummins Engineer * Burke, IFR (1976), 308 * Engineer's Journal, Sept./Oct. 1985, 57 * Margaret √ì h√ìgartaigh, ‚ÄòWomen engineers in early 20th century Ireland‚Äô, Engineer's Journal, Dec. 2003, 48‚Äì9 ==References== Category:1894 births Category:1968 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Cork (city) Category:20th-century Irish engineers Category:20th-century women engineers Category:Irish women engineers Category:Women engineers Category:Members of the Women's Engineering Society Category:Women's Engineering Society Category:Engineers Category:Irish engineers ","title":"Iris Cummins"},{"id":"56805375","text":"The 2009-10 season was the Manitoba Junior Hockey League's (MJHL) 93rd season of operation.

It was composed in 1952. == Composition == After working on his Imaginary Landscape No. 4 (March No. 2) and his Music of Changes, Cage's first two works to feature utter indeterminacy, Cage started working with Morton Feldman on graphical scores, which was fairly avant-garde at the time. Fascinated by the idea of detaching himself from the music he was making, he decided to write a piece that used the system in No. 4, but with recorded music rather than radio broadcasting. This piece was a part of Cage's two contributions to a project entitled Project for Music for Magnetic Tape, the other one being Williams Mix, composed in a similar fashion and also presented on graphic paper. However, the piece was to be realized as a tape recording, and not to be broadcast. With the help of long-time collaborator David Tudor and the technical assistance from Bebe and Louis Barron, Cage realized the composition on January 18, 1952. Cage used mostly jazz recordings to make this piece, which called for 42 recordings, presented as disposed in the score. This work became the basis of a dance piece, entitled Portrait of a Lady, which premiered in New York in 1952 by Jean Erdman. The score was eventually published by Edition Peters. == Structure == This piece consist of only one movement and the average duration varies widely from recording to recording. It is scored for 42 recordings disposed in eight tracks in a mixing studio, all of them being re-recorded into tape as disposed in the score. The score itself is a block- grid, wherein each square is meant to be three inches of recording (around 0.2 seconds). The score also indicates the changes in dynamics and includes crescendos and diminuendos. Whereas duration and amplitude are specified in the score, there is no mention from Cage as to what recordings or what type of music should be used for performing the piece. The compositional method was use of the I Ching, creating a chart work with a five to five structure, as in Imaginary Landscape No. 4 (March No. 2). == Recordings == The following is an incomplete list of recordings of Imaginary Landscape No. 5: * Peter Pfister realized the piece using jazz recordings by Anthony Braxton. The recording took place between May 28 and June 1, 1995 and was released by Hat Hut. * Vidolin Alvise also recorded this piece in 2009. The recording was later released in 2012 by Stradivarius. * Michael Barnhart also realized this piece in 2011 using pieces by Cage. It was recorded and released by Mode Records both on CD and DVD. == Footnotes  References  External links == * Manuscript of the piece by John Cage.

The hotel complex also houses a United Property Development Company (UPDC) mixed use development project, The Residences and the Festival Mall. Golden Tulip Hotel complex has evolved from its initial structure as apartment complexes built for second republic legislators and the Arewa Hotels managed Durbar Hotel into its present mixed use state. ==History== The initial complex was constructed by the Nigerian government to house members of the National Assembly until they moved to their residences at 1004 estate. Thereafter, the complex was turned into Durbar Hotel, Lagos, a top of the line hotel with 520 rooms that was one of the largest hotels in West Africa at the time it was commissioned in 1982. The hotel was managed by Arewa Hotels who were managing both Hamdala and Durbar hotels in Kaduna. ==RedevelopmentGolden Tulip Festac=== Durbar Hotel was redeveloped by investors as Golden Tulip Festac. It is the first hotel managed in Nigeria by the Golden Tulip Group. The hotel is set up to differentiate itself from competitors with the creation of a tropical garden. But the hotel is also known for its conference halls. It has 14 conference and meeting rooms. ===The Residences=== In 2016, United Property Development Company opened The Residences, a residential development on eight floors and consisting of 192 units. The intention of the developers is to construct an independent power plant that will ensure electricity supply to the residents. ===Festival mall=== Developed by UPDC, festival mall is a retail complex with Shoprite as the anchor. The redevelopment project was conceived as an entertainment and retail outlet for residents within the Amuwo-Odofin and Satellite Town, Lagos areas of Lagos. The mall has 46 stores occupying a space of 10,071 square meters. It is very close to diamond estate, which is along Festac extension.

After opening the private bank, he allowed customers to deposit money and then loaned it out. In 1808, Prime brought in Samuel Ward III as a partner and the firm was renamed Prime & Ward. In 1816, Joseph Sands, Prime's brother-in-law, was made a partner and the firm became Prime, Ward & Sands. In 1823, Prime met with and, eventually, invited James Gore King became a partner upon his return from England. King, a son of U.S. Senator Rufus King, had previously been affiliated with the firm of King & Gracie, founded in 1818 in Liverpool, England by King and his brother-in- law, Archibald Gracie, Jr. (the son of Archibald Gracie). King wound up the affairs of the house in England, returned to New York and became a partner of the house of Prime, Ward, Sands, King & Company on May 1, 1824, which at the time consisted of Nathaniel Prime, Samuel Ward, Joseph Sands, James G. King and Robert Ray (Prime's son-in-law). In 1826, after Joseph died the firm was again reorganized as Prime, Ward & King with the previous partners and including Edward Prime, Prime's son. In 1832, Prime retired and was replaced as a co-partner in the firm by his son, Edward. In 1839, Ward died and was replaced by his son Samuel Cutler Ward, who had joined the firm the previous year. In 1844, King's son Archibald Gracie King joined the firm which already included Denning Duer, the son of William Alexander Duer and the elders King's son-in-law. In 1846, King and his family left the firm and started James G. King & Son, which he operated until his death in 1853. The firm stunned the financial world when it collapsed in September 1847, which some claim was caused by the younger Ward's \\"excessive speculation in commodities\\" and caused the bankruptcy of the Ward family. ===Services=== Among their biggest clients was Baring Brothers, a British merchant bank based in London that was the world's second oldest merchant bank founded in 1762 and owned by the German- originated Baring family of merchants and bankers. In 1823, Baring bought Erie Canal bonds through the firm, causing other international investors to do the same. The success of the Canal bonds caused the firm to take the lead in financing American expansion out west. After the financial crisis of 1836 to 1837, the Bank of England in an effort to assist New York City banks in resuming specie payment, confided a loan of almost 5 million dollars of gold to the firm which was considered a remarkable sign of confidence. ==Timeline== The firm was known by various names throughout its existence, including: * Nathaniel Prime, Stock and Commission Broker (1796‚Äì1808) * Prime & Ward (1808‚Äì1816) * Prime, Ward & Sands (1817‚Äì1825) * Prime, Ward, Sands, King & Company (1825‚Äì1826) * Prime, Ward & King (1826‚Äì1846) * Prime, Ward & Company (1847) * James G.

Her work ranges from site-specific installations (1981-1995), found-objects, drawings, and paintings, with focuses on art history, museology, botany, and feminism. She has exhibited extensively in Montreal, Quebec, and New York City, New York, and across Canada. She now lives and works in Mansonville, Quebec. == Early Work == Lapointe studied art history and visual arts at the Old Montreal and Rosemont colleges, and in 1978 attained a Bachelor of Fine Art at Carleton University of Ottawa. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Lapointe lived and worked in Montreal with collaborative partner Martha Fleming. The two were together from 1981-1995. === Collaboration with Martha Fleming (1981-1995) === Lapointe and Fleming‚Äôs collaborations were rooted in the politics of radical feminism, marginalization, and museum practices. Their works combined the inquiry of site-specific histories, art historical references, female sexuality and desire, and botany, in order to critically analyze systemic social politics. The two ended their relationship in 1995. Site-Specific Installation From 1981-1995 Lapointe and Fleming executed several site-specific installations in politically charged architectural and abandoned buildings across Montreal, Qu√®bec, New York City, New York, and Sao Paulo, Brazil. Addressing systemic marginalization with museum and gallery practices in a feminist lens, these installations engage the complex social issues historically embedded at such sites. (such sites include: Casa Yaya, home of 1887 Dona Sebastiana de Mello Freire; These The Pearls, London; Duda, The Library in Emir Mohammed Park, Madrid; La Donna Deliquenta, Vaudeville Theatre, Montreal). Studiolo In 1997, The Musee d‚ÄôArt Contemporain exhibited a retrospective for Lapointe and Fleming titled, \\"Studiolo\\". The exhibit marked their 15-year collaboration, showcasing the years of the polemic research and creative processes that they shared. Complementary to the retrospective was a publication, also titled \\"Studiolo\\", which represented the political and philosophical frameworks from which they worked. The exhibit was subsequently exhibited at the Art Gallery of Windsor in 1998, invited by curator (at the time) Helga Pakasaar. Other Collaborative work includes: * La Mus√©e de Science, Montreal, Qu√©bec (1984) * Eat Me/Love Me/Feed Me, New York City, New York (1989) * La Salpetri√®re, (re-exhibited at Susan Hobbs Gallery 1995) * HANGING, from the Mus√®e de Science, and antique book covers displayed at the Book Museum in Bath, England, displayed at Susan Hobbs Gallery (1995) * D√©j√† Voodoo, Montreal, Qu√©bec, 1996 == Later Work (1995-present) == La Perle, Carlton University In 2007, the Carlton University Art Gallery held a solo exhibition for Lapointe titled, La Perle. The exhibit engaged Lapointe‚Äôs interest of sound, optics, and museum history, with 23 individual works of painting, drawings, and found-objects. The installation of works, drawn from images of botany, medical, art-historical sources and encyclopedias, were intended to challenge practices of museology and methods of display. Selected Works: La Pierre Patiente In 2011, the Pierre-Francois Oulette Art Contemporain exhibited 7 selected paintings from Lapointe‚Äôs series La Pierre Patiente (The Patient Stone). Lapointe used acupuncture needles, formally intended to reestablish a human internal balance of energy, to address the tension between humans‚Äô link to the environment and other species. These works were painted on glass with phosphorescent pigments (a technique seen in earlier works), to suggest the shift between light and darkness, and the fragility of memory and disembodiment. Further Exhibitions Include: * Lyne Lapointe, Susan Hobbs Gallery (2003) * Musee d‚ÄôArt Contemporain exhibited a survey of Lapointe‚Äôs work, Montreal, Quebec, 2002 * La Clef, SBC Gallery of Contemporary Art, 2008 * Cabinet, Mus√©e d'art de Joliette, Quebec (2011); Sporobole, Sherbrooke, Quebec (2010) Awards and Collections: Lapointe has been an awarded recipient from, among others, the Conseil des Art et des Lettres du Quebec (1983), the Pollock Krasner Foundation, New York (1997), the Prix Graff (1998), and the Canada Council for the Arts (2008). Her work is collected in major Canadian art institutes. She is represented by Roger Bellemare/Christian Lambert Gallery in Montreal, and has artworks at the Jack Shainman Gallery in New York City, New York. == References == Category:1957 births Category:20th- century Canadian artists Category:21st-century Canadian artists Category:Living people ","title":"Lyne Lapointe"},{"id":"56805486","text":"Vulvar tumors are those neoplasms of the vulva. Vulvar and vaginal neoplasms make up a small percentage (3%) of female genital cancers. They can be benign or malignant (vulvar cancer).There are four main groups of vaginal neoplasms: benign neoplasms, in situ neoplasms, malignant neoplasms, and neoplasms of uncertain or unknown behavior. Malignant neoplasms are also simply known as cancers.Tumor (American English) or tumour (British English), Latin for swelling, one of the cardinal signs of inflammation, originally meant any form of swelling, neoplastic or not. Current English, however, both medical and non-medical, uses tumor as a synonym for a neoplasm (a solid or fluid-filled cystic lesion that may or may not be formed by an abnormal growth of neoplastic cells) that appears enlarged in size.Some neoplasms do not form a tumor; these include leukemia and most forms of carcinoma in situ. Tumor is also not synonymous with cancer. While cancer is by definition malignant, a tumor can be benign, precancerous, or malignant. Vulvar neoplasms are divided into cystic or solid lesions and other mixed types. Vulvar cancers are those malignant neoplasms that originate from vulvar epithelium, while vulvar sarcomas develop from non-epithelial cells such as bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, blood vessels, or other connective or supportive tissue. Epithelial and mesenchymal tissue are the origin of vulvar tumors. Malignant vulvar neoplasms makes up 6% of all reproductive organ cancer and 0.7% of the total cancers in women in the United States. One out of every 333 women will develop vulvar cancer. In the United States, vulvar cancer accounts for nearly 6% of cancers of the female reproductive organs and 0.7% of all cancers in women. In 2018, there will be 6,190 women diagnosed with cancer of the vulva with 1,200 women dying from it. Malignant vulvar tumors can develop in the inner edges of the labia majora, labia minora, clitoris or in the Bartholin glands. Research in preventing vulvar cancers includes investigations into the use of oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, drug treatments, surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and lymph node mapping. == Epithelial neoplasms  Squamous tumors precursors === * Squamous cell carcinoma not otherwise specified * Basal cell carcinoma * Squamous intraepithelial neoplasia * Benign squamous lesions === Glandular Tumors === *Paget disease *Bartholin gland Tumors: carcinomas, adenoma and adenomyoma *Tumor arising from specialized ano-genital mammary-like glands *Adenocarcinoma of Shene gland origin *Adenocarcinoma of other types *Adenoma of minor vestibular glands *Mixed Tumors of the vulva *Tumors of skin appendage origin === Soft tissue Tumors === *Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (sarcoma botryoides) *Leiomyosarcoma *Fibrous histiocytoma *Proximal epithelioid sarcoma *Alveolar soft part sarcoma *Liposarcoma *Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans *Deep angiomyxoma *Superficial angiomyxoma *Angiomyofibroblastoma *Cellular angiofibroma *Leiomyoma *Granular cell Tumor === Melanocytic Tumors === * Malignant melanoma * Congenital melanocytic naevus * Acquired melanocytic naevus * Blue naevus * Atypical melanocytic naevus of genital type * Dysplastic melanocytic naevus ===Other=== * Yolk sac Tumor * Merkel cell Tumor * Peripheral primitive neuroectodermal Tumor/Ewing sarcoma === Haematopoietic and lymphoid Tumors === * Malignant lymphoma * Leukemiahttps://www.iarc.fr/en/publications/pdfs-online/pat- gen/bb4/bb4-chap7.pdf === Secondary tumors = Benign cystic lesions === * Bartholin duct cysts and abscesses * Skene duct cyst * Mucinous cyst * Ciliated cyst * Gartner duct cyst * Cyst of the Canal of Nuck * Perineal hernia  Solid lesions  * Epithelial lesions * Acrochordons, fibroepithelial polyps * Nevus * Seborrheic keratosis * Adenosis * Syringoma * Hidradenoma papilliferum * Anogential mammary-like glands  Mesenchymal and other subcutaneious lesions  * Endometriosis * Hemangioma * Fibroma * Lipoma * Granular cell tumor * Leiomyoma * Angiomyofibroblastoma * Aggressive andiomyxoma * Teratoma * Osteochondroma * Neurofibroma * Schwannoma * Perineal nodular induration * Epidermal inclusion cyst == See also == * Urethral caruncle * Vaginal cysts * Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia ==References Category:Neoplasms ","title":"Vulvar tumors"},{"id":"56805554","text":"Allison Hrabluik is a visual artist based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

In 1908 and 1909 he continued his studies in Basel and G√∂ttingen. He went on to teach in Rome, Messina, G√∂ttingen and Florence, where he became full professor of Greek literature in 1924, before occupying the chair of Greek and that of Latin literature. In 1925 he signed the Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals. From 1931 onwards he also taught at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa. He received various honours, including an honorary degree from the University of G√∂ttingen (1937) and being elected to the Royal Academy of Italy (1942). == Contribution to textual criticism == Pasquali's greatest claim to fame is the book Storia della tradizione e critica del testo (History of the tradition and textual criticism). It was born as a reaction to Textkritik by Paul Maas, of which Pasquali first wrote a long review that appeared in several instalments in the journal Gnomon. His book, which came out in 1934, complements the work of Maas rather than refuting it. A thoroughly revised second edition appeared in 1952, the year of Pasquali's death. The book has not been translated into English. The book makes several major contributions to textual criticism, and especially to its sub-field of stemmatics. Pasquali concentrates on ancient Greek and Latin texts, which we know mostly through manuscript copies written in the Middle Ages or the Renaissance. Before him, scholars had concentrated on abstract relationships between the manuscripts and drew up geometric stemmata codicum or \\"manuscript family trees\\"; Pasquali shows the benefit of seeing the transmission of a text as a historical process. He also studies special cases of textual transmissions, for example where the manuscripts contain different versions of the same passages, both (or all) of them written by the author; and where anomalous sources such as collations (textual notes) by humanists conserve readings from lost manuscripts. He shows that a fairly recent manuscript may conserve valuable textual variants, if it goes back to a valuable lost source, an idea that is expressed in the maxim recentiores non deteriores. == Bibliography == *A.

It was a member of the Consolidated Stock Exchange, before failing on April 29, 1922. The failure resulted in a highly publicized lawsuit over whether the firm committed mail fraud and bucketing before failing. ==HistoryFounding and failure=== The brokerage firm was founded in 1920 in New York. According to records, as early as November 21, 1921, Consolidated had discussed the firm's methods, as it was known for bucketing. As of 1922, it was based at 42 Broadway and 30 East 42nd Street, and were members of the Consolidated Stock Exchange of New York. Firm members included D. C. Raynor, E. H. Truesdell, and B. J. Nicholas. The firm soon ran into financial difficulties. In November 1923 at the bankruptcy hearing, speculator Louis B. Appleton told that he and his brother Charles put up $50,000 before the failure as an advance to the firm, to help keep it afloat. The firm failed on April 29, 1922. In October 1923, testimony about the firm revealed that it failed in April 1922 for $4,000,000, and that the committee of the Consolidated Exchange had been aware of its failing condition six weeks before that. The failure amount was in 1924 reported as \\"more than $2,000,000.\\" ===Bucketing and fraud charges=== In December 1923, De Witt C. Raynor was indicted by the Federal Grand Jury in connection with the failure, after testifying that May. When the hearing resumed the following June, he had disappeared, failing to answer to a subpoena. He was still missing by July 1923, when he should have surrendered for his arrest. On January 23, 1924, it was revealed after an examination of the books that Raynor, Nicholas Truesdell owed $1,250,000 to be divided among 2,500 customers, and had $80,000 in assets. That day, several curb brokers were called in to testify on their dealings with the firm's check history. On February 1, 1924, De Witt Raynor walked into the office of the United States Marshal in Havana and surrendered himself, disclaiming any voluntary violation of the law. On November 6, 1924, De Witt C. Raynor plead guilty before a federal judge on charges of conspiracy and using the mails to defraud. Other co-defendants at the time included William Silkworth, Louis Gilbough of Consolidated, Blaine J. Nicholas and Earl H. Truesdell, and several others including Peter Owens, office manager of the Raynor firm. Lawyer Peter McCoy was prosecutor. On November 29, 1924, Silkworth and five others also found guilty of bucketing, with Silkworth convicted of mail fraud relating to his brokerage and Raynor, Nicholas and Truesdell in 1922. During the appeal process, McCoy gave testimony before the Circuit Court of Appeals that Raynor, Nicholas & Truesdell had engaged in extensive bucketing operations since its founding late 1920. McCoy further testified that Silkworth had provided the firm's bucketing operations with the protection of Consolidated. The Judge ruled against the motion raised by defendants, which was that bucketing did not have a Federal statute against it at the time, and ruled in favor of McCoy on February 1, 1926 with the November conviction upheld. Silkworth served three months of a year sentence in 1926, with other brokers also serving time. ==See also== *Edward M.

He served in that position 54 years, the longest of any Kahu in its history. Fluent in the Hawaiian language, he was a friend and pastor to Native Hawaiians, which included several decades of the Hawaiian monarchy. ==Background== Born March 2, 1834 in Nuku Hiva, Marquesas Islands, he was the oldest of four children, and the only son, of missionaries Benjamin Wyman Parker (1803‚Äì1877) and Mary Elizabeth Barker Parker (1805‚Äì1907). They were part of the Sixth Company of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions that had been sent to Nuku Hiva in 1833. The island was under civil unrest at the time, and the mission was aborted within months. The missionaries arrived back in Honolulu on May 12, 1834. The Parkers were assigned to Kaneohe, where Henry and his sisters Mary, Harriet and Caroline grew up. He studied at the Royal School under the tutelage of Edward Griffin Beckwith, and later was enrolled in classes at Punahou School under Daniel Dole and William Harrison Rice. After graduation, he spent two years as an instructor at Lahainaluna High School on Maui. ==Ministry== The current Kawaiaha ªo Church was constructed between 1836 and 1842. The church as a congregation had existed since Hiram Bingham arrived in 1820, and began meetings adjacent to his thatched hut. Other replacement structures were built in the same location before the stone church was erected, and had been a church home for royalty since Queen Ka ªahumanu accepted Christianity in 1824. Various names for the church have included \\"the Stone Church\\", \\"First Native Hawaiian church\\", \\"the Mission Church\\", \\"the Native Church\\" and \\"the First Native Church at Kawaihao in Honolulu\\". Parker in 1876 Known to Hawaiians as \\"Paleka opio\\" (the younger Parker), he grew up fluent in the Hawaiian language. Parker was trained in the ministry as an associate pastor at Kawaiaha ªo Church under Rev. Ephraim Weston Clark, who was working on an updated version of the Hawaiian Bible. When Clark resigned from the pulpit to pursue that goal, Parker was ordained as Kahu (pastor) of Kawaiaha ªo Church on June 28, 1863. The Pacific Commercial Advertiser commented on his ordination, \\"His perfect acquisition of the native language, and the rare faculty he possesses of rendering foreign ideas and sentiments clear, attractive and intelligible to the native mind, has made him a popular speaker with them, and we hope he may prove equally useful as a pastor.\\" Kamehameha V, the last Ali ªi to reign under that name, looked favorably upon missionaries, and his viewpoint was that Parker's motivations were towards the well- being of the Hawaiian people. King Lunalilo 1873 coronation took place in Kawaiaha ªo Church, with Parker offering the opening prayer at the ceremony. When Lunalilo died in 1874, Parker officiated in the Hawaiian language at the funeral service in  ªIolani Palace. Although Queen Emma had helped establish the Church of Hawaii, upon her 1885 death, King KalƒÅkaua requested Parker deliver the Hawaiian language eulogy at her funeral. KalƒÅkaua was also a member of the Church of Hawaii; and while Parker did not deliver his eulogy, he was among the members of the official clergy representation at the funeral. When Hawaii's last monarch Lili ªuokalani died in 1917, Parker and Leopold Kroll of the Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew were notified so church bells could toll 79 times, her age at death. Her body lay in state at Kawaiaha ªo Church. Parker delivered the Hawaiian language eulogy at her funeral. A celebration of his ministerial role was held at Kawaiaha ªo on the 40th anniversary of his ordination. Very little mention was made of the royalty he had ministered to, but it was rather a recognition of his labors to hundreds of congregants who received his services over the decades. ==Retirement and final years== In 1912, he performed the marriage of his congregant Alice Rosehill to Maui sheriff Peter Noa Kahokuoluna . The ceremony took place in Parker's home. A few years later, Alice would become the first woman minister ordained by the Hawaiian Evangelical Association and, during her life, the only woman minister of the gospel in the Territory of Hawaii. Parker retired as an active minister on January 27, 1918, five months short of 55 years as pastor of Kawaiaha ªo Church. His last act as their Kahu was to baptize two babies. Akaiko Akana was called to succeed Parker in the pulpit. He devoted the next several years of his life to revising A Dictionary of the Hawaiian Language, originally published in 1865 by Hawaii Supreme Court judge Lorrin Andrews. Reviewer Herbert W. Williams in 1926 did not see the publication as an improvement over the original. However, historian Ethel Moseley Damon noted in 1945 that Parker's revised edition was still used as a standard. Parker never married. When he died in 1927 at age 93, his sister Harriet was the only remaining member of his immediate family. His father, Benjamin, died March 23, 1877 and was the first of the family to be buried in the Mission Cemetery at Kawaiaha ªo. His mother lived to age 102, dying in 1907.

It was the first time that the English city hosted the event. The men's 10,000 metres was held at the Gateshead International Stadium, while the women's event was dropped entirely. It was the eleventh edition of the competition limited to British athletes only, launched as an alternative to the AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors. However, due to the fact that the calibre of national competition remained greater at the AAA event, the UK Championships this year were not considered the principal national championship event by some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS). Many of the athletes below also competed at the 1987 AAA Championships.UK Championships. GBR Athletics. Retrieved 2018-02-25.AAA WAAA and National Championships Medalists. NUTS. Retrieved 2018-02-25. Fatima Whitbread won her seventh consecutive women's javelin throw UK title, while shot putter Judy Oakes won a fourth straight title and men's javelin athlete Mick Hill his third. Other athletes to defend their 1986 titles were Max Robertson (400 m hurdles), Paula Dunn (100 m), Lisa Langford (racewalk) and Diana Davies (high jump). Dunn, with her sprint double, was the only athlete to win two UK titles that year, though Kim Hagger managed to be runner-up in both 100 m hurdles and long jump events. The main international track and field competition for the United Kingdom that year was the 1987 World Championships in Athletics.

He studied at St John's College, Oxford, Slade School of Fine Art and the London School of Architecture. His contemporaries at Slade were Augustus John, Jacob Epstein and William Rothenstein. In 1898, Fothergill and Rothenstein opened the Carfax Gallery on 24 Bury Street, St James's with managerial assistance from Arthur Clifton and Robert Sickert (brother of Walter Sickert) and financial support from Edward Perry Warren. The gallery became Walter Sickert's chief dealer in England. William Bruce Ellis Ranken held his first exhibition at the gallery. Fothergill subsequently became one of Warren's biographers. Lewes House, 2017 Fothergill bought a large Tudor oak table for ¬£25 that was installed in the dining room at Warren's home, Lewes House. Upon Warren's death, it sold for ¬£2,100 (¬£ in ). Fothergill was left ¬£20,000 (¬£ in ) by Warren. His book, Confessions of an Innkeeper was dedicated to Warren's partner and main beneficiary. The Spread Eagle Hotel, managed by Fothergill in the 1920s In 1922, Fothergille bought the Spread Eagle Hotel in Thame and turned it into a success through the decade before it closed in 1931. The pub was regularly visited by Evelyn Waugh and associates, and is mentioned in Brideshead Revisited. Waugh gave Fothergill a copy of his first novel, Decline and Fall, in which he wrote, \\"John Fothergill, Oxford's only civilizing influence.\\" Fothergill hid the copy in the inn's toilet to avoid theft. Harold Acton also visited the inn and namechecked Fothergill in his memoirs, Memoirs of an Aesthete. Fothergill praised Acton's novel, Humdrum, saying that it \\"might have been written by the young Wilde.\\" Fothergill's book, My Three Inns recommends Acton's autobiography at the end. Following the Spread Eagle, Fothergill managed the Royal Ascot Hotel and the Three Swans at Market Harborough. He gravitated around the Bright Young Things group, in the meaning that this crowd attended the venues managed by Fothergill. He was praised for his cooking and innkeeping skills that helped to improve overall dining standards in Britain. Fothergill was a close friend of Robbie Ross and Reginald Turner, and met Oscar Wilde aged 19. Wilde grew fond of him, and presented Fothergill with an inscribed copy of The Ballad of Reading Gaol, following Wilde's release from prison in 1897. ==Publications== * An Innkeeper's Diary (1931) * Confessions of an Innkeeper (1938) * My Three Inns (1949) ==References== Category:1876 births Category:1957 deaths Category:English writers ","title":"John Fothergill (innkeeper)"},{"id":"56805779","text":"Folke Pettersson was a male Swedish international table tennis player. ==Table tennis career== He won a silver medal at the 1930 World Table Tennis Championships in the men's team event. ==See also== * List of table tennis players * List of World Table Tennis Championships medalists ==References== Category:Swedish male table tennis players Category:World Table Tennis Championships medalists ","title":"Folke Pettersson"},{"id":"56805786","text":"Abdulkarim Baderkhan () (born 22 November 1986) is a Syrian poet, translator and critic.

Also, he published articles, critical studies and translations in several Arabic newspapers and magazines. Abdulkarim Baderkhan. Gaziantep, Turkey. May 2015. == Biography  Family and education === Baderkhan was born to a well- educated middle-class family in Homs, Syria in 1986. He became interested in a diverse collections of books, films, and music records and found himself surrounded by bold discussions about history, religion, literature and art.

She has held research, teaching and leadership positions in both museums and universities in the United Kingdom, where she has lived since 1996. She has also held posts in university museums and collections in Denmark and in Germany. She lived and worked in Montreal, Qu√©bec, from 1981 until 1996, when she moved to London, England. Much of her research is practice- based, translating into exhibitions, strategic development instruments, and pedagogical programmes.Centre for Collections Based Research PhD Programme, University of Reading This approach derives from her earlier career (1980-1995) as an artist and art critic, where she developed a lasting interest in interdisciplinary methodologies integrating research and practice. She also publishes her research in scholarly contexts such as History of Science and Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Press. == Early Life == Fleming was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on 2 October 1958, the daughter of Canadian graphic designer Allan Fleming (1929-1977) and publishing executive Nancy Fleming (1931-2008).Obituary by Noreen Shanahan, The Globe and Mail, 1 April 2008 Her brother is the furniture designer Peter Robb Fleming.Peter Fleming, Furniture Studio Head and Faculty, Bachelor of Crafts and Design, Sheridan College, Ontario Her sister is the Chef and Culinary Arts Professor, Susannah Jane Fleming. The siblings‚Äô godparents were the poet Richard Outram and the artist Barbara Howard. The family home was a hub for Canadian creative professionals in the 1960s and 1970s, and was well appointed with furnishings both traditional and modernist, antiques, art and an extensive book collection. Fleming‚Äôs childhood took place in this expansive cultural context. Fleming‚Äôs father experienced stress-related health challenges while working as Vice President and Executive Art Director for MacLaren Advertising (now McCann Worldgroup) from 1963 to 1968. Her parents separated in 1976, and her father died shortly thereafter in 1977.Fleming left his wife in March 1976 and died December 31, 1977. Fleming worked for rare book sellers in Toronto on leaving school in 1974, including Monk Bretton Books and the Albert Britnell Book Shop. At the suggestion of her godfather, Fleming concurrently audited courses in English Literature at the University of Toronto, including lectures by Northrop Frye on the narrative structure of the Bible, lectures which were later published posthumously. == Higher Education == Fleming was awarded a Commonwealth Scholarship in 1997 to pursue a MA (Master of Arts) in The History of the Book at the School of Advanced Study of University of London. Fleming later received her PhD, titled From Le Musee des Sciences to the Sciences Museum: Fifteen Years of Evolving Methodologies in the Art and Science Interface from the School of Art, Architecture and Design of Leeds Metropolitan University. == Artistic Career == In her early artistic career, Fleming was an involved in various artist-run centres, and authored art criticism and theoretical articles for publications such as ArtForum, Open Letter, and Block,Conde and Beveridge. \\"C/V Carol Conde and Karl Beveridge\\". URL http://condebeveridge.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/web-cv.pdf (accessed Mar 2018) among others. ===Collaboration with Lyne Lapointe=== In 1981, Fleming established both a romantic and collaborative relationship with French-Canadian artist Lyne Lapointe. The couple lived together in Montreal, Quebec, where from their studio base they produced internationally a substantial body of research-intensive site-specific installations that were mainly self-organised, forging a deep and intersectional feminist aesthetics. Their hybrid practice was informed by, and contributed to, emerging artforms at the time such as installation, site-specificity, conceptual art, institutional critique, representational critique, readymades (found-objects), and appropriation. The projects which occupied abandoned architectures constituted forms of urban activism, inscribing critical thinking in marginal spaces in cities, and refuting the privatization of public space. Each Fleming and Lapointe project addressed a specific nexus of epistemic and political concern, addressing complex social issues historically embedded or metaphorically present at such sites. Large scale site-specific installation projects by Fleming & Lapointe *Projet Building / Caserne #14 (1983) 4247 Saint-Dominique Street, Montr√©al: self-organised *Le Mus√©e des Sciences (1984) 1700 Notre Dame Street West, Montreal: self-organised *La Donna Delinquenta (1987) 2480 Notre Dame Street West, Montreal: self-organised *The Wilds and The Deep (1990) Battery Maritime Ferry Terminal, New York City: Creative Time and The Mayor's Office for Culture *Duda (1992) Municipal Library, Emir Mohammed Park, Madrid: Edge Biennale *These The Pearls (1992) St Paul's Dock Street Church, London: Edge Biennale *The Spirit & The Letter & The Evil Eye (1994) Book Museum, Bayntun's Book Bindery, Bath: Bath Festivals Trust *Mat√©ria Prima (1994) Casa de Dona Yaya, Sao Paolo: Sao Paolo Biennale with Artemise Productions La Donna Delinquenta refers to Cesare Lombroso's 1893 book, The Female Offender, an early and influential criminological treatise profiling prostitutes, immigrants and poor people in order for police to identify prospective criminals. In December 1989, Fleming and Lapointe held their first collaborative exhibition in a museum setting, titled, Eat Me/Drink Me/Love Me, at The New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York. The title and exhibition is a response to poet Christina Rosetti‚Äôs 19th century allegorical poem \\"Goblin Market\\", which explores themes of feminine temptation, redemption, and conflicts between virtue and sensual pleasure, in a pastoral setting.\\"Press Release: Installation on Feminine Pleasure to be Presented at the New Museum.\\" New Museum of Contemporary Art. December 1989. Eat Me/Drink Me/Love Me, transformed the Museum‚Äôs gallery in to a space of a domestic yet nature-rooted environment, with found objects, materials from the natural world, and other architectural elements. Together, these elements transfused the themes of emotional and sexual possibilities or restrictions for women, including a homoerotic twist, inspired by \\"Goblin Market.\\" At the end of their 15-year relationship in 1995, Fleming and Lapointe had a retrospective, titled Studiolo, incorporating the bulk of research, processes, and discursive and creative projects that they shared. The show was exhibited at the Museum d‚ÄôArt Contemporain in 1997, and later at the Art Gallery of Windsor 1998 invited by curator at the time, Helga Pakasaar. Accompanied with the exhibition was an associated book, also titled Studiolo. The book showcases the philosophical, historical, and aesthetic frameworks associated to the exhibition, and is located in Artextes Editions of 1997. == Academic and Museum Career == In 1996, Fleming moved to London, England. While her formative years collaborating with Lapointe still greatly influenced her later work, her relocation to the UK enabled her to develop her practice further in interdisciplinary research fields, as she participated extensively in research projects at several major UK museums and universities. Fleming has specialised in the design, creation and management of research projects and centres which conjoin humanities disciplines (often in university settings) with museum and collection institutions. Fleming has furthermore lectured, edited, and published in various contexts, including that of lectureships, scholarly journals, and art journals. Since the beginning of 2000s, Fleming has been the recipient of several grants, and has been involved in several major interdisciplinary research projects. === Teaching === Fleming has taught in universities and in museum-university partnerships, most notably as inaugural Programme Director of the Centre for Collections Based Research at the University of Reading (2013-2016). Her earlier teaching career includes positions at Concordia University (Montreal), where she taught critical theory and studio practice, and Vermont College of Fine Arts (Montpellier), as well as at Anglia Ruskin University (Cambridge) and Camberwell College of Art (London).. She has supervised and trained doctoral and post-doctoral research students variously at the University of Copenhagen's Medical Museion (2006-2009); the Materials Library of King's College London (2007-2010); the Centre for Collections Based Research University of Reading; and at the Forschungskolleg \\"Wissen  Ausstellen\\" of the University of G√∂ttingen. === Research Positions === *Fellow, UK National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (2004-2007) *Visiting Associate Professor, Medical Museion, Institute of Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen (2006-2009) *Visiting Scholar, Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Berlin (‚ÄúHistory of Scientific Observation‚Äù, Department II) (2008) *Visiting Scholar, Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Berlin (‚ÄúSciences of the Archive‚Äù, Department II) (2012) The Epistemic Effect of Display Practices on the Development of Pre-Linnean Taxonomy *Affiliated Scholar, Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Cambridge (2012-2015) *Senior Research Associate, Assembling Alternative Futures for Heritage, Institute of Archaeology, University College London (2015-2016) *Visiting Scholar, Lichtenberg Kolleg, University of G√∂ttingen (2018) Fleming has a particular interest in museology and museum practices, including the histories of collections and the ways in which these intersect with histories of knowledge production and global colonial histories. === Museum Positions === *Creative Director, ‚ÄòSplit & Splice: Fragments from the Age of Biomedicine‚Äù, Medicinsk Museion, University of Copenhagen (2008‚Äì2009) *Centre for Arts and Humanities Research, Natural History Museum, London.

In a similar light to the collaborative installation La Musee de Sciences with Lapointe in 1984, the displays created a reflective and critical response to museum practices which reestablished new and multiple orderings of scientific tropes and meanings. Other museum exhibition and project collaborations include Split + Splice at the Medical Museion of the University of Copenhagen (2008-2009); and You are Here: The Design of Information, at the Design Museum in London. == References == Category:Living people Category:1958 births Category:Alumni of the University of London Category:Alumni of Leeds Beckett University Category:People from Toronto ","title":"Martha Fleming"},{"id":"56805850","text":"Elizabeth Vander Zaag (born 21 June 1952) is a Canadian media artist, writer, and entrepreneur who has been working in video and computer arts since the 1970s. She is based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Vander Zaag is considered a pioneer of digital media. Her work has been exhibited internationally and included in exhibitions such as c.1983 that examine the history of video art. == Life and education == Elizabeth Vander Zaag was born in Alliston, Ontario in 1952. She received a B.A. in English and film from the University of Western Ontario. She also studied creative electronics at Fanshawe College in London, Ontario. After moving to Vancouver, British Columbia in 1974, Vander Zaag briefly studied computer arts at Simon Fraser University in nearby Burnaby, British Columbia. Between 1977 and 1980 Vander Zaag created the Digit Series, a videotape series that was featured on the cable television program The Gina Show by producer John Anderson. The Digit Series explored both gender and technology. The Digit Series has been included in exhibitions such as the International Symposium on Electronic Art in 2015. In 1981 Elizabeth Vander Zaag produced Thru the Holes, a short video in which the fragmentation of the video screen was used as a filter for human presence. This and other video works by Vander Zaag from the 1980-1990s are distributed by Video Out and V/Tape. Thru the Holes has been included in a number of retrospective exhibitions. SyntheticSound: An Experimental Music/Video Retrospective (2016) examined experimental video and music from the 1970s onward. It was curated by Alan Kollins for the transmediale/CTM Vorspiel festival in 2016 and screened in both Canada and Germany. Vander Zaag's work is included to illustrate experimentation with video processing occurring in the 1980s. c.1983 (2012) examined the development of video art, and the ways in which artists such as Vander Zaag \\"critiqued the commodification of the art object through the expansion of the powers and capacities of the photographic image.\\" Vander Zaag's work Hot Chicks on TV (1986) was included in the exhibition Rebel Girls: A Survey of Canadian Feminist Videotapes 1974-1988, curated by Susan Ditta at the National Gallery of Canada in 1989. There it was discussed in the context of women's history, representations of the female body, and relationship of the personal to the political. In 2000, Elizabeth Vander Zaag's voice interactive installation Talk Nice appeared at the Banff Centre before traveling in Canada and to Seoul, Korea, Sao Paulo, Brazil and Paris. In 2007, she received her master's degree in Interdisciplinary Studies from the University of British Columbia. Her graduate thesis, Mother Tongue : a study of participant affect in an interactive installation, combines research in linguistics and human‚Äìcomputer interaction to further her understanding of the academic context of her interactive speech installations. Along with her graduate thesis, Vander Zaag produced an interactive video installation entitled Speaking Mother Tongues (2007). In 2011, Vander Zaag became the CEO of Mermaid Power Corporation. Mermaid Power has since merged with Neptune Wave, where Vander Zaag is now the CFO. She has also managed companies such as Front Media Ltd, CougarDate.com, Ross House Holdings Ltd. She is the director of North Arm Holdings Ltd. == Collections == Elizabeth Vander Zaag's work is in the following museum collections: * National Gallery of Canada * Art Gallery of Ontario * Vancouver Art Gallery * Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery * Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) ==References== Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Artists from Ontario Category:Canadian video artists Category:Canadian women artists Category:People from Simcoe County Category:University of British Columbia alumni ","title":"Elizabeth Vander Zaag"},{"id":"56805858","text":"Henry Wilbert was a male Swedish international table tennis player. ==Table tennis career== He won a silver medal at the 1930 World Table Tennis Championships in the men's team event. ==See also== * List of table tennis players * List of World Table Tennis Championships medalists ==References== Category:Swedish male table tennis players Category:World Table Tennis Championships medalists ","title":"Henry Wilbert"},{"id":"56805885","text":"Dragoljub Pljakiƒá (; August 28 1937 ‚Äì June 28 2011), nicknamed \\"Pljaka\\", was a Serbian basketball player and coach. == Playing career == Pljakiƒá spent the major part of his playing career with Radniƒçki from Belgrade, which played in the Yugoslav First Basketball League.

The space, designed by Rockliff Pierzchajlo Kroman Architects, will include a kitchen, resource library, community space, and offices for rent in addition to gallery space. The Ociciwan Contemporary Art Centre will be the first Indigenous-run contemporary art centre in Edmonton. Ociciwan's grand opening exhibition at the new space, amiskwac√Æw√¢skahikan, had been planned for March 2020. Just two weeks before the event, the gallery was forced to delay the opening indefinitely due to COVID-19. In June 2020, the gallery was the target of a theft, including new media equipment and a piece by Lana Whiskeyjack slated for the opening exhibition. The stolen artwork is a beaded medallion crafted with deer lace and rabbit fur titled Three Generations of nit√™h (my heart). In a public plea to find the piece, Whiskeyjack said, \\"the significance of the work is much more than the monetary value ‚Äî it is a creative practice of paradigm shifting to help address the violence against Indigenous People as well as to help lift their spirits and cultural awareness.\\" ==Major Projects== * Scene Report, with Wendy.

Ward's work utilizes sculpture, multi-media installation, drawing and architecture to explore the role of aesthetics in creating social realities. == Life == Ward obtained a BA in English from the University of New Brunswick in 1995 and went on to obtain a BFA, Interdisciplinary from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in 1999. In 2006, Ward completed her MFA, Studio at the University of Guelph. == Artistic practice == Ward has participated in group exhibitions in Canada, England, Mexico, the United States, Norway and South Korea and has shown seven solo exhibitions, the last being in 2009. Ward's first solo exhibition, More Softer Please, took place at the Helen Pitt Gallery, Vancouver, BC in 2000. In 2009, Ward's work, Island, was included in the Vancouver Art Gallery's exhibition, How Soon Is Now. Island consisted of a large pile of soil that was moved by volunteers to different parts of the gallery during the show. Vancouver Art Gallery curator, Kathleen Ritter said of Island, \\"it's a playfully irreverent work and it challenged our conventional notions of the art object being static, by making something that has an almost parasitical relationship with the other works in the exhibition.\\" In 2018, a new installation by Ward, Raw Goods, was shown at the Polygon Gallery in Vancouver as part of their inaugural exhibition, N.Vancouver. The work consisted of \\"two wide, cone-like piles - one coal, one sulphur. Both commodities are integral to the local economy, and the sulphur's bright yellow is a familiar sight for anyone who has spent time on the Stanley Park seawall across the Inlet.\\" In 2016, Ward's work Industry is Useless Without Culture: REsource Extraction #1-3 was acquired by the Vancouver Art Gallery for its permanent collection. === Collaboration === Ward is a long- time collaborator with Vancouver artist, Kevin Schmidt. The pair collaborated on Schmidt's EDM House (2013), The Pavilion, Phase 2 (2011‚Äì), an architectural hybrid that is also the pair's home, and Screen in the Landscape (2015‚Äì). === Select solo exhibitions === * 2017, Holly Ward: Planned Peasanthood, Kamloops Art Gallery, Kamloops, BC *2009, Here & There, Republic Gallery, Vancouver, BC * 2008, Radical Rupture, Morris and Helen Belkin Gallery,Vancouver, BC * 2004-2005, The Future Is Now, L‚ÄôOeil de Poisson, Quebec, PQ, Or Gallery, Vancouver, BC, YYZ Artist‚Äôs Outlet, Toronto, ON === Select group exhibitions === * 2019, Displacement, Vancouver Art Gallery, Vancouver, BC *2018, N.Vancouver, Polygon Gallery, Vancouver, BC *2012, An Era of Discontent: Art as Occupation, Kamloops Art Gallery, Kamloops, BC * 2010, Invitation to an Infiltration, Contemporary Art Gallery, Vancouver, BC * 2009, How Soon Is Now, Vancouver Art Gallery, Vancouver, BC * 2008, The Sound I‚Äôm Looking For, Part 2, Charles H.

It has two or three grass-like leaves and up to ten light yellow flowers with a few dark brown marks. It is threatened by urbanisation. ==Description== Diuris praecox is a tuberous, perennial herb with two or three linear leaves long, wide and folded lengthwise. Between six and ten flowers wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The flowers are pale yellow with a few dark brown markings at the base of the dorsal sepal and labellum. The dorsal sepal is more or less erect, narrow egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide, turned downwards and parallel to each other. The petals are more or less erect with a narrow elliptic to egg-shaped blade long and wide on a blackish stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is egg-shaped, long, wide and the side lobes are linear to egg-shaped, long and about wide. There are two ridged calli long in the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from July to early September. ==Taxonomy and naming== Diuris praecox was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected in the Glenrock State Conservation Area and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (praecox) is a Latin word meaning \\"too early ripe\\" or \\"premature\\" referring to the early flowering period of this orchid, especially compared to the similar Diuris abbreviata. ==Distribution and habitat== The early doubletail grows in coastal and near- coastal forests between Bateau Bay and Smiths Lake, especially in the Munmorah State Conservation Area and Wyrrabalong National Park. ==Conservation== Diuris praecox is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the New South Wales Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. The main threats to the species are loss of habitat due to urbanisation, weed invasion, uncontrolled track expansion and impacts due to recreational use. ==References== Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Endemic orchids of Australia praecox Category:Plants described in 1991 ","title":"Diuris praecox"},{"id":"56806027","text":"Stella Donnelly (born April 10, 1992) is an Welsh-Australian musician. Born in Western Australia to a Welsh mother, she spent some childhood years living in Morriston before moving to Perth, Australia with her family. ==Early life== Donnelly first started singing when she joined a rock band in high school (Irene McCormack Catholic College) that performed Green Day covers. After high school, Donnelly studied contemporary and jazz music at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts. ==Personal life== For recreation, Donnelly enjoys playing squash, swimming at beaches, birdwatching, gardening, completing cryptic crosswords, cooking, rock climbing with her partner, and playing board games with friends. In an interview with The Line of Best Fit, she stated: > \\"My version of taking a break [from recording and touring] is filling up my > day with as many activities as possible.\\" ==Musical style and influences== Donnelly describes Billy Bragg and Courtney Barnett as musical influences. ==Political views and activism== Donnelly is a supporter of various social and political causes. Her 2017 debut single \\"Boys Will be Boys\\", written about societal attitudes towards women and her friend's experience of sexual assault, was dubbed a \\"#MeToo anthem\\" (despite being written and released prior to the widespread global coverage of the movement). Donnelly is opposed to the celebration of Australia Day. In a 2019 interview with The Guardian, she stated: > \\"It's a really nationalist, white pride day... and it's actually a very > historic day for Indigenous Australians ‚Äì an invasion day, and a day of > mourning.\\" Donnelly supports same-sex marriage, and was \\"relieved\\" when it was legalised in Australia in 2017. Donnelly is pro-choice. ==Career== Donnelly released her first EP titled Thrush Metal in 2017 on the record label Healthy Tapes. In 2018, the EP was reissued in the United States by the American label Secretly Canadian. She released her debut album, Beware of the Dogs, on 8 March 2019 via Secretly Canadian. It received widespread acclaim from critics, including Robert Christgau, who praised it as a \\"musical encyclopedia of [male] assholes\\".

Originally titled Une messe en 1793 (A Mass in 1793), the text took its final title in the Chlendowski edition of 1845. The work appears in Sc√®nes de la vie politique (Scenes from Political Life), which is a part of the series of works that make up La Com√©die humaine (The Human Comedy), Balzac's multi-volume collection of interlinked stories. The later edition is dedicated to Monsieur Guyonnet- Merville, under whom Balzac had done his apprenticeship and studied the foundations of law. ==Plot summary== An elderly woman buys a package from a bakery on 22 January 1793, and suspects she is being followed. She asks for protection from the baker, but when he sees the stranger following her he refuses. She returns home alone, and it is revealed that she is an ex- Carmelite nun in hiding with another nun and a priest. All are elderly, and the box she bought contains communion wafers. The stranger comes up to their room, and asks the priest to say a mass for the recently executed King Louis XVI. He returns later to attend the mass. He also says that he will come back in a year for another mass for the king, and promises that they will be safe from any danger. He leaves a blood stained handkerchief with royal insignia as a present. The next year the stranger returns for the mass. Later, the priest visits a shop owned by some Royalist friends of his, and notices a tumbril passing by with the executioner and his victims. The priest faints when he recognises that the executioner is the stranger who has been helping them, and realises that the handerkerchief was the king's. ==Historical Background== The story takes place during the Reign of Terror, from 1793 to 1794. It starts the day after the execution of King Louis XVI. The story is fictional, but it features an historical figure, Charles-Henri Sanson, who was the High Executioner, and conducted the execution of Louis XVI. However the story does not give his name. The Reign of Terror was a period during which there was a process of Dechristianisation occurring in France. The nuns and priest in the story are in hiding because of this. ==Inspiration== The idea of writing the story was most likely born after Balzac's meeting with Sanson's son, Henri- Nicolas-Charles Sanson, also an executioner. Perhaps the son's stories about his father‚Äî an extremely religious man despite his work‚Äîinspired Balzac to write a story that is not based on actual facts, but on the human aspect of a real life character, and on alternate events that could have taken place. An Episode Under the Terror is also a clear proof of the influence of Romanticism on Balzac's work, and is evident in the general atmosphere of the story and its structure (the mystery of the main character and the drama of the final scene). ==References *\\"An Episode under the Terror\\", translation (by Clara Bell) at Project Gutenberg (full text) Category:1830 short stories Category:French short stories Category:Books of La Com√©die humaine Category:Short stories by Honor√© de Balzac fr:Un √©pisode sous la Terreur ","title":"Un √©pisode sous la Terreur"},{"id":"56806037","text":"The men's 500 metres at the 1990 Asian Winter Games was held on 10 March 1990 in Sapporo, Japan. == Records Results== { class= style=\\"text- align:center\\" !width=40Rank !width=250Athlete !width=80Time !width=50Notes -  align=left 38.14 -  align=left 38.21 -  align=left 38.34 -  align=left 38.34 - 5 align=left 38.43 - 6 align=left 38.49 - 7 align=left 38.89 - 8 align=left 38.95 - 9 align=left 39.01 - 10 align=left 39.05 - 11 align=left 39.10 - 12 align=left 39.37 - 13 align=left 40.45 - 14 align=left 41.70 } ==References== *Results ==External links== *Changchun 2007 Official website Men 500 ","title":"Speed skating at the 1990 Asian Winter Games ‚Äì Men's 500 metres"},{"id":"56806052","text":"Like, la leyenda , or simply Like is a Mexican telenovela that premiered on Las Estrellas on 10 September 2018 and ended on 20 January 2019. The telenovela is produced by Pedro Dami√°n for Televisa. The series follows the lives of thirteen high school students and the problems that adolescents experience during their time in high school. == Plot == The telenovela narrates the experiences of a group of young people interned at the Life Institute of Knowledge and Evolution (LIKE), a prestigious and cosmopolitan educational institution, with a supposedly modern and open educational system, but in reality it is deeply traditional and schematic. In this institution, which presumes its level of vanguard, each beginning of the school year a new generation of high school students are formed with rigid and tedious routines, in addition to educational techniques that do not excite anyone. The educational plan of Like, completely obsolete, has made teachers and students apathetic and conformist. That apathetic atmosphere will be challenged by Gabriel Rey, \\"Gabo\\", an atypical teacher who will come to the school after many years of experience, and who was also a student at Like. Gabo will encourage students not to conform to what adults want to impose on them, provoking a true revolution in Like, which will generate confrontations between teachers, parents and students. == Cast  Main === * Mauricio Abad as Ulises Reyes, comes from a neighborhood in Lima, Peru. He can seem aggressive and generate distrust, because he went through a very difficult situation in life by assuming the guilt for a crime he did not commit. * Santiago Achaga as Cl√°udio Meyer, he is the one who gets along with everyone and does everything he can. He is very fortunate to have been born into a family of ancestry and this privilege causes him at the same time honor and guilt. * Roberta Dami√°n as Antonia \\"Tony\\" De Haro, she seems predestined since she was born to be a princess. However, she struggles daily to get rid of that label. She is popular and leader by nature; is a fashion lover and loves to sing. * Macarena Garc√≠a as Machu Salas, has a special ability to manipulate others, she is an innate bully.

Siebens writes about dance films and techniques for applying filmmaking to dance, and has been praised for her practical insights into the filming of dance and the creative interactions between dance and film technique which she credits for expanding the cinematic experience: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm interested in breaking the frame, in moving beyond the traditional two- dimensional space of film, in questioning the status quo. The visual transgressions of dance media, that on the surface seem so simple and pleasing, are an entry point for feminists and activists to have their say, an allowance for a complexity of politics, enabled by the moving body through time and space.‚Äù Siebens is represented by Wil Aballe Art Projects in Vancouver. ==Education== Evann Siebens studied dance at the National Ballet School of Canada and the Royal Ballet School in London, England. She danced with the National Ballet of Canada and the Bonn Ballet in Germany. Siebens graduated from New York University in 1996, with a Bachelor of Arts, magna cum laude.

Filmed over period of five years, it focuses on three kumu hula or hula masters teaching in California: Sissy Kaio of Hula Halau O Lilino ªe, Mark Keali ªi Ho ªomalu of Na Mele Hula ‚ÄòOhana and Patrick MakuakƒÅne of Na Lei Hulu I Ka Wekiu. The film breaks down stereotypes about hula, in part by focusing on male dancers as well as females. To successfully complete the film, it was necessary to spend time with the Hawaiian hula community and win their trust. The film won a CINE Golden Eagle Award in 2003, a Silver Hugo Award at the Chicago International Television Festival, and the Bronze Award in Cultural Documentary at WorldFest Houston. The film also screened at the Hawai‚Äòi International Film Festival, and the Native American Film and Video Festival at the Smithsonian Institution.

After 10 years as Longman's Caribbean publisher, she spent two years in Nairobi as Publishing Manager for Longman Kenya,Anne Walmsley, \\"Longman Caribbean: Kenya\\", pp. 87‚Äì94, in Tim Rix (ed.), Longmans More Latter-day Memories, Personal and Various, printed for private circulation, 2012. and on her return to the UK she took an MA in African Studies at the University of Sussex. She subsequently worked as a freelance editor and consultant, and was also active with ATCAL (the Association for the Teaching of Caribbean and Africa Literature, founded in the late 1970s). In 1985 she began research into CAM, funded by a Leverhulme Fellowship.\\"Caribbean Artists Movement\\", George Padmore Institute. Another landmark anthology, Facing the Sea (1986), co-edited by Walmsley (with Nick Caistor), introduced writing from the Dutch, French and Spanish Caribbean to secondary school students of the Anglophone Caribbean, its regional span prompted by discussion of such writing in CAM. In 1992 she was awarded a PhD from the University of Kent for her thesis on CAM. That same year it was published as a book by New Beacon Books, entitled The Caribbean Artists Movement: A Literary and Cultural History, 1966‚Äì1971, and is considered to be a \\"groundbreaking study\\".Gail Low, Publishing Commonwealth: The Case of West Indian Writing, 1950‚Äì65, Brunel University, p. 84.

More than of debris slid down Mount Meager, temporarily blocking Meager Creek and destroying local bridges, roads and equipment. It was one of the largest landslides in Canadian history and one of over 20 landslides to have occurred from the Mount Meager massif in the last 10,000 years. Although voluminous, there were no fatalities caused by the event due in part to its remote and uninhabited location. The landslide was large enough to send seismic waves more than away into the neighbouring U.S. states of Alaska and Washington and beyond. Multiple factors led to the slide: Mount Meager's weak slopes have left it in a constant state of instability. ==Background== Mount Meager, located north of Vancouver, is a peak of the Mount Meager massif. This is a group of coalescent stratovolcanoes and the largest volcanic centre in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. It comprises about of eruptive rocks that were deposited during four distinct eruptive periods, the first beginning 2.2 million years ago. During the present period (beginning 150,000 years ago), it has erupted more than five times, producing ash falls, pyroclastic flows, lava flows and lahars. The only identified Holocene eruption was in about 410 BC and created a diverse sequence of volcanic deposits well exposed along the Lillooet River. This is the most recent major explosive eruption in British Columbia, as well as the largest known Holocene explosive eruption in Canada. The massif has been a source of large volcanic debris flows for the last 8,000 years, many of which have reached several tens of kilometres downstream in the Lillooet River valley. It is arguably the most unstable mountain massif in Canada and may also be its most active landslide area. The earliest identified Holocene landslide was in 7900 BP and further landslides occurred in 6250, 5250, 4400, 2600, 2400, 2240, 2170, 1920, 1860, 870, 800, 630, 370, 210, 150 BP and in 1931, 1947, 1972, 1975, 1984, 1986 and 1998. These events were attributed to structurally weak volcanic rocks, glacial unloading, recent explosive volcanism and Little Ice Age glacial activity. ==Landslide== The Meager Creek barrier after the dam outburst flood at the confluence of Capricorn and Meager creeks. At 3:27 a.m. PDT on August 6, 2010, the southern peak of Mount Meager collapsed in a series of major rockfalls. The rockfalls fell approximately onto Meager's weak and heavily saturated south flank where they destabilized a significant volume of material, forming a highly mobile, very rapid debris flow. The debris flow travelled the entire length of Capricorn Creek then inundated both the Meager Creek and Lillooet River valleys. Meager Creek was dammed for about 19 hours during which time water had built up behind the dam to create a long lake. The landslide dam ultimately failed into the Lillooet River valley, releasing roughly of water towards Pemberton with an average velocity of approximately . No deaths or injuries were associated with the event. A study conducted by Guthrie et al. (2012) concluded that groundwater played a key role in the collapse. Prior to failure the flanks of Meager were subject to high pore water pressures indicated by extensive surface seepage observed throughout the failure surface and along lateral shears following the 2010 event. The largest visible bedrock spring occurred along the west lateral scarp and was the location of at least two previous landslides, occurring in 1998 and 2009. Water supply was exacerbated by summer melt of snow and ice, causing even greater saturation of slopes. With a volume of approximately , the 2010 landslide was comparable in volume to the 1965 Hope Slide, making it one of the largest in Canadian history. The landslide consisted mainly of intrusive porphyritic rhyodacite, lava flows and breccia derived from the Capricorn and Plinth assemblages, which are the most recently formed geological formations comprising the Mount Meager massif. ===Impact=== Despite the remote location of the landslide, the event had considerable socioeconomic impact. Approximately of wood was stripped away from the slopes of Capricorn Creek and Meager Creek and the Lillooet River valley bottom and either pulverized into fine organic material or transported as large woody debris into the river system. The wood was a mixture of western hemlock, amabilis and subalpine firs, western red cedar and to a lesser extent lodgepole pine and balsam poplar. The total potential loss based on the markets at the time of the event was C$8.7 million. In addition, road construction equipment and two forest service bridges were destroyed, along with several kilometres of roads including almost of the Meager Creek forest service road. Raw seismic signals from 2010 Mount Meager landslide recorded across southwestern British Columbia and northern Washington. Station and landslide location indicated on inset map. The landslide and the subsequent threat of a dam outburst flood on Meager Creek caused the evacuation of approximately 1,500 residents in the lower Lillooet River valley for one night and rescue efforts for several campers and workers in the vicinity of Mount Meager. Sediment moving downstream puts pressure on the Pemberton district diking system, raising the effective flood levels. The obliteration of Capricorn Creek and inundation of Meager Creek will have long- lasting environmental effects. In total, direct costs associated with the event were estimated at C$10 million. If gravel removal or dike elevation changes become necessary as a result of the increased sediment load, the total long-term costs of this landslide could exceed the direct costs. ===Seismic signature=== The landslide generated long-period seismic waves that were visible at seismograph stations from southern California to northern Alaska, up to away. No known earthquake was associated with the failure, but the event itself was assigned an equivalent local magnitude of 2.6 by the Canadian National Seismograph Network. Landslides do not always generate identifiable seismic signatures due in part to their slower source process and poor ground coupling as compared to earthquakes. Seismic energy conversion rates for similar events are estimated to be as low as 0.01% of the kinetic energy and 1% of the potential energy released by the slide. It requires an extremely energetic source to generate waves high enough in amplitude to be visible for thousands of kilometres. The seismogenic nature of this landslide was a result of the large volume of material involved and the extremely rapid velocities. ==Eyewitnesses== Four people witnessed the event and were in extreme jeopardy on several occasions during and immediately following the landslide. K. Kraliz, J. Duffy, J. Tilley and P. Smith arrived at upper Lillooet forest campsite at 3:25 a.m. PDT and began unloading their gear. They were surprised by \\"two large cracks\\" (loud explosive noises, not physical cracks in the ground) occurring in quick succession, followed by a rumbling that initially sounded like a train or a forest fire, but that grew to a deafening volume in about 20 seconds. All four campers got back into their truck and headed for higher ground. Chaos ensued for the next few hours before daylight as they encountered debris flows, mud, falling trees and other hazards at the edge of the landslide deposit in the Lillooet River valley. Perhaps the most alarming part of their story occurred as they came face to face with a high wall of mud and water that appeared to them like a \\"turbulent bubbling wedge of black oil\\". They turned their truck around, but not before they were overtaken by the hyperconcentrated flow. Accelerating rapidly, they nonetheless escaped, in what P. Smith described as most resembling \\"the Millennium Falcon escaping the Death Star explosion at the end of Return of the Jedi\\". The two large cracks heard by the witnesses may have been caused by the impact of Meager's failed secondary peak. ==Significance== The 2010 landslide is significant for seven reasons: #It was the tenth mass flow involving volumes in excess of to have occurred at the Mount Meager massif since 1850 and the sixth largest mass flow identified at the volcano over the Holocene. #It was one of the largest landslides to have occurred worldwide since 1945. #The landslide exhibited dramatic transformation from an initial rock slope failure to a rapidly moving debris flow as a result of the high degree of fragmentation of the initial failure mass. #The formation of a significant landslide dam illustrated the importance of landslide damming as a secondary landslide process and as a hazard to distant downstream communities. #The seismic trace of the landslide initiation and motion allowed detailed reconstruction of the stages and velocity of movement. #The event demonstrated the role of rapid post-Little Ice Age deglaciation in destabilizing slopes adjacent to modern glaciers. #It represented a unique opportunity to consider hazard and risk from catastrophic failures to mountain communities. The event illustrated the extreme landslide hazard of glacier-clad dissected Quaternary volcanic centres, which results from the existence of steep slopes in poor quality rock (reflecting such factors as hydrothermal alteration and heterogeneity of volcanic products). In this geological environment, landslides are a major process of denudation and, through transformation into debris flows, deliver large volumes of debris to river systems. ==See also== *List of

Palermo, Marsala and Trapani. ==History== The company was established in Rome under a notarial deed of 3 September 1878 with a paid-up capital of 22 million lire divided into 44,000 shares. It obtained government approval by Royal Decree of 30 September of the same year. it built and inaugurated the first railway connection between the two cities of Palermo and Trapani in 1881. Work began with the opening, on 1 June 1880, of the first stretch from the new Palermo Lolli station (later replaced by Palermo Notarbartolo railway station) in Partinico. A month later it inaugurated the stretch to the south connecting Trapani to Castelvetrano. In March 1881 it linked Partinico with Castellammare del Golfo and finally, on 5 June 1881, the entire route was completed with the activation of the central section of Castellammare del Golfo - Castelvetrano. In 1882 the company built the link, from Palermo Lolli to the Bivio Madonna dell'Orto, (more recently called Bivio Marittima, for the port of Palermo). This connected to the Calabrian-Sicilian railway but the connection was only used for goods traffic. In 1884, the company was registered in the official list of the Milan stock exchange. ==Locomotives== The company ordered 14 steam locomotives from Reale Opificio di Pietrarsa. They were delivered between 1880 and 1885 and numbered 1-20. In 1886 Ansaldo supplied locomotives 35 and 36 and, between 1891 and 1895, delivered another 6 units similar to the 1-20 group. Subsequently, Ansaldo, in 1901, provided the last unit, number 37, similar to 35 and 36. ==Nationalization== The company operated the Palermo - Trapani Railway via Castelvetrano until August 1, 1907, when it was incorporated into the Italian State Railways (FS). Of the 1-20 group of locomotives, 16 units were registered as FS Class 385, while the three units in the 35-37 group were registered as FS Class 388. ==References== Category:History of rail transport in Italy ","title":"Societ√† della Ferrovia Sicula Occidentale"},{"id":"56806405","text":"The Battle of Blomindon took place on 21 May 1781 during the American Revolutionary War.

She had two half brothers and a sister who died young. Briscoe's career as an entertainer began at about the age of nine when she performed in a club where her uncle, Escaliere Thomas, was employed part-time in the evenings. She got the nickname \\"Baby\\" (sometimes \\"Babe\\"), which she retained in her entertainment career as an adult. == Early career == As a child, Briscoe performed in New Orleans at the St. Bernard Alley Cabaret as an acrobatic dancer in a floor show in which she was the sole child performer. A natural on the stage, Briscoe continued to perform as an acrobatic dancer and singer in such New Orleans cabarets as the Astoria, Entertainers, and the Owl in her early teenage years, often mentioned in newspaper articles as a cabaret's main draw. In February 1931, at the age of seventeen, Briscoe moved to New York City to pursue a career as a dancer. She was employed by Small's Paradise Club. She was out of work for at least several weeks during her recovery. In 1933 she returned to her native New Orleans to rise to such renown in the local jazz scene that she gained the title \\"the Sweetheart of New Orleans.\\" Pianist Joe Robichaux hired her to lead his band, the New Orleans Rhythm Boys, a group consisting at times of up to fifteen members, including three women: Briscoe, Joan Lunceford (singer), and Ann Cooper (trumpet). Dressed in what became her trademark tuxedo, Briscoe worked as a tap dancer, entertaining the crowd in front of Robichaux's band during and between musical sets. Briscoe worked with Robichaux for nearly five years before joining another group, the Harlem Playgirls, in early 1938. Based out of Minneapolis, Minnesota, this African American all-woman band toured the country to popular and critical acclaim. From 1938 to 1940 Briscoe, in her tuxedo and a baton in hand, led the band when it performed at the Apollo Theater in New York City on Thanksgiving Day in 1938 and at smaller venues in Frederick, Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio; Youngstown, Ohio; and Jackson, Tennessee. The Harlem Playgirls made numerous appearances at the Tick Tock Tavern in New Orleans. By this time Briscoe was not just a \\"front\\" for the band but a true band leader. == Personal life == Following her two-year tour with the Harlem Playgirls, Briscoe returned to New Orleans, where she met a merchant mariner named David \\"Val\\" Mouton. At the peak of her success she left her career in show business to marry Mouton in 1942. They had two daughters, Avon (\\"Vonnie\\") and Debra. Briscoe, a strong advocate for the right to vote, became a registered voter in New Orleans in 1948. Briscoe divorced her husband in 1950 due to domestic abuse. After the divorce she and her daughters lived with her mother on North Tonti Street in New Orleans, and Briscoe became a successful businesswoman. She studied cosmetology, operated a gift boutique named Avon and Debra's Gift Shop after her daughters, owned a small restaurant, and worked as a seamstress, making ball gowns for Mardi Gras. In 1957 Briscoe married Clarence Casimire, whom she had known from her youth. The marriage ceremony was performed by Briscoe's half brother Joseph Mitchell at the Christian Mission Baptist Church he co-founded in New Orleans. Shortly after their marriage the couple moved to Cleveland with Briscoe's daughters and Casimire's daughter from a previous marriage. They had one son. Despite her retirement from the stage, Briscoe continued to perform. She started to learn saxophone in her sixties, did splits on her seventy-fifth birthday, and danced on her eightieth birthday. In 1994 Briscoe was hospitalized with bone cancer at St. Alexis Hospital. A nun at the hospital told one of Briscoe's daughters that Briscoe \\"had talked of being a famous dancer...about wearing a satin tuxedo and conducting an orchestra. The nun added quickly that it was surely the morphine\\". She died four months after her 80th birthday, on August 25, 1994. ==Awards and honors== In 2004, Briscoe was included in a feature exhibition celebrating the Women of Jazz at the National Historic Jazz Park in New Orleans. To commemorate the tenth anniversary of her death, her daughters set up the Baby Briscoe Scholarship Fund at Tulane University. == References == Category:Created via preloaddraft Category:Jazz dancers Category:American bandleaders Category:American women in business Category:1914 births Category:1994 deaths Category:African-American jazz musicians Category:African-American female dancers Category:20th-century American dancers ","title":"Neliska Ann Briscoe"},{"id":"56806485","text":"Sophia Jane Goulden (n√©e Craine; 1833 ‚Äì 1910) was the mother of Emmeline Pankhurst and is credited with having an important forming influence on her daughters‚Äô political beliefs. == Early life == Sophia Jane Craine was born in Lonan, Isle of Man, in 1833, to William Craine and Jane (n√©e Quine). She was baptised 3 November 1833. Although William was a shoemaker by trade, he and his wife came to manage boarding houses in Douglas, initially Tynwald House at 3 North Quay, and then at Christian Road. In her youth Sophia was described as being ‚Äòan unusually good-looking young lady‚Äô and it is likely that she met Robert Goulden through the boarding house, whether he visited it on business or on holiday. Six years her elder, Robert Goulden was at that time an errand boy at a Manchester manufacturers. Sophia and Robert were married on 8 September 1853 at Kirk Braddan, when Sophia was 18 and Robert 24. The newly married couple moved to Manchester, where Robert Goulden rose to become managing director of his own manufacturing business. Although the family would visit the Isle of Man regularly through her life, it was in Manchester that Sophia had her eleven children, ten of whom survived into adulthood: Walter, Emmeline, Edmund, Mary, Herbert, Effie, Robert, Ada Sophia, Alfred Harold and Eva Gertrude. == Political engagement == Sophia Goulden's daughter, Emmeline Pankhurst (n√©e Goulden) Later in her life, Emmeline was to write of her parents: > ‚ÄòThose men and women are fortunate who are born at a time when a great > struggle for human freedom is in progress. It is an added good fortune to > have parents who take a personal part in the great movements of their time. > I am glad and thankful that this was my case.‚Äô Described as having ‚Äòa bright and attractive personality,‚Äô Sophia and her husband established themselves as members of Manchester‚Äôs ‚Äòradical elite,‚Äô exposing their family to radical politics and bringing them into contact with ‚Äòthe foremost intellectuals of the time.‚Äô It was amidst this ‚Äòatmosphere of reformist zeal‚Äô in the Goulden household that Sophia took her eldest daughter, Emmeline, to her first suffrage meeting in around 1872. Then aged 14, Emmeline left the meeting ‚Äòa confirmed suffragist.‚Äô The speaker they saw that day was Lydia Becker, who was to play an important role in the Isle of Man's becoming the first country in the world to grant votes to women in 1881 (although it is not believed that either Sophia or Emmeline played an active campaigning role in this). When her children were to go on their important roles in the suffragette movement, it was reported that Sophia ‚Äònaturally approved and was entirely in sympathy with them in the matter, and was greatly enthusiastic to secure the [UK] vote for women.‚Äô == Later life == Sophia kept up the connection with the Isle of Man, generally visiting the Island for their summer holidays each year throughout her life. By this time Sophia‚Äôs mother had moved to 9 Strathallan Crescent, Douglas, which was then bought by Robert Goulden in 1878. It was also here at Strathallan Crescent that Robert died on 24 April 1892, leaving Sophia to live on at the property with just her son, Walter, whose health was poor. Emmeline, Christabel and others of her family continued to visit her on the Isle of Man, until her death in 1910 at the age of 75. Having been in poor health for some months, she had ‚Äòan attack of double pneumonia‚Äô which led to her death at 5 o‚Äôclock on 22 April 1910 at her home. She was buried at Braddan New Cemetery, beside her husband. She left an estate worth ¬£789 15s 1d and a will which stated that ‚Äòthe share which any female shall take under this my will shall be for her sole and separate use independently of any husband and of his debts.‚Äô Sophia did not live to see the success of the Suffragette movement and the enfranchisement of women in the UK, an injustice felt all the more having had the vote in the Isle of Man, as a widowed property owner, for nearly thirty years. == Legacy == In 1881 Sophia Goulden, along with her daughter, Emmeline, was commemorated with a stamp issued by the Isle of Man Post Office celebrating the enfranchisement of women on the Isle of Man in 1881. In 2016, the Friends of Sophia Goulden was established in order to 'bring Sophia's role in the history of women's suffrage to greater public attention and to raise funds to create a suitable commemorative monument to her on the island.' In September 2018, a blue plaque in her honour was unveiled at her former home on Strathallan Crescent in Douglas on the Isle of Man where she lived at the end on her life. She was only the fourth person born on the Isle of Man to receive the honour. Her great-great-granddaughter, Helen Pankhurst said: \\"Sophia's role as a campaigner in the movement, and as mother guiding the interest of her more famous daughter, have so far received insufficient recognition. The plaque can start to change this. Moreover, it's fitting that this plaque will be put up on the Isle of Man, where Sophia came from and returned to, but also the nation that led the way in giving women the right to vote.\\" == References == Category:British feminists Category:British women's rights activists Category:Feminism and history Category:Emmeline Pankhurst Category:Manx women Category:1833 births Category:1910 deaths Category:Manx people Category:Deaths from pneumonia ","title":"Sophia Goulden"},{"id":"56806508","text":"Margaret Peterson (1902 - May 15, 1997) was an American painter of abstract art and known for creating a style that was highly influenced by the art of the Indigenous peoples of North America. == Biography == Peterson was born in Seattle, Washington in 1902. In the 1920s she studied at the University of California, Berkeley, graduating in 1926 with a Bachelor in Arts and soon joined its faculty of Fine Arts in 1928.

In 1951, she went to both Mexico and Guatemala and saw the arts of the Toltecs, Zapotecs, Aztecs, and Mayan cultures and also returned to Cowichan Bay. In 1952 she returned to San Francisco and founded a painting school. By 1956 she had moved to Victoria, BC. During the 1960s she would go on to learn mosaic techniques in Europe (1963), pursue a new interest in Romanesque and Medieval painting (1964), and have a mosaic of hers, Source of Sources (1964), installed in the McPherson Library at the University of Victoria. In the 1970s, she returned to Victoria (1974), created a mosaic for the Richard Blanshard building (1976-1977), and had a retrospective exhibition at the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria (1978). Her husband died in 1982 and Peterson died on May 15, 1997. == Artistic Practice == > Abstract art is to representative art what poetry is to prose. --Margaret > Peterson Throughout her career, Peterson drew from many influences, especially from abstract and Indigenous artworks. In her early career, she was mainly influenced by cubist and other modernist artists. She has said that after seeing work by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso, that ‚ÄúThey changed my direction in art, and life‚Äù. She was also influenced by the Mexican artists Carlos M√©rida and Rufino Tamayo, whom she had both met in Mexico City in 1934. From these influences came her interest in form ‚Äúas a symbol and a plastic constituent‚Äù and after 1949, as Colin Graham has said, her ‚Äúmain formal development after that date lay in her use of space, which became increasingly shallow.\\" She was also known to mainly work in egg tempera instead of oil paints, especially after 1934, which was connected to her interest in Medieval European painting and mixed her colors through overlapping layers on her canvas instead of her palette. Besides formal elements, she was also greatly interested in spirituality and human spiritual beliefs and practices. To Peterson, formal elements were not only lines and colors on a canvas, but, as she has said, ‚ÄúEvery line and every brush stroke is a vital related element to the total composition into which human thought has been transferred.\\" On the topic of abstract art, she has said, ‚ÄúIt is the act of man‚Äôs continual communion with the universe transformed as by magic into substance.\\" From this interest, she was also greatly influenced by the art and practices of many Indigenous groups, who she saw as giving form to universal forces. It is in this way that she believed ‚Äúart has been a summoning of those inexorable universal forces which man seeks but over which he has no control.\\" == Exhibitions  Solo Exhibitions === * California Palace of the Legion of Honor, San Francisco, California, 1933, 1960 * Biblioteca Nacional, Mexico City, 1934 * Henry Museum, Seattle, Washington, 1934 * The San Francisco Art Museum, Civic Center, 1950, 1958, 1973 * Du Casse Studio, San Francisco, 1958 * University of California, San Jos√©, 1958 * Monterey Peninsula Chapter of American Federation of Arts, California, 1965 * Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, British Columbia, 1950, 1959, 1962, 1978 === Group Exhibitions === * Fourth Biennal Exhibition of Canadian Art * Fifth Biennal Exhibition of Canadian Art * National Gallery, Ottawa, 1961, 1962 * S√£o Paulo Biennale, Brazil, 1963 == Awards == * Tansing Travelling Fellowship, University of California, 1931-1932 * First prize, San Francisco Women Artists, 1936, 1952 * Purchase Award San Francisco Art Association, 1942 * First Prize, San Francisco Art Association, 1947 * Blue Ribbon, Pacific Artists Festival, 1952 * Canada Council Senior Grant, 1963 == Collections == * Confederation Memorial Building, Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada * National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa * Oakland Art Museum, California * Palace of Legion of Honor, San Francisco, California * University of Victoria, British Columbia * Her personal papers are held at the University of Victoria Archives and were donated by the Greater Victoria Art Gallery in 2010 == References == Category:1902 births Category:American women artists Category:1997 deaths ","title":"Margaret Peterson (artist)"},{"id":"56806535","text":"Mutiny on the Blackhawk is a 1939 American adventure film, directed by Christy Cabanne.

Reece is of Cree, Tsimshian, Gitksan, and M√©tis descent. == Background == Skeena Reece was born in 1974 to Red Power movement activist Cleo Reece and internationally renowned carver Victor Reece. She studied at Northwest Community College and later at the Emily Carr University of Art and Design for media arts. She has been working in the arts since 1996 and currently is based out of Vancouver Island. She has also worked in administrative capacities such as the grunt gallery as a curatorial practices intern, founder of the Native Youth Artists Collective, and was Director of the Indigenous Media Arts Group from 2005 to 2007. == Artistic practice == > \\"I wanted to create this thing that was spiritually intangible and could > only be seen as something if you were here right now. And nobody can take > it, or even think about it or write about it or read about it later, you‚Äôve > kinda gotta be in it. It was just so magical I was like ‚Äòthat‚Äôs enough. It > doesn‚Äôt have to go anywhere from here.\\" - Skeena Reece, 2012 Reece is known for making works that deal with issues surrounding settler colonialism and its consequences on Indigenous peoples, especially women. Often these works unsettle and challenge their audiences. She also closely aligns herself and her artistic practice with the figure of the ‚Äúsacred clown‚Äù, a Hopi Indian figure who teaches lessons in uncouth ways. As well, she bases her work on trickster figures such as Coyote and Raven, who is seen as both a prankster, but also as wise. For example, in her performance, Raven on the Colonial Fleet (2010), she ‚Äúwears a corset, skirt and blanket designed with reference to traditional Northwest Coast Aboriginal Art and a feathered headdress referencing the Plains cultures.‚Äù Reece uses such regalia to make a political statement and to overturn Indigenous gender roles, for example by wearing a headdress that is usually reserved for men. Images of grenades, arms, and mythological figures cover her clothing to represent her as a ‚Äúfe/male warrior‚Äù and as a mythological figure, like Raven, coming to help fight against colonial violence. In 2010, she also performed this piece at the 17th Biennale in Sydney, Australia. As well, in a 2008 performance for the National Museum of the American Indian based on an episode of the television show, Moesha, she dressed up as a nurse and asked the audience, \\"Does anyone want to share any feelings you have about being a colonizer?\\" She proceeded to have another artist bring out a bucket of red paint in which he begins to paint ‚Äúone of Columbus's ships on a large board as Reece speaks about sexual fetishes, fear of government and the inaccurate portrayal of Indians on television.‚Äù Reece saw this ‚Äúas a metaphor for white people taking the blood of her people and painting their own history of them.‚Äù One song in her album Sweetgrass and Honey was created to honor carvers like her father and the Nuu- chah-nulth carver John T. Williams in Seattle that was shot by a police officer. On these issues, her work also deals with the act of caring and reconciliation. Such themes can be seen in her work Touch Me (2013), a video work made specifically for the 2013 exhibition, Witnesses: Art and Canada‚Äôs Indian Residential Schools. The fourteen minute video consists of Reece bathing Ukrainian-Canadian artist Sandra Semchuk. In the video, Reece washes Semchuk with a soap and cloth. Semchuk begins to tear up as Reece says ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù The film is influenced by her distant relationship with her parents, who were both Canadian Residential School survivors. The film is meant to be an act of reconnection between mother and daughter, child and elder, ‚Äúwanting to create a space in which touch, intimacy, and connection were animated, as well as a desire to perform a nurturing and loving act of bathing an elder inspired Reece to create this performance.‚Äù She also starred in a prominent role in the short film \\"Savage\\" about residential schools, along with Ta‚Äôkaiya Blaney, Doug Blamey, and Jennifer Jackson. The video won several awards including 2010 Genie award for Best Short Film, a Golden Sheaf Award for Best Multicultural Film, the ReelWorld Outstanding Canadian Short Film, and the Leo Awards for Best Actress and Best Editing. Recently, she has also made adult-sized moss bags, similar to swaddle bags meant to carry babies. They are meant to symbolize the care that families and communities give to new members and they are also a reminder that we always need care in our lives. == Exhibitions and performances == *2019 ‚Äì Surrounded: Skeena Reece, Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada *2018 ‚Äì Sweetgrass and Honey, Plug In ICA, Winnipeg and at the Comox Valley Art Gallery, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada *2017 ‚Äì Moss, Oboro Gallery, Montreal, Canada *2015 ‚Äì The Sacred Clown and Other Strangers, Urban Shaman Contemporary Aboriginal Art, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada *2013 ‚Äì Witnesses: Art and Canada‚Äôs Indian Residential Schools, Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada * 2012 ‚Äì BEAT NATION: Art, Hip Hop and Aboriginal Culture, Vancouver Art Gallery, British Columbia, Canada *2012 ‚Äì Like a Boss, The Power Plant, Toronto, Ontario, Canada *2011‚Äì Acting Out, Claiming Space, Modern Fuel Artist-Run Centre, Kingston, Ontario, Canada *2010 ‚Äì The Beauty of Distance: Songs of Survival in a Precarious Age, 17th Biennale of Sydney *2009 ‚Äì Please Do Not Disturb, Nuit Blanche, Toronto, Ontario, Canada *2009‚Äì Vampyre Love Ball, LIVE Biennale, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada *2008 ‚Äì UBC Museum of Anthropology, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada *2008‚Äì It‚Äôs not TV, It‚Äôs Indians!, National Museum of the American Indian, Washington DC, United States == Awards == * 2017 ‚Äì The Hnatyshyn Foundation, REVEAL: Indigenous Arts Award * 2014 ‚Äì VIVA Award, 2014 * 2012 ‚Äì British Columbia Creative Achievement Foundation, Award for First Nations Art == References  External links == *\\"Savage\\" by Lisa Jackson *\\"John Carver\\" song by Skeena Reece Category:M√©tis artists Category:First Nations performance artists Category:First Nations filmmakers Category:First Nations conceptual artists Category:Canadian performance artists Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian women artists Category:First Nations women ","title":"Skeena Reece"},{"id":"56806545","text":"Manuel Agust√≠n Fal√≥n (born 5 July 1995) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Sacachispas. ==Career== Fal√≥n's career began in 2017 with Argentine Primera Divisi√≥n side Hurac√°n.

He became famous for his deep knowledge of Karl Marx's work as well as for further developing Marxism through the dialectical sublation of its acquis. == Biography == V. A. Vaziulin was born in Zvenigorod, Moscow on 30 August 1932 and studied philosophy at Lomonosov University (1950-55), defended his PhD thesis at 1964 and his postdoctoral thesis at 1971. At 1964 he became professor at Lomonosov University, where he taught until his retirement. He also taught at the universities of Bratislava and Prague. He died in Moscow on 8 January 2012. == Work == V. A. Vaziulin wrote a novel, distinct direction in social theory, dialectical logic and science methodology. The main scientific achievements of V. A. Vaziulin include: # Revealed the logic of Karl Marx's \\"Capital: Critique of Political Economy\\" theory by a systematic, categorical, comparative evaluation of the \\"Capital's\\" politico-economic material alongside a parallel, critical analysis of Hegel‚Äôs \\"The Science of Logic\\". This comparative cross-examination enabled him to explore the methodology of the advanced scientific research, of the mature science as an organic whole. Within the framework of this logic and methodology are revealed- in \\"pure form\\"- i) the ascent from the abstract to the concrete in its dialectical unity with the ascent from the sensual- concrete to the abstract, ii) the logical in its unity with the historical and, iii) the reasonable aspect of thinking (germ. Vernunft) in unity with the intellectual (germ. Verstand). # # A concrete-historical approach of Marxism as a scientific system that is developed through the emergence and resolution of necessary contradictions. For Vaziulin, Marxism is a scientific system that consists of internally united- in their differences- components, each of which is at a certain level of its formation and development. This logical and methodological analysis of the history of Marxism paved the way for i) the discovery of the objective laws and contradictions (including the necessary fallacies) of the beginning, the emergence, the formation, and the maturity of the development of scientific research, i.e. the movement of cognitive thinking from the surface to the essence of the object (of the subject matter) and, ii) the development of the most promising components of Marxism. # # Revealed the inner, systematic interconnection of laws and categories of social theory which reflect the structure of the mature society and outlined the theoretical periodization of human history (the objective laws of its \\"ascent\\" from the beginning, the emergence, the formation, to the maturity) from the perspective of the interactions of natural and social factors. # The first two achievements are internally connected to the approach of scientific thinking as a natural-historical process. ==Bibliography== In Russian: * –õ–æ–≥–∏–∫–∞ ¬´–ö–∞–ø–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∞¬ª –ö.–ú–∞—Ä–∫—Å–∞, –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞ 1968, 2002. * –°—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –º–µ—Ç–æ–¥–∞ –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –ö.–ú–∞—Ä–∫—Å–∞ (–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∞—Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç), –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞ 1975, 2017 * –î–∏–∞–ª–µ–∫—Ç–∏–∫–∞ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–æ—Ü–µ—Å—Å–∞ –∏ –º–µ—Ç–æ–¥–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è –µ–≥–æ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è, –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞ 1978, 2007 * –õ–æ–≥–∏–∫–∞ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏. –í–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å—ã —Ç–µ–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –∏ –º–µ—Ç–æ–¥–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏, –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞ 1988, 2005, 2016.

Qamar was born in Karachi, Pakistan to a father from Bangladesh and a mother from Gujarat, India. Both parents are chemists. She was exposed to both Bengali culture and Gujarati culture growing up. In 2000, when she was nine, the family emigrated to Ontario, briefly residing in Scarborough. The family then moved to Mississauga, where she spent the rest of her childhood. She experienced prejudice and bullying against South Asian children in her school, especially in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. So as she later recalled, \\"I started going home and drawing comics about these experiences. But I would change the outcome. In my comics I always got the last laugh.\\" She aligned both with her Desi identity and with Western teen goth, punk rock, and heavy metal subcultures. She moved to Toronto and took a copywriting job in the advertising industry. This she did not like, and she was laid off around 2015. She then gained popularity as an artist through her Instagram page where she goes by the name of Hatecopy (the name indicating her feelings for her former field). As of 2019 she had a following of over 170,000 people on her Instagram platform. She is known for her satirical lens commenting on the hybridization of South Asian and Canadian culture. She uses a pop art aesthetic to create works that tackle themes surrounding her experiences of racism, the first generation experience, body shaming, classism, and the patriarchy. Her style is explicitly influenced by the work of Roy Lichtenstein and also by low culture such as Indian soap operas; one of her first works was captioned \\"what if Lichtenstein parodied Indian soap operas.\\" She does not translate her works for Western audiences, instead leaving South Asian terms and themes in unaltered as she focuses on a Desi audience. Qamar has sold work at exhibitions in Toronto, Los Angeles, New York and London. The Mindy Project creator and actor Mindy Kaling collects Qamar's work and her paintings decorated the set of that show. She had also created murals, signs, and menu and plate designs for restaurants in various North American cities. A 2019 exhibition, entitled \\"Fraaaandship!\\", at the Richard Taittinger Gallery in New York brought her additional visibility as the youngest artist at the gallery and the first to come from an Instagram background. Trust No Aunty won the 2018 Kobo Emerging Writer Prize for humour. == References == Category:Living people Category:Canadian women painters Category:21st-century Canadian painters Category:Pakistani emigrants to Canada Category:Naturalized citizens of Canada Category:People from Mississauga Category:People from Scarborough, Toronto Category:Artists from Toronto Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:21st-century Canadian women artists ","title":"Maria Qamar"},{"id":"56806746","text":"The 2019 Canadian federal election took place on Monday, 21 October 2019.

The second show to be broadcast under the title, it was the fourth and final television series by English comedy double-act Morecambe and Wise, and saw their return to ITV after their successful nine-year association with the BBC. ==History== In January 1978, Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise, just over four weeks after the broadcast of their successful 1977 Christmas Show on BBC1, which attracted an audience of just over 28m, announced that they had signed a contract with Thames Television to produce new shows for broadcast on ITV. This marked a return to commercial television for the pair, who between 1961 and 1968 had produced six series for ATV.McCann, p. 134 While their time at the BBC had been both a critical and ratings success, Morecambe and Wise retained an ambition to make films.McCann, p. 188 This was something that the BBC were not in a position to enable them to do, as, at the time, the Corporation did not have a motion picture production arm. Although evenly matched in the financial terms that were offered, it was the fact that Thames Television, through its film production company, Euston Films, were able to offer Morecambe and Wise the opportunity to make a film, that persuaded them to leave the BBC. Although Thames succeeded in persuading Morecambe and Wise to move, they were unsuccessful in their attempt to get the various individuals that worked alongside the duo in their productions to also make the switch; Ernest Maxin, who had been their producer/director since 1975, declined to leave, while Eddie Braben had an exclusive contract and was unable to write for anyone outside the BBC. As a consequence, Thames needed to make other arrangements for the upcoming production of their first shows. Keith Beckett was recruited as producer, while Barry Cryer and John Junkin, who had written sketches for Morecambe and Wise at the BBC, were brought in to do the scripts for their upcoming shows. For the first year with Thames, there was no series planned, with instead a single introductory special, plus the Christmas show, the only shows to be broadcast in 1978, with a plan for a subsequent series. In March 1979, Eric Morecambe suffered a second heart attack. Following a heart bypass operation, he was forced into an extended period of recuperation, with the result that there was no series that year, with their only appearance being a low-key Christmas special that was largely an extended interview with David Frost. By February 1980, Morecambe had regained his health sufficiently to start work on the first series for Thames. This saw the duo reunited with John Ammonds, their producer at the BBC from 1968 to 1974, who had agreed to take on the same role for them.McCann, p. 280 Additionally, Ammonds had made an arrangement with Eddie Braben to come and write for them as soon as he was available at the end of his contract with the BBC.McCann, p. 281 However, when the first series, which was eventually broadcast in September 1980, began, its running time had been reduced to 30 minutes, including a commercial break, which Braben found significantly more restrictive than the 45‚Äì50 minutes he had had at the BBC.McCann, p. 284 The struggle that Braben had to come up with fresh material led to increasing reuse of old ideas, while both Morecambe and Wise appeared to be less enamoured either with the process or product of their work. Morecambe in particular had intimated that, after nearly fifty years of working together, he wanted to do things away from the partnership.McCann, p. 290 Although they continued to work, producing four series for Thames, by 1983, having completed work on both that year's series and the planned film, which was produced as Night Train to Murder, Morecambe and Wise seemed agreed that the time had come to end their partnership.McCann, p. 292 ==List of episodesReception== Although the show received healthy ratings from the beginning, they were never at the same level as they had during the latter years at the BBC. The 1978 Christmas Show received in the region of 9.5m fewer viewers than the record-breaking effort of the previous year, while critics were only mildly complementary, with one describing it as \\"a somewhat grey- haired show\\". Ratings continued to drop as the series progressed, eventually garnering between 11m to 14m by the fourth and final series. The final Christmas Show, broadcast on Boxing Day 1983, was watched by 11.2m viewers. ==Aftermath== By 1984, Eric Morecambe had determined to enter a period of semi-retirement, as, in spite of the success of his heart operation five years previously, there were still worries about the state of his health. Indeed, during production of the 1983 Christmas Show, the filming of a sequence had led to him spending two nights in hospital after his heart went out of rhythm.McCann, p. 294 So, he sought to stop working and spend more time on things he enjoyed. This was especially the case with writing - he had completed and published a novel, Mr Lonely, while convalescing after his operation, and had written two children's books, The Reluctant Vampire and The Vampire's Revenge. During the beginning of 1984 he was completing a book about one of his other passions, fishing, and was in the process of writing a second adult novel. As the year progressed, concerns about his heart continued, to the extent that in May it was suggested he go for tests at the Harefield Hospital. He agreed to arrange this once he had completed some commitments over the Spring Bank Holiday weekend.McCann, p. 296 It was during one of these, a light-hearted question and answer event with his friend Stan Stennett in Tewkesbury, that, on 27 May 1984, Morecambe suffered his third, and fatal, heart attack.McCann, p. 299 Unlike his partner, Ernie Wise had little desire to retire, seeking out opportunities to continue working; in 1985, he toured a one-man show in Australia, while in 1987 he made a return to the West End stage after forty-one years in a musical version of The Mystery of Edwin Drood, before subsequently appearing in Run For Your Wife, and writing an autobiography.McCann, p. 304 He was also a regular panellist on the game show What's My Line (on which Morecambe had also made some of his last TV appearances in early 1984), as well as making several appearances in \\"Dictionary Corner\\" on Countdown, and writing a column on gardening for the News of the World. In 1993 he made his first appearance in pantomime without Morecambe, when he played the King in a production of Sleeping Beauty at the Theatre Royal, Windsor. The same year, he suffered the first of two strokes, the second of which, in 1995, led to him deciding to retire from showbusiness.McCann, p. 308 In December 1998, he suffered two successive heart attacks in a week while on holiday in Florida, and underwent a triple heart bypass operation. Having been flown back to the UK, Wise died on 21 March 1999. ==Home media releases== In 1980, Thames released a pair of VHS tapes; the first was the complete 1980 Christmas show, while the other was a compilation from the three that Morecambe and Wise had produced for the company at that point. The first shows from the Thames era, including the one- off special from 1978, seasonal shows from 1978 and 1980 and the David Frost programme from Christmas 1979 was released on DVD by the Network imprint on 11 April 2008 together with a second disc including the first series of Thames programmes from 1980. This was followed by a one-disc release, also by Network, which featured the three seasonal specials 1978-1980 only. No further plans have been announced by Network to release the final three series and seasonal specials broadcast during 1981-1983. ==NotesReferencesFurther reading== * * ==External links== * * Category:ITV sketch shows Category:Morecambe and Wise Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows produced by Thames Television Category:Television series by Fremantle (company) Category:1970s British television sketch shows Category:1980s British television sketch shows Category:1978 British television series debuts Category:1983 British television series endings ","title":"The Morecambe &amp; Wise Show (1978 TV series)"},{"id":"56806785","text":"is the assistant coach of the Levanga Hokkaido in the Japanese B.League. ==Head coaching record== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Bambitious Nara  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2014-15  521240 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"10th in Western---  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"- -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Saitama Broncos  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2015-16  52547 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"11th in Eastern---  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"- -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Shinshu Brave Warriors  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2016-17  601446 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"6th in B2 Central---  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"- -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Shinshu Brave Warriors  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"2017-18  602535 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"5th in B2 Central---  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"- -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Yamagata Wyverns  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2018-19  602238 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"5th in B2 Eastern---  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"- ==References== Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Bambitious Nara coaches Category:Japanese basketball coaches Category:Nippon Tornadoes coaches Category:Saitama Broncos coaches Category:Saitama Broncos players Category:Shimane Susanoo Magic coaches Category:Shinshu Brave Warriors coaches ","title":"Ryutaro Onodera"},{"id":"56806800","text":"Lorraine Hanson may refer to: *Lorraine Hanson (footballer) (born 1959), English footballer *Lorraine Hanson (sprinter) (born 1965), English sprinter ","title":"Lorraine Hanson"},{"id":"56806820","text":"This page describes the process of synapse stabilization mediated by cell adhesion molecules. To see related articles please see the pages on Synaptogenesis, Synaptic plasticity, Cell adhesion molecule, Development of the nervous system.right Synaptic stabilization is crucial in the developing and adult nervous systems and is considered a result of the late phase of long-term potentiation (LTP). The mechanism involves strengthening and maintaining active synapses through increased expression of cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix elements and postsynaptic scaffold proteins, while pruning less active ones. For example, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) play a large role in synaptic maintenance and stabilization. Gerald Edelman discovered CAMs and studied their function during development, which showed CAMs are required for cell migration and the formation of the entire nervous system. In the adult nervous system, CAMs play an integral role in synaptic plasticity relating to learning and memory. == Types of CAMs SynCAMs=== Synaptic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) play a crucial role in axon pathfinding and synaptic establishment between neurons during neurodevelopment and are integral members in many synaptic processes including the correct alignment of pre- and post-synaptic signal transduction pathways, vesicular recycling in regards to endocytosis and exocytosis, integration of postsynaptic receptors and anchoring to the cytoskeleton to ensure stability of synaptic components SynCAM‚Äôs (also known as Cadm or nectin-like molecules) are a specific type of synaptic CAM found in vertebrates that promotes growth and stabilization of excitatory (not inhibitory) synapses. SynCAM‚Äôs are localized primarily in the brain at both pre- and postsynaptic sites and their structures consist of intracellular FERM and PDZ binding domains, a single transmembrane domain, and three extracellular Ig-domains. During neurodevelopment, SynCAMs such as SynCAM1 act as ‚Äúcontact sensors‚Äù of axonal growth cones accumulating rapidly when axo-dendritic connections are made and helping to form a stable adhesion complex. synCAM1 along with neuroligin are the two CAM‚Äôs known to be sufficient to initiate the formation of presynaptic terminals, as addition of synCAM1 to media of co-cultured neuronal and non- neuronal cells lead to the establishment of presynaptic terminals. Homophillic binding of two synCAM1 molecules on the filopodia of axonal growth cone and dendritic spine allow for initial contact between pre- and postsynaptic cell to be made. synCAMs belong to the Ig superfamily of proteins. The cytosolic PDZ domains of synCAMs imbedded in the post-synaptic membrane interact with post-synaptic scaffold protein PSD-95 which helps anchor the complex to the underlying cytoskeleton. ===Cadherin-catenin=== Temporal and spatial distribution of N-cadherin complexes in the developing and mature synapse Cadherins are calcium- dependent, homophilic cell adhesion molecules that form complexes with cytosolic partners known as catenins. Components of this complex bind to a number of different scaffolding proteins, phosphotases, kinases, and receptors. Classical cadherins have five extracellular repeating structures which bind calcium, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tail with a distal cytosolic domain that binds a catenin partner. Recent work has implicated the cadherin-catenin complex in a number of different central nervous system processes such as synaptic stabilization and plasticity. Many cadherins in the central nervous system exhibit distinct spatial and temporal expression patterns. For example, N-cadherin is widely expressed at the developing synapse and later remains near the mature active zone implicating that this complex may be well-suited to provide a link between structural changes and synaptic stability. In fact, local synaptic activity changes impact the expression of the cadherin-catenin complexes. An increase in activity at a particular spine leads to the dimerization of N-cadherin which is then cleaved leading the repression of CBP/CREB transcription. This repression has many developmental and plasticity related implications. In the case of dendritic spine formation and pruning, a competition hypothesis has been proposed and corroborated. This hypothesis suggests that relative levels of cadherin-catenin complexes, which are distributed amongst spines in a local area in an activity-dependent manner, determines the fate of individual spines. That is, the inter-spine competition for Œ≤-catenin determines whether a spine will be matured (increased number of complexes) or pruned (decreased number of complexes). This is a critical mechanism during the refinement of cortical circuitry that occurs throughout development. ===Nectin=== Nectins are a distinct family of cell adhesion molecules. These CAMs are involved in the initial contact of presynaptic and postsynaptic neuronal processes during synapse formation. There are only four well characterized nectins at the synapse, they are Nectin-1, 2, 3, and 4. All membrane-bound nectins possess an extracellular region with three immunoglobulin-like loops. The furthest loop from the membrane is called the V-type loop and the two loops more interior are C2-type loops. Multiple nectins on one cell membrane will bind together at the V-type loop to form a cluster of nectin proteins, a process called cis-clustering. When two cells possessing individual cis-clusters come into contact they form a strong complex called a trans-interaction which provides adhesion and, in some cases, signaling between the two cells. The most robust knowledge of nectin‚Äôs role in synaptic stabilization comes from the synapses made between mossy fiber terminals and pyramidal cell dendrites in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. The nectins involved in formation and stabilization of this synapse are Nectin-1 and Nectin-3 which protrude from the plasma membrane of the postsynaptic cell and presynaptic cell, respectively, forming heterophilic extracellular contacts. The intracellular domain of all nectins directly bind to a protein called L-Afadin. L-Afadin is an actin binding protein that binds to the F-actin of the actin cytoskeleton. In this way, nectins form ridged connections of the cells actin architecture allowing for the synapse to develop in a controlled and stable environment. As synapses mature in the CA3 region, nectins and cadherins, which affiliate closely with one another in synaptic stabilization, are shifted to the periphery of the active zone and form the puncta adherens junction (PAJ). The PAJ functions much like the adherens junctions in epithelial tissues. The displacement of these CAMs and the formation of this junction provides the nascent synaptic membranes room to interact and mature while partitioning off the surrounding membrane and providing cytoskeletal fixation. thumbNeurexin-neuroligin interactions promote synapse stabilization. On the presynaptic side, neurexin associates with synaptotagmin, calcium channels. On the post-synaptic side, neuroligin PDZ domain interacts with scaffolding proteins that help cluster receptor channels. ===Neurexin-neuroligin=== Neurexin-Neuroligin interactions help establish the trans-synaptic functional asymmetry essential for the stabilization and maintenance of proper synaptic transmission. Presynaptic neurexin and its postsynaptic binding partner, neuroligin, complex early in neural development and are both known to be potent inducers of synaptogenesis. Non-neuronal cells that artificially express neurexin are sufficient to mobilize post-synaptic specializations in co-cultured neurons; neuroligin- expressing cells are likewise able to induce markers of pre-synaptic differentiation in neighboring neurons. However, while both play an important role in synaptogenesis, these cell adhesion molecule are not necessary for formation of neuronal connections during development. A triple knockout mouse mutant of either neurexins or neuroligins exhibit a normal number of synapses but express an embryonic lethal phenotype due to impairment of normal synaptic transmission. Therefore, they are not necessary for synapse formation per se but are essential for the maturation and integration of synapses into the functional circuits necessary for survival. Beyond their extracellular contact with each other, neurexins and neuroligins also bind intracellularly to a vast network of adaptor proteins and scaffolding structures, which in concert with the actin cytoskeleton, help localize necessary components of synaptic transmission. For example, the first neuroligin (NLGN1) discovered was identified by its PDZ domain which binds to PSD95, a well-known a scaffold protein at glutamatergic synapses that functionally links NMDA receptors to the proper post-synaptic locale. Similarly, another isoform of neuroligin (NLGN2) interacts with gephyrin, a scaffolding protein specific to GABA-ergic synapses, and is responsible for activation of the synaptic adapator protein collybistin. In the case of neurexins, their intracellular binding interactions are equally as important in recruiting the essential machinery for synaptic transmission at the active zone. Like neuroligins, neurexins possess a PDZ-domain that associates with CASK (Calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase). In addition to phosphorylating itself and neurexin, CASK promotes interactions between neurexins and actin binding proteins, thus providing a direct link by which neurexin can modulate cytoskeletal dynamics that is essential for synaptic stability and plasticity. Neurexin can also bind synaptotagmin, a protein embedded in the membrane of synaptic vesicles, and can also promote associations with voltage-gated calcium channel which mediate the ion flux required for neurotransmitter exocytosis upon synaptic stimulation. In this way, neurexin and neuroligin coordinate the morphological and functional aspects of the synapse which in turn permits nascent, immature contacts to stabilize into full-fledged functional platforms for neurotransmission. ===Ephrin-Eph signaling=== Ephrin A3/EphA4 signaling initiates a cascade of events that results in that regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Non-traditional adhesion molecules, such as the ephrins, also help stabilize synaptic contacts. Eph receptors and their membrane bound ligands, the ephrins, are involved in a variety of cellular processes during development and maturation including axon guidance, neuronal migration, synaptogenesis, and axon pruning. In the hippocampus, dendritic spine morphology may be regulated by astrocytes via bi-directional ephrin/EphA signaling. Astrocytes and their processes express ephrin A3, whereas the EphA4 receptor is enriched in hippocampal neurons. This interaction, mediated by ephrin A3/EphA4 signaling, induces the recruitment and activation of cyclin- dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), which then phosphorylates the guanine exchange factor (GEF), ephexin1. Phosphorylated ephexin1 can then activate the small GTPase, RhoA, leading to subsequent activation of its effector, Rho-kinase (ROCK), which results in the rearrangement of actin filaments. Through this mechanism, astrocytic processes are able to stabilize individual dendritic protrusions as well as their maturation into spines via ephrin/EphA signaling. Forward signaling involving the activation of EphA4 results in the stabilization of synaptic proteins at the neuromuscular junction. As in the EphA4/ephrinA3-mediated neuron‚Äìglia interaction, this process regulates dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton by activating ROCK through ephexin. Ephrin B/EphB signaling is also involved in synaptic stabilization through different mechanisms. These molecules contain cytoplasmic tails which interact with scaffolding proteins via their PDZ domains to stabilize newly formed CNS synapses. For example, Ephrin B3 interacts with the adaptor protein glutamate- receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP-1) to regulate the development of excitatory dendritic shaft synapses. This process, which was identified in cultures of hippocampal neurons, revealed that Eph/ephrin B3 reverse signaling recruits GRIP1 to the membrane of the postsynaptic shaft. Once at the membrane shaft, GRIP1 helps anchor glutamate receptors below the presynaptic terminal. This process also involves the phosphorylation of a serine residue near the ephrin-B carboxyl terminus (proximal to the PDZ-binding motif) that leads to the stabilization of AMPA receptors at synapses. Another mechanism, found in hippocampal neurons, revealed that EphB signaling could promote spine maturation by modulating Rho GTPase activity, as observed with EphAs. Unlike EphAs, however, the EphB2 receptor has been shown to interact with the postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) to recruit the GEF Tiam1 to the complex upon ephrinB binding. Phosphorylation of Tiam1 occurs in response to NMDAR activity, which allows for the influx of calcium that activates Tiam1. This mechanism also results in the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton. As a result of this stabilization, both EphB2 forward signaling and ephrin-B3 reverse signaling has been found to induce LTP via NMDARs. == References == Category:Neuroscience ","title":"Synaptic stabilization"},{"id":"56806829","text":"Phulwari is a 1984 Indian Hindi-language drama film directed by Mukul Dutt and produced by Tarachand Barjatya. \\\\- \\\\- The screenplay was also written by Dutt.

While playing the flute, they are interrupted by the sudden arrival of a beautiful young woman at his room. The young woman happens to be Lali, the younger sister of Arun. On the next day, He drops Rajiv to his allocated office. Rajiv attends Lali's birthday party but is interrupted by Pyare, a servant at Arun's house, who informs him that a man from his provision has been severely bitten by a mad dog and immediately needs to be taken to the doctor. Just when Rajiv is about leave, Lali stalls him saying that it is simply Pyare's job to take the wounded man to the doctor. She continues saying that this whole thing is being done in order to spoil her birthday party. Rajiv is stunned at Lali's rudeness and openly declares that she is selfish who does not care for anyone except herself. Lali once comes to visit Rajiv and apologises for her behaviour to him. Eventually she began to visit him and Rajiv slowly forms an affection towards her. Lali, one day inquires Rajiv as to whether he loves her. Rajiv initially fumbles but finally confesses to her his feelings.Lali also smartly declares that she is also in love with him. Arun arranges for Rajiv and Lali's wedding. In the meantime Lali once arrives at Rajiv's place but is unable find him there. She looks for him here and there and discovers him along with Mangli, his maid servant in a brook. Lali forms the prejudice that Rajiv has an illegitimate affair with Mangli and intends to marry her only because of her wealth. On the day of their wedding Lali fumes at Rajiv. She declares in front of everyone that she is no more willing to marry him as she thinks that he is a fraud and hypocrite. Mangli comes to visit Lali and reveals that she accidentally fell into the brook and Rajiv luckily saved her life on the day she discovered them far from the top of the hill. A repentant Lali, once again arrives at Rajiv's place but discovers that Rajiv has left without any information about where he has headed to. Gradually, Lali becomes dejected and to find solace she goes on a pilgrimage. Once standing on the bank of a river, she feels that her life has come to a meaningless term. Feeling guilty, she flings herself into the river but is saved by some of the people who were present at that moment. When she regains her consciousness, she meets an elderly woman to whom she tells everything about her life. Now that woman endeavours to reinstate her faith and hope. Coincidentally Rajiv appears and it is discovered that he is the son of that woman. Lali fails to restrain her tears and falls at his feet. Rajiv forgives her and they reunite. ==Cast== *Debashree Roy as Lali Choudhury *Shashi Puri as Rajiv Mathur *Rakesh Bedi *Iftekhar *Benjamin Gilani *Rajendra Nath *Pallavi Dutt (Introducing - her first film) *Dinesh Hingoo *Mohan Choti *Ashok Saraf *Jayshree T. *Rakesh Bedi *Junior Mehmood ==Crew== {  !

It was the first time that the event was held in North East England. The men's 10,000 metres was dropped from the programme and replaced by a 3000 metres event. Strong winds affected the jumps programme and several of the sprint races. It was the thirteenth edition of the competition limited to British athletes only, launched as an alternative to the AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors. However, due to the fact that the calibre of national competition remained greater at the AAA event, the UK Championships this year were not considered the principal national championship event by some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS). Many of the athletes below also competed at the 1989 AAA Championships.UK Championships. GBR Athletics. Retrieved 2018-02-25.AAA WAAA and National Championships Medalists. NUTS. Retrieved 2018-02-25. Shot putter Judy Oakes won a sixth straight title and women's 400 m hurdler Elaine McLaughlin made it three consecutive wins for her. Three other athletes defended their 1988 UK titles: Ian McCombie (racewalk), Steve Backley (javelin) and Linda Keough (400 m). Liz McColgan won the women's 3000 metres, having been 5000 metres champion the previous year. Marcus Adam was the only athlete to win multiple titles that year, taking a men's short sprint double. The main international track and field competition for the United Kingdom that year was the 1989 IAAF World Cup, where the men's team competed and women competed as part of the European team. Reflecting the secondary nature of the UK event, most of the individual British medallists at the World Cup did not compete here. Among those that did were Colin Jackson (hurdles runner-up), Stewart Faulkner (long jump bronze medallist), Jonathan Edwards (triple jump bronze medallist) and Steve Backley (javelin champion).IAAF World Cup In Athletics.

It was published in 1831 and is one of the √âtudes philosophiques of La Com√©die humaine. ==Background== The plot was inspired by a story told to Balzac by a former army surgeon, whose friend had been unjustly tried and executed. ==Plot summary== The story is told in the first person by an unnamed narrator. He attends a dinner party in Paris. A German guest named Hermann is asked to tell a story. Hermann's story occurs in 1799 in Andernach on the Rhine in Germany. At that time it was occupied by France. Two young French doctors from Beauvais arrive in the town to serve with the French regiment stationed there. They arrange to spend the night at an inn called the Red Inn, because of its colour. A German businessman named Walhenfer also arrives there to spend the night. The inn is full, and the only place for the three new arrivals to spend the night is in the main dining room. Over dinner Walhenfer confesses to the two young doctors that he is carrying a bag full of gold and diamonds. Hermann remembers that the name of one of the French doctors is Prosper Magnan, but cannot remember the other's name. During that night Magnan thinks about murdering Walhenfer, and running away with his valuables. He actually gets a knife out of his surgical bag to perform this. But he has second thoughts, and leaves the inn to go for a walk. After walking for some time, he returns to the inn and goes to bed. When he wakes up in the early morning, he finds that Walhenfer has been beheaded with his surgical knife. Magnan faints and falls into the pool of blood. When he wakes again he has been arrested by the French soldiers. Magnan's friend and Walhenfer's valuables are both missing, however because Magnan is covered in blood and his own knife was used, the soldiers suspect that Magnan is the murderer. Magnan was also seen walking outside, and is suspected of having buried Walhenfer's treasure. Magnan is sent to the town's prison, and it is there that he meets Hermann, who is under arrest for trying to start a rebellion against the French. Magnan tells Hermann everything that has happened, and says that he is innocent. However at the court martial, he is found guilty, and is executed. Whilst Hermann has been telling this story, the narrator notices that another guest, a wealthy man named Frederic Taillefer has been very agitated. The narrator suspects that Taillefer is the unnamed doctor in Hermann's story, especially when Hermann belatedly remembers that the other doctor was named Frederic. The narrator asks Taillefer if he is from Beauvais, and Taillefer confirms that he is. Taillefer then tries to avoid the narrator. The narrator has in the meantime fallen in love with a girl that he has seen at the party, and is shocked to discover that she is Taillefer's daughter Victorine. After the party, the narrator continues to court Victorine, and occasionally also see her father. The narrator is then in a dilemma, and hosts a dinner party to which he invites 17 of his friends to ask them whether he should marry Victorine, even though he believes her father is a murderer. After explaining the problem they hold a secret ballot to determine whether he should marry her. They vote 9 to 8 against. However, the narrator is suspicious that the 9 against votes were from his younger friends who wish to marry Victorine themselves. The story concludes with one of the older guests telling the narrator that he was foolish to ask Taillefer whether he was from Beauvais. ==Recurring characters== The Taillefers also appear in the novel P√®re Goriot. ==Adaptation== The story was the basis for a French film version in 1923, directed by Jean Epstein. The films of the same name of 1951 and 2007 are based on unrelated events at Auberge rouge. ==References *\\"The Red Inn\\", translation (by Katharine Prescott Wormeley) at Project Gutenberg (full text) * Audiobook production by Peter Strahm Category:1831 short stories Category:French short stories Category:Books of La Com√©die humaine Category:Short stories by Honor√© de Balzac Category:Short stories adapted into films ","title":"L'Auberge rouge (short story)"},{"id":"56807017","text":"Sevira (a Vulgar Latin spelling of the Classical Latin name Severa) is purported daughter of the Roman Emperor Magnus Maximus and wife of Vortigern mentioned on the fragmentary, mid-ninth century C.E.

A synthetic patient has no confidentiality restrictions and thus can be used by anyone to practice machine learning algorithms.\\" ==Background== EMRs contain sensitive personal information. For example, they may include details about infectious diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or they may contain information about a mental disorder. They may also contain other sensitive information such as medical details related to fertility treatments. Because EMRs are subject to confidentiality requirements, accessing and analyzing EMR databases is a privilege given to only a small number of individuals. Individuals who work at institutions that do not have access to EMR systems have no opportunity to gain hands-on experience with this valuable resource. Simulated medical databases are currently available; however, they are difficult to configure and are limited in their resemblance to real clinical databases. Generating highly accessible repositories of artificial patient EMRs while relying only minimally on real patient data is expected to serve as a valuable resource to a broader audience of medical personnel, including those who reside in underdeveloped countries. ==Academic use== In April 2018 Bioinformatics (journal) published a study that relied on EMRBots data to create a new R package denoted as \\"comoRbidity\\". Co-authors on the study included scientists from Universitat Pompeu Fabra and Harvard University. The repositories have been used to accelerate research, e.g., researchers from Michigan State University, IBM Research, and Cornell University published a study in the Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) conference. Their study describes a novel neural network that performs better than the widely used long short-term memory neural network developed by Sepp Hochreiter and J√ºrgen Schmidhuber in 1997. In May 2018 scientists from IBM Research and Cornell University have used the repositories to test a new deep architecture denoted as Health-ATM. To demonstrate superiority over traditional neural networks, they applied their architecture to a congestive heart failure use case. Additional use includes The University of Chicago creating a highly-detailed tutorial demonstrating how to use R using the repositories, University of California Merced, and The University of Tampere, Finland.

Further in March, scientists from multiple institutions, including Peking University, University of Tokyo, and Polytechnic University of Milan used the repositories to develop a new framework focused on medical information privacy. ==Use in hackathons== Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University used EMRBots data at the CMU HackAuton hackathon to create a prediction tool. Additional uses are available. EMRBots were presented at HackPrinceton 2018 organized by Princeton University. EMRBots were presented at TreeHacks 2019 organized by Stanford University. ==Availability== The repositories can be downloaded after registration. The repositories are available to download from Figshare without registration. Full source code for creating the repositories is available to download from Figshare. All source code for EMRBots is available in Elsevier's Software Impacts GitHub site. ==Northwell Health's EMRBot== In May 2018 Northwell Health funded a project denoted as EMRBot in the health system's third annual innovation challenge. Northwell Health's EMRBot, however, is neither related to Uri Kartoun's website (registered as a domain name in April 2015; www.emrbots.org) nor to any of its repositories or applications. ==Criticism== \\"[EMRBots] are ... pregenerated datasets of synthetic EHR with an insufficient explanation of how the datasets were generated. These datasets exhibit several inconsistencies between health problems, age, and gender.\\" An additional criticism is described in a thesis (\\"Realism in Synthetic Data Generation\\") granted by Massey University. ==Other Synthetic Medical Data Resources== CareCloud MDClone SyntheticMass SynTReN ==References== Category:Electronic health record software Category:Medical scoring system ","title":"EMRBots"},{"id":"56807057","text":"Lu Po-chi (; born 11 May 1949) is a Taiwanese politician.

Outside of politics, he had invested in Huilan Television. ==Political career== Prior to contesting the legislative elections of 2001, Lu served three terms on the Hualien County Council. His victory over Michael You in the legislative primaries held that April was considered unexpected, and subsequently he was elected to represent the Hualien County district in December. Shortly after taking office in February 2002, Lu received a single vote in a speakership election won by Wang Jin-pyng. The next year, Lu led You's campaign as he contested the Hualien County magistracy. As leader of the Democratic Progressive Party's campaign headquarters, Lu coordinated party efforts on behalf of its 2004 presidential ticket. During Lu's first term, he supported the establishment of direct flights between Hualien Airport and Seoul. In November 2004, Lu proposed that freeing captured animals be prohibited, to prevent commercialization of the release. Lu was again named a DPP legislative candidate in 2004, and was reelected alongside Fu Kun-chi. Lu backed the construction of a freeway between Hualien and Yilan during his second term in office. The DPP nominated Lu as its candidate for the Hualien County magisterial election in 2005. He lost the contest to Hsieh Shen-shan.

He is best known for his legal work on behalf of death row clients, political protesters, the homeless population of Denver, and his suit to have the Colorado River recognized as a legal person. He was also a lead organizer of the protests against the 2004 Republican National Convention. He lives in Denver, Colorado. ==Biography== Jason Flores- Williams' parents are Camille Flores, a New Mexican journalist and newspaper editor, and Drake Williams, a CPA and small business owner. He was raised in Texas outside of Houston. In the early 1980s, he moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico with his family. There, his father was convicted along with his twin brother of involvement with illicit drug trafficking and was sentenced to 35 years in prison. After his father's conviction, Flores-Williams dropped out of high school and moved to Washington, DC, where he self-educated at the Library of Congress and got his GED. He spent the late 80s living in Harlem across from the Apollo Theater, and graduated from Hunter College at CUNY with an honor's degree in Philosophy. He spent the early 90s in Prague where he wrote and worked as the first pizza delivery boy in post-Soviet Eastern Europe. He later moved to San Francisco to focus on writing. He is the grandson of William Flores, one of the founding fathers of League of United Latin American Citizens. ==Literary career== After moving to San Francisco, Flores-Williams' first book was End of the West. Published in 1996, it describes his bohemian lifestyle in the city. His follow up novel, Last Stand of Mr. America was a called \\"a ferocious portrait of a San Francisco public relations yuppie who lives a double life in underground sex clubs seeking salvation and meaning\\" and Flores-Williams was called \\"an all-American outlaw and edge-walker in the tradition of Jack Kerouac, Charles Bukowski, and Biggie Smalls\\" by novelist David Gates. He was also helped start the Litstock festival. After traveling to Scotland to get a 2nd edition of the novel published in 2004, Flores- Williams moved to New York where he became a blogger for High Times. ==Activism and legal career== In the September/October 2004 edition of High Times entitled, How to get Arrested, Jason Flores-Williams wrote the lead article entitled, A Call to Resistance, a guide for people looking to protest the 2004 Republican National Convention In May 2004, he was arrested leading a die-in staged on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to protest the invasion of Iraq by the US. After the convention protests, Flores-Williams became disillusioned with protest politics and completed his law degree at Rutgers Law School. After graduating from law school, Flores-Williams worked for the Capital Appeals Project representing indigent clients on death row in post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans. He moved back to Santa Fe, and represented US fugitive from justice and former Republic of New Afrika member Charlie Hill in his attempts to prevent his extradition from Cuba to face murder charges for the alleged killing a police officer. Hill was eventually allowed by the Cuban government to remain in the country and not extradited to the US. He also represented a Vietnam Veteran suffering from PTSD who was denied benefits from the Veterans Administration because he lived in Cuba, which the veteran eventually lost. After moving to Denver, Flores-Williams represented a group of homeless people living in Denver in a class-action lawsuit seeking an end to the city's practice of confiscating their property and the clearing their encampments from the city streets. It was alleged that the city had used flamethrowers to burn the homeless people's possessions after the raids and held a BBQ where the sweeps had occurred. Class-action status for the homeless people suing the city was initially denied, but was ultimately approved. Three of the homeless people who were a part of the lawsuit were convicted of violating the city's ordinance on camping. After the mass arrests at the DisruptJ20 during the Inauguration of President Donald Trump in January 2017, Flores-Williams was the attorney for the first three defendants facing charges of property destruction or assaults on police. In September 2017, Flores- Williams filed a controversial lawsuit on behalf of the Colorado River claiming that the river is a legal person and suing the state of Colorado and current Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper \\"for violating the river‚Äôs 'right to exist, flourish, regenerate, be restored, and naturally evolve.'\\" The lawsuit was eventually dismissed with prejudice by Flores-Williams due to the threat of legal sanctions from the Colorado Attorney General's Office who stated, \\"the case itself unacceptably impugned the State‚Äôs sovereign authority to administer natural resources for public use, and was well beyond the jurisdiction of the judicial branch of government.\\" Flores-Williams stated regarding the dismissal, ‚ÄúSituations change, and what is best for the rights of nature movement is not to get involved in a lengthy sanctions battle, but to move forward with seeking environmental justice.‚Äù The law firm of Jason Flores-Williams, with offices in Denver and Washington D.C, is now establishing an office in Mexico City to restart the family tradition of the fight for justice. The Mexico City Office collaborates with human rights groups in Latin America to bring class action litigation on the U.S. side of the border. Litigation focused on the development and assertion of rights for migrants and others who have been forced to abandon their homelands due to socioeconomic and environmental violence. Along with enforcing currently established rights, the strategic mission of the Mexico City Office is to assert rights for rights-less people through litigation utilizing a synthesis of American constitutional and international law. ==Bibliography== * Flores- Williams, J.

The British captured her in 1798 and Prinsep & Saunders purchased her and named her Young Nicholas. She made one voyage under license from the British East India Company (EIC) that resulted in legal difficulties. Next she had a short, unsuccessful cruise as a privateer that resulted in a French privateer capturing her in a single-ship action, but then releasing her. Lastly, she made a third cruise that resulted in French privateer capturing her, the Royal Navy recapturing her, and her being wrecked in a hurricane. This cruise too resulted in legal difficulties culminating in a notable court case. ==Career== Young Nicholas entered Lloyd's Register (LR) in 1798 with D. Ferris, master, Prinsep & Co., owners, and trade London-Cape of Good Hope.LR (1798), \\"Y\\" Supple. pages. However, Young Nicholass first voyage, in 1798, was to St Petersburg. In September she was at Elsinore, and by end-September had returned to Elsinore from there. ===Cape of Good Hope=== Captain Daniel Ferris acquired a letter of marque on 16 January 1799. However, Captain Richard Silby (or Tilby), acquired one on 26 January. Young Nicholas arrived at the Cape on 12 June 1799. It is not clear what Young Nicholas did between her arrival in June and early 1800. She is recorded as arriving again at the Cape from Saldanha Bay on 18 January 1800. However, in early 1800 Messrs. Walker and Peters purchased 367 bags of Java coffee and one case of gum Benjamin at a prize court sale of the cargo of the Danish ship Christianus Septimus. They also purchased three cases of bandannoes and three cases of tamarinds from the prize cargo of the American ship Pacific. Walker and Peters loaded their purchases aboard Young Nicholas as she was preparing to sail to England. However, they could not get permission to export their purchases and requested that they be allowed to unload the cargo and put it under the \\"King's Locks\\" until they could the authorities could advise on its export or disposal. They received permission to land the goods. However, Henry James Jessup, Chief Searcher of His Majesty's Customs at the Cape, on the advice of Peter Mosse, Advocate, requested that W.S. van Ryneveld, the King's Fiscal, detain Young Nicholas and seize the cargo that had come from Christianus Septimus. Because Christianus Septimus had been ruled not a prize, her carrying cargo from east of the Cape, to wit, Batavia, to England represented a violation of the British East India company's monopoly. When the goods were landed, Jessup seized them. The merchants involved had the authorization under a law of colony to ship them to England. Charges and counter-charges were made, and several people were relieved of their offices, Jessup among them. They then sailed to England. The government in May 1800 chartered Young Nicholas for a year in what appeared to have been a highly irregular arrangement. The government agreed with Walker & Robertson to a charter at rate of ¬£1200 per month. Walker & Robertson agreed a parallel charter with captain Selby on a rate of ¬£591 per month. The only other difference between the two charters was that the value in case of the loss of Young Nicholas was stated as ¬£6000 on the charter to the government, and ¬£4000 on the parallel charter to Walker and Robertson. Next, Young Nicholas was one of 28 vessels that left England between December 1800 and February 1801 to bring back rice from the Cape of Good Hope or beyond. The EIC had a monopoly on such trade and the vessels and sailed under charter to it. Prinsep & Saunders alone tendered 15 vessels, including Young Nicholas, Richard Silby, master. The government took up Young Nicholas at the Cape in early November 1802 to transport 160 to 170 tons of cannon and some officers and 250 invalids to Spithead. Lieutenant Street, the agent for transports, was placed in charge of her. Young Nicholas arrived at Portsmouth on 18 February 1803. The report of her arrival described her as a hired armed transport under the command of Lieutenant B. Street, and bringing ordnance stores, 200 invalids, and some passengers.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 9, p.164. Actually, the invalids she had embarked numbered 193 men, 20 men, and 15 children, the women and children presumably the dependents of the men. ===Privateer=== In June 1803, after the resumption of war with France, Young Nicholas became a privateer, with Captain John Cunditt acquiring a letter of marque. On 7 July Young Nicholas encountered the French privateer , of 22 guns and 100 men. The ensuing engagement lasted an hour and a half before Young Nicholas struck after she had suffered four men killed. Captain Aregnaudeau of Blonde gave Young Nicholas up to Captain Cunditt and his crew in recognition of their \\"courageous Conduct\\", and she arrived at Penzance on the 29th.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4372. ===Last voyage=== On 3 September 1803 Prinsep & Co. and Hunter signed a charter party. Young Nicholas was to sail to Honduras to gather mahogany, 60 tons of dye wood, and logwood or fustic. She gathered 200,000 feet of wood and sailed for London on 29 March 1804. A storm on 21 April so damaged Young Nicholas that she had to put into port to effectuate repairs. Lloyd's List reported on 29 May that Young Nicholas had been parted with off Charleston in a leaky state. She intended to put into Charleston.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4475. Lloyd's List reported about a month later that Young Nicholas, Henry, master, had put into Savannah in distress. She was reported to be sailing from Honduras to London.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4464. To pay for the necessary repairs Young Nicholass master sold part of her cargo. Young Nicholas, Horry, master, sailed from Savannah on 8 July. The next day a French privateer captured her and sent her to Guadeloupe. Eventually, Captain Horry arrived at Liverpool in Daphne.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4476. On 6 August, recaptured Young Nicholas, which was laden with mahogany. Hippomenes sent her into St Kitts.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4495. On 3 September 1804 a hurricane at St Kitts drove her ashore, wrecking her. She was one of five ships and several small craft that the hurricane destroyed. All crews were saved.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4502. ==Court case== When Young William came in to St Kitts as a prize, the Vice admiralty court ordered her sold, together with her cargo. Captain Horry/Henry then brought the proceeds home with him and passed them to Princep & Saunders, who deducted freight charges from them. The owners of the cargo sued for the return of the freight charges. The charter party specified that one-third of the freight was due on the cargo's arrival in England, and two-thirds some 90 days later. The court agreed with the plaintiff, Hunter, that as the cargo had not arrived in England no freight was due and so Prinsep & Saunders were required to refund the charges. ==Notes, citations, and references== Notes Citations References * * *Hyde East, Sir Edward (1809) \\"Hunter against Princep and others\\".

She is best known for her portraits and still life. The Museum of Brisbane (formerly Brisbane's Civic Art Gallery) holds a large collection of her works. == Early life == Caroline Barker was born on 8 September 1894 in Ascot Vale, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. She commenced her art studies at the art school at the Melbourne Art Gallery (now the National Gallery of Victoria) where she studied painting with Bernard Hall and drawing with Frederick McCubbin. There she was awarded second prize for her monochrome painting in 1917, which provided her with a year's free tuition, enabling her to complete her studies in 1919. Due to her father's ill-health, the family relocated to Brisbane in Queensland in 1920. From 1921 to 1922, Barker became an art teacher at the Ipswich Girls Grammar School, saving her money in order to continue her studies in England. She continued her studies at the Royal Academy of Arts in Piccadilly, London under Frederick Cayley Robinson and Charles Sims, where she also studied anatomy and the chemistry of painting, and then at the Byam Shaw School of Art under Vicat Cole. During this period her works were added to the collections of the Royal Academy, the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, the Paris Salon and the Byam Shaw. == Artist career == Portrait of Rhonda Kelly by artist Caroline Barker, 1942 Barker returned to Brisbane in November 1926. Initially she worked in the studios of Vida Lahey and Daphne Mayo before establishing her own studio in George Street. In 1928, Barker painted a portrait of Lord Mayor of Brisbane William Jolly in his mayoral robes and exhibited it at the Royal Queensland Art Society. Charles Herbert Gough was so impressed by the work that he initiated a public subscription to purchase the portrait as a gift for the mayor from the citizens of Brisbane. As Jolly was a popular mayor, the public were generous in their donations and the portrait was presented to the mayor in December 1928. Two of her works were used by The Queenslander newspaper for their colour covers, one of poinsettias in 1930 and another of gerbras and bougainvillea in 1931. Barker taught art at a number of schools including Somerville House (1935-1946), Loreto College Coorparoo, Clayfield College, and St Margaret's Anglican Girls' School and at her own home.

Her formative years as an artist were in the 1970s in Melbourne and London. In 1972, she completed a Diploma of Painting at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School, Melbourne. In 1973, she completed a Diploma of Education at the State College of Victoria. She had her first solo show in 1973. Early influences on her practice include conceptual art, feminism and the punk scene in London and Melbourne. Uniquely, her work takes these influences into the domain of figurative painting. She has developed her own visual language that frequently combines text with images. She currently mentors at Queensland College of Art, Griffith University. == Career == Watson came to prominence in Australia during the 1980s, a period in Australian art history when the relationship between word and image, painting and photography, and art and popular culture were important themes. Her work is part of this investigation of ideas about visual representation that characterised conceptualism and critical postmodernism. Both conceptualism and critical postmodernism stress distancing from the subject matter they represent, whether through deadpan presentation of material or an ironic tone, in contrast Watson's practice frequently suggests an intimate or personal approach to her material. Watson said of her approach: ‚ÄúI quickly realised that being a serious woman artist was not unusual, and with that possibility established, it allowed me to develop the work more radically, away from figuration towards philosophical, conceptual practice, and ultimately towards my own autobiographical take.‚Äù Watson's work has been described as confessional by art historian Benedikt Stegmayer thereby positioning her work alongside the work of younger artists such as Tracey Emin.Benedikt Stegmayer, \\"Jenny Watson\\" Autobiography as Fictive Construct: Confession, Jenny Holzer, Jenny Watson, Tracey Emin (Berlin: Verlag fur zeitgenossische Kunst and Theorie, 2015) In Watson's work it is unclear whether the paintings are autobiographical or not. In 1993, she represented Australia at the 45th Venice Biennale.

Horowitz produced the film along with Mickey Lidell and Pete Shilaimon. It stars Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Lorraine Toussaint, Saniyya Sidney, Christopher Denham and David Strathairn, and tells the story of Ruth (Mbatha-Raw), a woman with supernatural powers on the run from law enforcement and scientists who want to study and control her. The project was announced in January 2017, along with Mbatha-Raw's casting and that LD Entertainment would be fully financing the project on their own. Principal photography began on March 13, 2017 in New Mexico and lasted for 28 days. The film had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 10, 2018. It was released on April 19, 2019, by Codeblack Films. The film received positive reviews from critics with praise directed at Mbatha-Raw's performance and its uniqueness compared to other superhero films, but with criticism aimed at the script. A television series based on the film is in development at Amazon Studios, with Viola Davis' JuVee Productions producing, and with the film's original writers returning to script the show. ==Plot== In the future American Midwest, where it has not rained for eight years, Ruth (Gugu Mbatha- Raw) is a homeless wanderer whose seizures trigger supernatural earthquakes. As she travels to her old family home, she meets Bill (Christopher Denham), a diner customer who is actually a scientist attempting to capture Ruth for study. Bill tricks her into accepting a ride with him then attempts to draw blood samples from her, but Ruth wounds him and flees in the direction of her home. Bill is forced to abandon his vehicle to seek medical aid, where it catches the attention of the local sheriff Ellis (David Strathairn). Arriving at the home, Ruth reunites with her mother Bo (Lorraine Toussaint), who has the ability to telekinetically disintegrate objects, reassemble them, and see vibrant flashes known as \\"the colors\\". Bo has been taking care of Ruth's daughter Lila (Saniyya Sidney), who has the same powers as Bo and has no memories of her mother. After Ruth accidentally sets off another earthquake, Lila is introduced to her and they explain that Ruth's powers deteriorated in her childhood, becoming destructive and causing her to abandon her family. Lila and Bo attempt to train Ruth on reconnecting with her old powers, while the scientist and the sheriff investigate Ruth's trail. When Ellis discerns Ruth is back home, he covertly signals Bo, his longtime friend and lover, to warn her about the scientist that is searching for their daughter. The next morning, Bill begins heading for the women's house, and Ruth takes off in the family truck to escape him, leaving Bo and Lila behind. When she exits miles later for gasoline, her seizures return. Ruth relives the memory of her nearly drowning her then-infant daughter during a past episode, and then of saving her life, emotionally healing and causing the sky to rain again. Ruth returns home, where Ellis informs her that Bill and his accomplices kidnapped Lila. Ruth goes to rescue her, followed by Ellis and Bo. At the sheriff's office where Lila is being held, Ruth creates a storm and panics Bill and his guards. Bo offers herself to the scientists in exchange for Lila, who is reunited with her mother. The two escape in the truck, and find a note from Bo telling them to head for Rome to find another woman that she used to know with powers. ==Cast== * Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Ruth ** Aliza Halm as young Ruth * Lorraine Toussaint as Bo * Saniyya Sidney as Lila, Ruth's daughter * Christopher Denham as Bill * David Strathairn as Ellis * Levi Dylan Martinez as Henry ==Production== In January 2017, it was announced Gugu Mbatha-Raw had joined the cast of the film, with Julia Hart directing, from a screenplay written by Hart and Jordan Horowitz. Horowitz, Mickey Liddell and Pete Shilaimon will produce under their Original Headquarters and LD Entertainment banners, respectively. In March 2017, Lorraine Toussaint, David Strathairn, Saniyya Sidney, and Christopher Denham joined the cast of the film. ===Filming=== Principal photography began in New Mexico on March 13, 2017 and lasted for 28 days. ==Release== The film had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 10, 2018. Shortly after, Codeblack Films acquired distribution rights to the film and set it for a March 29, 2019, release. It was then pushed back to April 19, 2019. ===Critical reception=== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 81% based on 85 reviews, and an average rating of 6.81/10. The website's critic consensus states: \\"A grounded superhero story with more on its mind than punching bad guys, Fast Color leaps over uneven execution with a single Gugu Mbatha-Raw performance\\". On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 64% based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3.5 stars and praised Mbatha-Raw for her performance, and director Julia Hart for \\"genuinely moving drama, an engrossing, supernatural-sci-fi mystery and some pretty darn impressive special effects.\\" Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"Hart has fashioned a tale of matriarchal inheritance, but one whose fierce message is undercut rather than deepened by its child's-book clarity. The intriguing setup receives underpowered execution, the intended jolts landing all too softly.\\" Amy Nicholson of Variety wrote: \\"Ultimately, Fast Color‚Äôs thesis is more inspirational than the film, which often seems like it, too, is struggling to swirl itself into something more solid. Instead, its magical sparks don‚Äôt quite congeal as the audience can‚Äôt help hoping a movie this empathetic and unusual reaches transcendence\\". ==Television series== As of 2019, a TV series based on the film was in development at Amazon Studios. The show is set to be produced by Viola Davis and Julius Tennon's company JuVee Productions, with the return of the film's writers Julia Hart and Jordan Horowitz. ==See also== * List of black films of the 2010s * Afrofuturism in film ==ReferencesCategory:2018 films Category:2010s science fiction films Category:2010s superhero films Category:2010s supernatural films Category:American films Category:American superhero films Category:American science fiction thriller films Category:American thriller drama films Category:American independent films Category:Dystopian films Category:English- language films Category:Films about families Category:Films directed by Julia Hart Category:Films scored by Rob Simonsen Category:Films set in the future Category:Films set in the United States Category:Films shot in New Mexico Category:LD Entertainment films Category:Climate change films ","title":"Fast Color"},{"id":"56807439","text":"Jennifer Herd is an Australian Indigenous artist with family ties to the Mbar- barrum people of North Queensland.

Opened on 16 June 1886 by the Thessaly Railways (now part of OSE). Today TrainOSE operates Regional Express services to desanations across Greece. It is currently the most northwesterly part of the Greek railway network in operation. ==History== The station open 16 June 1886 by the Thessaly Railways.http://www.trainose.gr/en/ŒπœÉœÑŒøœÅŒπŒ∫œåœÇ-œÉœÑŒ±Œ∏ŒºœåœÇ- Œ≤œåŒªŒøœÖ/ The original station building (and the line) was designed by the Italian Evaristo de Chirico, (father of Giorgio de Chirico). The line was authorise by the Greek government under the law AMH‚Äô/22.6.1882.https://thessalyrailways.gr/?page_id=2768‚ü®=en soon after the liberation of Central Greece from the Ottomans. After the First World War, the Greek state planned the ambitious construction of several new rail lines and links, including a standard gauge line from Kalambaka on to Kozani and then Veroia creating a conversion of the route from Volos to Kalambaka on standard gauge. In 1927, the relevant decisions were made, starting in 1928, work was carried out on the construction of the new line from Kalambaka. But a year later, it was clear that the project would exceed the estimated costs many times over. In 1932, the construction work was stopped and remains unfinished.Alexandros C. Gregoriou 'In 1955 Thessaly Railways was absorbed into Hellenic State Railways (SEK). https://thessalyrailways.gr/?page_id=2768‚ü®=en Freight traffic declined sharply when the state-imposed monopoly of OSE for the transport of agricultural products and fertilisers ended in the early 1990s. Many small stations of the network with little passenger traffic were closed down, especially on the mainline section and between Karditsa and Kalampaka. In 2001 the section between Kalampaka and Palaiofarsalos was converted from Narrow gauge (1000 mm) to standard gauge (1435 mm) and physically connected at Palaiofarsalos with the mainline from Athens to Thessaloniki. Since to upgrade, however, travel times improved and the unification of rail gauge allowed direct services, even InterCity services, to link Volos and Kalambaka with Athens and Thessaloniki. In modern Greek, MP is transliterated as B, not as MB and not as MP. That shows on the station sign, and also on beer labels (MPYRA). ==Facilities== The Station has waiting rooms on platform 1. There is a footbridge from platform 1 to platform 2, via stairs or lift. Luggage storage is no longer available, however the station is staffed, with ticket purchasing facilities. ==Services== Today, the station is served by direct lines to the rest of Greece, via Palaiofarsalos, served both by intercity trains to Athens, Larissa and Thessaloniki and Proastiakos to Athens.https://tickets.trainose.gr/dromologia/?lang=en#view=search;apo=%CE%9A%CE%91%CE%A1%CE%94;pros=%CE%A4%CE%A1%CE%99%CE%9A;date=2018-11-23;trip_type=single;return_date=undefined- undefined- Previously Thessaly Railways operated a narrow gauge service to Volos.

Located in the Gros Ventre Range, the log cabin was occupied by Jack Craig from about 1902, who prospected for gold in the area. Despite claims that Craig found gold, there was no evidence that he found any significant amount. Craig advertised his operation on the radio and sold shares in the mine, but was alleged to have planted what gold he had on the site. Geological surveys indicated that what gold could be found had come from higher country via stream drainage. Craig stayed at the cabin during the summer and returned home to Salt Lake City in the winter. Disputes over water made Craig unpopular among local ranchers. From 1940 the cabin was used by Arthur Bowlsby as a lodge for visiting hunters. From 1971 the cabin was used by a succession of outfitting businesses and continues in that use. The main cabin is a 1-1/2 story log cabin, measuring about by . There are two rooms downstairs with a loft above. A contemporaneous one-story log tack shed is nearby.

The company's chartered purpose was to prospect for gold in the Chukotka region of Russia. The first problem encountered by the company once it was founded was finding miners willing to work in Chukotka. Because the concession was on imperial land, it could not be divided into claims like in North America. As a result of this, the company could not legally offer any property rights to miners, only salaries. Russian miners were very hard to come by, so the company had to recruit Americans with false promises of lucrative gold stakes with generous terms (half of the gold plus half of the gold-producing land). The NESC operated vessels of its own, including the gasoline schooner Barbara Hernster. In 1905, the Barbara Hernster struck a reef and was sunk near Providence Bay while on a journey to recover furs and ivory worth more than a million dollars. Its captain, adventurer Olaf Swenson, became a well-known trader in Anadyr. In 1906 it was reported that the NESC was forbidden by the Russian government from any activities other than mining, such as fur trading. The company may also have been involved in illegally trading alcohol. Also in 1906, American miners working for the NESC reportedly discovered a steel and leather mail coat, along with a helmet and coins which may have been left by Cossack explorers in the mid-1600s. In 1909, the company sent out a dispatch that there was a prison riot in Yakutsk resulting in the deaths of at least four guards, and that escaped prisoners were attempting to flee to Alaska. Later that year the Russian government banned foreign investment in Chukotka in an effort to stop the \\"unscrupulous exploitation\\" and mistreatment of the Chukchi people by the Americans. The company's concession in Russia was ended in 1910. ==References== Category:Gold mining companies of Russia Category:Economy of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug Category:Defunct mining companies of the United States ","title":"Northeast Siberia Company"},{"id":"56807980","text":"On December 22, 1969, construction began on a Harrisburg incinerator at a cost of $15 million.

Dioxins are very toxic and according to the World Health Organization, they can cause \\"reproductive and developmental problems, damage the immune system, interfere with hormones and also cause cancer.\\" Eric Epstein, an environmental activist, accused the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection of environmental racism because the incinerator was located near two low-income housing projects which had a high minority population. == 2000 Dioxin Arctic Study == In September 2000, a study published by the North American Commission on Environmental Cooperation (NACEC), lead by Dr. Barry Commoner, found that Inuit women in the Arctic in Nunavut, Canada were found to have high levels of dioxin in their breast milk. The study tracked the origin of the dioxins using computer models from the sources that produced it and found that the dioxin pollution in the Arctic originated from the United States. Out of 44,000 sources of dioxin polluters in the United States, they found that only 19 were contributing to greater than a third of the dioxin pollution in Nunavut.

The King's administrative negligence and frequent conflicts with the clergy (which had gotten him excommunicated already by that point), along with his unwillingness to listen to the Roman Curia, led to Pope Innocent IV issuing the bull Inter alia desiderabilia in March 1245, which severely crippled Sancho's authority by charging him with the responsibility for the kingdom's near-anarchical state. Following the First Council of Lyon, that same year, Innocent issued Grandi non immerito urging the people and nobility of Portugal to receive the Count of Boulogne and to show him \\"fidelity, homage, allegiance, and accordance\\", under threat of ecclesiastical censure. The bull did not, however, nominally depose King Sancho or remove any descendants he would beget from the succession (though he would go on to die with no legitimate children). The Count of Boulogne ruled the kingdom using the styles of Visitador, Curador e Defensor do Reino (\\"Visitor, Curator and Defender of the Kingdom\\") until his brother's death and his own eventual coronation as Afonso III of Portugal. ==References== Category:1245 works Category:13th-century papal bulls Category:Documents of Pope Innocent IV ","title":"Grandi non immerito"},{"id":"56808305","text":"The Massachusetts general election held on November 5, 2002, included three ballot measures that were voted on by the public.

The life of Saint Padarn described Tydecho as one of the saints who came to Wales from Armorica. There are questions as to whether this place was Brittany or an area in southeast Wales which is known for its saints. Tydecho was the son of Amwn Ddu Emyr Llydaw and a cousin of Saint Cadfan, with whom he travelled Wales. He is said to have come to Wales during the time of King Arthur and became an anchorite after the great king's death. Tydecho lived with his sister Tegfedd in the Mawddwy area and was the founder of churches at Llanymawddwy, Mallwyd, Garthbeibio and Cemmaes. Tydecho is also credited with founding a chapel, Capel Tydecho, in Llandegfan. Tydecho acquired some of the land for his churches by interesting means. His sister Tegfedd was a beautiful woman who attracted the attention of a wealthy man named Cynon, who kidnapped her as he was so taken by her beauty. Tydecho caught up with the man and forced him to release his sister. He was also able to convince Cynon to compensate for his misdeed by ceding some land to Tydecho for a church at Garthbeibio. Legends record the young prince of Gwynedd, Maelgwn Gwynedd, as a chief tormentor of the saint. Tydecho, who slept on rocks, wore a hair shirt and engaged in agriculture, used oxen to plow his fields. The prince decided to make off with Tydecho's team. A visit to Tydecho's land the next day found him using a pair of wild stags to plow with a grey wolf pulling the harrow behind them. The angry prince brought dogs to chase off the deer and sat down on a rock to watch the spectacle. When he tried to rise, Gwynedd was unable to do so. His only choice was to make apologies to the saint and beg forgiveness. Among the known concessions were: Tydecho's land was a sanctuary for both men and beasts and exempt from mortuaries, claims and any oppression. Another legend says that a milkmaid working for Tydecho slipped when crossing the river and her pail of milk spilled into the water. Tydecho's response to the accident was to turn the river from its source to the village of Llanymawddwy into a stream of milk; he called this section Llaethnant. The Welsh poets Dafydd Llwyd ap Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and Matthew Brwmffild have both written poems about St. Tydecho: \\"The Legend of St Tydecho\\" and \\"St. Tydecho, and the Two Parishes of Mawddwy\\". A feast day is celebrated on 17 December. ==NotesReferences== Category:Medieval Welsh saints Category:6th-century people ","title":"Saint Tydecho"},{"id":"56808415","text":"is a Japanese football player.

She was murdered soon after in Macerata, Italy. The suspects are three Nigerian migrants, who as of 7 July 2018 were still in custody. The murder caused public outrage, anger, and anti-immigrant sentiment in Macerata. ==Background== Mastropietro was born and lived in Rome. She was 18 years old, and had moved away from the recovery community for drug addiction where she was a guest in Marche Region, Corridonia, on 29 January. Her mother stated that Mastropietro began abusing drugs after dating a Romanian man, and was living in a drug treatment centre at the time of her death.Jason Horowitz (July 7, 2018) This Italian Town Once Welcomed Migrants. Now, It‚Äôs a Symbol for Right-Wing Politics, The New York Times, accessed 28 July 2018 When she left the community, she did not take her mobile phone and identification documents. She is believed to have sought drugs in Diaz Gardens, a known gathering place for dealers, addicts, and criminals. ==Murder and investigation== Mastropietro's body was found severely mutilated, hidden in two suitcases; though she was believed to be a murder victim, the exact cause of her death had not been determined as of February 2018. Soon after, Italian police said they found her bloodied clothing at the home of Innocent Oseghale, a Nigerian who moved to Italy in 2014 but who had dropped out of a refugee assistance program and begun selling drugs.Il Fatto Quotidiano, 31 January 2018.Corriere 21 February 2018. Oseghale, described as \\"a 29-year-old Nigerian with an expired residency permit and a criminal record of drug dealing,\\" was arrested soon after the body and clothing were found. Along with Oseghale, police arrested Desmond Lucky and Lucky Awelima. On 7 June 2018, the magistrate of Macerata, Giovanni Maria Manzoni, dropped orders of detention on charges of murder, vilification, and destruction and concealment of corpse, against Awelima and Lucky. Awelima and Lucky remained in jail for heroin dealing. Matteo Salvini, the newly-elected deputy prime minister and interior minister, has often mentioned the Mastropietro murder as part of his hard-on- crime policies and skepticism towards immigration. Alessandro Meluzzi, a psychiatrist and criminologist, has alleged that the murder was associated with Nigerian organized crime gangs. == See also == * Murder of Meredith Kercher * Murder of Ashley Ann Olsen * Murder of Desir√©e Mariottini * Murders of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Ueland ==References Category:2018 crimes in Italy Category:2018 murders in Europe Category:2010s murders in Italy Category:2010s trials Category:21st century in Marche Category:Crime in Marche Category:Incidents of violence against women Category:January 2018 crimes Category:January 2018 events in Italy Category:Macerata Category:Murder trials Category:Trials in Italy Category:Violence against women in Italy ","title":"Murder of Pamela Mastropietro"},{"id":"56808467","text":"is a former Japanese football player.

The film stars Aglaya Tarasova, Alexander Petrov and Milo≈° Bikoviƒá. Ice was theatrically released in Russia took place on February 14, 2018 and the Olympic Committee. A sequel, titled Ice 2, was released in February 2020. ==Plot== The life of Nadezhda Alexandrovna 'Nadya' Lapshina (Aglaya Tarasova), a humble girl from the city of Irkutsk, Nadya Lapshina always dreamed of being a figure skater, but had problems with coordination and balance, which is why the famous children's coach Irina Sergeyevna Shatalina (Mariya Aronova) refused to take her as a student, contrary to the faith and persuasion of Nadya's mother. Nadya begins to live with her aunt Margosha, who sells bananas. Margosha treats her niece well and takes care of her as she can, but does not share the late sister‚Äôs opinion about Nadya‚Äôs potential. However, the girl does not give up and in the end shows such perseverance that Irina Shatalina decides to take her. Nadya Lapshina begins to live in a boarding school at the local sports palace and learn the basics and subtleties of figure skating. At first, nothing comes out of her, but determination and good learning take their toll and Nadya becomes the best student of the boarding school. As a result, Irina Shatalina nominates her as a candidate for children's figure competitions held throughout the country. Another girl, who was the best before Nadya, tries to sabotage her performance by blunting her skates, but Nadya carries out the impossible and even performs dull-class dance on blunt blades. Years pass. Nadya Lapshina has matured and became one of the most famous figure skaters in the country. She is invited to go to the big leagues, having tried on the role of a partner of the famous skater Vladimir Borisovich 'Vova' Leonov (Milo≈° Bikoviƒá). At first, Nadya refuses, not wanting to leave her beloved coach, but Irina Shatalina, having fallen in love with Nadya as a daughter and wishing her advancement, tells her that her mother deceived her, saying that Irina discerned talent in her as a child. Nadya is upset, but decides to take a chance and eventually gets a place. Soon, he and Vova Leonov begin to live together and he even thinks of proposing to her. However, during the next performance, a catastrophe occurs: Vova accidentally drops Nadya and she hits so hard when she falls that she breaks the spine and becomes disabled. She closes herself from depression and stops communicating with everyone. In the capital, she fails to recover, and she returns to her aunt and uncle, who is confined to a wheelchair. Irina Shatalina, learning about the troubles of her former student, decides to help her. Meanwhile, in the local hockey team, striker Alexander Arkadyevich 'Sasha' Gorin (Alexander Petrov) has a conflict with a friend, because of which he is suspended from the game. Irina offers him a deal: he will help Nadya restore spirit, and Irina will help him return to the team. Sasha Gorin pretends to agree, but at first he tries to cheat, seeing that Nadya is completely crushed and does not see a chance to recover. However, Irina quickly exposes him, and he begins to act for real. At first, Sasha and Nadya cannot stand each other, but Sasha Gorin turns out to be a good psychologist and begins to restore Nadya‚Äôs spirit by physically mocking her and then finding a common language. Soon this is bearing fruit: the sensitivity of the legs and the ability to move their fingers begin to return to Nadya. After that, they switch to physiotherapy exercises: Sasha starts taking Nadya to the local gym, where she learns to walk again and restores her atrophied leg muscles. As a result, she again gets to her feet, and then returns to the ice. At this point, their relationship with Sasha reached an almost romantic level. As a result, Nadya even persuades him to act as her partner on the return number, speaking in her previous role as a hockey player. The resulting unusual number is received warmly. Later, Sasha also admits to Nadya that in his childhood he also went in for figure skating for some time, to which his grandmother drove him, but his father considered him a purely female sport and persuaded his son to switch to hockey. After their joint performance, Sasha Gorin unexpectedly meets Vova Leonov in the locker room, who is trying to convince him to leave Nadya, claiming that only he, Vova, can lead her to the Olympic medal. The whole day Sasha spends sad thoughts: he realizes that he has fallen in love with Nadya and wants to be with her, but Vova‚Äôs words touched him too deeply. As a result, he gets drunk, comes to Nadya and lies to her that all this time he helped her only out of pity, leaving a big teddy bear won in the shooting gallery. Nadya Lapshina again unites with Vova Leonova and begins performing in a big competition, but he drops her almost immediately. The doctor establishes that Nadya no longer has any problems with her back: the point is pure psychosomatics. Vova explodes and expresses that in fact he always considered Nadya an insignificant figure skater and spoke with her only because of her popularity among the people. Nadya does not stand it and returns to speak alone, although this is against the rules. Sasha, who watched the contest on television, does not dare to stay away and urgently gets to Moscow. Having entered the stadium with the support of Irina Shatalina, he takes his suit from a dejected Vova and goes out to the ice to Nadya. She in tears asks him why he came, and he confesses to her his feelings. The judges refuse to start playing music for them again, sitting among the audience, begins to sing themselves, and then the whole room picks up the song, and Nadya and Sasha perform a beautiful duet number for it. Despite the fact that they remained disqualified, Nadya Lapshina and Sasha Gorin are happy, because now they can be together on the ice and outside it. ==Cast== * Aglaya Tarasova as Nadezhda Alexandrovna 'Nadya' Lapshina, a figure skater ** Diana Enakaeva as Nadya Lapshina, as a child * Alexander Petrov as Alexander Arkadyevich 'Sasha' Gorin, a hockey player * Milo≈° Bikoviƒá as Vladimir Borisovich 'Vova' Leonov, a pair skater * as Irina Sergeyevna Shatalina, children's coach * as Vsevolod Igorevich 'Seva' Shulzhenko, coach Vova Leonov * Kseniya Rappoport as Nadya Lapshina's mother * as Margosha, Nadya Lapshina's aunt * as Gena, Margosha's lover * as Zhzhyonova, a competitor * Fyodor Bondarchuk as a tramp * Andrey Zolotarev as reporter * Maksim Belborodov as Mitya, a pair skater * Andrey Balyakin as Andrey Burov, hockey coach * Vilen Babichev as security at the Olympics in Sochi ==Production== The film was the feature-length debut of director Oleg Trofim.

Under the scheme, villages of 100 houses each are being created to accommodate the various castes, with one community hall and burial ground to be shared by all. The scheme is named after the social reformer Periyar E. V. Ramasamy. == Background == In 1997, the Government of Tamil Nadu decided to change the name of a transport corporation in the Virudhunagar district to the Sundaralingam Transport Corporation, in honour of 18th-century general Veeran Sundaralingam. The name change was the long-time demand of the Dalit Pallar community, which considered Sundaralingam the icon of their community. However, backward caste Thevars opposed the decision since the transport corporation would bear a Dalit name. Thevars torched the transport buses and attacked the drivers. In response, Dalits vandalised U. Muthuramalingam Thevar's statue. Incidents by both castes sparked violence in the southern districts of Tamil Nadu. == Scheme == The scheme aims to ease the situation and to integrate the Dalits segregated by the caste system to begin using the wells and temples of the dominant communities. The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu M. Karunanidhi introduced the housing scheme to create villages of 100 houses each. Each village is subdivided into 40 houses for Dalits, 25 houses for backward caste, 25 houses for most backward caste, and 10 for other communities. To avoid caste discrimination, the Samathuvapuram would have one community hall for all communities, as well as a common burial ground. The first samathuvapuram inaugurated by M. Karunanidhi on 17 August 1998 in the Melakottai village near Tirumangalam, Madurai. By 2001, 145 samathuvapurams were opened across Tamil Nadu.

The sportspeople are competing two sports: para-alpine skiing and sledge hockey. There were 24 sportspeople, 16 support people and 4 administrators. First allocated four sports in para-alpine skiing, the country won two more spots and are sending six skiers. The sledge hockey team goes to South Korea after qualifying at a tournament in Sweden. They had financial difficulties before the Winter Paralympics because of corruption in sports funding. This made it more difficult to train and compete for the 2018 Games. == Team == In June 2017, the Executive Committee of the Czech Paralympic Committee (ƒåPV) was told by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) they had been given four spots to send people to the 2018 Winter Paralympics to compete in para-alpine skiing. Three of these spots were for men, and one was for a woman. Patrik Hetmer was the first skier to be nominated for inclusion on the 2018 team going to Pyeongchang. In September 2017, Pavel Bambousek, Miroslav Lidinsk√Ω and Anna Pe≈°kov√° seemed to be the most likely skiers to be named to the team in para-alpine skiing. The full team was named by the ƒåPV on 6 February 2018. It included people in two sports: para-alpine skiing and sledge hockey. There were 24 sportspeople, 16 support people and 4 administrators. Aniƒçka Pe≈°kov√° was the only woman representing the Czech Republic in Pyeongchang. The team included 6 alpine-skiers and their 2 guides. Tom√°≈° Vaverka, who competed at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in snowboarding, was selected to compete in para-alpine skiing. The group was scheduled to fly to South Korea on 3 March 2018.

Three of these spots were for men, and one was for a woman. In September 2017, Pavel Bambousek, Miroslav Lidinsk√Ω and Anna Pe≈°kov√° seemed to be the most likely skiers to be named to the team in para-alpine skiing. The team had a training camp in early autumn 2017 on the glaciers in the Czech Republic. This was to prepare for their first races, which took place in November in Landgraaf, Netherlands. After that, the team went Pitztal to race.  Support  Health Care in the Hradec Kr√°lov√© supported Czech para-alpine skiers before Winter Games. This program was supervised by Deputy Governor for Health Care Ing. Ale≈° Cabicar. Shesaid, \\"The project of the handicapped skiers center is known, especially their teaching program, which they realize in the Krkono≈°e Mountains. I am very glad that successful athletes are being prepared in our region to achieve great results. When the representatives of the Center approached me with the request for support and support, I did not hesitate and I am glad that the Hradec Kr√°lov√© Region is one of the partners of the Czech representatives.\\"  Skiers  Patrik Hetmer was the first skier to be nominated for inclusion on the 2018 team going to Pyeongchang. He competed at the 2014 Winter Paralympics. Hetmer has a vision impairment. The blind skier races with guide skier Miroslav M√°ƒçka. Aniƒçka Pe≈°kov√° was the only woman representing the Czech Republic in Pyeongchang. The blind skier is accompanied by her guide skier, Michaela Hubaƒçov√°.

Corruption in the Czech Republic involving subsidies for sport resulted in the national team getting less money to support their training and ability to compete in tournaments. FAƒåR Chairman Miroslav Pelta was arrested as part of the corruption issues. About the corruption, team captain Zdenƒõk ≈†afr√°nek said, \\"The subsidy scandal has radically reduced the amount we receive. For the sake of illustration, the Czech Paralympic Committee has now gotten less money than last year's sledge hockey players, and it has to be divided into a lot of sports.\\" The team could not buy time to use ice at skating rinks to train much before their final qualifying competition in Sweden. They also could not buy new equipment like sledges, hockey sticks or hockey gloves. To make sure they were ready to qualify, the captain thought the team needed around 1 million Czech Koruna () to pay for all the costs of training and traveling. Because they could not get funding from the government, players had to ask individuals to support them financially. The team went to Nagano to compete in a tournament in February 2018 to prepare for the Games. === Qualification === Japan, Sweden and the Czech Republic were the last 3 teams that were able to go to the 2018 Games. They could go because of how they finished at the Qualification Tournament in October in Ostersund, Sweden in October 2017. Teams participating in the tournament included Sweden, Germany, Slovakia, Japan and Great Britain. ;Preliminary round ;5‚Äì8th place semifinal ;Fifth place game == Media coverage == Some of the Paralympics would be broad on television by ƒåT TV and ƒåT Sport.

These included getting more people to compete in disability sports. They also wanted to increase the level of accessibility to sports buildings and sports field in Nord-Tr√∏ndelag County and the rest of Norway. == Doping == In December 2017, Norway said it would not send any anti-doping officials to the Winter Olympics or Paralympics. They are tired of needing to use unpaid volunteers. They think anti-doping officials need to be paid. Anti-doping Norway chief executive Anders Solheim said, \\"If you sell TV rights for this arrangement for billions of dollars, then we think it's wrong that we pay for Norwegian doping controllers to help with the controls. An inspector should receive a reasonable salary and his trip paid for the three weeks he or she will be there. By not paying doping controllers, the organisers are de facto relying on volunteers. Anti-doping work should not be a voluntary profession for those who want to. It is downplaying the priority of our work, and we are tired of it.\\" == Alpine skiing  Biathlon Cross-country skiing== Birgit Skarstein competed in two sports: adapted rowing and para-Nordic skiing.

It has two grass-like leaves and up to ten purple or mauve flowers, often with darker, sometimes yellow marks. A yellow form from near Guyra is probably now extinct. ==Description== Diuris punctata is a tuberous, perennial herb with two linear leaves long, wide and folded lengthwise. Up to ten flowers wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The flowers are purple or mauve, often with darker, sometimes yellow marks. The dorsal sepal is more or less erect, elliptic to egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are greenish-brown, linear to lance-shaped, long, wide and turned downwards. The petals are erect with an egg-shaped blade long and wide on a dark coloured stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is broadly egg-shaped to fan-shaped, long and wide and the side lobes are linear to wedge-shaped, long and wide. There are two ridge-like calli about long, surrounded by yellow in the mid- line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from September to December. ==Taxonomy and naming== Diuris punctata was first formally described in 1804 by James Edward Smith and the description was published in Exotic Botany. The specific epithet (punctata) is a Latin word meaning \\"spotted\\". ==Distribution and habitat== The purple donkey orchid is found in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria growing in forest and grassland. In New South Wales it occurs south from the Moonbi Range and in Victoria north from the Mornington Peninsula. A form known as Diuris punctata var. sulfurea was known from a property near Guyra but is now thought to be extinct. It had smaller, yellow flowers. ==Conservation== Diuris punctata is classed as \\"threatened\\" in Victoria under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. The main threats to the species are competition from weeds and grasses, grazing and soil disturbance. ==References== punctata Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Orchids of Victoria (Australia) Category:Orchids of the Australian Capital Territory Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Plants described in 1804 ","title":"Diuris punctata"},{"id":"56809075","text":"The Testimony of Taliesin Jones is a 2000 British drama film directed by Martin Duffy and starring John Paul Macleod and Jonathan Pryce.

Vaginal stenosis can have a negative impact on sexual dysfunction, dyspareunia and make pelvic exams difficult and painful. The lining of the vagina may also be thinner and drier and contain scar tissue. This condition can result in pain during sexual intercourse or a pelvic exam. Vaginal stenosis is often caused by an episiotomy, radiation therapy to the pelvis or some types of surgery. Chemotherapy can also increase the likelihood of developing vaginal stenosis.http://www.uhn.ca/PatientsFamilies/Health_Information/Health_Topics/Documents/How_to_Manage_Vaginal_Stenosis.pdf Vaginal stenosis can be a defect caused by congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Having an episiotomy is associated with stenosis. == Causes Radiation- induced=== Uterine, vaginal, rectal and cervical cancers are often treated with pelvic radiation therapy (RT). Radiation-induced vaginal stenosis can be a side effect of treatment. Causes are external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), or brachytherapy. It is one of the most prevalent side effects of pelvic radiation, affecting about one third of women. Radiation-induced stenosis can be a late reaction to treatment. Damage to the vaginal epithelium causes abnormal collagen production that leads to atrophy, loss of muscle, decreased blood flow, hypoxia, and fibrosis. Pallor, adhesions, and fragility can be observed along with loss of elasticity. === Congenital === The inadequate prenatal suppression of adrenal androgens leads to congenital adrenal hyperplasia. This condition can result in the vagina being affected by stenosis as a result. ==Diagnosis Treatment == Stenosis of the vagina is treated with vaginal dilator therapy, but the evidence is lacking for its efficacy. == See also == * Vaginal anomalies == References == Category:Noninflammatory disorders of female genital tract Category:Women's health ","title":"Vaginal stenosis"},{"id":"56809107","text":"is a Japanese football player.

The firm got started when McAnnar was furloughed from his firm during the recession of 2009, and Voss secured space at his firm, Reinert Weishaar & Associates, in the neighborhood of Laclede's Landing, St. Louis. The firm's budget grew from less than $75,000 in 2009 to $300,000 in 2013. The firm expanded in June 2013 through a contract under then Mayor Francis Slay's campaign to end chronic homelessness, through which it was later able to hire two staff attorneys. Harvey and Voss joined the firm full-time in 2014. The shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in August 2014 brought additional attention to ArchCity and its work. It produced a report on revenue predation by police departments and municipal courts in St. Louis County (of which Ferguson is a part). In 2017, co-founder Harvey announced that he was leaving ArchCity to join his wife in Los Angeles and raising money for an effort to raise funds for cash bail. Employee Blake Strode was named Harvey's replacement. As of January 2018, the firm has 20 full-time staff with additional volunteers and year-round interns. ===Executive Directors=== {  - b0c4de;\\" ! Years ! Name -  2009‚Äì2018 Thomas Harvey -  2018‚Äì Blake Strode } ==Programs== ArchCity began in 2009 with clearing arrest warrants, and later expanded to a court-watching program in partnership with the Saint Louis University School of Law to statistically validate their clients' experiences in the court system. The court-watching program resulted in a \\"Municipal Courts White Paper\\" describing policy related to the municipal courts of St. Louis that began receiving significant national attention at the same time the shooting of Michael Brown and ensuing Ferguson unrest of police brutality protesting unfolded in August 2014. ArchCity expanded to provide legal representation to the people protesting, and subsequently filed a number of lawsuits targeting the \\"criminalization of poverty\\" as well as police brutality. In December 2014, ArchCity filed ten lawsuits against seven St. Louis County municipalities alleging constitutional abuses by their courts. ArchCity filed additional lawsuits against the cities of Ferguson and Jennings in February 2015, alleging Constitutional violations for jailing people without adequately considering their ability to pay. A class-action lawsuit was filed in 2016 against thirteen Missouri municipalities. In 2016, a federal judge approved a $4.7 million settlement to compensate people jailed in Jennings, Missouri for their inability to pay court fines and fees, covering 1,964 people collectively spending more than 8,000 nights in jail over a period from 2010 to 2015. Jennings separately settled to change its municipal court policies related to collecting unpaid fines and fees, moving to a civil collecting process instead of jail. ==Fundraising== ArchCity is primarily funded through grants, legal fees from settlements and damages awards, and donations. It does not charge its clients any fees. ArchCity received some funds from a September 2015 settlement with the City of Jennings.

However, leaks have become more frequent since 2014. Question papers of other public examinations such as the Primary School Certificate (PSC), Junior School Certificate (JSC), Secondary School Certificate and Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) have been leaked in a regular basis. There have also been multiple university and medical entrance exam question paper leaks. == Incidents Certificate examinations=== In 2014, question papers from all Bangladesh public examinations were leaked but the government initially denied this allegation. However, after a few days, Minister of Education of Bangladesh Nurul Islam Nahid declared quick action would be taken against people involved in question paper leaks. During the 2014 HSC examination period, the English exam schedule of Dhaka Board was changed due to leaks. Other tests' question papers were leaked but no further action was taken. === Admission tests === There were allegations of Medical and Dental entrance test question paper leaks in 2015. The Health Minister Mohammad Nasim denied this allegation. An inquiry team was established which confirmed the allegations and suggested the entrance test be retaken. Students and renowned Bangladesh educators like Muhammad Zafar Iqbal and Syed Abul Maksud protested against the leak and demanded the test be retaken, but no action was taken. The demonstration was described as 'illogical' and the Health Minister Mohammad Nasim described the demonstrations as hype. In 2018, the question paper of Dhaka University D unit (Gha Unit) entrance test was allegedly leaked. The government denied this allegation. In 2020, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of police said that at least 4,000 students were admitted to several medical and dental colleges through answering the question papers leaked by a gang from 2013 to 2018. == Criticism and reaction == Bangladesh people and educators have criticized the leaks. In 2014, scientist and writer Muhammad Zafar Iqbal protested at the Central Shaheed Minar against an alleged leak and the government's silence. In 2015, there was a massive student demonstration against Medical and Dental Entrance Test leaks. Educator and columnist Syed Abul Maksud joined this demonstration and demanded the test be retaken. The Bangladesh Government had several meetings with Bangladesh educators to prevent question paper leaks. The government banned internet access and social media several times; however, none of these interventions were successful. == Law and punishment== Leaking and distribution of any public examination question paper is a crime under Bangladesh law. According to 'The Public Examinations (Offences) (Amended) Act, 1992' the punishment is a 3-10 year prison term. Many people have been arrested in relation to question paper leaks. On 2017, a government official was arrested for being involved with a Medical and Dental Entrance Test question paper leak. However, no-one has been punished over this incident. == References== Category:Education in Bangladesh Category:Education scandals Category:Crime in Bangladesh ","title":"Question paper leaks in Bangladesh"},{"id":"56809278","text":"Arkadiusz Mi≈Çoszewski (born March 22, 1973) is a Polish professional basketball coach and former national team player.
