Minto is located 38 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Campbelltown and is part of the Macarthur region. ==History== Minto was named in honour of the Earl of Minto, Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, who was Viceroy of India from 1807–1814. The name was originally given to the entire district stretching from just north of Appin up to what is now Denham Court.Minto History The area that constitutes the current suburb of Minto was originally home to the Tharawal people until the arrival of British settlers from the First Fleet. In 1811, Governor Lachlan Macquarie granted in the area to William Redfern, the colony's first surgeon. He in turn named it Campbellfield after Macquarie's wife Elizabeth whose maiden name was Campbell. Redfern used the property as a vineyard and sheep station. In 1810, Dr Robert Towson built his sandstock home, Varroville, in St Andrews Road, on land granted by Governor Macquarie. The house was subsequently owned by Charles Sturt and James Raymond, the first Postmaster General. In the 1820s, Colonel Parker built a Georgian bungalow called Epping Forest in Raby Road. A farm called Robin Hood Farm was built in Campbelltown Road circa 1830. These three properties are now listed on the Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/21 In 1874, a railway station was built in the area and named Campbellfield after the property but this led to confusion with nearby Campbelltown so in 1882, it was renamed Minto. Development of the area followed shortly after and by the 1950s it was a village of around 500 people. A large slice of land on the east side of Minto was sold to Housing Commission in 1969 to provide cheap housing. Shortly after a large industrial estate was also established in the area and Minto's transition from village to Sydney suburb was complete. == Heritage listings == Minto has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Lot 315 Ben Lomond Road: Stone Cottage, Minto == Transport == Minto railway station is serviced by the Airport & South Line on the Sydney Trains network. Minto also has a small inland port connected by rail to Port Botany. The inland port consists of a single rail siding with an adjacent hard stand surface for the containers, and the siding is operated by top and tail trains with engines at both ends. ==Schools== Minto is home to two high schools, Sarah Redfern High and Alfaisal College; five primary schools, Campbellfield Public, Minto Public, Sarah Redfern Public,The Grange Public and Alfaisal college; and a special school, Passfield Park, which services disabled students from pre- school through to high school. Rugby League players, Michael Lett, Gray Vaine, Justin Brooker, John Skandalis, Ken McGuinness, Kevin McGuinness, Israel Folau, Mickey, Lopini and Lelea Paea, Tim Lafai, Byron Fruean and Dominique Peyroux all attended Sarah Redfern High School, a notable rugby league school. ==Housing== Public housing belonging to Housing NSW has recently been demolished in the suburb to make way for a new housing estate called One Minto. The new estate will consist of both public and private housing. The majority of the houses will be private with around 850 privately owned houses compared to only 360 public housing homes. ==People== Shiva statue in Minto Shiva Temple ===Demographics=== At the 2016 census, there were 12,551 people in Minto. *Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 3.2% of the population. * 50.9% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were Bangladesh 7.0%, India 4.5%, New Zealand 4.0%, Philippines 3.7% and Fiji 3.6%. * 48.0% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Bengali 10.2%, Hindi 4.8%, Samoan 3.8%, Nepali 3.1% and Arabic 2.8%. * The most common responses for religion were Catholic 21.4%, Islam 16.9%, No Religion 13.4%, Anglican 10.8% and Hinduism 9.7%. * The median weekly household income was $1,383, lower than the national median of $1,438. === Notable residents === * Rugby league players Israel Folau, Jarryd Hayne and Krisnan Inu all grew up within a few blocks of each other in Minto and played park football together. Mickey Paea and Tim Lafai also known in Minto as good helpers of the Minto Cobras team both players give up their time to help the Minto Cobras out every week in their extra time. * Member of the Parliament of New South Wales and former Housing Minister Cherie Burton grew up in Minto. ==Sport and recreation== Minto Sports Centre The Minto Indoor Sports Centre is home to local basketball and netball teams. The Macarthur Heat plays in the New South Wales State Basketball League and uses the Centre as its home court. The Campbelltown District Netball Association, which is also based at the Centre, plays in the third division of the Netball NSW State League. Minto has a rugby league team, the Minto Cobras playing in the Western Suburbs District Junior Rugby League. The Cobras home ground is Townson Oval. They have produced a number of NRL players including Israel Folau, Michael Lett, Gray Vaine, Justin Brooker, John Skandalis, Ken McGuinness, Kevin McGuinness, Jarryd Hayne, Mickey Lopini, Lalea Paea, Krisnan Inu and Tim Lafai. Mickey Paea, a current Bulldogs forward, always gives up his extra time and helps out Minto Cobras. The club is proud of him for doing that because not many NRL players would give up spare time to go visit the clubs where they played their junior footy. ==Controversy== The entrance to Minto Mall South entrance of renovated Minto Marketplace Minto has received negative publicity on two occasions because of a local shopping centre, Minto Mall, which has been investigated twice on the news program A Current Affair. Although it began as a boost to local business, it has more recently become dilapidated and untidy, and the management has taken no action to combat these problems. After being placed under pressure by A Current Affair and members of the community due to the rundown state of the mall, Minto Mall sold in late 2012. Since 2014, the former Minto Mall has fully reopened and refurbished as Minto Marketplace. It is populated by major retailers and franchises such as Woolworths, Kmart, Priceline, Lowes Menswear, Gloria Jeans, Michel's Patisserie, Donut King, Ocean Master, Millers and many more. ==References== ==External links== * [CC-By-SA] Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:Rail yards in Australia Category:Populated places established in 1882 Category:1882 establishments in Australia Category:City of Campbelltown (New South Wales) ","title":"Minto, New South Wales"},{"id":"2581511","text":"Birth Control is a German rock band known for their progressive hard rock sound and provocative album covers (such as that of Two Eggs – Two Concerts which depicts a hen cooking eggs). ==History== Birth Control formed in 1966 in Berlin from two other bands, the Earls and the Gents. The band was founded with a lineup consisting of Bernd Koschmidder (bass), Reinhold Sobotta (organ), Rolf Gurra (saxophone, vocals), Fritz Gröger (vocals), Reiner Borchert (guitar), Hugo Egon Balder (drums), and Klaus Orso (guitar). Within five years of the band's formation all seven of the original members had departed, but the band continued under the leadership of long-standing members drummer (and later lead vocalist) Bernd Noske (who replaced Balder in late 1968) and guitarist Bruno Frenzel (who replaced Borchert in 1969). Following the death of Frenzel in 1983, the group disbanded, but reunited in 1993 with only Noske remaining from the previous lineup. Other members of the reformed band included returning bassist/vocalist Horst Stachelhaus, as well as guitarist Rocco Zodiak and keyboardist Xaver Fischer. Despite the death of mainstay Stachelhaus in 1999, the band continued under Noske's guidance, touring Germany and release new albums periodically following the turn of the century. In later years, former members Peter Föller (bass, vocals) and Zeus B. Held (keyboards) both returned to the fold as guest musicians at occasional concerts. The band came to an end on February 18, 2014 with the death of Noske. The final lineup of the band consisted of Noske, bassist Hannes Vesper, keyboardist Sascha Kuhn, and guitarist Martin Ettrich. From 2016 on the band continued performing. The new lineup is: Peter Föller(vocals), Martin Ettrich (guitar, talkbox), Sascha Kühn (keyboards), Hannes Vesper (bass) and Manni von Bohr (drums).

Anglo- American songs can also be distinguished from British songs by having fewer pentatonic tunes, less prominent accompaniment (but with heavier use of drones) and more melodies in major. Anglo-American traditional music, dating back to colonial times, includes a variety of broadside ballads, humorous stories and tall tales, and disaster songs regarding mining, shipwrecks (especially in New England) and murder. Folk heroes like Joe Magarac, John Henry and Jesse James are also part of many songs. Folk dance of English origin include the square dance, descended from the European high society quadrille, combined with the American innovation of a caller instructing the dancers. Sea shanties are an important part of Anglo-American music. The folklorist Alan Lomax described regional differences among rural Anglo- American musicians as included the relaxed and open-voiced northern vocal style and the pinched and nasal southern style, with the west exhibiting a mix of the two. He attributed these differences to sexual relations, the presence of minorities and frontier life. == References == * * ; cited in Nettl * == Notes == # Nettl, pg. 201 # Nettl, pgs. 201-202 # Burk, Meierhoffer and Phillips # Lomax, pg. 1, cited in Nettl, pg. 202 Category:English music Category:Ethnic music in the United States Category:English-American culture ","title":"Anglo-American music"},{"id":"2581519","text":"Drypetes is a plant genus of the family Putranjivaceae, in the order Malpighiales.

It is the first of four volumes in The Book of the New Sun which Wolfe had completed in draft before The Shadow of the Torturer was published. It relates the story of Severian, an apprentice Seeker for Truth and Penitence (the guild of torturers), from his youth through his expulsion from the guild and subsequent journey out of his home city of Nessus. In 1987, Locus magazine ranked The Shadow of the Torturer number four among the 33 \\"All-Time Best Fantasy Novels\\", based on a poll of subscribers. • An older edition of the website links multiple pages providing the results of several polls and a little other information. • See also \\"1987 Locus Poll Award\\". ISFDB. Retrieved 2012-04-12. Locus subscribers voted only two Middle-earth novels by J. R. R. Tolkien and A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin ahead of Wolfe's The Shadow of the Torturer. Third and fourth ranks were exchanged in the 1998 rendition of the poll, which considered Wolfe's Book of the New Sun and Le Guin's Earthsea series as single entries. == Plot summary== Severian, an apprentice in the Torturers' Guild, barely survives a swim in the River Gyoll. On his way back to the Citadel, Severian and several other apprentices sneak into a necropolis where Severian encounters Vodalus, a legendary revolutionary. Vodalus, along with two others, including a woman named Thea, are robbing a grave. Vodalus and his companions are confronted by volunteer guards. Severian saves Vodalus's life, earning his trust and the reward of a single coin. Shortly before Severian is elevated to journeyman he encounters and falls in love with Thecla, a beautiful aristocratic prisoner. Thecla's crime is never made clear, though it is implied that she is imprisoned for political reasons since Thecla's half-sister is Thea, Vodalus's lover. The Autarch (ruler of the Commonwealth) wishes to use Thecla to capture Vodalus. When finally Thecla is put to torture, Severian takes pity on her and helps her commit suicide by smuggling a knife into her cell, thus breaking his oath to the guild. Though Severian expects to be tortured and executed, instead the head of the guild dispatches Severian to Thrax, a distant city which has need of an executioner. Master Palaemon gives Severian a letter of introduction to the archon of the city and Terminus Est, a magnificent executioner's sword. He departs the guild headquarters, traveling through the decaying city of Nessus. He finally comes upon an inn, where he forces the innkeeper to take him in despite being full and is asked to share a room with other boarders. His roommates are the giant Baldanders and Dr. Talos, travelling as mountebanks, who invite Severian to join them in a play to be performed the same day. During breakfast, Dr. Talos manages to recruit the waitress, Jolenta, for his play and they set out into the streets. Not intending to participate, Severian parts with the group and stops at a rag shop to purchase a mantle to hide his fuligin cloak (the uniform of his guild, which inspires terror in common folk). The shop is owned by a twin brother and sister, and the brother immediately takes interest in Terminus Est, but Severian refuses to sell the sword. Shortly after, a masked and armoured hipparch enters the shop and challenges Severian to a duel. Severian, who believes this is an indirect means for the Autarch to execute him for his crime, is forced to accept, and he departs with the sister, Agia, to secure an avern, a deadly plant used for dueling. While on their way, urged by Agia's bet to a passing fiacre, their driver crashes into and destroys the altar of a religious order, where Agia is accused of stealing a precious artifact. After Agia is searched and released, they continue their journey to the Botanic Gardens, a large landmark of Nessus created by the mysterious Father Inire, right hand to the Autarch, where they encounter strange hypnotic illusions and at one point appear to be transported to present-day Earth without realizing it. Inside the gardens, Severian falls into a lake used to inter the dead, and while pulling himself out he finds a young woman named Dorcas to have come up from the lake as well. Dazed and confused, the woman follows Severian and Agia. Severian secures the avern with the help of a man named Hildegrin, who he recognizes as a companion of Vodalus from the night they met in the necropolis. Agia, Severian and Dorcas proceed to an inn near the dueling grounds. While eating dinner, Severian receives a mysterious note warning about one of the women. After dinner, Severian fights in the duel, and though stabbed by the avern he miraculously survives. When Severian wakes again, he finds himself to be in a lazaret. After finding Dorcas and identifying himself, he is requested to perform an execution. The prisoner turns out to be his opponent, Agia's brother, whom he executes after learning that Agia had challenged him in disguise, while her brother fought him with the avern, as part of a scheme to kill him and steal Terminus Est. Severian continues his travels toward Thrax, and Dorcas accompanies him. While searching his belongings, Severian finds the Claw of the Conciliator. Apparently Agia stole the Claw from the altar they destroyed and placed it in Severian's belongings knowing that she would be searched. Eventually Severian and Dorcas encounter Dr. Talos, Baldanders and Jolenta, who are almost ready to perform the play they had invited Severian to the morning before. Severian assists in the play, and the next day the group sets out toward the great gate leading out of Nessus, where they meet a man named Jonas. As they are passing through the gate, there is suddenly a commotion and the narration abruptly ends. ==Reception== Greg Costikyan reviewed The Shadow of the Torturer and The Claw of the Conciliator in Ares magazine #9 and commented that \\"This is fantasy as it should be written; portentous events, marvelous beings, wielders of great powers, a land of terror and delight. If Wolfe never writes another word, he will have made his mark.\\" ==Awards== The Shadow of the Torturer won the annual World Fantasy Award and British Science Fiction Association Award as the year's best novel. Among other annual awards for fantasy or science fiction novels, it placed second for the Locus (fantasy), third for the Campbell Memorial (SF), and was a finalist for the Nebula (SF). \\"Gene Wolfe\\" .

It is the second volume in the four-volume series The Book of the New Sun. ==Plot introduction== The book continues the story of Severian, a journeyman in the Seekers for Truth and Penitence (the guild of torturers), describing his travels north to the city of Thrax. An independent tale in the book, \\"The Tale of the Student and his Son\\", was later published separately in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, October 1981. == Plot summary == The book continues shortly after the previous installment left off, skipping Severian's journey from the gate of Nessus to the nearby town of Saltus. Having been separated from the rest of the group he was traveling with, Severian pauses his search for them here as he is given an opportunity to practice his art (in this case, execution) on two people. The first was accused of being a servant of Vodalus, a revolutionary leader. As the man is dragged out of his home by a mob, Severian glimpses Agia amidst the crowd, a woman who with her twin brother had formerly tried to swindle and then kill Severian to gain his valuable executioner's sword. (Severian executed the brother at the request of the local authorities.) Realizing she has been sighted, Agia flees and Severian, still in love with her, follows, searching for her at the town fair. Unable to find her, he ends up at a tent containing a man whose skin is green. The green man is held as a slave, and his master makes money off of him, claiming he can answer any question. In answer to Severian's queries as to how he could know everything, the green man tells Severian he is from the future. The green man does not know where Agia can be found, but Severian takes pity on him and gives him a piece of his whetstone so that he can free himself by grinding through his chains, thus recalling his mercy to Thecla, another prisoner, in the first book. Unable to find Agia, Severian returns to town where he later executes a woman accused of being a witch. Eating dinner with his friend Jonas (whom he met at the gate at Nessus) that evening, he finds a letter he first thinks is from Thecla (but is actually from Agia) asking him to meet her at a nearby cave. In the cave, Severian encounters and barely escapes a group of man-apes. The light from the Claw (a relic he accidentally came into possession of, which had previously been held by a religious order) stops the man-apes' attack, but it also seems to wake a gargantuan unknown creature deep below in the cave, who is only heard and not seen. Severian has little time to ponder this as he escapes, only to be attacked by Agia and her assassins outside the cave. One of the attackers is killed by one of the man-apes, who had its hand cut off by Severian in the battle in the cave. The ape gestures its stump at Severian, wanting him to do something with it, but Severian does not know what. Severian prepares to execute Agia, but, still unable to hate her, lets her go and returns to Saltus, where he and Jonas are kidnapped by Vodalus' gang for having agreed to execute one of its members. Severian recalls to Vodalus that he saved his life some years past, so Vodalus allows Severian to enter his service. Severian and Jonas attend a midnight dinner with Vodalus, where they consume Thecla's roasted flesh, which, when combined with an alien substance, allows Thecla's memories to live within Severian. Given the task to deliver a message to a servant in the House Absolute, the Autarch's seat of power, Severian and Jonas set off to the north. They are attacked by a flying creature who feeds on the heat and life force of living beings, and escape only by tricking the creature into attacking and killing a nearby soldier instead. Severian feels guilty and, having a suspicion of the healing powers of the Claw, uses it to bring the soldier back to life. They are then captured by guards of the House Absolute and thrown into an antechamber designed to hold prisoners indefinitely. Severian's Claw heals a wound Jonas receives during the night they spend there; then the pair escape some unknown horror using a pass phrase to open a secret door — Severian remembers the phrase using Thecla's memory. Walking the corridors of the House Absolute, Jonas is revealed to be a robot who once crash-landed on earth and is now partly covered by human flesh, and steps into a mirror and disappears, promising to return for Jolenta when he is healed. Severian is lost and eventually encounters the Autarch himself, to whom he swears service, upon being shown a portal to another universe. Stumbling into the gardens of the House Absolute, Severian is reunited with Dorcas, Dr. Talos, and Baldanders, who are preparing to once again perform the play they put on in the first book. Severian participates again, but the play is cut short when Baldanders flies into a rage and attacks the audience, revealing that aliens are among them. The band is scattered and Severian finds them a distance away the next morning, heading north. Talos and Baldanders part ways with Severian and Dorcas at a crossroad, Severian heading toward Thrax, and the giant and his physician headed toward Lake Diuturna. The waitress Jolenta tries to have Talos take her with him, but he has no more use for her now that the plays are no longer necessary, and Severian is forced to take her. As they head north, Jolenta is attacked by a \\"blood bat\\" and becomes ill. It is revealed that she had been scientifically altered by Dr. Talos to be gorgeous and desirable, but is quickly becoming sickly and unattractive. Soon the trio meets an old farmer who tells them they must pass through an enigmatic stone city to get to Thrax. Upon arriving at the ruinous city, Severian sees a pair of witches initiate a dream-like event in which ghostly dancers of the stone town's past fill the area and engage with the witch's servant, who is actually Vodalus's lieutenant Hildegrin. The book ends with Dorcas and Severian emerging from a stupor in the stone town, Jolenta dead, and the witches and Hildegrin gone. ==Reception== Greg Costikyan reviewed The Shadow of the Torturer and The Claw of the Conciliator in Ares Magazine #9 and commented that \\"This is fantasy as it should be written; portentous events, marvelous beings, wielders of great powers, a land of terror and delight. It Wolfe never writes another word, he will have made his mark.\\" ==Awards== The Claw of the Conciliator won the Nebula Award for Best Novel, in 1981; won the Locus Award in 1982; and Hugo and World Fantasy Award nominations in 1982. ==Limited edition== In 2008, Centipede Press, a small privately owned fine press, produced a limited edition of The Claw of the Conciliator. Like their previous limited edition of The Shadow of the Torturer, this book was limited to 100 copies, each signed by Gene Wolfe. This edition also included full color artwork by the German artist Alexander Preuss, a ribbon marker, head and tail bands, and three-piece cloth construction. It also came with a protective slipcase.

It is the fourth and final volume in the four- volume series The Book of the New Sun. ==Plot introduction== Unlike the first books in the series, The Citadel of the Autarch picks up right after the end of the previous one, The Sword of the Lictor. It tells of the travels of Severian, weak and defenseless after his encounter with Baldanders and Dr. Talos. Severian continues his travels, which lead him into war. == Plot == Severian finds himself wandering around when he first happens upon a dead soldier whom he revives with the Claw. The soldier remains unable to speak as they make their way to the Pelerines camp. In the camp, Severian suffers a fever and is treated along with others injured in the war. While recovering, Severian judges a story telling contest. Before leaving he returns the Claw by putting it in an altar. Outside the church Severian is tasked to visit a friend of the Pelerines in the mountain, to bring him back from the danger of the war to the safety of the camp. Severian arrives to the man's house but, due to time-travel related phenomena, the man disappears as he is led away. Upon returning to the camp, Severian discovers it has been attacked and abandoned. Severian soon finds the new camp where most of those he met during his stay are dead or dying. Eventually, Severian is drawn into war against armies of the North composed of people known as Ascians. Severian nearly perishes but is rescued by the androgynous spy he met in the House Absolute, the Autarch of the Commonwealth. Severian is nursed back to health and converses with the Autarch about his role in the Commonwealth. They board a flier and while heading out over the war zone, they are shot down. The Autarch is dying and tells Severian to consume the alzabo vial around his neck and consume his flesh, as Severian is to be the next Autarch. Severian does so and thus he acquires hundreds of consciousnesses that the Autarch once had. Before the Autarch died, he messaged Vodalus that the Autarch was aboard the flier. Thea and a group of Vodalus' men ascend on the crash site and rescue Severian from the Ascians. Severian is held prisoner and is visited by Agia who attempts to kill him once again. He survives and is rescued by the green time traveler whom he rescued earlier in The Claw of the Conciliator. The green man opens a passage through time in which Severian is then visited by an alien who takes the form of Master Malrubius and Triskele. Malrubius tells him that he must one day face a challenge that will either allow man to return to the stars (if he succeeds) or strip him of his manhood, leaving him infertile, and unable to produce an heir (if he fails). Severian realizes that the last Autarch must have failed which feminized him and gave him his androgynous looks. After the meeting, Severian is left on a beach. He discovers a bush covered in thorns. He claims the single black one, grown from a species of bush that grow exclusively white Claw shapes, and ponders the meaning of the Claw in relationship to higher beings, time-travel and the New Sun. Severian makes his way back to Nessus aboard a ship whose crew revere him on sight. He visits with people of his past and assumes the role of Autarch. He returns to the waiter who slipped him the note in the Shadow of the Torturer saying that Agia had been there before. The note was meant for Dorcas who reminded the waiter of his mother. A picture of Dorcas in a locket around the waiter's neck confirms this suspicion. Severian also notes that the waiter very much resembles himself and it is implied that the waiter is Severian's father. The book ends with Severian exploring the citadel and retracing Triskele's steps through an underground building. Seeing the dog's footsteps and his own he follows the latter, returning to the Atrium of Time. ==Reception== Dave Langford reviewed The Citadel of the Autarch for White Dwarf #44, and stated that \\"I think it's extremely good: marvellously written, with a feel for language which Stephen Donaldson would have done well to imitate. Unlike Donaldson's, Wolfe's obscure words lurk unobtrusively until they seem both familiar and - thanks to their careful planting in context - meaningful.\\" ===Awards=== Citadel was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1983Nebula Award for Best Novel but did not win. ==External links== * http://www.wolfewiki.com/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=WolfeWiki.TheCitadelOfTheAutarch ==References== Category:1983 science fiction novels Category:1983 American novels Category:High fantasy novels Category:Novels by Gene Wolfe Category:Dying Earth subgenre Category:Nebula Award for Best Novel-winning works Category:1983 fantasy novels Category:Books with cover art by Don Maitz Category:The Book of The New Sun ","title":"The Citadel of the Autarch"},{"id":"2581535","text":"The Sword of the Lictor is a science fantasy novel by American writer Gene Wolfe, first released in 1982. It is the third volume in the four-volume series The Book of the New Sun. ==Plot introduction== The book continues the story of Severian, a lictor in the Seekers for Truth and Penitence, describing his time as a torturer in the city Thrax and then his travels after soon leaving Thrax. ==Plot summary== Having completed the journey he was sent upon when he was exiled from the Citadel, Severian takes up his position as the Lictor (or Master of Chains) of the city of Thrax. His lover Dorcas falls into depression, in part because of her position as the partner of a reviled and feared figure in a strange city. She is also becoming increasingly upset by her mysterious past, and convinced that she must unravel its secrets, however disturbing they may turn out to be. Escaping an exotic creature that incinerates things, which seems to have come to Thrax to find him, Severian finds himself again showing mercy to a condemned prisoner and is forced to flee the city. He and Dorcas separate, and he journeys alone into the mountains in search of the Pelerines, whom he believes to be the rightful keepers of the priceless relic which he carries, the Claw of the Conciliator. On the road, he battles his enemy Agia, and the Alzabo—a beast which acquires the memories of those it consumes, as well as a gang of men who have opted to become as animals. In the wake of this violence, he takes an orphaned boy, little Severian, into his care. They encounter a village of men who claim to be sorcerers, and who possess more power than Severian at first believes. Escaping amidst the threat that yet another dangerous creature has been set upon his trail, Severian discovers a monarch from the past, Typhon, in an ancient city. Typhon tries to manipulate Severian during a complex confrontation. Little Severian is killed. Continuing his journey, Severian is drawn into a local conflict on the side of a group of islanders being enslaved. He then discovers that his old companions Dr. Talos and Baldanders are the enslavers, and is forced to battle the giant Baldanders. In the wake of this battle, in which his sword and the Claw are both (at least apparently, in the latter case) destroyed, Severian seeks to digest a series of revelations: about the nature of Baldanders, the nature of the aliens who manipulate events on Urth yet profess to be his friends, and the nature of the Claw which he carried for so long. As he does so, he finds himself approaching the edge of the war in the North. ==Awards== In 1983 The Sword of the Lictor won the Locus Award for Best Fantasy NovelLocus Award for Best Fantasy Novel and the August Derleth AwardAugust Derleth Award, and was nominated for the Nebula in 1982Nebula Award for Best Novel and Hugo in 1983. ==References== ==External links== * http://www.wolfewiki.com/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=WolfeWiki.TheSwordOfTheLictor Category:1982 science fiction novels Category:1982 American novels Category:High fantasy novels Category:Novels by Gene Wolfe Category:Dying Earth subgenre Category:Nebula Award for Best Novel-winning works Category:1982 fantasy novels Category:Books with cover art by Don Maitz Category:The Book of The New Sun ","title":"The Sword of the Lictor"},{"id":"2581546","text":"Bevern () is a municipality in the District of Holzminden, Lower Saxony, Germany.

The town is most well known for manufacturing all kinds of lighting. In recent years the town has grown into a place with thousands of small and big factories all related to lighting in one way or the other. Many international lighting companies have factories and showrooms in Guzhen town, which is about one and a half hours drive from Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. If you are coming from Hong Kong, it will take 2 hours to reach Zhongshan ferry terminal and another 30 minutes to Guzhen Town. The population of Guzhen Town is estimated at 75,000 permanent residents with a floating population of up to 30,000. ==Administration== The area of Guzhen is divided into twenty administrative districts each with a resident committee. ==Geography== The town of Guzhen is bordered by Jiangmen to the West, with the Xi river serving as a boundary. The Xi river forms part of the Pearl River. Foshan borders Guzhen to the North. ==Economics== ===Lighting industry=== Dubbed China Lighting Capital by the China Light Industry Council and China Association of Lighting Industry. Guzhen is the largest production base of lighting fittings in China and one of the four largest lighting fitting distributing centers in the world. In 2001, lighting fittings produced in Guzhen made up 60% of the Chinese market with exports reaching $1 billion. The production of lighting fittings is the primary industry in Guzhen, accounting for nearly 88% of the town's industrial output. The development of the lighting fittings industry in Guzhen can be traced back to the late 1970s, however, the first significant developments took place from the mid-1980s to early 1990s. Due to the rapid economic development of China Guzhen's lighting fittings industry has undergone unprecedented growth in the past two decades. Guzhen's growth at the turn of the millennium was unprecedented, boasting a 50% increase in lighting enterprises from 1999 to 2001, with exports increasing from $40 million to $250 million. In the year 2013, total exports for lighting items from Guzhen Town exceeded $1 billion, as per unofficial sources.

Two rows of bilaterally symmetrical piercings are performed and can be composed of as few as four piercings (two in each row) or as many as the length of the area being pierced (usually the back) and the vertical space between piercings will allow space for. Due to the difficulty and risks associated with permanently healing single surface piercings, most corset piercings are intended to be temporary. ==As temporary piercings== Temporary corset piercings are often performed for aesthetic reasons, often as part of a fetish event or photo shoot. A body piercer may also perform a corset piercing to promote their business, to be photographed for a portfolio or to be used for advertising purposes. They may also be performed as play piercings as part of BDSM activity. Often temporary corset piercings are worn laced with ribbon, rope, or chain. Usually temporary corset piercings use captive bead rings as jewelry, but corset piercings intended as play piercings or as part of a short photo shoot might simply be done with hypodermic needles, which will be removed after the activity is finished. Rarely worn for more than a week, corset piercings are typically worn only for a few hours or until the event or activity they were required for has ended. Temporary corset piercings are open wounds, and are subject to the same infection, cross contamination, and irritation risks as any other healing piercing or small wound. Scarring from the removal of temporary piercings is usually minimal or non-existent. ==As permanent piercings== It is possible for the multiple surface wounds that constitute a corset piercing to heal; however, they are unlikely to heal properly. Permanent corset piercings would consist of multiple surface piercings, pierced with jewelry designed for the purpose, and bear all of the healing issues and risks associated with them. To date, the most successful attempts at permanent corset piercings have been performed with surface bars, although some success has been reported using Teflon or Tygon tubing, both of which are flexible and move with the body. There have also been experiments in healing corset piercings as transdermal implants. Due to the tremendous potential for the healing piercings to be irritated by normal daily life, corset piercings, even healed ones, require constant vigilance by the wearer to prevent damage. Although corset piercings are usually intended to be laced, during the healing period, especially the initial healing period, surface piercings intended to be part of permanent corset piercings are not usually laced as it puts pressure, torsion, and tension on the piercing that can increase the chances of migration and rejection. Once the piercing is fully healed, one of the beads at the end of the surface bar can be replaced with a special bead, drilled to accept a ring, similar to the bead on a bondage bar. The healed surface piercings can then be laced for aesthetic purposes, although subjecting the piercings to extended periods of lacing can increase the risk of migration or rejection. Healing and aftercare for corset piercings is identical to healing for any surface piercings, although the healing process can be extended and complicated due to the number of piercings healing at the same time, which puts greater stress on the body. The location of most corset piercings, on the individual's back, can make caring for the healing piercings more difficult as well. Like all surface piercings, rejected or improperly healed corset piercings can leave noticeable permanent scarring. ==History and culture== Although corsetry has a long history, the corset piercing is of contemporary origin, coming into practice with the establishment of the body piercing industry in the late 1990s. Like corsetry, it is associated with erotic behavior and aesthetics, particularly fetish aesthetics. Also paralleling corsets, most wearers of corset piercings are women. There is some controversy regarding the publication and promotion of images of corset piercing. Almost all of the photographs of corset piercing are of fresh piercings, which have not had the time to reject, migrate or otherwise fail to heal properly. Images used in advertising or magazines may be photoshopped or airbrushed to eliminate indications of swelling, redness, or infection, further promoting the illusion that these piercings are easy, or even possible to heal. Photographs of corset piercings done with captive bead rings, which are inappropriate for permanent corset piercings, vastly outnumber photographs of corset piercings done as proper surface piercings. Usually corset piercings are photographed laced, also leading the public to believe that they can be worn laced at all times, which is not possible, even in a well healed, permanent corset piercing. ==External links== * Body Modification E-Zine article on corset piercing * Body Modification E-Zine Encyclopedia entry on corset piercing * Snopes.com Urban Legends Reference Page on corset piercing * Painful Pleasures Body Mod photo Gallery - Corset Piercing Pictures * GreatPiercingShop.com Original information taken from source - Reference Page on corset piercing Category:Surface piercings ","title":"Corset piercing"},{"id":"2581560","text":"Port Tennant Port Tennant is a suburban district of Swansea, Wales, falling within the St. Thomas ward.

See “Standard Outputs”, Table KS101SC, Area type: Civil Parish 1930, Area: Abbey St Bathans == History and Kirk == Abbey St Bathans was originally a priory of Cistercian Nuns established in the 12th century. It was sanctified and then used as a retreat by the sisters who formed the community at Haddington and at Nunraw, under the patronage of Ada, Countess of Dunbar and her husband Patrick, Earl of Dunbar. While there is no priory today there is a small church, or Kirk, in private ownership situated in the centre of the village. The Kirk was rebuilt in the 18th century and incorporates, in the east and north walls, late 14th century remains of the Church of the Priory of St Mary - the original Cistercian priory founded in the late 12th or early 13th centuries (exact date unknown) and secularised in 1622. Abbey St Bathans KirkIn the mid-1960s a deposit or \\"midden\\" was found by the existing Kirk, on the river bank where such a \\"tip\\" would logically be located . This contained many shards of pottery which were identified as mediaeval by the Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh. This suggests that the priory was located in the riverside meadow area around the existing Kirk, and a dig would probably reveal some of the structure. This deposit was discovered and excavated by Mrs. E. K. Robb, whose family used to holiday in the village. The dedication is to Saint Bathan () the second abbot of Iona. A Minister used to be shared with nearby hamlet of Longformacus. Edins Hall BrochThere is evidence that Abbey St Bathans has been inhabited for at least 2500 years with the discovery of bronze age artefacts including a bronze age dagger , and the presence of the nearby Edins Hall Broch, an Iron Age defensive structure. ==The village== Abbey St Bathans village is situated beside the Whiteadder Water. The village is centred around the Kirk, a footbridge (known locally as the 'Gurkha bridge' after the Gurkha Soldiers that built it in 1987), sheep sheds, a post box, telephone exchange, phone box and housing. The Rest House, no longer a working youth hostel Further up the valley north of the Kirk is the village hall which holds regular events and occasional exhibitions. Downriver, south of the Kirk can be found a fish farm, car park, cafe and small sawmill. The Southern Upland Way and the Sir Walter Scott Way pass through the village. There are several footpaths for walkers including to the nearby Edins Hall Broch and Cockburn Law hill. The village is also on a bicycling route. The SYHA used to have a youth hostel in the village known locally as the Rest House, however it has been closed for over ten years. The New Zealand township of Saint Bathans is named after the village.Reed, A.W. (1975) Place names of New Zealand. Wellington: A.H. & A.W. Reed. p. 371 ==Abbey St Bathans House== The house began, probably in the early 19th century (a date stone of 1694 is of unknown provenance) as a thatched cottage ornée, set at the base of a knoll with the ground falling away steeply to the north to the Whiteadder Water. It was built for the Turnbull family. This earlier core is identifiable at the centre of the entrance front as a two-bay section with first-floor dormers rising through the eaves, and with a salient gabled section at its northern end terminating the north-west range. Later extensions, especially in the 1870s, retain something of the original character, if not the scale, in the plethora of traceried bargeboards, dormers, and barley-sugar chimneystacks. The detailing of the north-west front is more overtly Baronial, having a central tower-like pavilion with chamfered corners at the upper levels, a tall pyramidal roof, and a quadrant bartizan at the north-east angle. There are attractive interiors, particularly the stair with twisted balusters and timber arcading. Many fittings were moved here in the 1880s by Dorothea Veitch from Bassendean House. On the estate are a picturesque lodge, stables and groom’s cottage, and an artfully composed Z-plan complex including gamekeeper’s cottage and kennels. In 2019 the house was in multiple occupation. ==Non profit community resources== *Abbey St Bathans, Bonkyl and Preston Community Council *Know the code before you go (Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003) ==See also== *List of places in the Scottish Borders *List of places in Scotland *Saint Bathans, New Zealand — a historic township named after Abbey St Bathans *Sir Walter Scott Way *Southern Upland Way ==References== Cruft, Dunbar & Fawcett, The buildings of Scotland: Borders, 2006, p. 90 Category:Villages in the Scottish Borders Category:Berwickshire Category:Parishes in Berwickshire ","title":"Abbey St Bathans"},{"id":"2581567","text":"Millers Point is an inner-city suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is on the north-western edge of the Sydney central business district, adjacent to The Rocks and is part of the local government area of the City of Sydney. Millers Point lies on the southern shore of Sydney Harbour, beside Darling Harbour. The Barangaroo development is taking place on 22 hectares of land on the western side of the suburb.Barangaroo a north shore girl , City of Sydney, 19 October 2006. Retrieved 5 December 2006. Sections of Millers Point have been included as part of The Rocks area in the past and some residents and businesses still use it in their address. ==History== On 30 June 1814 Thomas Miller, a Sergeant in the 73rd Regiment of Foot, received a grant of land from the governor. A small mill that was owned by an ex-convict, Jack Leighton was located here. The area became known as Jack, the Miller's Point. In 1833 Governor Bourke granted the Catholic Church land at Millers Point for the construction of a school house that could serve as a chapel on Sundays. The Colonial Architect, Ambrose Hallen in consultation with Bishop Ullathorne, designed the school building which was completed by May 1835. It was a one-story building constructed in sandstone with two rooms that could be opened into one. St Brigid's Church is one of the oldest existing place of Catholic worship in Australia. The school was closed in 1992 but the church continues to be used by the local community.http://www.deh.gov.au/cgi- bin/heritage/photodb/imagesearch.pl?proc=detail;barcode_no=rt46731 From 1841 to 1921, Miller's Point was the location of a gasworks owned by the Australian Gaslight Company. The current Sydney Observatory building on Observatory Hill was completed in 1858 by English astronomer and clergyman William Scott. Also on Observatory Hill is the old Fort Street School, converted from the old Military Hospital at Fort Phillip in the 1850s. Fort Street School incorporated the first government secondary school in Australia, and after the secondary school moved out in 1975, its building has housed the National Trust of Australia; the primary school remains nearby in a separate, heritage listed, building. Two separate pubs in the area claim to be Sydney's oldest surviving pubs, the Lord Nelson (built in about 1836, but modified since) at Millers Point and the Fortune of War (which was built in its current form in 1922, although a hotel was operating on the site in 1830) nearby at The Rocks. Other active pubs in the area include the Palisade, the Hero of Waterloo and the Captain Cook. ==Population== In the 2016 Census, there were 1,482 people in Millers Point. 42.5% of people were born in Australia and 59.9% of people only spoke English at home. The most common response for religion was No Religion at 29.3%. ==Protests== Protest Signs in 2014 A protest movement developed from 2008 when various governments announced plans to lease and sell Millers Point, Dawes Point and The Rocks properties and move existing public housing tenants. \\"Save Our Community\\", \\"Friends of Millers Point\\" and the associated \\"Save Our Sirius\\" formed

It is located east of Charing Cross. It lies within the Historic County of Kent. From Summer 2021, Abbey Wood will be connected by Crossrail's Elizabeth Line. ==Toponymy== The district takes its name from Lesnes Abbey Woods, located to the east, which once belonged to the monks of Lesnes Abbey. ==Development== The Abbey of St Mary and St Thomas the Martyr at Lesnes (or Lesnes Abbey) was founded in 1178 by Richard de Luci, Chief Justiciar of England. The Abbott of Lesnes Abbey was an important local landlord, and took a leading part in draining the marshland. However, this and the cost of maintaining river embankments was one of the reasons given for the Abbey's chronic financial difficulties. It never became a large community, and was closed by Cardinal Wolsey in 1525, under a licence to suppress monasteries of less than seven inmates. It was one of the first monasteries to be closed after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1524, and the monastic buildings were all pulled down, except for the Abbott's Lodging. Henry Cooke acquired the site in 1541 and it eventually passed to Sir John Hippersley who salvaged building materials, before selling the property to Thomas Hawes of London in 1632. It was then bequeathed to Christ's Hospital in 1633. Abbey Wood railway station was opened in 1849, immediately to the north of the area now known as \\"The Village\\", built where Knee Hill became Harrow Manorway. Contemporary maps show Knee Hill as a minor track compared with a more major pathway through the centre of the existing woods.See http://www.ideal- homes.org.uk/greenwich/abbey-wood/map-abbey-wood-1870.htm . The Village consisted of a dozen or so cottages, and two pubs, the Abbey Arms (next to the railway station) and the Harrow Inn (demolished in 2009).See http://www.stmichaelsabbeywood.co.uk/history.htm The Harrow Inn which was located on the Kent side of Abbey Wood was the place where live bands would play in their hall; it was also the scene of a nightly migration as drinkers would relocate to the Abbey Arms each night, as Kentish closing times used to be 10.30pm whilst the Abbey Arms, which was in London, closed at 11 o'clock. Abbey Wood was suggested as a site for a cemetery serving east London at a time of burial crisis in the capital. When the station was new, Edwin Chadwick proposed the closure of all existing burial grounds in the vicinity of London other than the privately owned Kensal Green Cemetery northwest of the city, which was to be nationalised and greatly enlarged to provide a single burial ground for west London, while a large tract of land on the Thames around southeast of London in Abbey Wood was to become a single burial ground for east London. The Treasury was sceptical that Chadwick's scheme would ever be financially viable, and it was widely unpopular. Although the Metropolitan Interments Act 1850 authorised the scheme, it was abandoned in 1852. The Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society (RACS) owned two farms on the hillside to the south of The Village, and between 1900 and 1930 built the Bostall Estate. Once known as \\"Tin Check Island\\" after the Society's dividend system, and known locally as \\"The Co-op Estate\\", this has streets named after Co-operative themes (Alexander McLeod, the first secretary of the RACS, Rochdale, Robert Owen, Congress), a school & shops but, like much social housing of the period, no public houses. The housing is largely traditional of the \\"two-up, two-down\\" design, in distinctive yellow London brick, with gardens to the front and rear.See http://www.kentarchaeology.ac/authors/006.pdf for a more detailed description of the building of the Bostall Estate. Between 1955 and 1959 the London County Council built the Abbey Estate starting with one road south of the railway and later extending on the northern side on former Royal Arsenal marshland. Predominantly conventional brick houses with gardens, at first there were no shops or pubs, later equipped with a few shops and pubs together with schools and open spaces were added. Transport was non existent at first until one bus, the route 180 was added after the building of Eynsham bridge. The estate was first used to rehouse people from Dockhead and Peckham then London's East End. The main through-road is Eynsham Drive. In the mid-1960s the Greater London Council began building the first phase of Thamesmead on more ex-Royal Arsenal land, north-east of Abbey Wood station. The original railway level crossing was replaced by a flyover. Abbey Wood has benefited from the opening of the DLR station at Woolwich Arsenal, whilst the next stage in the development of the area will be the construction of Crossrail, a development tipped to encourage the growth of local house prices by the time it is opened in Autumn 2019. Abbey Wood will be connected by The Elizabeth Line, with travel times of 11 minutes to Canary Wharf and 25 minutes to Bond Street. The Greenwich ward of Abbey Wood has a population of just over 13,000,http://www.greenwich.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/42616176-F28F-4577-A8A1-F3930C8B6902/0/_5_AbbeyWoodProfile.pdf and its rail station sees over 3 million passenger journeys a year. ==Places of interest== Places of interest include the ruins of the 12th-century Lesnes Abbey and the adjacent Lesnes Abbey Woods, a Local Nature Reserve. Part of the Woods are designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest called Abbey Wood, which has important Paleogene fossils. The ancient Bostall Woods & Heath. Bostall Woods (part of the South East London Green Chain) includes one of the few camping and caravan sites in London, which is owned and operated by The Caravan Club. The co-operative woods were also the site of the first camp for the Woodcraft Folk. St. Michael and All Angels Parish Church was opened in a temporary building in 1905. A permanent church, designed by Sir Arthur Blomfield, was consecrated three years later, and the original building became the church hall.

It was a daughter house of Whitland Abbey, and constructed at the behest of three sons of Madog, the then Prince of southern Powys.

His modification of the standard hoplite formation and his use of reserve cavalry in that battle constitute what most historians agree is the first recorded use of formal military tactics in human history. == Biographical information == Little is known of Pagondas's life. He is mentioned by Pindar as having been born to a noble Theban family, and we know that he was in his early sixties at Delium. He was evidently a fiery and persuasive speaker, purportedly moving the disparate Boeotian contingents to unify and attack their Athenian enemies through rhetoric alone. Apart from a brief mention by Thucydides, however, there is very little extant information about Pagondas or his life. He seems to have appeared and abruptly disappeared solely for the Battle of Delium. == Delium == At the battle, the Boeotians faced off against a group of Athenians led by Hippocrates. The Boeotians charged down a hill at the Athenian army, while the Athenians, having been surprised by their sudden appearance, got themselves together and charged up the hill. On the Boeotian left were men from the town of Thespiae. On their right, Pagondas had placed his own Thebans. Remarkably though, he chose to stack his Thebans twenty-five shields deep, rather than the standard eight, to give them more pushing-power and punch. This marks the first recorded instance of any Greek general ever changing the standard depth of a hoplite unit. This novel technique worked wonders, as the Thebans rapidly broke through the Athenian left, and moved to encircle the rest of the Athenian army. However, the Thespians on the Boeotian left were up against the Athenians' crack troops, and were themselves quickly overwhelmed, surrounded, and killed almost to a man. Sensing that his victorious Thebans could not outflank the enemy before the Athenian right broke into his rear, Pagondas chose to do something utterly unprecedented in the annals of Greek warfare. He called in a reserve force (the mere creation of which was itself unprecedented) of several hundred cavaliers to support the now decimated Thespians. The Athenians on the right were stunned by this—so much so that they apparently fell into a confusion and turned tail. This was perhaps fortunate for Pagondas's cavaliers, as Greek cavalry, made up of light-armed aristocrats without saddles or stirrups, was no match for a company of hoplites. Nevertheless, the use of the cavalry reserve broke the Athenian right and, because the Thebans had by now moved into the Athenian rear, caused a general Athenian rout. Pagondas's victory at Delium helped guarantee Boeotian security, and prevented further Athenian incursions into their territory for the remainder of the Peloponnesian War. == After effects == Pagondas's theretofore unseen employment of tactics in combat set the stage for his fellow Theban Epaminondas's brilliant command at Leuctra (371 BC), considered one of the most astounding tactical victories in the history of warfare. How much Epaminondas learned directly from Pagondas and Delium is lost to history - he was not yet born when the battle was fought, and given Pagondas's age at the battle of Delium it is unlikely the two ever met. Visually, the similarity of their tactics suggests a link, but the 53 year interval raises the question as to whether the use of a deeper phalanx became a staple of Theban tactical lore or had to be reinvented by Epaminondas, perhaps after reading an account of the battle? Furthermore, the tactic of a deeper phalanx had been used by Pelopidas, a compatriot of Epaminondas, at the Battle of Tegyra four years before the Battle of Leuctra. In turn, Philip of Macedon, who was raised in Boeotia as a hostage, was apparently taught by Epaminondas himself and, after Epaminondas's death, by other Theban generals and was a student of the Peloponnesian War, would go on to develop further the tactical ideas originated by Pagondas. In turn, his legacy would be followed and expanded by his son, Alexander the Great. Historian Victor Davis Hanson, among others, therefore argues that Pagondas's simple use of cavalry reserves and altered troop formations set the stage for the entire military history of the West, and, by extension, the world. == See also == * Socrates * Alcibiades * Military tactic * Military strategy * Ancient Greece * Battle of Leuctra == Further reading == * Hanson, Victor Davis Ripples of Battle: How Wars of the Past Still Determine How we Fight, How we Live, and How we Think (Doubleday, 2003) * Thucydides History of the Peloponnesian War * Kagan, Donald The Peloponnesian War (Viking Press, 2003) Category:People of the Peloponnesian War Category:Ancient Theban generals Category:5th-century BC Greek people ","title":"Pagondas"},{"id":"2581607","text":"Abbeystead is a small hamlet located in the Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in Lancashire, England. Abbeystead lies close to the Trough of Bowland but even in medieval times, was considered part of Wyresdale rather than within the domain of that powerful local magnate, the Lord of Bowland, so-called Lord of the Fells.Forest of Bowland official website Abbeystead is located in the civil and ecclesiastical parish of Over Wyresdale. ==History== Little is known of the history of Abbeystead before the Norman Conquest, except that it was occupied from at least the middle of the prehistoric period. ==Name== The name is derived from \\"the site of the abbey\\" and relates to the short-lived presence of a house of Cistercian monks from Furness Abbey between c.1192 and 1204. One tradition sites the monks' house just below the junction of the Marshaw Wyre and the Tarnbrook Wyre, on the north side of the reservoir. Another places it around the site of the primary school. ==Structures== Notable buildings in the Abbeystead area include: Cawthorne's Endowed School, founded 1674, rebuilt on its original site in 1877; Home Farm opposite, dated at 1891; Abbeystead House, built in 1886 for the 4th Earl of Sefton, Stoops Bridge Cottage, built in 1674 to house the schoolmaster, rebuilt in 1841, and the attached schoolroom, which now houses the Abbeystead Estate Office, which housed the school from 1841 to 1877. Records trace the chapel to the west of Abbeystead back to the 14th century. The church was rebuilt in 1733, with a spire, buttresses to the tower, new windows, a vestry and new sanctuary added during restoration in 1894, at which time benches replaced pews and the west end musicians' gallery was removed. The Abbeystead Reservoir was built in 1855 by Lancaster Corporation to supply mills lower down the River Wyre in the dry season. Although the reservoir is no longer in service it still features a curved overflow weir visible from the footpath. == Abbeystead disaster == On 23 May 1984, 44 people were attending a presentation at a newly built valve house at the outfall end of the Lune/Wyre Transfer Scheme in Abbeystead when an explosion occurred in the building. A total of 16 people were killed and 22 injured, some severely. The event had been organised to demonstrate how winter flooding in the lower Wyre Valley could be managed. An official inquiry into the disaster concluded that methane from coal deposits had built up in an empty pipe. It was released by the sudden pressure of water from the pumps as they were switched on. The cause of ignition has never been determined. ==References== ==External links== Category:Villages in Lancashire Category:Geography of the City of Lancaster Category:Forest of Bowland ","title":"Abbeystead"},{"id":"2581611","text":"Abbeytown, also known as Holme Abbey, is a village and civil parish in Cumbria, England. The name Abbeytown dates to the mid-17th century (The Towne of the Abbey, Abbey Towne; Abbeytown from mid-18th century) and is named after the Holmcultram Abbey founded in the 12th century. The population of the civil parish as of the 2011 census was 819. It is located five-and-a-half miles south-east of Silloth, and six-and-a-half miles north-west of Wigton. The civil parish borders Holme Low to the north, Holme East Waver and Dundraw to the east, Bromfield to the south, and Holme St Cuthbert to the west. The county town of Carlisle is eighteen miles to the north-east. Other nearby settlements include Foulsyke, Highlaws, Kelsick, Mawbray, Pelutho, and Wheyrigg. The B5302 road runs through the village. Historically a part of Cumberland, Abbeytown was built around the former Cistercian Holmcultram Abbey, the nave of the church of which now serves the parish as St Mary's Church. On 9 June 2006 the church was set alight in an arson attack which devastated its roof parts of which had been in situ since it was erected 900 years ago. The church has since been restored, and fully reopened in September 2015. The Village also has a recreational field, which regularly hosts football matches from around the Allerdale district. The recreational field was constructed in 2012, with the demolition of the former standing structural foundation making way for a new field. A designated area within this field houses the children's play park. As of 2015 Abbeytown Archers have set up their club at the recreational field, and outdoor shooting takes place on Monday evenings, with indoor shooting held in the Holm Cultram C of E school, also on Mondays. The village is located on the main Wigton to Silloth road and has a small range of local amenities including a pub, post office and a shop. Many buildings in the village date from the medieval period, especially those associated with the former abbey. Others are Victorian, when much of the village was concerned with the railway line to Silloth, and, more recently, a large number of houses were built at \\"Friars Garth\\". The village is located on the edge of the Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the Cumbria Coastal Way passes through the village. ==Governance== Abbeytown is part of the parliamentary constituency of Workington. In the December 2019 general election, the Tory candidate for Workington, Mark Jenkinson, was elected the MP, overturning a 9.4 per cent Labour majority from the 2017 election to eject shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman by a margin of 4,136 votes. Until the December 2019 general election The Labour Party has won the seat in the constituency in every general election since 1979.The Conservative Party has only been elected once in Workington since World War 2, at the 1976 by-election. Before Brexit, it was in the North West England European Parliamentary Constituency. ==Nuclear disposal site== In June 2012, it became clear that the Solway Plain between Silloth, Abbeytown and Westnewton has been identified as a potential site for a Geological Disposal Facility for the UK's high level nuclear waste. Two other sites have also been identified – Eskdale and Ennerdale – both of these are within the Lake District National Park. The Solway Plain wasn't named by the Managing Radioactive Waste Safely (MRWS) Partnership, rather they referred to the 'Low permeability sedimentary rocks associated with the Mercia Mudstone Group (MMG)'. This was in (publicly available) document 285 of the West Cumbria MRWS in a report written by Dr Dearlove, the consultant geologist recruited by MRWS. In 2013, Cumbria County Council withdrew from the MRWS process. Though Allerdale Borough Council and Copeland Borough Council wished to proceed, the Department of Energy and Climate Change closed the site selection process in west Cumbria. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Holme Abbey ==Sources and external links== * Holme Cultram Abbey pictures (before and after the fire) * British History Online: The Register and Records of Holm Cultram: the full text of the cartulary and other records of the abbey. ==References== Category:Villages in Cumbria Category:Civil parishes in Cumbria ","title":"Abbeytown"},{"id":"2581614","text":"Darryl White (born 12 June 1973) is an Australian rules footballer whose career with the Brisbane Bears and Lions in the Australian Football League (AFL) lasted from 1992 to 2005. An Indigenous Australian, in 2005 he was named at fullback in the Australian rules football Indigenous Team of the Century. Beyond his AFL career, White continues to be involved in football, having forged one of the most successful careers of any Australian rules footballer, with six premierships across three competitions (AFL, NTAFL and QSL). He is an indigenous role model for many aboriginal Australians. ==Early career== White, who is of Indigenous Australian (Arrernte)BRISBANE LIONS RECONCILIATION  ACTION PLAN  AUGUST 2018 - AUGUST 2019 descent, grew up in Alice Springs in central Australia, playing junior football for the Pioneer Football Club. Like many of his peers he had a difficult adolescence, but had a natural talent for football. In 1990 he represented the Northern Territory at the Teal Cup under-17 national football carnival held in Brisbane, where he came to the attention of Brisbane Bears coach Robert Walls and his football manager Scott Clayton. Impressed with his clean ball handling skills, his leap and his ability to play tall, the Bears drafted him at the end of the season with a priority draft pick from their Queensland-Northern Territory recruiting zone. ==AFL career== Despite initial reluctance to move to the Bears—a club which, in White's words, \\"only won two games a year\\",Morris, G. 2004, 'NT champ is first to 250', Northern Territory News, 2 June, p. 48. the future football star was persuaded to give the club a chance (turning up to his first training session in a purple LA Lakers singlet and bouncing a basketball). He found the transition from Alice Springs football to training under strict disciplinarian Walls difficult once there, for example; on one occasion during an cycle up a mountain he hurled his bike off a cliff, telling his coach he'd come to play football, not ride bikes.Steele, S. 2005, 'Lions farewell a favourite', The Sunday Mail, 28 August, p. 98.Voss, M. 2005, 'Band of brothers lights up the football world – on and off the field', Sunday Age, 17 July, p. 6. His first season of football was an announcement of a rare talent, leading the Brownlow Medal count after three rounds with two best-on-ground performances and kicking the official goal of the year with his first-ever goal. However White suffered continual problems with homesickness. At the end of the season he immediately returned to Alice Springs and did not return for the start of pre- season training a month later. When Walls telephoned him to ask him if he was coming back, the response was: \\"I'm really busy—call me again in a couple of weeks.\\"*Walls, R. 2002, 'Cubs Could Only Dream of Premierships, Now Lions Are The Stuff of Nightmares', The Age, 27 March, p. 1. White soon became a crowd favourite, with a marking ability well beyond that which his height would normally allow. Fans grew to instantly recognise his loping running style, his casual but pinpoint foot passing, and his idiosyncratic pose after a mark, holding the ball aloft on its point as if to show the world he'd caught it. He even found citywide fame when a photo of a spectacular White mark was published on the cover of the 1996 Brisbane White Pages telephone directory (a marketing coup for the struggling club). White's vertical jump allowed his coaches to take advantage of his flexibility by positioning him in a variety of key positions—even, when injuries to teammates demanded it, the ruck. White's opponents were often much taller and stronger but his leap and flexibility allowed him to hold his own in such contests. White survived the 1996 merger between Fitzroy and the Bears which formed the Brisbane Lions, and was an integral member of its first premiership victory in 2001 playing off half-back. He also played in the Lions' flag wins in 2002 and 2003, as well as its Grand Final loss in 2004. By now, White had become an inspiration to other indigenous players, especially those from his former home of the Northern Territory. On one occasion, he even found himself approached by a young indigenous player from another club immediately after a match who asked him to pose for a photograph with him before leaving the ground. His progression from erratic youth to responsible adult had been guided by mentor and former teammate, fellow aborigine Michael McLean. A trip to South Africa in 1997 and a 36-hour gaol term for assault in the same year (later overturned on appeal) opened his eyes to what his life could have been. \\"I used to be out stealing handbags,\\" he said in 2001. \\"I was just starting to get into bigger and better stuff. Back then, I was stealing BMWs. Luckily I got caught and got sent away for six months in [a] juvenile detention centre in Perth. Look at me now, it's all changed.\\"Burke, B. 2001, 'White thankful for lucky timing', The Australian, 19 September, p. 24. In 2005 he was named captain of the Indigenous All-Stars, an all-Aboriginal team, selected to play the Western Bulldogs in Darwin that February. White was devastated when he ruptured a thumb ligament at Lions training in the weeks before the game, and was unable to play. Desperate to play a part, he flew in for the occasion and acted as the team's runner during the game. However, in 2003 and 2004 his form had been patchy, spending increasing time in the club's seconds side, and at the end of each season there was increasing speculation that he would retire. The Lions continued to show their loyalty to the player who had served them so well and re-signed him for the 2005 season, but he added only ten games to his career tally. In the second-last home-and-away game of that season, with the Lions struggling to make the finals, White played in the seconds and kicked nine goals, ensuring his recall for one last game. The Lions were thrashed by St Kilda by a record 139 points in Melbourne in a disappointing finish to a spectacular and entertaining career. In the last quarter, White fielded a mark at half-forward and held it skyward in trademark fashion. He then drilled a no-look pass forward to Jared Brennan, a player who had idolised White as a boy. Brennan goaled. White's shellshocked teammates flocked around him to offer congratulations. After the siren, he was carried from the ground by indigenous teammates Chris Johnson and Ash McGrath, signifying the respect in which he had been held by his community. White's contribution to football and his community was recognised in 2005 when he was named at fullback in the Indigenous Team of the Century, alongside premiership teammate Johnson and former mentor McLean. His Brisbane captain, Michael Voss, said that it was important that White be kept involved in football. \\"He has taught me a lot and helped me try to understand their indigenous culture. He will leave the game with a lot of respect from his teammates and fellow players.\\"Cartwright, D. 2005, 'White's nine goals earn fond farewell', The Courier-Mail, 26 August, p. 58. ==Statistics== :Darryl White's player profile at AFL Tables - - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1992 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  29  19  17  8  155  122  277  68  30  0.9  0.4  8.2  6.4  14.6  3.6  1.6 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   1993 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  29  12  13  4  72  67  139  37  25  1.1  0.3  6.0  5.6  11.6  3.1  2.1 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  1994 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  33  15  10  6  93  91  184  56  20  0.7  0.4  6.2  6.1  12.3  3.7  1.3 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   1995 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  33  22  29  17  169  122  291  100  39  1.3  0.8  7.7  5.5  13.2  4.5  1.8 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1996 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  33  22  37  11  194  111  305  87  40  1.7  0.5  8.8  5.0  13.9  4.0  1.8 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   1997 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  33  19  3  5  164  92  256  76  46  0.2  0.3  8.6  4.8  13.5  4.0  2.4 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1998 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  33  22  19  9  202  121  323  100  40  0.9  0.4  9.2  5.5  14.7  4.5  1.8 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   1999 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  33  25  14  9  240  112  352  129  46  0.6  0.4  9.6  4.5  14.1  5.2  1.8 - style=\\"background- color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2000 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  33  23  3  0  212  114  326  106  41  0.1  0.0  9.2  5.0  14.2  4.6  1.8 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  2001 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  33  22  1  1  210  130  340  115  31  0.0  0.0  9.5  5.9  15.5  5.2  1.4 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2002 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  33  21  11  3  130  83  213  86  39  0.5  0.1  6.2  4.0  10.1  4.1  1.9 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2003 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  33  21  5  2  150  88  238  96  25  0.2  0.1  7.1  4.2  11.3  4.6  1.2 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2004 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  33  15  0  1  103  62  165  52  17  0.0  0.1  6.9  4.1  11.0  3.5  1.3 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2005 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  33  10  3  1  69  38  107  42  16  0.3  0.1  6.9  3.8  10.7  4.2  1.6 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 268 ! 165 ! 77 ! 2163 ! 1353 ! 3516 ! 1150 ! 455 ! 0.6 ! 0.3 ! 8.1 ! 5.0 ! 13.1 ! 4.3 ! 1.7 } ==Post AFL career== In the 2005/06 NTFL Season, White played for the Darwin Football Club, playing in a premiership team.

In the late 1630s, he compiled the first Latin-Church Slavonic lexicon, which he would revise on several occasions. Upon hearing about Epifany's scholarly expertise, the Imperial Russian Tsar Alexis invited him to correct the ecclesiastical books of Muscovy. Epifany arrived in Moscow in 1649 and visited the Trinity- Sergius monastery the same year. He quickly managed to secure the patronage of the Boyar Boris Morozov and Metropolitan Nikon of Novgorod, who was elected Patriarch a short time later.

Menangle Park is located 56 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Campbelltown. Menangle Park is a largely rural area and is part of the Macarthur region. ==Demographics== According to the 2016 census, Menangle Park had a population of 257 people, who are mostly Australian born. The area has a particularly high number of people from the Anglican church (41%), over double the proportion of Anglicans nationwide (17%). The median income of $443 per week is lower than the national average ($577). ==History== Menangle Park was originally home to the Tharawal people and it was they who gave the name, transcribed as Manangle or Manhangle, to a small lagoon on the west bank of the Nepean River. The river was important to the Tharawal both for its consistent water supply as well as the fish and yabbies that could be caught there.Liston, C: Campbelltown: The Bicentennial History, Allen & Unwin, 1988: pp. 1–2. When British settler Walter Davidson established a farm on the west side of the river in 1805, he named it Manangle after the lagoon. Another early settler Thomas Taber built Menangle House on the east side of the river, indicating the name was being used to describe the district. The Main South railway line came through in 1863Bayley, W. A. 1973. Picton-Mittagong Loop- Line Railway. pp.11 Bulli: Austrail. and stations were established on either side of the river but following a north–south line so that the station in what is now known as Menangle Park was initially called North Menangle. With the establishment of the Menangle Park Racecourse in 1914, the suburb name became synonymous with the racecourse and only a few years later, the name was officially changed to Menangle Park. In 1920, the land to the east of the station was subdivided into lots to provide land for returned World War I servicemen. While there has been a push to open the area up for further subdivision since then, this has been resisted by the state government because of concern about the effects such development could have on the water quality of the Nepean. == Heritage listings == Menangle Park has a number of heritage- listed sites, including: * Glenlee Road: Glenlee, Menangle Park ===Landmarks=== Built in 1914, Menangle Park Paceway gave the suburb its name and is still its major landmark. Designed by local architect Alfred Payten, it lies on the river flats between the railway station and the Nepean River. In 1996, much of the Paceway activity was relocated to the newly upgraded Harold Park; it was then used mostly for training. In 2004–2007, the Paceway received a major upgrade, and was reopened for major racing events,Paceway History with the intention of concentrating all such events there after the closing of Harold Park. By the western side of the current railway station are the remains of the Menangle Racecourse Junction. This comprised three sidings, and provided a Passenger Platform and a Horse Loading Platform. The platforms can still be seen, and they are considerably longer than the current station platform. Discussion on Railpage, March 2008. To the north is an older landmark. Glenlee House was built by magistrate William Howe in 1824. It was purchased by the Macarthur Development Board in 1978 who restored it and opened it to the public. ==Present community== Menangle Park is effectively divided from the eastern neighbouring suburb of Gilead by the M31 Hume Motorway. On the eastern side of the motorway are Broughton Anglican College, established in 1986 in the premises of the former Mount Gilead Christian School, and The Campbelltown Steam and Machinery Museum.

It is part of the Northern Sydney region. Melrose Park sits on the northern bank of the Parramatta River. ==History== ===Aboriginal culture=== The Wallumedegal Aboriginal tribe lived in the area between the Lane Cove River and Parramatta River, which was known as Walumetta. ===European settlement=== Melrose Park was the name of the large housing estate established in 1937. Melrose Park is named in honour of aviator Charles James Melrose (1913–1936). He held a number of flying records, was the only solo flyer to finish the Melbourne Centenary Air Race in 1934 and helped in the unsuccessful search for Sir Charles Kingsford Smith. He died when his plane broke up in turbulence on a charter flight from Darwin to Melbourne. Streets in the suburb also recall other aviators such as Sir Alan Cobham, Jean Batten and Amy Johnson.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 169 == Population == In the 2016 Census, there were 1,574 people in Melrose Park. 68.1% of people were born in Australia and 66.9% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 35.0%, No Religion 22.9% and Anglican 11.4%. == Transport == Melrose Park is served by bus route 524, connecting the suburb to West Ryde and Parramatta. The nearest train station is Meadowbank Station, located in the centre of Meadowbank.

The project would include the construction of a bridge across the Parramatta River, between Melrose Park and Wentworth Point. == Redevelopment == Redevelopment underway on 20 November 2016. The western part of the suburb located within the City of Parramatta has historically been industrial, including the Australian operations of large pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer and Reckitt Benckiser. In February 2016, Payce Consolidated Limited announced plans for a major urban renewal of the industrial part of Melrose Park. This would include the development of 5000 new apartments, new affordable housing, public parks and community facilities. An electric shuttle bus service to Meadowbank railway station and West Ryde railway station was proposed. Sustainability proposals include renewable energy generation for new homes, electric charge points for cars, as well as electric shuttle bus services & improved cycleways.

It was acquired in October 2018 by Tenneco.https://www.tenneco.com/tenneco_announces_close_of_federal- mogul_acquisition/ Federal-Mogul operated two independent business divisions, Federal-Mogul Powertrain and Federal-Mogul Motorparts. The two divisions each had their own chief executive officer. ==History== ===Origins=== Federal-Mogul was founded in Detroit in 1899 by J. Howard Muzzy and Edward F. Lyon as the Muzzy-Lyon Company. Muzzy and Lyon went into business together producing mill supplies and rubber goods. In addition, the partners formed a subsidiary called the Mogul Metal Company where they launched various bearing innovations. Muzzy Lyon began producing bearings made from their own Babbitt metal called Mogul, an alloy of tin, antimony and copper. The product was trademarked under the names of \\"Mogul\\" and \\"Duro\\". In addition to Babbitt metal, Muzzy and Lyon invented a process of custom die-casting bearings. The Muzzy-Lyon Company bearings business proved successful in the early 1900s and became the pair's main concern, with Buick as one of their earliest customers. In 1924, the Muzzy-Lyon Company and Federal Bearings and Bushing, an engine bearings and bushings manufacturing company founded in 1915 by a group of Detroit businessmen, merged to become Federal-Mogul Corporation. The combined company also manufactured bronze bearings, a product the Muzzy-Lyon Company had not supplied. Federal Mogul established a research division in 1929, with the help of Battelle Memorial Institute. In 1931, during the Great Depression, Federal-Mogul started its Equi-Poise propeller division. In 1932, the company developed a new alloy called C-100, one of the first new bearing materials since the discovery of Babbitt metal. The Federal-Mogul research team revamped the C-100 in 1934 to create a C-50 alloy. ===Post-WWII expansion=== In 1955, the company acquired National Motor Bearing Company, and the company name was changed to Federal-Mogul Bower. In the late 1950s, the company opened business operations in Switzerland, and in 1962, the company established an overseas service center in Antwerp, Belgium. In 1963, Federal-Mogul Bower's Arrowhead division manufactured components for NASA's Saturn launch vehicle. In April 1965, Federal-Mogul Bower merged with Sterling Aluminum Products. The combined company was renamed the Federal-Mogul Corporation. In 1966, Federal-Mogul Corporation relocated its corporate headquarters from downtown Detroit to Southfield, Michigan. In 1981, Federal-Mogul Arrowhead parts were implemented in the NASA space shuttle launch. In 1981, the company attempted to patent a process for curing rubber based on the mathematical equation written by Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius in 1889. The US Patent Office rejected Federal-Mogul's claim, on the basis that neither a formula, as a law of nature, nor a computer program based on such a formula, could be patented. That same year, the company won a claim in the Supreme Court to the patent. ===Bankruptcy to the present=== In 1998, the company acquired the Automotive Products division of Cooper Industries, with brands including Anco wiper blades, Champion ignition, MOOG chassis, and Wagner and Blazer lighting. It also acquired Cooper's Abex Friction products business, which included asbestos-containing products. That same year, Federal-Mogul acquired Turner & Newall, a building materials company based in Manchester, UK. Turner & Newall was one of the world's largest manufacturers of asbestos-related products, including those made with blue crocidolite asbestos mined in South Africa. Turner & Newall was responsible for the Armley asbestos disaster in Leeds, UK. After the acquisition, Federal-Mogul set aside approximately $2.1 billion to cover asbestos-related claims but that amount provide insufficient. The large number of products liability claims that came with the Turner & Newall acquisition were largely responsible for Federal-Mogul's federal Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in 2002. During the company's restructuring, Federal-Mogul Corporation acquired multiple companies including Robert G. Evans Co., Hanauer Machine Works, Inc., Metaltec, Inc., Mather Co. and Fel-Pro, Inc. The company emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization in January 2008, and in April 2008, the company listed Class A common stock on NASDAQ under the trading symbol FDML. In June 2010, Federal-Mogul expanded further into Asia by opening a headquarters and technical center in Shanghai, China. The Asia Pacific headquarters and technical center facility contains powertrain dynamometers and vehicle braking test cells among other processes. The location allows for increased technical support to powertrain and vehicle customers as well as technology development.

In March 2012, Federal-Mogul's board of directors modified the company's corporate structure to create separate Powertrain and Vehicle Components segments, each with its own CEO. Rainer Jueckstock, former senior vice president of the company's Powertrain Energy business, was named CEO for the Powertrain segment effective April 1, 2012. In February 2014, Daniel A. Ninivaggi was appointed CEO of the Federal-Mogul Vehicle Components segment (VCS). In July 2012, Federal-Mogul announced a definitive agreement to purchase the BERU spark plug business from BorgWarner Inc. In September 2014, the company formally announced the long pending modification to the company's corporate structure would be a split into two separate companies, Federal- Mogul Powertrain, and Federal-Mogul Motorparts. The Powertrain division will focus on the manufacturing and selling of OEM auto parts while the Motorparts division focuses on selling aftermarket parts. Each company has their own CEO and corporate level staff that will continue to report to the board of directors of Federal-Mogul Holding Corporation. The company expects the split to be completed in the first half of 2015 pending regulatory approval. In 2014, Honeywell completed a $155 million sale of its friction materials business to Federal Mogul. In December 2016, Federal-Mogul completed the acquisition of the Beck/Arnley brand and certain associated assets.

It is considered by many to be the national dish of Myanmar. It is readily available in most parts of the country. In major cities, street hawkers and roadside stalls sell dozens of dishes of mohinga to the locals and passers-by. Usually eaten for breakfast, today the dish is being consumed more and more throughout the day. ==History and origins== The origins of mohinga are difficult to pinpoint in the absence of extant records. Food processing tools dating to the Pyu city- states used to ferment rice have been discovered, leading to the conclusion that the tradition of making rice vermicelli, the key starch used in mohinga, has a long history. The earliest reference to mohinga dates to the Konbaung dynasty, in the poet U Ponnya's alinga verse poem. Burmese history researcher Khin Maung Nyunt has concluded that during pre-colonial times, mohinga was likely a commoner's dish, as a recipe for \\"mohinga\\" has not been found in palatial records and cookbooks. During the latter half of Bagyidaw's reign, a poet by the name of U Min emerged and referenced \\"mohinga\\" as \\"mont di\\" (မုန္႔တီ) in a poetry competition. While mont ti largely refers to another set of dishes in modern-day Myanmar, a small minority continues uses \\"mont ti\\" in reference to mohinga. Various regions in the country also call mohinga simply \\"mont\\" (မုန္႔) or \\"mont hin\\" (မုန္႔ဟင္း). == Preparation == There are different varieties of mohinga in various regions of Myanmar. Rakhine mohinga has more fish paste and less soup. Its ingredients depend on their availability. However, the standard dish comes from southern Myanmar, where fresh fish is more readily available. The main ingredients of mohinga are chickpea flour and/or crushed toasted rice, garlic, shallots, onions, lemongrass, banana tree stems, ginger, fish paste, fish sauce, and catfish or other types of fishes, like Mrigal carp in a rich broth cooked and kept on the boil in a cauldron. It is served with rice vermicelli, dressed and garnished with fish sauce, a squeeze of lime, crisp fried onions, coriander, spring onions, crushed dried chillis, and, as optional extras, crisp fried fritters such as split chickpeas (') (), urad dal (') () or gourd (') () or sliced pieces of Chinese donuts (), as well as boiled egg and fried fish cake (). == Availability == It is perhaps the most popular breakfast dish of all, now available as an \\"all-day breakfast\\" in many towns and cities. Mohinga is also served with all the trimmings at formal functions and it is also sold in dry packets as a ready-made powder that is used for making the broth. Street hawkers are the original purveyors of this popular dish doing the rounds through neighborhoods where they have regular customers. They carry the soup cauldron on a stove on one side of a shoulder pole and rice vermicelli and other ingredients along with bowls and spoons on the other. It used to be available only early in the morning and at street pwès or open air stage performances and zat pwès or itinerant theatres at night. Trishaw peddlers began to appear in the 1960s and some of them set up pavement stalls making mohinga available all day.

In 1086 it was recorded as Bicatona, in 1107 Bechintona, and in 1580 Abbots Bekenton, to reflect the possession by Hartland Abbey. ==Overview== The village is located in the Torridge local authority area. It is within the Church of England's Deanery of Holsworthy and the Diocese of Exeter. In the late 19th century it was reported that blue limestone was quarried in the village for building construction, and trustees of Lord Rolle were patrons of the church. ==History== ===Normans=== The village was held by Goda the priest in the time of King Edward before the Norman Conquest of 1066. The area was part of the Black Torrington Hundred and had 10 households, 8 were smallholders and 2 were slaves. It is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086–7 as Bichetone, when it was held by Gerald the Chaplain, the tenant-in-chief and lord. He was also associated with two other locations in Devon: Stoke and Shapley. ===Abbey and manor=== ====Hartland Abbey==== In the 12th century the manor was given to Hartland Abbey by Geoffrey de Dinant, as part of the abbey's initial endowment. It remained as property of the abbey until dissolution in 1539. The church was built as a \\"cell\\" of the abbey. ====Manor==== Hugh Prust contracted for a 40-year lease of the manor. By 1871, Mark Rolle owned most of the 1078 acres of Abbots Bickington and was lord of the manor. At that time there were 50 people living in 8 households. Rolle paid for the 1868 renovations to the church, including installation of new seats and construction of a new roof. ===Church of St James=== The village church was built about 1300 of stone rubble and lancet windows. In the 15th century, stained glass were added, featuring St Anthony and St Christopher. There is also a monument to Thomas Pollard in the church. The chancel and nave, west tower and south transept were all built about the same time. It has the original piscina. Medieval Barnstaple tiles, some with fleur-de-lys pattern, cover the chancel floor. In 1863 and 1868 the church went through processes to reseat and restore the church. Church of St James is described as \\"an unspoilt example of a small early church, modest in size but with a number of interesting features and very picturesque appearance.\\" ==Population and parish governance== The population was 68 in 1801, 61 in 1901, and 35 in 2001. Because of low population there is no parish council; instead there is a parish meeting. ==Transportation== Abbots Bickington is located north of the A388 road. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== Category:Villages in Devon Category:Torridge District ","title":"Abbots Bickington"},{"id":"2581664","text":"An antique tractor at Greenbank Greenbank is an unincorporated community on Whidbey Island in Island County, Washington, United States. Greenbank, which was named by Calvin Philips after his homestead in Delaware, has a population around 250. It is the location of the Greenbank Farm, once the largest loganberry farm in the world, and the Greenbank Store, which was once owned and run by the Coupe family, descendants of Captain Thomas Coupe, founder of Coupeville and is now owned and run by new owners unrelated to the Coupe family. Opening in 1904, Greenbank Store features a deli, access to the post office, a small grocery store, as well as a full-service restaurant upstairs (opening again soon). Greenbank Farm, once the largest loganberry farm in the country, now has fields of trails and an off leash dog area. The farm was saved from development when the Port of Coupeville agreed to purchase the 151 acre property and take on a 20 year bond payment in 1997. The purchase was completed in 2017 and continues to be operated by the Port of Coupeville. Greenbank Farm with its large historic, “Whidbey 1904 Barn” is a much-sought venue for weddings, social gatherings and seasonal markets. The Shops at Greenbank Farm, independent tenants of the Port of Coupeville, feature Whidbey Pies Cafe, Greenbank Farm Wine Shop, Greenbank Cheese, Seaside & Sylvan Home, Artworks Gallery, and Raven Rocks Gallery & Gifts. Whidbey Camano Land Trust has its headquarters upstairs in Barn C. Behind the barns at the Greenbank Farm is a small marsh with a viewing platform recently built by the Whidbey Audubon Society.

The business was renamed Westdeutsche Kaufhof AG, but, in contrast to many other Jewish businesses, the internal structure was not changed.

Menachem Ussishkin was born in Dubrowna in the Belarusian part of the Russian Empire. In 1889, he graduated as a technical engineer from Moscow State Technical University, today known as Bauman Moscow State Technical University. Ussishkin was among the founders of the BILU movement and the Moscow branch of the Hovevei Zion. He also joined the Bnei Moshe society founded by Ahad HaAm. In 1891, he made his first trip to Palestine. He served as Secretary of the First Zionist Congress. At the Sixth Zionist Congress he opposed the Uganda plan. He was one of the Jewish delegates to the Paris peace conference after World War I. In 1919, Ussishkin made aliyah to Palestine. In 1920 he was appointed head of the Zionist Commission in Palestine. In his pamphlet \\"Our Program\\" he advocated group settlement based on labour Zionism. Under his influence, the Zionist movement actively supported the establishment of agricultural settlements, educational and cultural institutions, and Jewish polytechnic - later the Technion. In 1923 he was elected President of the Jewish National Fund which he headed until his death. Ussishkin was behind major land acquisitions in the Hefer, Jezreel and Beit She'an valleys.

He has had a number of research interests, including quantification of cognitive processes, scaling and measurement theory, computer-interactive psychological measurement, multivariate statistics, and ordinal methods. One of his major contributions to psychometrics was the method for rotation of canonical components. Asserting that much of psychological data have only ordinal justification, Cliff also published various papers and a book on ordinal methods for research. On the one hand this included extensions to the established ordinal methods for correlating data (i.e. Kendall's tau, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient). However, on the other hand, Cliff also suggested that there are viable and robust ordinal alternatives to mean comparisons. He introduced a measure of proportional difference (or dominance) between two sets of data often referred to as Cliff's delta. He has been president of the Psychometric Society and of the Society for Multivariate Experimental Psychology. Now an Emeritus Professor, he lives in New Mexico. ==References== * Cliff, N. (1966).

It is an old settlement and is mentioned (under the name of Langelai) in the Domesday Book. Economically the village is closely linked to Watford and was formerly part of the Watford Rural District. Since 1974 it has been included in the Three Rivers district. ==History== This village has had a long history of successful human habitation. The first traces of human habitation in the area were recorded by renowned archaeologist Sir John Evans (1823–1908). The village sits on a saucer of clay covered by a layer of gravel, and as a result water supply has never been a problem; records show that in earlier times water could be drawn from a well just deep. In 1045 the Saxon thegn Ethelwine 'the Black' granted the upper part of Langlai to St Albans Abbey as Langlai Abbatis (Latin for Langlai of the Abbot, hence 'Abbot's Langley') the remainder being the king's Langlai. By the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 the village was inhabited by 19 families. The area was split into four manors, Abbots Langley, Langleybury, Chambersbury, and Hyde. In 1539, Henry VIII, seized Abbots Langley and sold it to his military engineer Sir Richard Lee. The Manor of Abbots Langley was bequeathed by Francis Combe in his will of 1641 jointly to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge and Trinity College, Oxford. The manors of Langleybury and Chambersbury passed through the Ibgrave and Child families, and in 1711 were conveyed to Sir Robert Raymond then Solicitor General later Attorney General and Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench. On the death of his son without issue in 1756 the manors passed to the Filmer family. The Manor of Hyde passed to Edward Strong in 1714, through his daughter to Sir John Strange, who left the manor to be shared between his children and their descendents (including Admiral Sir George Strong Nares) and then to the possession of F.M. Nares & Co which sold the estate to the British Land Company in 1858. On Tibbs Hill Road there is a well-preserved example of a Prince Albert's Model Cottage. The original design and construction was for the Great Exhibition of 1851, to demonstrate model housing for the poor. Subsequently, the design was replicated in several other locations, including Abbots Langley. Kitters Green developed as a separate hamlet by Manor House. The land between Kitters Green and Abbots Langley was bought from the estate of Sarah Smith by the British Land Company in 1866. It laid out plots for development along Adrian, Breakspear, Garden and Popes roads. The development of these plots led to the merger of the two settlements and the loss of Kitters Green's separate identity. To the west of Manor House Park is a legendary sledging hill called Blackhill. This leads to a wooded area called the Dell. The recent Katherine Place development has brought in some high class retailers to the centre and was sold for £2.93 million in December 2005. These include a pharmacy, a small supermarket, a dog barber, a betting shop and a fish and chip shop. To the south of the village are Leavesden Film Studios, on the former RAF and later Rolls-Royce airfield, where scenes from movies including GoldenEye, Sleepy Hollow and the Harry Potter series have been filmed. Scenes from the Channel4/E4 coming-of-age comedy The Inbetweeners were filmed in housing estates in the town. ==Nicholas Breakspear/Pope Adrian IV== Bedmond, a village that is administratively part of Abbots Langley, is the birthplace of Nicholas Breakspear (later Pope Adrian IV), the only Englishman to serve as Pope; he is believed to have been born at Breakspear Farm . The site where his home stood is marked by a plaque.

It consists of approximately 70 dwellings and 250 people. It retains 4 mixed working farms within the village boundaries. The village was the country retreat for the Abbots of Evesham Abbey and the moat that surrounded their house is still visible. The village church is dedicated to St Peter and is over 1000 years old. The hamlet of Morton Spirt lies east of the village. ==History== Abbots Morton was listed as Mortune in the Domesday Book of 1086. The most northerly of the four parishes in the benefice, the parish of Abbots Morton incorporates the hamlets of Morton Spirt, The Low and Gooms Hill as well as the village of Abbots Morton itself. The parish contains approximately 70 homes. Many of the houses in the village are half-timbered black and white buildings dating from the 17th and 18th centuries; three have 15th century origins. ===8th - 16th century: Evesham Abbey and Morton Abbatis=== The Domesday Book of 1086 lists Abbots Morton as \\"Mortune\\", assessed at 5 hides and belonging to Evesham Abbey, but the settlement is believed to have been established several hundred years earlier. Before the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century, Abbots Morton used to be a country retreat for the abbots of Evesham; the remains of their moated manor house can still be seen near the church. The site of the manor house was acquired by Evesham Abbey in the 8th century, and a building existed on the site before the Norman conquest. Abbots Morton (Morton Abbatis) was one of the parishes entangled in the dispute between Evesham Abbey and the Bishops of Worcester: both parties claimed control over the churches in the Vale of Evesham and the surrounding area. After 200 years, the dispute was settled in the middle of the 13th century when the abbey was given jurisdiction over all the churches within the Vale apart from one: Abbots Morton. ===16th-17th century: the Hoby and Kighley families=== After the Dissolution, Abbots Morton passed into the hands of the Hoby [Hobby] family, who acquired many of the properties originally belonging to Evesham Abbey. In 1600 ownership of the manor appears to have been disputed: documents held at the Worcestershire Records Office include \\"Letters Patent of Elizabeth I being a licence for alienation from Richard Hobby [Hoby], esquire, to Richard Mottershed, gent., and Ralph Hodges of the manors of Badsey and Abbots Morton\\" while the Records of the Kings Remembrancer in the National Archives show \\"Philip Kighley of Broadway, gentleman to Thomas Edgeok of Broadway, gentleman: Demise, indented, for 3 years, of the manors of Badsey and Abbots Morton,\\". Philip Kighley had married Elizabeth Hoby, Richard's daughter, in 1597. It is presumed that the manor of Abbots Morton then passed into the hands of the Kighley family. After Philip's death at the beginning of the 17th century, Elizabeth married Charles Ketilby who sold the manor a few years later. ===18th century: the Throckmorton family of Coughton Court=== By the beginning of the 18th century, much of the land around Abbots Morton appears to have been acquired by the Throckmorton family of Coughton Court. Papers deposited in the Shakespeare Centre Library and Archive record 500-year leases of \\"rights of common\\" granted on lands of Sir Robert Throckmorton; and a century later John Throckmorton was disputing the tithes of Abbots Morton. ===19th century=== In 1870-72, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Abbots Morton like this: ABBOTS-MORTON, a parish in the district of Alcester and county of Worcester; 6 miles N by E of Fladbury r. station, and 7 WSW of Alcester. It has a post office under Bromsgrove. Acres, 1,420. Real property, £2,091. Pop. 245. Houses, 57. The property is all in one estate. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Worcester. Value, £146. Patron, G. J. A. Walker, Esq. The church is good. ===20th Century=== The church houses the WW1 war memorial to the village's only casualty of the conflict, Private Philip Collins, who served with the local Worcestershire Regiment in Mesopotamia. There were no local losses during the second world war. For the early part of the century Abbots Morton became known as Muddy Morton due to the poor roads and properties falling into disrepair. By the 1970s things started to change, properties began to transfer into individual ownership and were renovated rather than pulled down, this led the local council to call the village its \\"Golden Gem\\" and making most of the village a conservation area. The village hall was rebuilt in 1998. ==St Peter's Church== The parish church, dedicated to St Peter, stands on the site of a Saxon church. The current Grade I-listed building is the result of rebuilding and alterations performed since the 12th century. The list of Rectors of Abbots Morton stretches back to Petrus le Meare in 1288. The oldest part of the church is the north wall which dates from the 12th century, and is now supported by a modern buttress. The chancel was rebuilt in the 14th century, with the east window being added later in the same century. The Lady Chapel on the north side of the church, now used for the organ and choir, was added at about the same time. The south doorway, now the only entrance to the church, was constructed during the 15th century, and two pews from this period are incorporated into the porch. A second doorway, now blocked-up, can be seen in the north wall; this may have been used by the monks from the abbots' retreat to the north of the church. The exposed roof beams, many of them roughly-shaped branches rather than carefully cut timber, have also been dated to the 15th century. In 1955 the residents of the parish raised over £1,300 (worth more than £25,000 today) to preserve the beams. The tower was built in the late 14th century. The oldest bell, the tenor, dates from the 15th century and may have been hung soon after the tower was completed. It is one of the few remaining \\"Royal Head\\" bells, where the stops between the words of the inscription \\"Virgenis Egregie Vocor Campana Maria\\" represent the heads of Edward III and Queen Philippa. The 2nd bell is dated 1633, while the 3rd and treble bells were cast by Thomas Mears of London in 1842. ==References== Abbots Morton Parish Council Category:Villages in Worcestershire Category:Evesham Abbey ","title":"Abbots Morton"},{"id":"2581697","text":"Maroubra Road, Maroubra Junction Maroubra Junction is an unbounded locality of the suburb of Maroubra in Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia.

Maraylya is located north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of The Hills Shire and the City of Hawkesbury. Maraylya is bounded in the north and the east by Cattai Creek. The western part of Maraylya is prone to flooding after heavy rains, particularly from run-off from the Scheyville National Park. The flood waters make their way to Longneck Lagoon, which eventually drains into the Hawkesbury River less than 2 km to the west. Maraylya consists mainly of small-acreage properties used as hobby farms and for keeping horses for recreational purposes. Scheyville National Park adjoins the southern border of Maraylya and is popular for horse trail rides for local residents. There is an arena in the area called the Horseworld Sportsworld Equestrian Stadium. In July 2020, a small section of Maraylya in the south was carved out and formed the new suburb of Gables. == References == Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:City of Hawkesbury Category:Hawkesbury River Category:The Hills Shire ","title":"Maraylya, New South Wales"},{"id":"2581718","text":"XS (Jenni Ognats) is a fictional character in the future of the DC Comics universe. A member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, she is the maternal granddaughter of Barry Allen (the second superhero known as the Flash), and first cousin of Bart Allen (the second speedster identified as Kid Flash). Her first appearance is in Legionnaires #0 (Oct 1994). Jessica Parker Kennedy portrayed the character on The CW television series The Flash during the fourth and the fifth seasons. ==Fictional character biography== Despite being the granddaughter of Barry Allen (the Flash) and the daughter of Dawn Allen (one of the Tornado Twins), Jenni Ognats did not at first display any signs of super-speed. However, the Dominators, knowing her family heritage, captured her. This did not keep her out of danger, due to the long-standing feud between the Allen line and the Thawne line. As a baby, she was held hostage by President Thawne, only escaping danger when several Allens backed down.Impulse #25 (May 1997) At the sight of her father Jeven Ognats of Aarok being tortured, her latent super-speed powers activated. She managed to escape with her father before stray fire from the Dominators caused their base to explode.Legion of Super Heroes Annual (vol. 4) #6 (1995) After this, she checked herself into a laboratory to help her learn to coordinate herself at super-speed. Once she learned control, she was drafted into the Legion of Super-Heroes. She eventually learned to overcome her initial fear and nervousness, while she developed crushes on Cosmic Boy and, later, M'Onel, and eventually dated Dyrk Magz. During the Legion's first trip to the 20th century, XS was separated from them. She met her cousin Bart Allen (Impulse), becoming a good friend.Impulse #9 (December 1995) She revealed how she was participating in an archeological dig in the future.Impulse #12 (March 1996) XS fought side by side with Impulse and other speedsters during the events of Dead Heat. Afterwards, the 27th century Flash fixed her grandfather's Cosmic Treadmill, enabling her to go home. Unfortunately, she overshot, encountering two further future incarnations of the Legion before returning. Impulse left her a goodbye note in the building that she was participating in excavating. XS was one of the Legionnaires left behind after many of her teammates were lost, causing the team to be forcefully disbanded. She traveled to Xanthu with her teammate Star Boy, where she found herself caught in a war between Xanthu and Robotica. While the two Legionnaires managed to save millions of lives by distracting Robotica long enough for the surviving Xanthians to escape off- planet, the two remained trapped there for months thereafter, until rescued by their returned teammates. XS and her version of the Legion were removed from mainstream DC continuity in the Teen Titans/Legion Special. They were revealed to be alive on in the parallel universe containing \\"Earth-247\\".Infinite Crisis #6 (May 2006) The Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds miniseries reveals that the Tornado Twins and their family members (including XS) originated on the same Earth as the post-Infinite Crisis version of the Legion (which was introduced in \\"The Lightning Saga\\").Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #3 (February 2009) Thus, continuity revisions have been made: after Barry Allen's death in Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Twins and their families became the target of Professor Zoom, who was attempting to sabotage Don Allen and Meloni Thawne's marriage. Both families escaped to Earth-247 and the Twins died soon after in unknown circumstances. Both cousins were reunited with their grandmother Iris, and both also rapidly aged to teenagers within days. Presumably, XS' rapid- aging stabilized under her own volition, as she never showed signs of it during her tenure with the Legion. XS is used by Brainiac 5 to revive her cousin, Bart Allen, culling his spirit from the Speed Force. The two then team up against Superboy-Prime.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #4 (April 2009) After the battle with Superboy-Prime and his Legion of Super-Villains, XS resigns from the Earth-247 Legion. Bart asks her to join him in the 21st Century, but she decides to stay in the 31st Century with the post-Infinite Crisis Legion to locate any of their surviving relatives. Her friend and teammate, Gates, also decides to stay to accompany her.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #5 (July 2009) ==Powers and abilities== XS possesses Speed Force- based powers like the other members of her family (Barry Allen, Bart Allen, Wally West, and Iris West II). She can run at near-light speeds, vibrate through solid matter, and even time travel and cross dimensions by altering her molecular vibrational frequencies. ==Equipment== As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes she is provided a Legion Flight Ring. It allows her to fly and protects her from the vacuum of space and other dangerous environments. ==Other versions== XS has only appeared in Adventures in the DC Universe #10, a series that was published before the DC Animated Universe expanded with Superman: The Animated Series and Justice League. As such, most events in the series are contradicted by the television series and later comics, and this character can be considered apocryphal. ==In other media== * XS makes a cameo appearance in the animated television series Legion of Super Heroes. She's seen in the episode \\"Dark Victory\\" [Pt. 1]. * Jessica Parker Kennedy portrays XS on the live-action series The Flash. This version is Nora West-Allen, the daughter of Barry Allen and Iris West from the future. Her characterization is an amalgam of XS and Dawn Allen.

Although his main instrument is trumpet, he has also performed on trombone, tuba, euphonium, flugelhorn, saxophone, clarinet, double bass, guitar, and piano. He is a composer, writing jazz charts for ensembles of various sizes and proficiency levels. He composed and performed the opening fanfare at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. In 2009, he joined Steve Pizzati and Warren Brown as a presenter on Top Gear Australia. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2010 Morrison and a cappella group, The Idea of North, won Best Jazz Album, for their collaboration on Feels Like Spring. In 2012 Morrison was appointed as Artistic Director of the Queensland Music Festival for the 2013 and 2015 festivals. He was inducted into the Graeme Bell Hall of Fame 2013 at the Australian Jazz Bell Awards. In July 2013 he conducted the World's Largest Orchestra in Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium, consisting of 7,224 musicians. In March 2015 Morrison opened the James Morrison Academy of Music in Mount Gambier, South Australia – a tertiary level, dedicated jazz school offering a degree in jazz performance. ==Biography== ===Early years=== James Lloyd Morrison was born on 11 November 1962 in Boorowa, a rural farming community where his father, George Morrison, was a Methodist minister.James Morrison interview – Bob Rogers Show, Radio 2CH, 09:29 AEDT 15 March 2007. Morrison comes from a musical family: his mother plays alto saxophone, piano, and organ; his sister is a trumpeter, and his older brother, John Morrison, is a jazz drummer. The family moved to various sites in New South Wales due to his father's ministry before settling in Pittwater. From the age of seven Morrison practised on his brother's cornet. Morrison attended Mona Vale Primary School and Pittwater High School, then Sydney Conservatorium of Music where he completed a jazz course. At the conservatorium he met Don Burrows, who became his mentor. In 1981, Morrison was a faculty member at his alma mater. ===Morrison Brothers=== In 1983 James and John Morrison formed the Morrison Brothers Big Bad Band, a 13-piece group. In 1984 the band included James Morrison on trumpet, trombone, and piano, Warwick Alder on trumpet, Peter Cross on trumpet, Paul Andrews on alto saxophone, Tom Baker on alto and baritone saxophones, Jason Morphett on tenor saxophone, Glenn Henrich on vibraphone, Craig Scott on bass, and John Morrison on drums. The band's debut album, A Night in Tunisia, was released in 1984 by ABC Records as part of the Don Burrows Collection. The title track is a jazz standard by Dizzy Gillespie; another track, \\"Burrows Bossa\\", was written by Morrison. Also that year he backed Burrows on Burrows at the Winery, playing trumpet, slide trumpet, trombone, and flugelhorn. The album was live at Rothbury Estate Winery. Morrison Brothers Big Bad Band used the same venue for their album Live at the Winery. ===Association with other musicians=== Morrison has performed with Dizzy Gillespie (the first Australian to do so); Don Burrows, Ray Charles, and B.B. King. He has also worked with George Benson, Ray Brown, Cab Calloway, Jon Faddis, Herbie Hancock, Whitney Houston, Quincy Jones, Graeme Lyall, Wynton Marsalis, Mark Nightingale, Red Rodney, Arturo Sandoval, Woody Shaw, Frank Sinatra, and Phil Stack. In 1990, he recorded the album Snappy Doo with Ray Brown on double bass, Herb Ellis on guitar, Jeff Hamilton on drums, and Morrison on piano, trumpet, trombone (tenor and bass), saxophone (soprano, alto, tenor, and baritone), and bits of clarinet, flute, flugelhorn, and euphonium. He recorded a sequel, Snappy Too, in 2011 with Hamilton, but Brown and Ellis died in the interim, so Morrison played guitar and bass in addition to all of the other instruments from the first album. In 1999, he collaborated with Gina Jeffreys and The Idea of North on the song \\"Blue Christmas\\", which is included on Jeffreys' album, Christmas Wish. In 2005, he was guest soloist at the 150th anniversary concert of the Black Dyke Band; and in 2009 performed with them as special guest during their Australian tour. In 2007, he again appeared as guest soloist at concerts with the band in Manchester and London. In 2003 he founded the band On the Edge together with the German keyboardist and composer Simon Stockhausen, son of Karlheinz Stockhausen. Morrison has a long association with composer and pianist Lalo Schifrin (composer of the theme from Mission: Impossible) and has recorded albums for Schifrin's \\"Jazz Meets the Symphony\\" series. These include recordings with the London and the Czech National symphony orchestras. He found his lead vocalist, Emma Pask, at a school concert when she was 16, and she became an internationally renowned jazz singer. Morrison sponsors scholarships for musicians and is involved with youth bands. His association with Generations in Jazz has spanned three decades. He is chairman of this organization which runs one of the largest youth jazz events in the world. == Radio and TV presenter == For a number of years, Morrison has been the presenter of the in-flight jazz radio station for Qantas Airways. In 1994, James presented Behind The Wheel, a motoring television series on Network Ten. Ten saw the benefits of a series like this and commissioned 18 episodes. It aired on a Tuesday night at 7.30pm to an audience of 2.1 million viewers. The pilot episode was produced by Tim Kupsch, Andy Wallace and James Morrison. Unlike Top Gear, the show ideas and script were largely conceived \\"on the fly\\" by Morrison and Kupsch. On 19 December 2008, presenter Charlie Cox announced his departure from Top Gear Australia due to lack of time. Morrison replaced him in the second season alongside Warren Brown and Steve Pizzati. He appeared as the \\"Star in a Bog-Standard Car\\" in episode 6 of the first series. ==Instruments== In early 2010 he formed an association with Austrian brass manufacturer Schagerl to produce \\"signature\\" models. These include two series – the custom, hand-made \\"Meister\\" series and the intermediate professional \\"Academica\\" series. There are trumpets and trombones in both series, and the Meister series includes flugelhorn and bass trumpet. His design of a trumpet called \\"The Raven\\" uses rotary valves with a long lead pipe usually associated with a piston trumpet. An instrument project with designer and robotics expert Steve Marshall produced the Morrison Digital Trumpet, a MIDI wind controller that looks like a futuristic version of a typical trumpet. It allows a trumpeter to play electronic sounds in much the same way a pianist can play a synthesizer.http://newatlas.com/go/4393/ On his collaboration album The Other Woman with singer Deni Hines, he wrote a track called \\"(Tired of Being) The Other Woman\\". When Morrison performed this track at a performance in Sydney, he revealed his latest piece of music technology. It is a Roland keyboard (VP770) that has a microphone attached and 'sings' whatever Morrison speaks into the microphone, producing the sound of a choir. ==Spanish national anthem== Morrison played the wrong Spanish national anthem at the Davis Cup final in Australia in 2003. Instead of playing the current anthem, \\"Marcha Real\\", he performed the \\"Himno de Riego\\", not heard since the Second Republic era (1931–1939), causing the enraged Spanish Secretary of State for Sport to walk out in anger. Morrison later revealed he had mistakenly learned the incorrect tune due to being given the wrong sheet music. Fortunately an official quickly found a CD of the correct anthem, placating the Spanish and allowing the match to proceed. ==Personal life== James Morrison met Judi Green, the 1987 Miss Australia winner, at a barbecue before both participated in a celebrity race at the Adelaide Grand Prix. The couple married in 1988. ==Discography== ===Albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" + List of albums, with selected chart positions. ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:18em;\\" Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\" Peak chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\" Certifications - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" AUS ARIA - ! scope=\\"row\\"  A Night in Tunisia  * Released: 1984 * Label: ABC Records (836375-1) * Formats: LP  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  James Morrison At the Winery  * Released: 1985 * Label: ABC Records (836374-1) * Formats: LP  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Postcards from Down Under  * Released: August 1988 * Label: WEA (255697.1/255697.2) * Formats: LP, CD  47  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Swiss Encounter  * Released: 1989 * Label: WEA (256731.1/256731.2) * Formats: LP, CD  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Snappy Doo  * Released: July 1990 * Label: WEA (903171211.1/903171211.2) * Formats: LP, CD, Cassette  17  *ARIA: Gold - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Manner Dangerous  * Released: December 1991 * Label: EastWest (903176023.2/903176023.4) * Formats: CD, Cassette  76  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Two the Max  * Released: 1992 * Label: EastWest (903177125.2) * Formats: CD  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  This is Christmas  * Released: 1993 * Label: EastWest (450993863.2) * Formats: CD  91  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Live in Paris  * Released: 1994 * Label: EastWest (450999260.2) * Formats: CD  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Live at The Sydney Opera House  * Released: June 1996 * Label: Warner Music Australia (0630151462) * Formats: CD  71  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Quartet  * Released: 1998 * Label: Morrison Records (MR 001) * Formats: CD  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Three Minds  * Released: November 1998 * Label: Morrison Records (MR 003) * Formats: CD  83  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  European Sessions  * Released: 1999 * Label: Morrison Records (MR 006) * Formats: CD  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Scream Machine  * Released: 2001 * Label: Morrison Records (MR 10) * Formats: CD  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  The Gospel According to Groove  * Released: 2001 * Label: Emu Music (EMU8JA-2) * Formats: CD  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  On the Edge  * Released: 2003 * Label: Morrison Records (MR 15) * Formats: CD  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Gospel Collection  * Released: 2005 * Label: Morrison Records (MRG001) * Formats: CD  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2x2  * Released: January 2006 * Label: Morrison Records * Formats: CD  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Gospel Collection Volume 2  * Released: August 2006 * Label: Morrison Records * Formats: CD  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  The Other Woman  * Released: 13 October 2007 * Label: MGM Distribution (JMDH2) * Formats: CD, digital download  86  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  James Morrison Instrumental  * Released: November 2009 * Label: Classic Fox * Formats: CD, digital download  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Three's Company  * Released: 2010 * Label: Morrison Records * Formats: CD, digital download  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Feels Like Spring  * Released: April 2010 * Label: ABC Jazz (2735660) * Formats: CD, digital download  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Snappy Too  * Released: September 2012 * Label: Morrison Records (MR 20) * Formats: CD, digital download  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  A to Z of Jazz  * Released: 2014 * Label: ABC Jazz (4704193) * Formats: 2xCD, digital download  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Chermoula  * Released: 2015 * Label: Morrison Records * Formats: digital download  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  A Fine Bromance  * Released: July 2015 * Label: Morrison Records * Formats: digital download  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  In Good Company  * Released: 20 November 2015 * Label: ABC Records * Formats: digital download  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Mare Balticum  * Released: 13 June 2016 * Label: Mūsdienu Mūzikas Centrs (CD016) * Formats: CD_Rom, digital download  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  James Morrison with His Academy Jazz Orchestra  * Released: November 2016 * Label: ABC Records * Formats: digital download  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  The Great American Songbook  * Released: June 2017 * Label: ABC Jazz (4815433) * Formats: CD, digital download  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Ella & Louis  * Released: November 2017 * Label: ABC Jazz (4816483) * Formats: CD, digital download  -  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Midnight till Dawn  * Released: March 2018 * Label: ABC Jazz (6730676) * Formats: CD, digital download  -  - } ==Awards and honours== On 9 June 1997 James Morrison was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia with a citation \\"for service to music, particularly jazz, and the sponsorship of young musicians\\".

Abbotsham (pronounced Abbotsam) is a village and civil parish in the English county of Devon. In 2001 its population was 434 increasing at the 2011 census to 489. ==Amenities== Abbotsham no longer has a Post Office and General Store but remains a vibrant community. There is a primary school, a Pre-School, a church a Chapel and a pub. There is also a village hall where a large range of activities take place. One bus service serves Abbotsham; the Stagecoach 319 from Barnstaple to Hartland. From May to October 2007, Stagecoach Devon ran a commercial service, the 21B, from Barnstaple to Westward Ho! via Abbotsham. However, this service was later withdrawn. The Big Sheep amusement farm park is located in Abbotsham. ==History== The name Abbotsham is derived from 'Ham held by the abbot' [of Tavistock] (Old English abbodes + placename Ham). The area was called Hame in the Domesday Book and was later recorded as Ab(b)edisham in 1193 and 1269, and Abbodesham in 1282. The village formed part of the original endowment of Tavistock Abbey in the late tenth century, from which it takes its name. St. Helen parish church, originally built by the Normans, was rebuilt in the thirteenth century and features many carved statues and bench- ends. A mile to the north of the village is Kenwith Castle, built c. 1760 in the Georgian Gothic style and now part of a retirement complex with 31 stand alone bungalows and sheltered accommodation. ==Abbotsham Village School== The local village school St Helen's C of E Primary School has been in existence for over 150 years. There is a wealth of information on the School's past available in the Abbotsham Archives including the School Register back to 1894 and many pictures of pupils, staff and villagers. == People == There are a number of valuable sources for family historians on the Village Website looking for references to particular families. These include the School Register from 1894 to 1997 listing pupils in alphabetic order, a transcription of the 1842 Tithe Register and a complete collection of press cuttings referring to the village from 1860 to 1978.

The locomotives were furnished with skirts to protect pedestrians as at one point the line ran along the quay at Bideford. The line had eleven halts which largely served visitors visiting the coast or travelling to swim off the beaches around Westward Ho!. The railway, authorised in 1896, was opened as far as Northam by 1901 and to Appledore in 1908. It closed in 1917.Stuckey, Douglas (1962). The Bideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway 1901-1917.

The course ran along the valley of Abbotsham Court and Cornborough Cliffs and closed in 1930. ==See also== *HMS Abbotsham ==References== ==External links== *Community website *Devon Local Studies - Abbotsham community page * *Village School Category:Villages in Devon Category:Civil parishes in Devon Category:Torridge District ","title":"Abbotsham"},{"id":"2581727","text":"Malabar is a suburb in south-eastern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia 12 kilometres south-east of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Randwick. ==Location== Malabar is a coastal suburb situated around Long Bay. Malabar is mostly residential, but with large plots of land devoted to the Randwick Golf Course, the ANZAC Rifle Range and the Long Bay Correctional Centre. A small group of shops is located at Prince Edward Street, close to the intersection with Anzac Parade. To the north, the suburb is bounded by Malabar Headland which features the Malabar Battery, a World War II fortification complex. ==History== Malabar was named after a ship called the MV Malabar, a Burns Philp Company passenger and cargo steamer that was shipwrecked in thick fog on rocks at Miranda Point on the northern headland of Long Bay 2 April 1931. The ship itself was named after Malabar, a region in the Indian state of Kerala famous for its history as a major spice trade centre. Prior to the wreck, the suburb was known as either Brand or Long Bay. Long Bay is reputed to have been the local Indigenous community's principal camping/healing place between Sydney and Botany Bay. Malabar Headland is the site of a number of Aboriginal engravings. Historian Obed West claimed in 1882 that Aboriginal people referred to Long Bay as 'Boora' and that a rock overhang on the south side of Long Bay had been used as a shelter by Aboriginals suffering from a smallpox epidemic in the late 1700s. Following a petition by local residents, the new name was gazetted on 29 September 1933. There have been five shipwrecks on the headland at Malabar – the St Albans in 1882, the MV Malabar in 1931, Try One in 1947 and SS Goolgwai in 1955 (and an unnamed barge in 1955).From Long Bay to Malabar – A Village by the Sea, published by Patrick Kennedy April 2009. . Malabar Newsagency, Dymocks Bookstore Maroubra The area was originally part of the land reserved for the Church and Schools Corporation; with the income intended to support clergy and teachers. In 1866 an attempt was made to create a village on Church and School Land at Long Bay when the surveyor general called for tenders for clearing timber and erecting posts for street names. This was followed by a sale of allotments in 1869. The suburb was proclaimed as the Village of Brand in 1899, though most people continued to refer to it as Long Bay. People were slow to take up residence in the area and it was not until the tram line was built to the Coast Hospital in 1901 that the suburb started to grow. By the early 1900s the village had two community halls; Anderson's Hall and Picnic Grounds on the corner of Victoria and Napier Streets and Dudley's Hall which provided a home for the school until Long Bay Public School opened in 1909. During 1910–1920 a number of entrepreneurs bought cheap land at Long Bay and erected tents and huts as accommodation for visitors who flocked to the beach there at weekends. Residents complained about unsanitary conditions and the effect of these holiday camps on land values. During this period there were also a number of more permanent residents living in shacks in the sand dunes behind Long Bay, forced into these living conditions by a housing shortage in inner city Sydney. Construction of the State Reformatory for Women began in 1902 on a 70-acre site south of the village. This was officially opened in August 1909, followed by the opening of the State Penitentiary for Men in 1914. The reformatory became part of the prison in the late 1950s, known as the Long Bay Penitentiary. The women's prison was vacated after Mulawa Correctional Centre opened in 1969 at Silverwater. The Long Bay Life Saving and Amateur Swimming Club was formed at the end of World War I, meeting at the ambulance building on Bay Parade before a clubhouse was built in 1922. In 1916 the Ocean Outfall was constructed on Malabar Headland and by 1959 increasing sewage discharge had severely affected water quality at Long Bay. A number of club members left to found a new club at South Maroubra and by 1973 the Malabar club had to be disbanded. The commencement of the Deep Water Sewer Outfall in the 1990s saw some improvement in water quality, but the clubhouse was demolished in the same decade after suffering severe water damage. The rifle range on the Malabar headland was originally known as the Long Bay Rifle Range, there is a long history of the site being used as a range dating back to when recreational and militia shooting first commenced on this site in the 1850s which contributed to local security. The original ANZAC Rifle Range at Holsworthy was closed in 1967 and the rifle clubs were transferred to the Long Bay Rifle Range at Malabar. The range at Malabar was renamed the ANZAC Rifle Range in 1970 in memory of the ANZAC soldiers who lost their lives during the World Wars and the Korea Campaign.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 161 The headland was shared by the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, the NSW Smallbore and Air Rifle Association, the Sydney Model Aero Club and the Malabar Riding School until the Commonwealth Government terminated their leases in November 2011. The western section of the headland was transferred from the Commonwealth to the NSW Government on 2 March 2012. This 17.7 hectare area contains remnants of the Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub, eucalypt woodlands and coastal heath land that now form part of a National Park. The (Gillard / Rudd) Labor Commonwealth Government had planned to convert the remainder of the headland to a National Park after relocating the rifle range and completing work to make the area safe for public use. However the NSW Rifle Association defeated the Commonwealth Government in court, scuttling the plans.Court shoots down plan to shift rifle range and create a park A report submitted to the Abbott government in January 2015 recommended selling off the land for developmentMalabar headland sized up for future development, report reveals but the plan met community outrage and was swiftly refuted by the Commonwealth Government.Super Sydney's dark side: the threat to open spaces In March 2015, plans to commit more of the headland to National Park and to return the horses were announcedEnvironment Minister Greg Hunt announces section of Malabar headland to be national park, riders to return50-hectare stretch of Malabar Headland to be converted to national park The future of the remainder of Malabar Headland remains uncertain. == Heritage listings == Malabar has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 1250 Anzac Parade: Long Bay Correctional Centre * Franklin Street: Malabar Headland ==Population== According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 5,420 people in Malabar. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 6.6% of the population. * 67.7% of people were born in Australia.

The town is north-east of the capital Sofia and about west of the city of Varna and the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. Targovishte is known as an old market settlement. ==Name== The name comes from the Slavic root targ (\\"trade\\") + the Slavic placename suffix -ishte, \\"market town\\" (a calque of the Ottoman Turkish Eski Cuma, \\"old market\\", though the Turkish name may be derived from the earlier Bulgarian Sborishte \\"gathering place\\"). ==City== Archaeological studies prove that in these places there were people in the Copper-Stone Age (Chalcolithic) – between the 5th and the 4th millennium BC. In the city's vicinity are the remains of Thracian settlements (5th–3rd century BC), a Roman settlement (2nd–4th century AD) and a fortress from the early Byzantine period (5th–6th century). A Bulgarian settlement was founded in the 10th century during the First Bulgarian Empire, however due to its proximity to the capital Preslav, it did not develop until the 12th century. In the 12th century, due to its location on a main road from the new capital Veliko Turnovo, a fortress by the name \\"Сборище\\" (Sborishte) was built.

He first distinguished himself as a Liang dynasty general during the campaign against the rebel general Hou Jing, and he was progressively promoted. In 555, he seized power after a coup against his superior, the general Wang Sengbian, and in 557 he forced Emperor Jing to abdicate the throne to him, thereby establishing the Chen dynasty. He died in 559, and as his only surviving son Chen Chang was held by Northern Zhou, he was succeeded by his nephew Chen Qian (Emperor Wen). == Background and early career == Chen Baxian was born to Chen Wenzan (陳文讚) and Lady Dong in 503 CE, the second year of the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang (the founding emperor of Liang Dynasty). He was from Wuxing Commandery (吳興, roughly modern Huzhou, Zhejiang). His family traced its ancestry to Chen Shi (陳寔), a county magistrate and Confucian scholar during Han Dynasty. During the lineage that was traced, Chen's ancestors generally served as officials, although several were important figures in imperial governments of Jin Dynasty and the subsequent Southern dynasties, including Chen Baxian's grandfather Chen Daoju (陳道巨). When Chen Baxian was young, he was considered ambitious, not caring about managing properties. As he grew, he studied military strategies and learned various fighting techniques. Initially, he married a daughter of Qian Zhongfang (錢仲方), who was also from Wuxing Commandery, but she died early. After Lady Qian's death, he married Zhang Yao'er, likewise from Wuxing Commandery. She bore him at least one son, Chen Chang. It is known that he had five sons before Chen Chang, but all, including Chen Ke (陳克), the only one whose name is preserved in history, appeared to have died early; it is not known who were their mothers. In the late 530s, when Xiao Ying (蕭映) the Marquess of Xinyu, a nephew of Emperor Wu, was the governor of Wuxing Commandery, he had the chance to see Chen Baxian and was impressed by him. When Xiao Ying was made the governor of Guang Province (廣州, modern Guangdong) around 540, he invited Chen to serve on his staff, and subsequently, Xiao Ying made him an acting commandery governor. ==War with Vạn Xuân== In 541, the people of Giao Châu Province (in modern northern Vietnam), dissatisfied with the cruel rule of Xiao Zi (蕭諮) the Marquess of Wulin (another nephew of Emperor Wu), rebelled under the leadership of Lý Bôn. Xiao Ying sent the generals Sun Jiong (孫冏) and Lu Zixiong (盧子雄) to attack Lý Bôn, with Xiao Ying overseeing the operations. In spring 542, Xiao Ying and Xiao Zi ordered Sun and Lu to attack, despite Sun and Lu's request to delay the attack to fall 542 due to fears that hot temperature could cause illnesses. When Lý Bôn crushed their forces with heavy casualties, Xiao Zi falsely accused Sun and Lu of working in concert with Lý Bôn, and Emperor Wu ordered Sun and Lu to commit suicide. Lu Zixiong's brothers Lu Zilüe (盧子略) and Lu Zilie (盧子烈) and subordinates, the brothers Du Tianhe (杜天合) and Du Sengming (杜僧明) and Zhou Wenyu (周文育,) attacked the capital of Guang Province, wanting to kill Xiao Zi and Xiao Ying to avenge Lu Zixiong. Xiao Ying ordered Chen to engage them, and he defeated them, killing Du Tianhe and capturing Du Sengming and Zhou. Believing that Du Sengming and Zhou were both good soldiers, he released them and retained them on his staff. For this accomplishment, Emperor Wu created Chen the Viscount of Xin'an, and while he did not summon Chen to the capital Jiankang, he had an artisan draw a portrait of Chen and deliver it to him. In January 544, Lý Bôn proclaimed himself emperor and named the country Vạn Xuân, ending the Second Chinese domination of Vietnam. In winter 544, Xiao Ying died, and initially, Chen started escorting Xiao Ying's casket back to Jiankang for burial. On the way, while he was still at Dayu Mountain (大庾嶺, on the borders of modern Jiangxi and Guangdong), he was ordered to rendezvous with the new governor of Giao Châu Province, Yang Piao (楊瞟), and another nephew of Emperor Wu's, Xiao Bo (蕭勃), to attack Lý Bôn. Xiao Bao did not want to set out on the campaign, and therefore tried to persuade Yang not to advance. Chen persuaded Yang otherwise, and in spring 545, Yang, with Chen as his lieutenant, attacked Lý Bôn, defeating him and forcing him to flee into the mountains and conduct guerilla warfare instead. In 548, Lý Bôn's subordinates killed Lý Bôn, and when Lý Bôn's brother Lý Thiên Bảo succeeded him and attacked Ai Province (愛州, centered on modern Thanh Hóa Province, Vietnam), Chen defeated Lý Thiên Bảo. Emperor Wu made Chen the governor of Gaoyao Commandery (高要, roughly modern Zhaoqing, Guangdong) as well as the commander of the forces of the surrounding commanderies. == During the Hou Jing Disturbance == In summer 548, Hou Jing, formerly a general of Eastern Wei (a branch successor state of Northern Wei) whose defection Emperor Wu had accepted, rebelled, and in 549 captured Jiankang, taking Emperor Wu and his son and crown prince Xiao Gang hostage. After Jiankang's fall, Hou, who had initially claimed that he wanted to restore Northern Wei's imperial clan to power, from the control of the regent Gao Cheng, enticed the governor of Guang Province, Yuan Jingzhong (元景仲), a member of Northern Wei's imperial Yuan clan, to join him, and when Chen received the news, he publicly announced Yuan's treachery and gathered the troops of the nearby generals to attack Yuan. Yuan committed suicide, and Chen welcomed Xiao Bo, then the governor of Ding Province (定州, roughly modern Guigang, Guangxi) to take over Guang Province. In winter 549, against Xiao Bo's request, Chen took his troops and embarked on a campaign to join the fight against Hou, sending messengers to Emperor Wu's son Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong, the governor of Jing Province (荊州, modern central and western Hubei), pledging support and loyalty to Xiao Yi, then commonly viewed as the leader of the remaining Liang provinces not under Hou's control. For the next year, Chen advanced north through modern Jiangxi, fighting the various local warlords and generals loyal to Hou, with his main struggle against Li Qianshi (李遷仕). In spring 551, he captured and killed Li. Xiao Yi made him the governor of Jiang Province (江州, roughly modern Jiangxi). By fall 551, he had rendezvoused with Xiao Yi's main general, Wang Sengbian, at Xunyang (尋陽, in modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi). In 552, after they had sworn a solemn oath to Liang, they advanced east toward Jiankang, where Hou had killed Xiao Gang (who had succeeded Emperor Wu as Emperor Jianwen) and taken the throne himself as Emperor of Han. Chen was instrumental in the subsequent siege of Jiankang, and they defeated Hou together, causing Hou to flee. Subsequently, Hou was killed by his own men. For Chen's contributions, Xiao Yi created Chen the Marquess of Changcheng—Chen's home county. Wang put Chen in charge of the important city Jingkou (京口, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu). For the next two years, Chen was several times involved in border battles against Northern Qi (Eastern Wei's successor state). At times, when Xiao Yi (who had by now taken the throne as Emperor Yuan but set up his capital at his headquarters of Jiangling rather than at Jiankang) summoned Wang on campaigns, Wang would put Chen in charge of Jiankang. == Seizure of power == In 554, Western Wei launched a major attack on Jiangling, and Emperor Yuan summoned Wang to come to his aid, putting Chen in charge of Jiankang. Before Wang could reach Jiangling, however, Western Wei had already captured Jiangling, killing Emperor Yuan and declaring his nephew Xiao Cha emperor instead (as Emperor Xuan). (Xiao Cha's state is known in history as the Western Liang.) Wang and Chen refused to recognize Emperor Xuan; instead, in spring 555, they welcomed Emperor Yuan's 11-year-old son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an—Emperor Yuan's only surviving son—to Jiankang, preparing to make him emperor and first having him take the title Prince of Liang. (When Jiankang fell, Chen's son Chen Chang and nephew Chen Xu, who had been serving in the imperial administration, were captured and taken to the Western Wei capital Chang'an as honored captives.) At this time, however, Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi had other ideas, and he sent his brother Gao Huan (高渙) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang—whom Eastern Wei had taken captive in 547—back to Liang to be emperor. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after his forces lost a few battles to Northern Qi forces, changed his mind and decided to accept Xiao Yuanming as emperor after extracting a promise from Xiao Yuanming to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince. In summer 555, Xiao Yuanming arrived at Jiankang to take the throne, and he created Xiao Fangzhi crown prince. Wang and Chen continued to be in charge of the military. Chen, however, was unhappy about the situation, believing Xiao Yuanming to be unworthy of the throne. Despite Wang Sengbian's knowledge of Chen's displeasure, however, Wang did not suspect Chen of having any rebellious intentions, as they had been friendly, and Wang and Chen had agreed on having Wang Sengbian's son Wang Wei (王頠) marry Chen's daughter, although the marriage had not been established on account of the recent death of Wang Sengbian's mother. in fall 555, believing reports that Northern Qi was going to attack, Wang sent his secretary Jiang Gan (江旰) to Jingkou to alert Chen. Chen instead detained Jiang and started a surprise attack on Wang. With Wang not suspecting that an attack would occur, Chen quickly reached Wang's headquarters at Shitou (a fortress near Jiankang), capturing and killing Wang Sengbian and Wang Wei. He took over control of the imperial government, forcing Xiao Yuanming to abdicate and making Xiao Fangzhi emperor (as Emperor Jing). Immediately, Chen faced resistance from the generals Xu Sihui (徐嗣徽), Ren Yue (任約), and Hou Tian (侯瑱), and Wang Sengbian's brother Wang Sengzhi (王僧智) and son-in-law Du Kan (杜龕). (Du was the governor of Chen's home commandery of Wuxing, and the historian Bo Yang had speculated that Du's disrespect for Chen and his curbing of special privileges that Chen's clan was exerting in Wuxing might have been an impetus for Chen's rebellion against Wang.) Chen initially sent his nephew Chen Qian and his general Zhou Wenyu against Du and Du's ally Wei Zai (韋載), but the campaign was inconclusive, and Chen subsequently went to attack himself. Meanwhile, Xu and Ren, aided by Northern Qi, made a surprise attack on Jiankang, nearly capturing it, but were repelled by Chen's general Hou Andu. Soon, Chen defeated Wei and Wei surrendered, and Chen returned to Jiankang, leaving Zhou to face Du. Despite Northern Qi aid, Xu and Ren could not defeat Chen, and Chen put Shitou, which the Northern Qi general Liu Damo (柳達摩) had captured, under siege. Liu sought peace, but requested Chen to send his relatives as hostages to Northern Qi. Most officials advocated peace, and Chen, despite his skepticism about such a peace holding, agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (陳曇朗), Emperor Yuan's grandson Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (王珉), the son of the key official Wang Chong (王沖), as hostages, permitting Northern Qi forces to withdraw, and Xu and Ren withdrew with them. By spring 556, Du had either been captured or surrendered to Zhou and Chen Qian, and Chen Baxian executed Du. Wang Sengzhi fled to Northern Qi, and the capital region was largely under Chen Baxian's control. Meanwhile, Northern Qi forces were preparing another attack, but they invited Xiao Yuanming to their camp to discuss peace. Chen sent Xiao Yuanming to Northern Qi camp, but before talks could begin, Xiao Yuanming died from a severe infection on his back. By summer 556, Northern Qi forces were again descending on Jiankang, but once there, their forces stalemated with Chen's forces. Northern Qi forces' food supplies soon ran out, and Chen defeated them, killing Xu and capturing a number of Northern Qi generals, whom Chen executed. (In response, Northern Qi executed Chen Tanlang, although Chen Baxian never found out during his lifetime.) Meanwhile, Hou Tian, having been defeated by another general, Hou Ping (侯平), chose to submit to Chen. During the next year, Chen began to receive greater and greater titles and offices, progressing from being the Marquess of Changcheng to Duke of Changcheng to Duke of Yixing to Duke of Chen to Prince of Chen. In 557, Xiao Bo declared a resistance against Chen from Guang Province. Soon, however, Zhou defeated Xiao Bo's general Ouyang Wei (歐陽頠), and Xiao Bo was killed by his own generals. At the same time, Wang Lin, who controlled modern Hunan and eastern Hubei, suspicious of Chen's intentions, refused his summon to Jiankang and prepared for battle instead. Chen sent Zhou and Hou Andu against Wang Lin. In winter 557, Chen had Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing Chen Dynasty as its Emperor Wu. He created Emperor Jing the Prince of Jiangyin. He posthumously honored his parents emperor and empress, his deceased wife Lady Qian empress, and his deceased son Chen Ke crown prince. He created his wife Zhang Yao'er empress. == Reign == While it is not known when Emperor Wu became a Buddhist, once he became emperor he immediately took steps to officially sanction Buddhism, as he displayed a relic believed to be a Buddha's tooth and held a major Buddhist festival. He also, following the lead of Liang's Emperor Wu, offered himself to Buddha's service on one occasion. He made several requests to Western Wei's successor state Northern Zhou to return Chen Chang and Chen Xu, and while Northern Zhou promised to do so, they would actually not be returned in Emperor Wu's lifetime. Meanwhile, news that Emperor Wu had accepted the throne had reached the front where Zhou Wenyu and Hou Andu were engaging Wang Lin, greatly depressing Zhou and Hou's forces, as this removed a major appeal that they had—that Wang was being a rebel for refusing to follow Emperor Jing's orders. Wang defeated Zhou and Hou and captured them. After doing so, however, both Chen forces and Wang Lin's forces were stalemated by the fact that the general Lu Xida (魯悉達), who controlled Northern Jiang Province (北江州, roughly modern Anqing, Anhui), was accepting overtures from both sides but refusing to actually obey either side. Not able to make progress in his campaign against the new Chen state, Wang sought help from Northern Qi and requested that it return Xiao Zhuang to be emperor. Soon, Northern Qi returned Xiao Zhuang, and Wang Lin declared Xiao Zhuang emperor at Ying Province (郢州, modern eastern Hubei). In summer 558, Emperor Wu had the former Emperor Jing of Liang killed. He sent Hou Tian and Xu Du (徐度) to attack Wang Lin, but soon negotiated a peace with Wang Lin, after Wang's general Yu Xiaoqing (余孝頃) was defeated by the independent general Zhou Di (周迪), satrap of Linchuan (Jiangxi). (Meanwhile, Zhou Wenyu and Hou escaped from Wang's custody and returned to Chen, although Zhou was soon assassinated by the independent general Xiong Tanlang (熊曇朗).) In summer 559, Emperor Wu suffered a major illness and died suddenly. At that time, the only close relative of his in Chen territory, his nephew Chen Qian the Prince of Linchuan, was away building a fort at Nanhuan (南皖, in modern Anqing, Anhui). Empress Zhang, after consulting the officials Du Leng (杜稜) and Cai Jingli (蔡景歷), chose not to announce Emperor Wu's death and summoned Chen Qian back from Nanhuan. The imperial officials decided to support Chen Qian as emperor, and while Empress Zhang was initially hesitant, hoping that Chen Chang would return, she eventually agreed, and Chen Qian took the throne as Emperor Wen. == Era name == * Yongding (永定 yǒng dìng) 557-559 ==Family== * Parents: ** Chen Wenzan, Emperor Jing () ** Empress An, of the Dong clan () * Consorts and Issue: ** Empress Zhao, of the Qian clan () *** Chen Ke, Crown Prince Xiaohuai () ** Empress Xuan, of the Zhang clan (; 506–570), personal name Yao'er () *** Chen Chang, Prince Hengyangxian (; 537–560), sixth son *** Princess Yuhua () ** Unknown *** Chen Li, Prince Yuzhangxian () *** Chen Quan, Prince Changshasi () *** Princess Yongshi (), first daughter **** Married Qian Chan (), and had issue (one son) *** Princess Kuaijimu () **** Married Shen Junli of Wuxing, Marquis Wangcai (; 525–573), and had issue (Lady Shen Wuhua) ==References== == Reading == * Book of Chen, vols. 1, 2. * History of Southern Dynasties, vol. 9. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 158, 159, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167. - Category:Liang dynasty Buddhists Category:Liang dynasty generals Category:Liang dynasty regents Category:Chen dynasty emperors Category:503 births Category:559 deaths Category:Chen dynasty Buddhists Category:Politicians from Huzhou Category:6th- century Chinese monarchs Category:Generals from Zhejiang Category:Chinese Buddhist monarchs ","title":"Emperor Wu of Chen"},{"id":"2581777","text":"Pseudocysts are like cysts, but lack epithelial or endothelial cells. Initial management consists of general supportive care. Symptoms and complications caused by pseudocysts require surgery. Computed tomography (CT) scans are used for initial imaging of cysts, and endoscopic ultrasounds are used in differentiating between cysts and pseudocysts. Endoscopic drainage is a popular and effective method of treating pseudocysts. This is not to be confused with the so-called \\"pseudocystic appearance\\", mainly radiographically, of other lesions, such as Stafne static bone cyst and aneurysmal bone cyst of the jaws. ==Signs and symptoms== Pseudocysts are often asymptomatic. Symptoms are more common in larger pseudocysts, though the size and time present usually are poor indicators of potential complications. Pancreatic pseudocysts may cause abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, a bloated feeling, and trouble eating or digesting food. They also may become infected, rupture, or block part of the intestine. Rarely, the infected pseudocyst causes jaundice or sepsis. Mediastinal pseudocysts, a rare form of pancreatic pseudocysts in the abdomen, may cause dysphagia, dyspnea, airway obstruction, or cardiac tamponade. Adrenal pseudocysts may cause abdominal pain, along with various gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and constipation. ==Cause== Pancreatic pseudocysts are often caused by acute or chronic pancreatitis. They may also be caused by trauma to the abdomen, with a higher frequency in children. Pseudocysts are more often present in chronic pancreatitis patients than acute pancreatitis patients. Also, if the pancreatitis is alcohol induced, there is a higher incidence of pseudocysts. These alcohol-related pseudocysts account for 59%-78% of all pancreatic pseudocysts. Actual pancreatic pseudocyst incidence is small, at around 1.6%-4.5%, or .5-1 per 100,000 adults per year. Types of adrenal cysts include parasitic cysts, epithelial cysts, endothelial cysts, and pseudocysts. 56% of all adrenal cyst-like changes are pseudocysts, and only 7% of those pseudocysts are malignant or potentially malignant. The cause of adrenal pseudocysts is unknown. A few theories exist, but it is believed that repeated episodes of trauma, infection, or bleeding may cause collagen formation leading to the formation of a fibrous lining. Retinal pseudocysts may be related to geographic atrophy. A study found that 22% of eyes with geographic atrophy contained pseudocysts. In South American trypanosomiasis (Chagas’ disease), the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi forms pseudocysts, particularly within muscular and neurological tissue. Within these pseudocysts the parasites enter their amastigote stage, reproducing asexually, before rupturing from the pseudocyst and entering the bloodstream. ==Diagnosis== ===Description=== A pseudocyst is a cystic lesion that may appear as a cyst on scans, but lacks epithelial or endothelial cells. An acute pancreatic pseudocyst is made of pancreatic fluids with a wall of fibrous tissue or granulation. Pseudocysts may form in a number of places, including the pancreas, abdomen, adrenal gland, and eye. ===Pancreatic pseudocysts=== The most common and effective method of diagnosing a pancreatic pseudocyst is with a CT scan. A pseudocyst generally appears as a fluid-filled mass. In some instances, other methods must be used to distinguish between a normal cyst and a pseudocyst. This is usually accomplished with endoscopic ultrasound or with fine needle aspiration. Transabdominal ultrasound can be used to identify pseudocysts, which appear on the scan as echoic structures associated with distal acoustic enhancement. They tend to be round and enclosed in a smooth wall. Pseudocysts may appear more complex when young, hemorrhaged, or when complicated due to infection. The transabdominal ultrasound has a sensitivity rate in detection of pancreatic pseusocysts of 75%-90%, making it inferior to a CT scan, which has a rate of 90%-100%. CT scans are more accurate, and provide more detail regarding the pseudocyst and its surroundings. The CT scan’s weakness is its lack of differentiation between pseudocysts and cystic neoplasm. Also, the intravenous contrast given at the time of the CT scan may worsen kidney dysfunction. MRI and MRCP are effective methods of detecting pseudocysts, but are not regularly used because CT scans offer most of the needed information. These scans do, however, provide better contrast, which allows for better characterization of fluid collections, depicting debris within the collections, and detection of bleeding. Endoscopic ultrasound is generally used as a secondary test to further evaluate the cysts found in other tests, and is used when determining if a cyst is a pseudocyst or not. ===Adrenal pseudocysts=== Adrenal pseudocysts are found in much the same way as pancreatic pseudocysts, with CT scans. In addition, adrenalectomies are used to diagnose the lesion and sometimes relieve pain. ==Prevention== Because pseudocysts are closely related to other conditions, such as pancreatitis and alcohol use, the prevention of pseudocysts lies in the prevention of the main problem. ==Treatment== Not all cysts require treatment. Many pancreatic pseudocysts improve and disappear by themselves. If the cysts are small and are not causing symptoms, careful observation with periodic CT scans is often done. Pseudocysts that persist over many months or that cause symptoms require treatment. Supportive medical care used to help small pseudocysts go away includes the use of intravenous fluids, analgesics, and antiemetics. Doctors often recommend a low-fat diet for those who can tolerate oral intake. Surgery is usually required in the treatment of pseudocysts with symptoms or complications. There are three main methods for draining a pancreatic pseudocyst: endoscopic drainage, percutaneous catheter drainage, or open surgery. Endoscopic drainage tends to be the preferred method due to it being less invasive and having a high long-term success rate. Percutaneous drainage involves the guidance of a CT scan or ultrasound. A drainage catheter is placed into the fluid cavity to drain the fluid, which is then collected over several weeks into an external collection system. The catheter is removed when the drainage becomes minimal. Once the catheter is removed, contrast is injected into the cyst cavity to determine the remaining size and to monitor progress. The success rate is around 50%, and the unsuccessful drainages are mostly caused by large ductal leaks or blockage of the main pancreatic duct. This method is not recommended when patients cannot manage a catheter at home or with patients whose cysts contain bloody or solid material. Surgical drainage of a pseudocyst involves creating a pathway between the pseudocyst cavity and the stomach or small bowel. This method is generally only used if the patient cannot tolerate or failed percutaneous or endoscopic drainage. This method is more risky than the others. Endoscopic drainage is becoming the preferred method of draining pseudocysts because it is less invasive, does not require external drain, and has a large long-term success rate. Drainage is usually achieved with a transpapillary approach with ERCP. Sometimes a direct drainage across the stomach or duodenal wall is used instead. The transpapillary approach is used when the pseudocyst is in communication with the main pancreatic duct, and is also successful in patients with pancreatic duct disruption. Transgastric or transduodenal approaches are used when the pseudocyst is next to the gastro-duodenal wall. Endoscopic ultrasound is the most commonly used test to gather the needed information about the pseudocyst for this method. The endoscopic method depends on the presence of a bulge into the stomach or duodenum to determine the site for catheterization. Inherent risks include missing the pseudocyst, injuring nearby vessels, and inefficient placement of the catheter. In patients with chronic pseudocysts, this approach has a 90% success rate. Recurrence after drainage is around 4%, and the complication rate is below 16%. To treat adrenal pseudocysts, an adrenalectomy or laproscopy may be used. ==References== == External links == Category:Gross pathology ","title":"Pseudocyst"},{"id":"2581781","text":"Gândul (, \\"The Thought\\") is a Romanian online newspaper published in Bucharest.

Its aim is to promote the progress of the mathematical, physical, and natural sciences and the study of related epistemological problems. The Academy has its origins in the Accademia Pontificia dei Nuovi Lincei (\\"Pontifical Academy of the New Lynxes\\"), founded in 1847 as a more closely supervised successor to the Accademia dei Lincei (\\"Academy of Lynxes\\") established in Rome in 1603 by the learned Roman Prince, Federico Cesi (1585–1630), who was a young botanist and naturalist, and which claimed Galileo Galilei as its president. The Accademia dei Lincei survives as a wholly separate institution. The Academy of Sciences, one of the Pontifical academies at the Vatican in Rome, is headquartered in the Casina Pio IV in the heart of the Vatican Gardens. The academy holds a membership roster of the most respected names in 20th century science, including such Nobel laureates as Ernest Rutherford, Max Planck, Otto Hahn, Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, and Charles Hard Townes. ==History== Academy courtyard Cesi wanted his academicians to adhere to a research methodology based upon observation, experimentation, and the inductive method. He thus called his academy \\"dei lincei\\" because its members had \\"eyes as sharp as lynxes,\\" scrutinizing nature at both microscopic and macroscopic levels. The leader of the first academy was the famous scientist Galileo Galilei. Academy of Lynxes was dissolved after the death of its founder, but was re-created by Pope Pius IX in 1847 and given the name Accademia Pontificia dei Nuovi Lincei (\\"Pontifical Academy of the New Lynxes\\"). It was later re-founded in 1936 by Pope Pius XI and given its current name. Pope Paul VI in 1976 and Pope John Paul II in 1986 subsequently updated its statutes. Since 1936, the Pontifical Academy of Sciences has been concerned both with investigating specific scientific subjects belonging to individual disciplines and with the promotion of interdisciplinary co-operation. It has progressively increased the number of its academicians and the international character of its membership. The Academy is an independent body within the Holy See and enjoys freedom of research. The statutes of 1976 express its goal: \\"The Pontifical Academy of Sciences has as its goal the promotion of the progress of the mathematical, physical, and natural sciences, and the study of related epistemological questions and issues.\\" ==Activities== Academy entrance Since the Academy and its membership is not influenced by factors of a national, political, or religious character it represents a valuable source of objective scientific information which is made available to the Holy See and to the international scientific community. Today the work of the Academy covers six main areas: *fundamental science *the science and technology of global questions and issues *science in favor of the problems of the Third World *the ethics and politics of science *bioethics *epistemology The disciplines involved are sub- divided into eight fields: the disciplines of physics and related disciplines; astronomy; chemistry; the earth and environmental sciences; the life sciences (botany, agronomy, zoology, genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, the neurosciences, surgery); mathematics; the applied sciences; and the philosophy and history of sciences. Principal among the many publications produced by the Academy are: * Acta – proceedings of the Plenary Sessions * Scripta Varia – major works such as full reports on Study Weeks & Working Groups held at the Academy; some, due to their special importance, have been taken up by foreign publishers * Documenta & Extra Series – for quick publication of summaries and conclusions of Study Weeks and Working Groups; also for rapid diffusion of Papal addresses to the Academy, and of significant documents such as the \\"Declaration on the Prevention of Nuclear War\\" * Commentarii – notes and memoirs as well as special studies on scientific subjects. With the goal of promoting scientific research, the Pius XI Medal is awarded by the Academy every two years to a young scientist who is under the age of 45 and shows exceptional promise. A few of the winners have also become members of the Academy. ==Goals and hopes of the Academy== Aula Magna The goals and hopes of the Academy were expressed by Pope Pius XI in the motu proprio \\"In multis solaciis\\" which brought about its re-foundation in 1936: :\\"Amongst the many consolations with which divine Goodness has wished to make happy the years of our Pontificate, I am happy to place that of our having being able to see not a few of those who dedicate themselves to the studies of the sciences mature their attitude and their intellectual approach towards religion. Science, when it is real cognition, is never in contrast with the truth of the Christian faith. Indeed, as is well known to those who study the history of science, it must be recognized on the one hand that the Roman Pontiffs and the Catholic Church have always fostered the research of the learned in the experimental field as well, and on the other hand that such research has opened up the way to the defense of the deposit of supernatural truths entrusted to the Church.... We promise again that it is our strongly-held intention, that the 'Pontifical Academicians', through their work and our Institution, work ever more and ever more effectively for the progress of the sciences. Of them we do not ask anything else, since this praiseworthy intent and this noble work in the service of the truth is what we expect of them.\\" Forty years later (10 November 1979), John Paul II once again emphasized the role and goals of the Academy, on the 100th anniversary (centenary) of the birth of Albert Einstein: :\\"The existence of this Pontifical Academy of Sciences, of which in its ancient ancestry Galileo was a member and of which today eminent scientists are members, without any form of ethnic or religious discrimination, is a visible sign, raised amongst the peoples of the world, of the profound harmony that can exist between the truths of science and the truths of faith.... The Church of Rome together with all the Churches spread throughout the world attributes a great importance to the function of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. The title of 'Pontifical' given to the Academy means, as you know, the interest and the commitment of the Church, in different forms from the ancient patronage, but no less profound and effective in character.... How could the Church have lacked interest in the most noble of the occupations which are most strictly human – the search for truth?\\" :\\"Both believing scientists and non-believing scientists are involved in deciphering the palimpsest of nature which has been built in a rather complex way, where the traces of the different stages of the long evolution of the world have been covered over and mixed up. The believer, perhaps, has the advantage of knowing that the puzzle has a solution, that the underlying writing is in the final analysis the work of an intelligent being, and that thus the problem posed by nature has been posed to be solved and that its difficulty is without doubt proportionate to the present or future capacity of humanity. This, perhaps, will not give him new resources for the investigation engaged in. But it will contribute to maintaining him in that healthy optimism without which a sustained effort cannot be engaged in for long.\\" On 8 November 2012 Pope Benedict XVI told members of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences: :\\"Dialogue and cooperation between faith and science are urgently needed for building a culture that respects people and the planet.... Without faith and science informing each other, the great questions of humanity leave the domain of reason and truth, and are abandoned to the irrational, to myth, or to indifference, with great damage to humanity itself, to world peace and to our ultimate destiny.... (As people strive to) unlock the mysteries of man and the universe, I am convinced of the urgent need for continued dialogue and cooperation between the worlds of science and of faith in building a culture of respect for man, for human dignity and freedom, for the future of our human family, and for the long-term sustainable development of our planet.\\"Benedict XVI ==Members== The new members of the Academy are elected by the body of Academicians and chosen from men and women of every race and religion based on the high scientific value of their activities and their high moral profile. They are then officially appointed by the Roman Pontiff. The Academy is governed by a President, appointed from its members by the Pope, who is helped by a scientific Council and by the Chancellor. Initially made up of 80 Academicians, 70 who were appointed for life.

It is 56 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Penrith, and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. It is on the eastern side of the Nepean River, just south of Penrith and bears the name of Thomas Jamison, a pioneer landowner and First Fleet surgeon. ==History== ===Aboriginal culture=== Prior to European settlement, what is now Jamisontown was home to the Mulgoa people who spoke the Darug language. They lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle governed by traditional laws, which had their origins in the Dreamtime. Their homes were bark huts called 'gunyahs'. They hunted kangaroos and emus for meat, and gathered sweet potatoes, berries and other native plants. ===European settlement=== In 1805, the then Surgeon-General (Principal Surgeon) of the Colony of New South Wales, Thomas Jamison (1752/53-1811), was granted on the banks of the Nepean River, to the south of what is now Jamison Road. Later, the property passed to his son, Sir John Jamison (1776–1844), Kt, MD, MLC - a celebrated physician, land owner and political reformer, who erected a splendid mansion (since destroyed by fire) on the nearby Regentville estate during the 1820s. The land at Jamisontown stayed rural for the next 150 years or so. In 1911, it was the departure point for the first cross-country flight in Australia, made by William Ewart Hart. In the 1960s the area began to be subdivided and developed and in 1976, Jamisontown was officially gazetted as a neighbourhood. Jamison Town Post Office opened on 10 May 1889 and closed in 1931. The sikh locals formed Sydney Gurdwara Penrith (Sikh Association of Australia) as well. ==Transport== Mulgoa Road is the main road in the suburb, connecting with both Penrith and the M4 Western Motorway which in turn provides quick connection to greater Sydney and the Blue Mountains. The nearest railway station is at Penrith on the Western Line of the Sydney Trains network. Busways provides three bus services in the area with route 791 connecting Jamisontown to Penrith, route 795 connecting to Penrith and Mulgoa, and route 797 connecting to Penrith and Glenmore Park. ==Local Attractions== The Penrith Ice Palace is located in Jamisontown close to the river. ==Education== Jamisontown Public School is the only school in the suburb. Jamison High School is actually located in South Penrith. ==Population== === Demographics === According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 5,500 people in Jamisontown. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 3.2% of the population. * The most common ancestries were English 28.4%, Australian 27.3%, Irish 8.6%, Scottish 6.6% and German 3.1% * 74.9% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 4.7%. * 83.6% of people spoke only English at home. * The most common responses for religion were Catholic 28.4%, No Religion 23.9% and Anglican 22.3%. ===Notable residents=== * Thomas Jamison (1745–1811), NSW surgeon- general and colonial landholder in Jamisontown. ==Governance== At a local government level, Jamisontown is part of the south ward of Penrith City Council, represented by Jim Aitken, Mark Davies, Karen McKeown, Susan Page and Gary Rumble.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 Census, including Little Ann and Red Post Bridge, was 2,566. ==History== The village name Ann was derived from the Celtic river name 'Anne' meaning 'Ash Tree Stream' (now known as the Pillhill Brook). The first settlements in the area can be traced back to 50BC when the Atrebates cleared the forests and cultivated the land. During Roman rule the village prospered, and at the end of Dunkirt Lane a large Roman villa was built. Mosaics taken from this villa are now in the British Museum. First mentioned as Anna when reportedly granted to the New Minster of Winchester by King Edward the Elder, it was later recorded in the Domesday Book as an area containing 8 hides and 3 mills. The long, narrow and roughly rectangular boundary is characteristic of West Hampshire chalk land parishes. Defined in Saxon times, or possibly earlier, this shape ensured that Abbotts Ann had its share of river, down land and richer waterside meadows. Before the Norman invasion the land was granted to the abbey of Hyde and became known as Ann Abbatis (\\"estate on the River Anne belonging to the abbot\\"). Little Ann was granted to the abbey of Wherwell. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries the estates passed back into secular hands. In 1806, Robert Tasker settled in Abbotts Ann and later took over the blacksmith's business. Tasker and his brother developed the first iron plough, which become so popular that they set up the Waterloo Ironworks in Anna Valley to cope with the demand. In 1831, Robert Tasker built the Abbotts Ann school on its previous site in the village, and leased it to the Revd. Samuel Best, the Rector of Abbotts Ann. Built 39 years before education became compulsory, the school was one of the first in England to take children of all denominations. The school's name is Abbotts Ann C of E Primary School, and it has since moved to a new site which is surrounded by the countryside of Abbotts Ann. Between 1915 and 1924 the Red Rice Estate, which included Abbotts Ann and much of the surrounding countryside, was sold. In 1934 the Government bought Little Park for the new Land Settlement Association, creating the largest influx of population into the village since AD500. The settlers came mainly from northern England and Wales, and those who stayed on made a permanent contribution to the village. Of the 517 houses in the village, 107 have been built in the last 20 years. ==St Mary the Virgin, Abbotts Ann== St Mary's Church, Abbots Ann The presence of a church in Abbots Ann is first recorded in a charter granted by Edward the Elder in 901. By the 14th century a second, \\"more substantial\\", church had been erected on this site. In 1710 Thomas \\"Diamond\\" Pitt, the grandfather and great-grandfather of the Prime Ministers William Pitt the Elder and William Pitt the Younger, purchased the estate of Abbots Ann, the manor house and the church. In 1716 Pitt – who had made a huge fortune from his sale of a 410 carat (82g) diamond, purchased for £20,400 (equivalent to £ in ) and sold to the French regent, Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, for £135,000 (equivalent to £ in ) – paid for the demolition of the existing church and the construction of the present parish church of St Mary the Virgin, Abbotts Ann. A Virgin's Crown, dated 1953, hanging in St Mary's church ===Virgins' crowns=== The church has one of the largest collections of virgins' crowns in existence, and Abbots Ann is the only parish in England which perpetuates the custom of awarding them. The crowns \\"may be requested by the relatives of the deceased person, who must have been born, baptised, confirmed and have died, unmarried, in the parish, and must have been of unblemished reputation.\\" The crown is made of hazelwood and decorated with paper rosettes, with five paper gloves or gauntlets attached to it to \\"represent a challenge thrown down to anyone to asperse the character of the deceased.\\" At the funeral the crown is \\"suspended from a small white wand and carried by two girls aged between twelve and sixteen and dressed in white with folded handkerchiefs on their heads at the head of the funeral procession, laid on the coffin in the church and afterwards in the churchyard until the body is committed to the ground.\\" It is then hung from a hook in the church gallery \\"so that all entering church on the following Sunday may pass under it.\\" If unchallenged after 3 weeks, the crown is hung from a hook near the ceiling of the church, with an escutcheon recording the name and date. The oldest crown dates from 1740, and the most recent from 1973. Writing in 1992, local historian and author Pamela J. King observed that \\"With today's increasingly mobile population very few people are likely to spend all their lives in one parish and this ancient custom may disappear.\\" ==Present== Today the village contains a village shop run by volunteers (which itself contains a post office – one of many recently threatened with closure), which achieved first prize in the Best Rural Retailer 2009 competition. The village also has a village hall, a primary school, a playing field and a pub called the Eagle, as well as another well-known pub in the neighbouring hamlet of Little Ann, called the Poplar Farm Inn. The village is also home to one of the last remaining classic red phoneboxes left in England. ==Abbotts Ann Players== The Abbotts Ann Village Players is a community amateur dramatics society inside the village of Abbotts Ann it performs most of its performances inside the Abbotts Ann village Hall which is known as a hub of the village. The village hall boasts a large stage the players normally perform on, the players have also performed at local village primary school known as the Abbotts Ann Church of England primary school. The Abbotts Ann Players have been running for the last 40 years performing shows such as 'beauty and the beast' and 'jack and the bean stalk'. The players are made up of residents from Abbotts Ann and surrounding villages and towns. ==Further reading== * * ==References== ==External links== * Category:Villages in Hampshire Category:Test Valley ","title":"Abbotts Ann"},{"id":"2581815","text":"Putranjiva is a plant genus of the family Putranjivaceae, first described as a genus in 1826.

He gained notoriety for a court case in 1824 where a neighbour sued him for getting his 14-year-old daughter pregnant. During the case, Kearns was defended by William Charles Wentworth a young Lawyer at the time, Wentworth had evidence proving the neighbour was a man who lied about other matters so not a person to be trusted. Kearns had to pay a far lesser amount than the neighbour had wanted. William and his new wife Elizabeth went on to bring up the little girl from the former relationship the child adored her father. Kearns's land was originally owned by the Tharawal people until they were dispossessed by British settlers in the 1820s. They first named the land River Hill but by 1828 it had been renamed Epping Forest by Kearns. By purchasing neighbouring land grants, he expanded his property to and established a thriving dairy farm and orchard. After his death in 1880, the property stayed within the family until 1978. In 1975, Campbelltown Council began planning a major development in the area and chose the name Kearns for the suburb since Epping Forest would have caused confusion with the suburb of Epping elsewhere in Sydney. Streets were named after famous rivers of the world such as Mississippi, Danube and Yangtze and the first residents moved in in 1985. Not long after, a primary school was established in 1992. == Heritage listings == Kearns has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Mississippi Crescent: Epping Forest, Kearns ==People== According to the 2016 census from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Kearns had a population of 2,745 which could be best described as young families on better than average incomes.

It is part of the Hills District region. ==History== 250px Kellyville is believed to be named after Hugh Kelly, who owned land comprising the Kellyville Estate. Kelly was a former convict who arrived in New South Wales aboard The Rolla in 1803. Early land holders given grants included John Tivett, George Acres, Hugh Kelly and Michael Hancey. Kelly owned a hotel on the corner of Wrights and Windsor Roads called the Bird-In-Hand. Kellyville's origins as a landmark date to at least 1810 with the grant of land and the 1820s construction of the White Hart Inn. The foundations for the Inn remain. The Inn was a popular stable and accommodation on the main road to Windsor. The White Hart Inn existed long prior to its competitor The Bird In Hand. Ironically, the original owner of the land grant on which the White Hart Hotel was built was Hugh Kelly. The NW Rail Line has conducted extensive archaeological research on the site and documented the history of the Inn including information about Hugh Kelly. Originally, the area had been known as 'There and Nowhere' followed by 'Irish Town' for the clan of Kellys that lived in the area. Kelly died in 1884 a respected local. Following his death, John Fitzgerald Burns, James Green, George Withers, Tiger Lilly, and Adam and Stephanie Corbishley (who went on to be divorced) purchased portions of several early land grants, which were subdivided into farmlets as part of the 'Kellyville Estate', thereby giving the suburb its name. Their original land boundaries explain the present route of Windsor Road. The first subdivisions of lots were made in 1884.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 133 Kellyville Post Office opened on 1 January 1889. The original post office building stands on the corner of Acres Road and Windsor Roads. It now houses a car rental operation. Parts of Kellyville have become separate suburbs over the years. Beaumont Hills, north of Samantha Riley Drive, was renamed in 2002. Kellyville Ridge, west of Old Windsor Road, is a separate suburb in the City of Blacktown. North Kellyville was proclaimed a separate suburb in June 2018. Kellyville Public School is a historic building which was established in 1873. For most of the 20th century, Kellyville was semi-rural. From the 1960s to the 1980s about 900 homes were developed in an area around Acres Road, known locally as 'The Village'. Major developments such as Kellyville Plaza have encouraged residential growth. Due to the suburb's location, Kellyville is a major growth area in The Hills. ==Commercial areas== Kellyville Village features a Coles supermarket and 38 speciality stores with services, groceries and fashion. The centre and Woolworths supermarket next door both opened in 2003. Other shopping needs are met by the various shops located on a light commercial strip in an area known as 'The Village' on Windsor Road, Kellyville. Kellyville Pets, on Windsor Road, is a large and diverse pet store. In 2014, an Aldi supermarket opened on land next door to Kellyville Village on Wrights Road. In 2015, an expansion of Kellyville Village opened with a larger Coles Megastore, First Choice Liquor, Kmart Tyre & Auto Service, and an additional 16 speciality stores. The newly opened North Kellyville Square located on the corner of Withers and Hezlett Roads to the north of the suburb provides a Woolworths and specialty stores to the area which is booming in population. ==Residential areas== Kellyville possesses a combination of semi-rural, older suburban and modern residences offering a variety of lifestyles, spanning from medium-density townhouse developments along Kellyville Shopping Plaza to opulent residences sited adjacent to natural creeks and bushlands. As a result of the suburb's strategic location, Kellyville offers a relaxed and quiet lifestyle being surrounded by rural areas and suburban Castle Hill, Baulkham Hills and Glenhaven. Housing estates: * Duncraig Estate (Cattai Creek Drive, north-east Kellyville) - Known for being a popular choice among home buyers due to both leafiness and diverse choice of house types, ranging from modest modern housing to large affluent properties. Residential land sizes range between * Highlands Estate (Wellgate Avenue, far-northern Kellyville area) - Renowned for being an upmarket neighbourhood surrounded by natural bushland and creek.

Recent infrastructure development in the Hills District has increased the accessibility of Kellyville. Windsor Road, formerly one-lane each way, was upgraded to a two-lane road in 2006 and has significantly improved traffic flow in the area. Green Road was completed as a two-lane road in 2006 and links Kellyville with the nearby Victoria Avenue, Castle Hill trading zone 2 km down the road, home to three Homemaker centres, car dealers, light industrial areas and many other retail outlets. The old Glenhaven Bridge is a wooden, shared one-lane bridge and was replaced with the new Glenhaven Bridge, which is a proper concrete bridge suitable for heavy vehicles. Built in 2007, the bridge runs over Cattai Creek and allows for normal traffic flows between Kellyville and Glenhaven. An unorthodox bailey bridge (Circa ?) and former roadway have been retained in Golden Grove Reserve. This former road bridge can be found between James Mileham Dr and Geewan Ave in the reserve. This bridge once was the extension to Acres Road joining Hazlett Road. Kellyville now has the advantage of faster travel to Sydney CBD fuelled by the new Lane Cove Tunnel and the M2 Hills Motorway. In good conditions, travel takes approximately 35 minutes. ===Bus and rail=== Transport to Parramatta by bus in the far-western side of Kellyville has been improved through the development of the bus-only North-West T-Way, which runs parallel with Old Windsor Road. The Metro North West Line connects the Hills District to . It is planned to extend the line from Chatswood to the City and the Bankstown Line with a dedicated new harbor tunnel crossing, planned to open in 2024. ==Sport and recreation== The Bernie Mullane Sporting Complex is a major recreational facility which was officially opened in March 2003 with a total project cost of more than $13 million. As part of the project, an indoor facility for a gym and other indoor sports, tennis courts, soccer fields and cricket grounds were constructed. The complex provides for a wide range of indoor and outdoor health, recreational and sporting programs and services. Other recreational venues include: * Caddies Creek Reserve - Radisson Place * Commercial Road Netball Reserve - Wellgate Avenue * Kellyville Park - Memorial Avenue * Macquarie Avenue Reserve - Macquarie Avenue * The Hills Centenary Park - Cnr Commercial & Withers Recreational facilities in close proximity include Castle Hill Country Club and Fred Caterson Reserve in Castle Hill. Fred Caterson Reserve is set within a 60 hectare bushland setting directly less than 1 km south-east of Kellyville, and offers a range of outdoor options including bushwalking tracks, BMX track, cycleways, remote control car track and many other sporting fields. ==Population== In the , the population of Kellyville was 27,971. Residents had somewhat younger ages than the country overall: the median age was 35 years, compared to the national median of 38 years. Children aged under 15 years made up 24.3% of the population (national average is 18.7%) and people aged 65 years and over made up 8.9% of the population (national average is 15.7%). 61.0% of residents were born in Australia, the next most common countries of birth were India 4.2%, China 4.1%, England 3.0%, South Africa 2.2% and Philippines 2.0%. 64.3% of residents only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 5.3%, Cantonese 2.5%, Hindi 2.3%, Arabic 2.0% and Persian 1.6%. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 30.3%, No Religion 18.3% and Anglican 13.4%. The median weekly personal income for people aged 15 years and over in Kellyville (State Suburbs) was $889, compared with the national median of $664. The median mortgage payment being $2,600 per month, compared to the national median of 1,986. 90.8% of occupied private dwellings were separate houses, while 7.4% were semi-detached, and 1.3% were flats, units or apartments. ==Notable residents== Some of Kellyville's notable residents include - *Maxine Beneba Clarke - award-winning author, poet and illustrator *Greg Page - former member of The Wiggles * Anthony Field - member of The Wiggles * Waqar Younis - former Pakistan cricketer ==Issues== ===Environmental impact=== Kellyville, as with other newer suburbs in both the south-west and north-west districts of Sydney, has been viewed in the media as a suburb of larger homes that are low-cost in design and mediocre in terms of build quality. Most of the newer homes are built at a high house-to-land ratio, resulting in small distances between neighbours, smaller backyards, and smaller setbacks. With less land and much larger floor plans (double what a typical house would cover), environmental impact is a concern. More trees are planted to offer natural shade from extreme summer heat and more energy is needed to run air-conditioners and heaters. ===Public transport deficiency=== The deficiency of public transport in the area is often criticised. Due to low density planning the bus service within many of the suburbs is slow and infrequent. As a result, commuters to the city are forced either to drive through expensive and congested tollways or take buses which are almost always overcrowded.Northern News - Overcrowding on Hellsbus to city The Northern News 17 June 2008 Transportation has significantly improved after the opening of the Sydney Metro North West line on the 26th of May 2019 ===Land release=== Over the next decade, Kellyville will be further developed on remaining greenfield sites. These sites include northern Kellyville (adjoining Rouse Hill) and the Balmoral Road release area. Since 2013 following approval of the NW Rail Line and the approved design there has been significant land release with construction now evident throughout these land release areas. The former \\"no man's land\\" between Glenwood (Windsor Rd), Windsor Road and Bella Vista is under construction with a blend of high and medium density development build adjacent to new railway stations, track works and siding facilities. ===Weather events=== On 21 June 1972, heavy snow fell between Kellyville and Kellyville Ridge over an area of approximately a square mile centring on the present position of the Ettamogah Hotel. == References == == External links == * History of Kellyville.

Kenthurst is derived from the English County of Kent and hurst meaning a woody hillock or clearing. The area was originally known as Little Dooral and later Little Dural. In 1886 a public meeting was held to discuss a change of name. Charles Gibb was the main agitator who declared that the settlement needed a more elegant title. \\"Kent Forest\\" was suggested as an appropriate name for the area where settlers from Kent County that had settled in the area, but it wasn't popular and eventually Kenthurst was chosen. The meeting applied to the government ministry for permission to change the name, which was successful and was in general use from 1887.HillsDirectory.com.au page on Kenthurst In the 1890s, Dural and the Hills district was the chief supplier of citrus fruit for most of Australia.

It is one of the main species used in greenhouse pollination, and so can be found in many countries and areas where it is not native, such as Tasmania. Moreover, it is a eusocial insect with an overlap of generations, a division of labor, and cooperative brood care. The queen is monandrous which means she mates with only one male. B. terrestris workers learn flower colors and forage efficiently. == Taxonomy and phylogenetics == B. terrestris is part of the order Hymenoptera, which is composed of ants, bees, and wasps. The family Apidae specifically consists of bees. It is also part of the subfamily Apinae. There are 14 tribe lineages within Apinae, and B. terrestris is in the bumblebee tribe, Bombini. It is in the genus Bombus, which consists entirely of bumblebees, and the subgenus Bombus sensu stricto. This subgenus contains closely related species such as Bombus affinis, Bombus cryptarum, Bombus franklini, Bombus ignitus, Bombus lucorum, Bombus magnus, Bombus occidentalis, and Bombus terricola. There are nine recognized subspecies: B. terrestris africanus, B. terrestris audax, B. terrestris calabricus, B. terrestris canariensis, B. terrestris dalmatinus, B. terrestris lusitanicus, B. terrestris sassaricus, B. terrestris terrestris and B. terrestris xanthopus, each with a distinctive coloration scheme. ==Description and identification== Ventral view of B. terrestris B. terrestris are pollen-storing bees that generally feed and forage on nectar and pollen. The queen is between 20 and 22 mm long, males range from 14 to 16 mm, and workers from 11 to 17 mm. Workers have white-ended abdomens, and look just like workers of the white-tailed bumblebee, B. lucorum, a close relative, apart from the yellowish bands of B. terrestris being darker in direct comparison. The queens of B. terrestris have the namesake buff-white abdomen tip (\\"tail\\"); this area is white as in the workers in B. lucorum. B. terrestris is unique compared to other bees in that their caste of workers exhibit a wide variation in worker size, with thorax sizes ranging from 2.3 to 6.9 mm in length and masses ranging from 68 to 754 mg. == Distribution and habitat == B. terrestris is most commonly found throughout Europe and generally occupies temperate climates. Because it can survive in a wide variety of habitats, there are populations in the near East, the Mediterranean Islands, and Northern Africa as well. Additionally, it has escaped captivity after being introduced as a greenhouse pollinator in countries where it is not native, so this bee is now considered an invasive species in many of these places, including Japan, Chile, Argentina, and Tasmania. Nests are usually found underground, such as in abandoned rodent dens. Colonies form comb-like nest structures with egg cells each containing several eggs. The queen will lay egg cells on top of one another. Colonies produce between 300 and 400 bees on average, with a large variation in the number of workers. ==Colony structure== === Social castes === Like in most social bees, there are three main social caste divisions in B. terrestris. This ensures a division of labor and efficient colony functioning. Queens become the main female individual to reproduce in a future colony. There is only one per colony. Her sole responsibility is to lay eggs after she founds a nest. This fate is determined for larvae that receive more food, have longer instar stages, and higher levels of juvenile hormone biosynthesis. Workers, an entirely female caste, mainly forage for food, defend the colony, and tend to the growing larvae. They are usually sterile for most of the colony cycle and do not raise their own young. Unlike queens and workers, which develop from fertilized diploid eggs, drones, or male bees, are born from unfertilized, haploid eggs. Drones leave the colony shortly after reaching adulthood to find a mate outside the nest. Mating is their sole role in the colony. left === Life cycle === A solitary queen hatched from her abandoned colony initiates the colony cycle when she mates with a male and finds a nest. She will stay in this nest over winter and then will lay a small batch of diploid (female) eggs in the spring. Once these hatch, she tends the larvae, feeding them with nectar and pollen. When the larvae are grown, they pupate, and about two weeks later, the first workers emerge. This is known as the initiation phase of the colony. Workers forage for nectar and pollen for the colony and tend later generations of larvae. The workers are smaller than the queen, and usually die while foraging in the jaws of predators like birds or robberflies. The foraging range and frequency of workers depends on the quality and distribution of available food, but most workers forage within a few hundred meters of their nest. This first phase can last a variable amount of time in B. terrestris, after which a switch point is reached, and the queen begins to lay some unfertilized eggs, which develop into males. When the male drones emerge from the nest, they do not return, foraging only for themselves. They seek out emerging queens and mate with them. The remaining diploid eggs hatch into larvae that receive extra food and pupate to become new queens. The queen can use pheromones to discourage the workers' inclination to invest more in these larvae, thereby ensuring that not too many become queens. The resolution of this worker/queen conflict can be complex and is discussed below. The colony persists until fall in temperate zones and then workers begin to lay unfertilized eggs that if they mature will become males. At this point, outright aggression among workers and between the queen and workers begins. This is a predictable time point that occurs about 30 days into the colony cycle in very temperate climates. Usually, the worker-queen conflict will force the queen out and the new workers will become queenless. A \\"false queen\\" might take control of the colony for a short period. The newly emerged queens sometimes act as workers and help to raise another brood of queens. During this time they daily leave the nest looking for food, during which time they may mate. Eventually they find a site to dig a “hibernaculum” where they will hibernate until the next spring, when they emerge, seek food — primarily to build up their ovaries — and soon seek a site to found a new nest. (In warmer climates they may skip the hibernation stage.) Almost always the old colony will have died out, and if the site is free of parasites one of the new queens will return and reuse that site. ==Reproductive behavior== ===Mating system=== B. terrestris is a singly mating species. Mating with multiple males might provide benefits of genetic variability among the brood, but it does not happen in this or any but the most highly derived social bees. The lack of multiple matings by B. terrestris queens may be partly due to male interference. B. terrestris males plug the female's sexual tract with a sticky secretion during mating, which appears to reduce the female's ability to successfully mate with other males for several days. However honeybee males also plug the female's reproductive tract to no avail; honeybees mate tens of times on one mating flight. While there may be genetic fitness benefits in colony heterogeneity from a polyandrous mating system, bumblebees are also likely to be monandrous due to social constraints, risks associated with multiple matings, and phylogenetic inertia since the ancestral bees are singly mated. Finding multiple mates might be energetically costly and expose the queen to higher predation risks. Additionally, while queens may prefer multiple matings to ensure more genetic variability and viable offspring, workers are more closely related to full sisters than to paternal half sisters. This is due to haplodiploidy in Hymenopteran social insects in which males (drones) are haploid and females (workers and queens) are diploid. This confers greater genetic similarity between sister workers (relatedness of 0.75) than between mother and offspring (relatedness of 0.5), making the relatedness component of kin selection higher between sisters. ===Worker egg laying=== In addition to the queen, the workers can lay eggs . Since workers do not mate, all of their eggs are haploid and will develop into drones. There are multiple factors that determine whether a worker bee will become reproductively active. Workers born early in the first brood are more likely to become egg layers due to their increased size and age, which allows more time for ovarian development. Workers usually have to be at least 30 days old to become an egg layer. Individuals that spend less time foraging and more time near the queen are also more likely to become reproductive. Lastly, due to intense competition for the opportunity to reproduce, older workers often harass the queen by attacking her and buzzing loudly. Once this point is reached the colony is usually abandoned. ===Sex ratios=== Due to the variability in the switch point to male production from worker production of B. terrestris colonies, there are varying levels of sex ratios among nests. Early-switching colonies have a much smaller number of future queens compared to males (1:17.4), which may give them a competitive advantage in mating with later emerging queens. Late-switching colonies have fewer males and a more even sex ratio of 1:1:3, thus indicating the queen's control over her colony (she prefers a 1:1 ratio, since she is equally related to both sons and daughters). On the other hand, workers prefer a 3:1 ratio, as they are more related to each other than to their mother. Although early and late switching colonies are usually balanced equally in numbers in the population, the overall demographic in one study was found to be male biased, resulting in an overall sex ratio of 1:4 (female to males). However, most studies show that this balance of bimodal sex determination between early and late-switching colonies creates the queen's preferred 1:1 sex ratio in B. terrestris populations. This is unusual for monogamous social insects, which usually have a 3:1 sex ratio indicative of worker colony control. B. terrestris often does not conform to standard predictions of sex ratios based on evolutionary theory and haplodiploid theory. ===Reproductive suppression=== ====Queen suppression==== Queen bees can control oogenesis in worker bees by suppressing juvenile hormone (JH) in the workers, which regulates egg development. Among queenless B. terrestris workers, the corpora allata, which secrete JH, was noticeably enlarged compared to queenright workers. JH concentrations were also higher in the hemolymph of queenless workers. This suggests that the presence of a queen is enough to prevent workers from laying eggs, which helps her maintain genetic control over her colony's brood. The mechanism through which the queen induces this behavior is likely through pheromones. ====Worker suppression==== While the queen controls much of the egg laying and larval development in the colony, it is likely that workers play a much bigger role in controlling egg laying than previously thought. Dominant workers will often inhibit younger workers from laying eggs. Workers have low levels of JH and ovarian development during the early stages of the colony cycle and also after the competition point. Workers introduced into queenright and queenless colonies experience similar levels of inhibition from fellow workers during the competition point, indicating the key role of worker policing of fellow nest mates later in the colony cycle. This suggests that worker reproductive development will be highest between early development and the competition point in the colony. ==Kin selection== Queen and worker on Cucurbita pepo flower ===Worker-queen conflict=== Conflict is expected between the queen and workers over the sex ratio and reproduction of males in the colony, especially in monandrous colonies where workers are more related to their own sons and nephews than to their brothers. In early-switching colonies, workers might start laying eggs when they know it will be in their own genetic interests, perhaps from a cue that indicates the switch point has been reached and the queen is now laying haploid eggs. In late-switching colonies (where the competition point still occurs at the same time in the cycle), workers may start laying eggs when they detect a change in the queen's pheromone that indicate larvae are developing into new queens. Thus, the outcome of this conflict is mediated through the dominance of the queen and the information available to the workers. While it is assumed that queens usually win this conflict, it is still unclear because some studies have indicated that up to 80% of males are produced by workers. These asymmetries in the timing of egg lying and dominance in B. terrestris might explain why it often does not conform to predicted sex ratios and kin-selection hypotheses, although worker bees are more closely related to their nephews (0.375) than to their brothers (0.25) and kinship selection would lead workers to favor their sons over nephews, and nephews over brothers. ===Worker-worker conflict=== Although B. terrestris workers are most directly in competition with the queen for egg laying opportunities, they will still inhibit their sisters from laying eggs in order to have their own sons. This is beneficial to them because they will share more genes with their own sons (.5) rather than their nephews (.375). However, kin theory states that in monandrous colonies, workers will be most closely related to their sisters (0.75) but are more closely related to their sons (0.50) than to their nephews (0.375) and least of all to their brothers (0.25), and would accordingly devote their resources. ==Social and foraging behavior== Newly emerged workers start out at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy in the social colony. As they age, they move closer to the position of queen. Queen-side workers are often egg layers and interact more frequently with the queen. This social position may pay off later, after the competition point is reached. When the queen is overthrown by the aggression of the workers, the most dominant worker will have the best likelihood of contributing more eggs to the colony brood and will perhaps climb to the position of “false queen.” The queen appears to maintain a constant distance of social dominance from her workers at all points in the cycle, suggesting that she is displaced by the sheer number of workers later in the cycle. ===Foraging behavior=== B. terrestris generally forage on a large variety of flower species. Their highest activity is in the morning, with their peak time being noted at around 7-8 am. This is likely because it gets progressively warmer in the afternoon, and foragers prefer ambient temperatures of around 25 °C during nectar and pollen collection. ====Alloethism==== B. terrestris bees exhibit alloethism, which is where different sized bees perform different tasks. This kind of behavior can be seen most often in foraging activities. Larger bees are more often found foraging outside the nest and will return to the nest with larger amounts of nectar and pollen. It is possible that larger bees might be able to withstand greater temperature variation, avoid predation, and travel larger distances making them selectively advantageous. Distinct social roles based on morphology might also be beneficial for individuals of the colonies, by making the colony operate more efficiently. Small bees can be reared more cheaply and kept for in-nest tasks, while only some larvae will be fed enough to become large foraging bees. B. terrestris foraging ====Food alert==== Individuals who return from the nest after a foraging run often recruit other bees in the colony to leave the nest and search for food. In B. terrestris, successful foragers will return to the nest and run around frantically and without a measurable pattern, unlike the ritualized dance of the honeybee. Although the mechanism by which this recruitment strategy functions is unclear, it is hypothesized that running around likely spreads a pheromone that encourages other bees to exit and forage by indicating the location and odor of food nearby. Colonies with lower food stores will often be more responsive to this foraging pheromone. Conversely, in colonies with ample food reserves bees will be less responsive to these pheromones likely to save time and energy from unnecessary foraging. ====Homing ability==== B. terrestris has an impressive homing range, where bees displaced from their nests can relocate the colony from up to 9.8 km away. However, the return often takes several days, indicating B. terrestris might be utilizing familiar foliage and natural landmarks to find the nest. This may be a tedious process if an individual is outside the conventional foraging range of the nest. Another study indicated that these bees can navigate their way back to the nest from a distance as far away as , although most forage within 5 km of their nest. One mark and recapture study found their average foraging distance to be approximately 663 m. Male bees have also been found to have longer flight ranges than worker bees, likely because they move farther away from the nest to find mates. Males have flight distances of anywhere from 2.6 to 9.9 km. If males also contribute to pollination, this might increase previously predicted pollen flow ranges based on worker flight behavior. ===Learning=== Bumblebees and honey bees are extremely influenced by an innate preference for blue and yellow color. When they have no training, they will often just visit flowers that naturally attract them. However, it is generally thought that bees will learn to visit more nectar rewarding flowers after experience associates the reward with the color of the petals. This has been demonstrated in B. terrestris, where bees trained on artificially colored flowers will pick a similar color to the one they were trained with when tested with an array of flower choices. If individuals were tested with flower colors significantly different than from what they were trained with, they just visited flowers most closely aligned with their innate color preferences. In addition to identifying specific colors for foraging purposes, it has also been shown that young worker bees have to learn complex motor skills in order to efficiently collect nectar and pollen from flowers. These skills might take several days to develop, as memory does not always hold perfectly on a day-to-day basis, sometimes deteriorating overnight. Even within a species, different populations have varying levels of innate blue preference and exhibit intraspecific variation in learning rate during association tasks. This is true of two subspecies of B. terrestris, B. terrestris dalmatinus and B. terrestris audax. left ====Limitations on foraging precision==== While bees are highly adept at discrimination tasks, they are still limited by the magnitude of difference needed in hue to properly carry out these tests. Error rates of color recognition decrease in B. terrestris when flower pigments are closer together on the color spectrum. This might have damaging effects on pollination efficiency if bees visit different flower species with similar, but distinct colors, which can only be mediated if the flowers have unique shapes. ====Social learning==== While bees often forage alone, experiments demonstrate that young foragers might learn what flowers provide the most nectar more quickly when foraging with older workers. B. terrestris individuals have a faster learning curve for visiting unfamiliar, yet rewarding flowers, when they can see a conspecific foraging on the same species. The discovery of this type of associative learning is a novel insight into bee behavior and may supplement learning via color reward association. ==Parasites and disease== === Brood parasites === B. terrestris is parasitized by B. bohemicus, a brood- parasitic Cuckoo bee that invades B. terrestris hives and takes over reproductive dominance from the host queen, laying its own eggs that will be cared for by host workers.Kreuter, Kirsten; Elfi Bunk (November 23, 2011). \\"How the social parasitic bumblebee Bombus bohemicus sneaks into power of reproduction\\". Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 66 (3): 475–486. doi:10.1007/s00265-011-1294-z. Retrieved 21 September 2015. Another brood parasite is the bee B. vestalis'. Both of these are distributed in various regions of Europe. The difference between B. bohemicus and B. vestalis is that the former parasitizes several bumble bee species while B. vestalis exclusively parasitizes B. terrestris. === Microsporidian parasites === A common microsporidian parasite that infects the gut of various bumblebee species, including B. terrestris , is Nosema bombi. N. bombi can cause a creeping disease and is detrimental to the fitness of its bumblebee host.Paul Schmid-Hempel (1998). \\"Parasites in Social Insects\\" Princeton University Press. A study by Manlik et al. (2017) showed that N. bombi infection prevalence varies widely over time, and is associated with mitochondrial DNA genotypes in B. terrestris . ===Effects of foraging on resistance=== Foraging is considered energetically costly and it is possible that individuals that spend more time foraging suffer costs to their overall fitness. For example, B. terrestris is often vulnerable to parasitism by conopid flies in Central Europe, and it has been hypothesized that foragers might suffer higher incidences of parasites due to the increased metabolic costs of flying. This was demonstrated in a population in which foraging workers had significantly lower levels of encapsulation of an experimental parasitic egg when compared to non-foraging workers. This suggests that foragers have compromised immune systems due to increased energetic expenses and might be predisposed to fly parasites. ===Effects of polyandry on resistance=== While B. terrestris is a singly mating species, a polyandrous system would potentially be beneficial because it would be possible to attain greater genetic variability for resistance against disease. Accordingly, artificially increasing the number of mates a B. terrestris queen obtains through artificial insemination has shown that the increased genetic variability in her offspring confers greater resistance to the most common bumblebee parasite, Crithidia bombi. However, the average reproductive success between one and multiple matings is not linear. Queens that mated once and mated four times had a higher fitness than those that mated twice. This suggests that there might be a fitness barrier to increased matings, which might be why colonies are usually monandrous. ===Immunocompetence=== Surprisingly, the immunocompetence, as measured by the ability to encapsulate a novel antigen, does not vary based on the local environment. Experimental studies demonstrate that B. terrestris have equal levels of encapsulation in poor and stable environments. This is unexpected, because immunity should be compromised in conditions where food supply is low in order to save energy. Perhaps encapsulation represents an invariable trait of bumblebees, or immunity is far too complex to characterize solely based on measurements of encapsulation. ===Threats from disease=== Deformed wing virus (DWV) is normally a honey bee pathogen that results in reduced and crumpled wings, making those individuals inviable. This virus is thought to have spread to B. terrestris, and in 2004, as many as 10% of queen bees bred commercially in Europe were found dead with deformed wings. This was confirmed as DWV when B. terrestris colonies tested positive for the presence of DWV RNA. This could indicate that DWV is a broad range pathogen among bees, or perhaps it has recently been infecting new hosts after transmission from honey bees. === Interactions with other species === Female Bee Moths (Aphomia sociella) prefer to lay their eggs in the nests of bumblebees. The A. sociella larvae will then hatch and feed on the eggs, larvae, and pupae left unprotected by the bees, sometimes destroying large parts of the nest as they tunnel throughout looking for food. ==Environmental concerns== ===Invasive species=== While native to Europe, B. terrestris has been introduced as a greenhouse pollinator into many foreign ecosystems. The presence of B. terrestris is becoming an ecological concern in many communities in which it is not native. It is classified as an \\"invasive alien species\\" in Japan. For example, B. terrestris has a large niche overlap with local Japanese bee species in terms of flower resources and nest sites. B. terrestris queens competing for local underground nest sites are displacing B. hypocrita sapporoensis. However, B. pseudobaicalensis, which visits similar flowers but only forms nests above ground, has not seen a rapid decline in population numbers. In 2008, the Australian government banned the live import of B. terrestris into Australia on the grounds that it would present a significant risk of becoming a feral species and thereby present a threat to native fauna and flora. In 2004, this bumblebee was classified as a 'Key Threatening Process' by the Scientific Committee of the New South Wales Department of Environment. This species was introduced to Chile in 1998. It has since crossed into Argentina, and is spreading at about 275 km per year. Its spread has been detrimental to populations of Bombus dahlbomii, which is the only bumblebee species native to southern South America (Patagonia, Southern Chile and Argentina). Bombus terrestris populations facilitated such massive and immediate population decline of Bombus dahlbomii through competition and pathogen introduction/spillover. Bombus ruderatus, a bee previously introduced in 1982, is also seriously affected. The cause is thought to be the parasite Apicystis bombi, an organism carried by the buff- tails, but which has no adverse effect on that species. ===Colony development in changing environments=== In temperate areas, variable climates and environmental conditions occur during changing seasons. Lack of available food due to these unpredictable circumstances can often negatively affect colony growth, reproduction, and resistance to parasites. In poor environments with limited food, the few workers born are smaller than average. However, it appears that B. terrestris is well adapted to a changing environment, considering colony growth is higher under variable feeding conditions than under stable feeding conditions. Workers and reproductives are also heavier with a variable food supply when compared to stable food availability. This might indicate an adaptive strategy of increased provisioning to save for days it is hard to find food. ===Pesticide exposure=== In their 2014 study published in Functional Ecology researchers using Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging technology on the bees, found that a sublethal exposure to either a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) and/or a pyrethroid (?-cyhalothrin) over a four-week period caused an impairment of the bumblebee's ability to forage. Research published in 2015 showed that bees prefer solutions containing neonicotinoids, even though the consumption of these pesticides caused them to eat less food overall. This work implies that treating flowering crops with such pesticides presents a sizeable hazard to foraging bees. ==Human importance== ===Commercial use=== Since 1987, B. terrestris has been bred commercially for use as a pollinator in European greenhouse crops, particularly tomatoes—a task which was previously carried out by human hand. B. terrestris has been commercially reared in New Zealand since the early 1990s,Velthuis, H. H. W. and van Doorn, A. (April 2004) 'The breeding, commercialization and economic value of bumblebees.' in B. M. Freitas and J. O. P. Pereira (eds) Solitary Bees Conservation, Rearing and Management for Pollination. Federal University of Ceara, Brasil, pp. 135-149http://biobees.co.nz/biology.html and is now used in at least North Africa, Japan, Korea, and Russia, with the global trade in bumblebee colonies probably exceeding 1 million nests per year.Dave Goulson (2010). \\"Bumblebees. Behaviour, Ecology and Conservation\\" Oxford University Press. In Korea, however, some have chosen Bombus ignitus over the already established commercial pollinator, Bombus terrestris, for fear of competition or genetic contamination by mating with native bumblebee species. Also, there has been a ban on importing B. terrestris into North America which resulted in higher interest in other species like B. impatiens in North America.\\"Bumblebees : Behaviour, Ecology, and Conservation\\". web.a.ebscohost.com. Retrieved 2015-09-26. Nonetheless, B. terrestris are key commercial pollinators in Europe, which has driven researchers to investigate the influence of agricultural land on the foraging and survival of this species. Monoculture reduces biodiversity in farmland areas, and likely decreases the number of flowering species bees can forage on. B. terrestris consequently exhibits greater nest growth in suburban areas than in farmland, because local suburban gardens promote more plant diversity for bees to feed from. Agriculture has a profound impact on many bumblebees, and is causing widespread decline in several species. However, B. terrestris is still widespread, likely because it can forage at very long distances, making it less sensitive to changes in biodiversity and the environment. ==References== Reference to add: Parmentier et al.

Its exact location was lost for many years until excavations were carried out in the 1960s. ==Location== Elsyng, also known as Enfield House, should not be confused with Enfield Manor House, known after the end of the eighteenth century as Enfield Palace. This was located near the market place in Enfield Town, with parts surviving until 1928. Elsyng was in the separate manor called Wroth's, Tiptofts and later Worcesters. The house lay within the present estate of the later Forty Hall, to the north-east of the hall and to the south of Turkey Brook. The site is now a scheduled ancient monument. ==History== The manor originally known as Wroth's Place was inherited in 1413 by John Tiptoft, 1st Baron Tiptoft (whose mother was Agnes Wroth)Clark, L., \\"Tiptoft, John, 1st Baron Tiptoft (c.1378–1443)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press from his cousin Elizabeth Wroth. John was succeeded by his son John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester (1427–70)Kohl, B.G., \\"Tiptoft [Tibetot], John, 1st earl of Worcester (1427–1470), administrator and humanist\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press 2004 who is said to have built the house. After Worcester's execution in 1470 the manor (now called Tiptofts) passed to his sister Phillipa. From here it passed to Phillipa's son Edmund de Ros, 10th Baron de Ros and in 1492 to Edmund's sister Isabel and her husband Sir Thomas Lovell, Speaker of the House of Commons. On Lovell's death in 1524, it passed to his great-nephew, Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland. In 1539 he exchanged the manor, by now called Worcesters, with property in Leicestershire, and the manor therefore came into the ownership of Henry VIII. Henry VIII visited Elsings, \\"the palatial Middlesex home of Sir Thomas Lovell, more frequently than any other residence belonging to a lay subject. Foreign visitors were invariably housed at Sir Thomas Lovell's mansion...As treasurer of the household, Lovell played an important role in Wolsey's administration but perhaps it was the splendour of Elsings coupled with its convenient location which most attracted the king.\\"Neil Samman, in The Reign of Henry VIII: Politics, Policy and Piety, ed. by Diarmaid MacCulloch (Hampshire: 1995). The original building date of the house is not known. Earliest traced records show it belonged to Thomas Elsyng, a Citizen and Mercer of London. Under the ownership of Sir Thomas Lovell it was extended to become a brick palace sufficient to receive the court on progress; Lovell also contributed to the clerestory and glazing of Enfield parish church.Gunn, S.J., Lovell, Sir Thomas (c.1449–1524), administrator and speaker of the House of Commons, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press 2004 Henry VIII's sister Queen Margaret of Scotland stayed at Lovell's house in 1516. After 1539, the estate which was called Little Park was used by Henry VIII as a base for hunting. His children spent part of their childhood here. There were extensive repairs by James Needham, Clerk of the King's Works in 1542 in preparation for a Christmas visit by Prince Edward and his sisters Mary and Elizabeth, and it is where Elizabeth and Edward heard of their father's death. As Queen, Elizabeth is believed to have stayed at Elsyng on at least four occasions. The palace fell out of use in the Stuart period in favour of nearby Theobalds. In 1608 James I had it partly demolished and the materials used for extensions there. The remaining part, including the gatehouse and hall, was occupied from 1616 to 1623 by Philip Herbert, Earl of Montgomery. By 1630 however he had succeeded his brother as Earl of Pembroke and was busy remodelling Wilton House. Elsyng probably began to fall into disrepair and in 1641 Charles I sold it to Pembroke. In 1646, Nicholas Raynton, owner of the neighbouring Forty Hall, died and his estate passed to his son, also Nicholas. Following the death of Pembroke in 1650, Raynton acquired the remains of Elsyng to extend the Forty Hall estate. Initially the ruins of the palace may have been retained as a folly, however it was eventually demolished sometime in the 1650s with some reuse of bricks in other houses around Enfield. ==Archaeology== The rediscovery of the palace site began in the 1960s with the local Enfield Archaeological Society finding traces of Tudor vaulted brick drains, and traces of the royal apartments. Subsequent digs in 2004, 2005 and later have revealed further traces of the palace and its associated outbuildings. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Enfield Category:History of the London Borough of Enfield Category:Tudor royal palaces in England Category:History of Middlesex Category:Middlesex ","title":"Elsyng Palace"},{"id":"2581864","text":"Killarney Heights is a suburb of Northern Sydney, situated on Middle Harbour, in the state of New South Wales, Australia.

The island was named Yassıada until 2013, when it was renamed “Democracy and Freedom Island” in order to remember the 1960 military coup, the first in the history of the republic.Yassıada to become ‘Island of Democracy and Freedom’ In the past, the island was named Plati (). The island, which has an area of 0.05 km², is officially a neighbourhood in the Adalar (meaning \\"Isles\\" in Turkish) district of Istanbul Province, Turkey. Yassıada was used by the Byzantines for sending prominent figures into exile. One such person was the Armenian Patriarch (Catholicos) Narses who was first sent to this island before being imprisoned at Prinkipos in the 4th century AD. In the 11th century AD the Byzantines used the island for political prisoners. The remains of the 4 underground prison cells from this period can still be seen. The Byzantine Emperor Theofilos, built the Platea Monastery on the island. Patriarch Ignatios, who was exiled to the island in 860, had built a church. Tunnels under the church were used as a dungeon. Yassıada (Plati) was captured by the Latin Crusaders during the Fourth Crusade in 1204. In 1857, Yassıada was purchased by the British ambassador Henry Bulwer, brother of novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton, who built himself a mansion and a number of other structures to live undisturbed on this distant island. Henry Bulwer also organized agricultural production on the island to self-sustain his little realm at least to a certain degree, but later sold Yassıada to the Khedive of Ottoman Egypt and Sudan, Ismail Pasha; who, however, didn't construct any new buildings and completely neglected the island. With the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the island became a property of the Turkish state, and in 1947 Yassıada was handed over to the Turkish Navy which built several school buildings. Between 1960 and 1961, these school buildings became the venue for the trials of the members of the former ruling party, Demokrat Parti, after the military coup of 1960. Several of the defendants were sentenced to death, and three of these, including the former Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, were taken to İmralı Island (further southwest, near the southern shoreline of the Sea of Marmara) and executed there in 1961. After the end of the trials, Yassıada was given back to the Turkish Navy and lessons continued to take place at the naval school buildings until 1978. In 1993, the island became a property of Istanbul University's department of Marine Life and Sea Products, which used it for lessons and research. However, the strong winds on the island made life difficult for the students and eventually classes were held elsewhere. Today, the island is a favourite location for scuba diving schools and amateur divers. == Rename and restructure == The island was home to the infamous trial of then Turkish Prime minister Adnan Menderes and ministers Fatin Rüştü Zorlu and Hasan Polatkan, which was resulted with execution order. After the 1960 coup \\"Yassıada\\" name was remembered negatively, which led the island to be renamed as \\"Democracy and Freedom Island\\" on November 7, 2013. After renaming, the island went into major restructure in 2015. On 27 May 2020, President Erdoğan opened the island with a ceremony including “27 May Museum”, a convention center, an hotel and a mosque. ==References and notes== ==External links== Category:Islands of the Sea of Marmara Category:Islands of Turkey Category:Neighbourhoods of Adalar, Istanbul Category:Islands of Istanbul Province ","title":"Yassıada"},{"id":"2581907","text":"A Barrack-room (1942) by Keith Vaughan John Keith Vaughan (23 August 1912 – 4 November 1977), generally known as Keith Vaughan, was a British painter. Born in Selsey, Vaughan attended Christ's Hospital school. He worked in an advertising agency until the war, when as an intending conscientious objector he joined the St John Ambulance; in 1941 he was conscripted into the Non- Combatant Corps. Vaughan was self-taught as an artist. His first exhibitions took place during the war. In 1942 he was stationed at Ashton Gifford near Codford in Wiltshire, and paintings from this time include The Wall at Ashton Gifford (Manchester Art Gallery). Also during the war Vaughan formed friendships with the painters Graham Sutherland and John Minton, with whom after demobilisation in 1946 he shared premises. Through these contacts he formed part of the neo-romantic circle of the immediate post-war period. However, Vaughan rapidly developed an idiosyncratic style which moved him away from the Neo-Romantics. Concentrating on studies of male figures, his works became increasingly abstract. Vaughan worked as an art teacher at the Camberwell College of Arts, the Central School of Art and later at the Slade School. Vaughan is also known for his journals, selections from which were published in 1966 and more extensively in 1989, after his death. A gay man troubled by his sexuality, he is known largely through those journals. He was diagnosed with cancer in 1975 and committed suicide in 1977 in London, recording his last moments in his diary as the drugs overdose took effect. The centenary of Keith Vaughan's birth was celebrated with an exhibition at Pallant House Gallery in Chichester, 'Keith Vaughan: Romanticism to Abstraction' (10 March to 10 June 2012). His auction record of £313,250 was set at Sotheby's, London, on 11 November 2009, for the oil on canvas Theseus and the Minotaur, previously in the collection of Richard AttenboroughKeith Vaughan, lot

It is south of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Sutherland Shire along the east coast. Cronulla and Woolooware are the only adjacent suburbs. La Perouse is located opposite, on the northern headland of Botany Bay. The Cronulla sand dunes are on the south eastern headland of Botany Bay. The eastern side of the peninsula is part of Botany Bay National Park, and Towra Point Nature Reserve is located on the western side of the suburb. ==History== Kurnell is the place where Captain James Cook landed on 29 April 1770, making first contact with the original inhabitants of the area, the Gweagal people whilst navigating his way up the East Coast of Australia on Endeavour. Captain Cook along with his crew stayed at Kurnell for a period of eight days. During their visit they collected botanical specimens, mapped the area and tried to make contact (unsuccessfully) with the indigenous population. When Cook reported back to England he said that the land was suitable for agriculture and was lightly wooded. Captain Arthur Phillip, arriving in H.M. Armed Tender Supply on 18 January 1788, before the First Fleet arrived, following Cook's advice. They began to clear land and dig wells, near modern-day La Perouse but a week later, Phillip decided to abandon the site and moved north to Sydney Cove at Port Jackson. Captain Cook Memorial Obelisk Cook's landing place is located on the north-eastern part of the national park, just near Silver Beach. Sutherland Point is named in honour of a crew member, Scotsman Forby Sutherland, who died of tuberculosis during their eight days here and was buried on the shore. Cape Solander is named after Swedish botanist Daniel Solander, a colleague of Joseph Banks. Inscription Point was named by the Australian Philosophical Society in 1822 when they secured a plaque to the cliff face to mark the point of the Endeavour's crew first landing. Dampier Street, Tasman Street and Torres Street commemorate other navigators in Australia's history. The first land grant of was made in 1815, to Captain James Birnie, who established Alpha Farm. 'Alpha' is the first letter in the Greek alphabet and the name was thought appropriate for the first farm in the area. In 1821 John Connell Junior was also granted land here and used it for timber getting. His father purchased Alpha Farm from Birnie and by 1842 the Connell family's estate was over one thousand acres (4 km²) in size. In 1860, Alpha Farm was sold to Thomas Holt (1811–88), who owned most of the land that stretched from Sutherland to Cronulla. The area was known as Birniemere for a time and Holtmere was once a locality. Kurnell peninsula from air Before the 1920s, Kurnell was used by fishermen as schools of several varieties of fish inhabited the Botany Bay foreshore and the open sea. Fishermen built numerous huts and shacks which sheltered them for the weekend fishing. During the Great Depression, from the late 1920s, many severely affected low-income families took up residence there, in a shantytown. === 2015 storm === On 16 December 2015 a supercell tracked along New South Wales coast producing a strong F2 tornado, high rainfall, hailstones and unusually strong winds. Kurnell was particularly hard hit at about 10:30 am with homes and businesses un-roofed, sewerage and electricity cut, two trucks tipped on their sides, and workers evacuated from Kurnell Refinery and the desalination plant, which was damaged. A \\"Wind gust of 213 km/h recorded in Kurnell at 10:33am,\\" was \\"the fastest wind speed recorded in NSW history\\". Injuries to people were only minor. The damage to Kurnell was calculated to have cost insurers . Elsewhere on the same day roof damage occurred at Westfield Bondi Junction and in South Nowra. Thousands of homes lost power in Bulli, Thirroul and Woonona north of Wollongong. ==Name== It is possibly a corruption of a Dharug term \\"cunthal\\", \\"kundle\\" or \\"koondool\\", perhaps meaning \\"place of or where the wild carrot grows\\". Alternatively it is an Aboriginal corruption of the surname of John Connell, who was granted land in the area in 1821. == Heritage listings == Kurnell has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Cape Solander Drive: Kamay Botany Bay National Park ==Population== In the 2016 Census, there were 2,267 people in Kurnell. 83.1% of people were born in Australia and 90.6% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 27.5%, Anglican 27.3% and Catholic 26.9%. ==Places of interest== thumb The northern part of the peninsula is a historic site known as Captain Cooks Landing Place with a number of memorials located here: * Captain Cook Memorial Obelisk * Kamay Botany Bay Discovery Centre * Sir Joseph Banks Memorial * Solander Monument * Sutherland Monument * Marton Park (Home of the mighty Kurnell Stingrays) on Game Day The Discovery Centre provides information and displays relics from the early days in Kurnell's history. Endeavour Heights is a recreation area in the Botany Bay National Park. The Kurnell Lookout provides brilliant views of Botany Bay and the northern headland of Botany Bay at La Perouse. Cape Solander is popular amongst whale watchers during the migration season. ==Commercial areas== The Kurnell sand dunes The small residential area with a population of 2,260 is located to the north with a small group of shops in the village of Kurnell. Sand mining on the peninsula has depleted the area of much of the sand that was originally there. It has been said that 40-metre deep pools now form in the dunes and are clearly visible in view from Google Earth. The remaining sand dune is used as a recreational off-road area for 4 wheel drives. The Cronulla sand dunes formed part of the location for the films Forty Thousand Horsemen, directed by Charles Chauvel in 1940 and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. Kurnell is dominated by an industrial area, which once included the Caltex Oil Refinery which is now closed. It now functions as an bulk fuels import terminal to supply imported fuel for Australian customers. Refined petrol is piped to the other side of Botany Bay in an underwater pipeline. The Kurnell Desalination Plant, opened in 2010, now provides much of the rest of Sydney with an alternative water supply. It has been criticised on environmental grounds (greenhouse gases and impact of large amounts of deoxygenated brine), and was shelved, but was resumed after the March 2007 NSW state elections. Continued widespread protest by residential, environmental, and community groups was declared to be irrelevant. Immediate work began on a pipeline under Botany Bay to carry desalinated water to northern suburbs and the size of the desalination plant was doubled. The water supply of Kurnell is supplemented with bore water. Total water stored in the Sydney catchment was at a low of 36.9% on 7 June 2007 but rainfall increased volume stored to 64% as of 7 February 2008,Water storage and supply reports – Sydney Catchment Authority before reaching over 98% capacity in March 2012.8 March 2012 Water storage and supply reports – Sydney Catchment Authority ==Transport== Transdev NSW operates bus route 987 Kurnell to Cronulla via North Cronulla. ==Sport and recreation== Kurnell is home to the mighty Stingrays JRLFC, one of the Shire's favourite rugby league clubs. Green hills Skatepark is located in Kurnell on Captain Cook Drive. It consists of a small and large bowl and street sections. Triathlons are held in Kurnell annually. There are running tracks through Botany Bay National Park, as well as running along the beach and swimming in the netted area of Silver Beach. This location also offers fishing, sailing, scuba diving and windsurfing activities. There is a free shuttle bus service during whale watching season, departing from the parking area of the office of the National Park. Boat Harbour Beach is the location of a 4WD park. Access can be gained via Captain Cook Drive. People are permitted to drive on the beach with their 4WDs. An entry fee is required and one may drive along the beach for at least two kilometres. ==Gallery== File:Kurnell Flags.JPGKurnell flag masts at sunset File:Kurnell Sutherland.JPG Sutherland's monument Image:Kurnell Rocks 1.JPGKurnell sandstone cliffs, view towards Pacific Ocean Image:Kurnell Banks.JPGSir Joseph Banks Memorial Image:Kurnell panoramio.jpgCliff and Pacific ocean view ==References== Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:Kurnell Peninsula Category:Botany Bay Category:Sutherland Shire ","title":"Kurnell, New South Wales"},{"id":"2581910","text":"Kyeemagh ( ) is a suburb in southern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia.

Prior to European settlement it was part of the lands of the Cadigal people. The name of the suburb was adopted from the name of the Polo Ground established in the area in 1929 (Sydney Morning Herald 4 July 1929 p15). To provide better access to the ground from the north a new bridge was constructed over the Cook's River (Sydney Morning Herald 28 June 1930 p20). The new polo ground was also used for playing cricket.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/16805913 In the 1920s the area was known as North Brighton. A map of the area showing the existing streets was included in the Commonwealth Electoral Rolls of that period. The area between the Cooks River and Georges River was originally known as Seven Mile Beach. It was changed to Lady Robinson’s Beach in 1874 to honour Governor Sir Hercules Robinson’s wife.

John Goode had property in West Botany Street, from which he built a private road to Seven Mile Beach, as Lady Robinsons Beach was known then. Goode Street was named in his honour, but this later became Bestic Street.

Maps in Commonwealth Electoral Rolls show no development in the area in 1909 (Lang/Rockdale) or 1915(Illawarra/Rockdale). Maps in the 1925 and 1928 Rolls (Barton/Rockdale) show a very dense, cramped settlement, Filby Estate, between Goode Street and the bay. Adair Street and Annie Street lie east from Goode Street. Other streets include Coy, Derby, Henry and William Streets. There appear to be numerous other lanes and walking tracks in the settlement. None have persisted. This settlement was replaced by a larger, more sparsely-populated suburb named Kyeemagh. The area was served by a bus route between the shopping centres of Rockdale and Brighton-Le Sands. ==Landmarks== thumb thumb Kyeemagh is located on the southern bank of the Cooks River and the eastern bank of Muddy Creek. Lady Robinson Beach and Cook Park run along the eastern border. A small group of shops is located in Bestic Street near General Holmes Drive.

Latty's Pleasure Grounds, the Butterfly Hall, Hollywood Park and the Lansdowne Reserve were popular ventures which fringed the river and lakes system. The amusement parks were struggling by the time of the Great Depression and eventually the land that they occupied was acquired by the council for public reserves.Book of Sydney Suburbs, p.148 It is a little-known fact that the first games of Rugby League football in Australia, in early 1908, were trial games that took place in Lansvale, at Latty's Pleasure Grounds. This was before the first official competition games tookplace at venues closer to the City of Sydney, and well before professional Rugby League clubs came to the further western suburbs of Sydney, such as Parramatta, Canterbury-Bankstown and Western Suburbs. The suburb developed in the 1950s when the peripheral areas of Bankstown municipality assumed identities of their own. One popular housing estate is known as River Heights, where stylishly designed houses with every modern detail and a luxurious finish have been built. A local landmark is Lansdowne Bridge, a sandstone bridge built between 1834 and 1836, designed and supervised by David Lennox. The bridge is listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, 1981, p.2/24 Magic Kingdom was an amusement park that operated in Lansvale from the 1970s to the 1990s. == Heritage listings == Lansvale has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Hume Highway: Lansdowne Bridge ==People== According to the 2016 census, Lansvale had a population of 2,570 people with a median age of 39, which was slightly higher than the national median age of 38. About half of these people were born in Australia (49.2%), with the other most common countries of birth being Vietnam (21.4%), New Zealand (1.9%), China (excludes SARs and Taiwan) (1.9%), Cambodia (1.8%) and Lebanon (1.6%). The majority of people spoke a language other than English at home (62.0%), with Vietnamese (31.1%), Arabic (7.0%), Cantonese (3.9%), Khmer (2.0%) and Mandarin (1.8%) forming the top responses for languages spoken at home. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 23.4%, Buddhism 21.5% and No Religion 17.1%. ==Housing== As at the 2016 census, Lansvale had a total of 756 occupied private dwellings, of which 96.0% were separate houses, 2.2% were semi- detached dwellings, 0.7% were flats or apartments and 1.1% were other dwellings. Of these occupied private dwellings, 38.7% were owned outright, 35.9% were owned with a mortgage and 21.1% were rented. ==See also== * Magic Kingdom, Sydney ==References== Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:City of Fairfield ","title":"Lansvale, New South Wales"},{"id":"2581947","text":"Colditz is a British television series co-produced by the BBC and Universal Studios and screened between 1972 and 1974. at the Internet Movie Database The series deals with Allied prisoners of war imprisoned at the supposedly escape- proof Colditz Castle when designated Oflag IV-C during World War II, and their many attempts to escape captivity, as well as the relationships formed between the various nationalities and their German captors. Colditz was created by Brian Degas working with the producer Gerard Glaister, who went on to devise another successful BBC series dealing with the Second World War, Secret Army. Technical consultant for the series was Major Pat Reid, the real British Escape Officer at Colditz. One of the locations used in filming was Stirling Castle. ==Characters== ===British=== *Lieutenant Colonel John Preston (Jack Hedley) - Senior British Officer, Colonel Preston is the embodiment of British stiff upper lip. He is mostly emotionless, intelligent, respected by his troops, and normally rigid in his application of principles. He gets along quite well with the accommodating Kommandant, whom he respects and is adept with in negotiating. His only real sources of passion are recollections of his time in the trenches in World War I and his wife Caroline, whom he married late and had to leave behind to go to war. *Captain Pat Grant (Edward Hardwicke) - Captain Grant is the first British escape officer in Colditz. He is mild-mannered and mostly level-headed. He often serves as an arbiter between his fellow officers' passion and enthusiasm and Colonel Preston's clinical calmness. The fictional Grant resembles Pat Reid, former POW who was the technical advisor for the series. *Flight Lieutenant Simon Carter (David McCallum) - Flight Lieutenant Carter is a pugnacious young RAF officer who enjoys baiting the German guards and is very impatient to escape. He misses his young wife, Cathy, very much, and seeks to return to her. He finds himself frequently in solitary confinement. In the second season, he mellows a bit as he accepts the post of escape officer and is tempered by that responsibility. The fictional Carter resembles the real Colditz inmate Flight Lieutenant Dominic Bruce OBE MC AFM KSG MA RAF, the legendary 'Medium Sized Man' from IX Squadron, who was sent to Colditz after escaping from Castle Spangenberg. Bruce was the author of one of the most celebrated of all escapes from Colditz, the so-called 'Tea Chest' escape, a replica of which was featured in the Imperial War Museum's 'Great Escapes' exhibition. *Captain Tim Downing (Richard Heffer) - Captain Downing is generally the devil's advocate of the group. While he seems to be the most pessimistic of the British contingent, his criticisms are often insightful and valid. His character most closely resembles that of the Public School \\"Officer Class\\" stereotype. He is ambitious, views himself as the second-in-command, and seeks the post of escape officer. He is often at odds with Colonel Preston, whom he challenges quite frequently. He rarely participates in escape attempts himself but provides reliable support for escapees. Downing is portrayed with a handlebar moustache. *Captain George Brent (Paul Chapman) - Captain Brent is the most nervous and least confident of the officers but is capable of having brilliant ideas. He is unfortunately known for the number of times he has bungled escapes or ruined others' chances at escape. He has insomnia, and often worries about the future, generally having a pessimistic outlook on his captivity. However, he has occasionally been extraordinarily brave, such as in the episode \\"Ghosts\\" where he remained holed up in dreadful conditions, voluntarily, for several weeks. An accomplished artist, Brent uses his skilfulness to sketch a likeness of a refuse collector in the episode \\"Court Martial\\" in order to aid and abet an escape attempt by Flight Lieutenant Carrington. He has a weakness for gambling, and at one time lost his house, home to his infirm father, having involved himself in a card school with a notorious card sharp, Flight Lieutenant Collins. Brent is usually portrayed wearing a cricket sweater like the real life Rupert Barry *Lieutenant Dick Player RN (Christopher Neame) - Lieutenant Player is a quiet but determined officer from the Royal Navy. His perfect German and history of living in Germany cause the Germans to suspect he is a spy at first, which causes him a great deal of trouble. Once in Colditz, though, he is a keen and cool escaper, and participates in some of the most daring and fantastic escape attempts of the series. *Pilot Officer Peter Muir (Peter Penry-Jones) - P.O. Muir is a rash officer who has a reputation for not looking before he leaps. Nevertheless, he is a keen member of the escape team. He formed part of Pat Grant's escape team, but was wounded by a gunshot when he and Player were recaptured. *Lieutenant Jordan (Padre) (Donald McDonald) - The Padre is a mild-mannered officer who, in his own words, does \\"not exactly summon a multitude\\" with his tedious sermons. His cloth unfortunately often conflicts with his duty to the war effort, and so Colonel Preston generally keeps him out of any escape plans. At one point he protests this with a quotation from 1 Corinthians, \\"When I became a man I put away childish things\\". Patrick Troughton played \\"Padre\\" in one episode of the first season. *Doc (Geoffrey Palmer) - The Doc is featured in three episodes, most prominently in \\"Tweedledum\\". He is frustrated by the lack of medicines and views the German village doctor as a quack. *Wing Commander George Marsh (Michael Bryant) - A medical orderly and assistant to the British Medical Officer, Marsh is the officer who famously feigned insanity to achieve repatriation. *Lieutenant Page (Ian McCulloch) - Lieutenant Page is an antisocial and violent late addition to the British contingent, who appears to have little knowledge of the air force, despite claiming to be an air force officer. Page is not his real name but the identity of the Lysander pilot who was killed while inserting him into France. This character is a British Secret agent on his thirteenth mission and is known to, and being hunted by, the Gestapo. Suffering from Post Traumatic stress syndrome he sees his identity change as a chance to escape the war and hide out in Colditz, the last place the Gestapo would look for him. *Flying Officer Jimmy Walker (Peter Winter) - An RAF officer who suspects Lieutenant Page is a German spy, picks a fight with him and as a result ends up with injury to his eyes. *Captain George Holland (David Allister) - A member of the escape committee who becomes unstable as he gives up hope from escaping the castle. *Lance Corporal Baker (Alec Wallis) - Colonel Preston's personal NCO who has immense respect for his superior. *Lieutenant Michael Brown (Sean Roantree) - *Captain Walters (Nicholas McArdle) - *Corporal Hopkins (Len Lowe) - *Squadron Ldr. Tony Shaw (Jeremy Kemp) - An aerial reconnaissance pilot and one of the most highly decorated men in the Allied Forces. In addition to which, according to Hauptmann Ulmann, Shaw is also the most decorated person in Colditz, apart from Major Mohn. An academic lecturer before the war, he becomes obsessed with his idea of an escape using a POW built glider. The real Colditz Cock glider was devised and built by RAF pilot, Bill Goldfinch with Jack Best his partner in the construction. *Major Trumpington (Willie Rushton) - A Scottish Commando, captured with two companions during a raid on Boulogne. The German SD intend to implement Hitler's order that all Commandos are to be shot. Despite the best efforts of the SBO, the British escape committee and the Camp Kommandant, Major Trumpington and his two fellow commandos are taken away by the SD for execution but are shot while trying to escape. This episode mirrors the fate of the 'Musketoon' raid commandos who were briefly imprisoned in the solitary confinement cells at Colditz before being shot at Sachsenhausen. Flt Lt Bruce's conversation with the commando leader Capt Black is retold in \\"Operation Musketoon\\" by Stephen Schofield. *Flight Lieutenant Jack Collins (Ray Barrett) - A late and disruptive arrival who introduces a card school into the British quarters. Captain George Brent joins the school and eventually loses very heavily. Owing £1000, Brent loses his house in a game of 'double or quit'. Collins attempts escape by playing cards with Unterfeldwebel Ernst Krueger, a German quartermaster, cheating to make Krueger lose heavily before bribing him for a workers identity disc. The escape attempt is foiled and Collins is moved out of Colditz but not before the Kommandant retrieves and returns all Brent's losses to the SBO. *Lieutenant McDonald (Prentis Hancock). McDonald is portrayed as having a working-class background unlike the private schooled other officers. He is a Scottish commando who receives a letter from his wife informing him she is pregnant by another man. He resolves to escape soon and after initial debating and resistance, is given a place on a French escape plan. He escapes the castle wall and encourages the French escapee to press on without him. Seemingly with a deathwish, McDonald is shot in the wire. The Kommandant reads unposted letters of McDonald's indicating McDonald indeed wanted to die in the escape. McDonald's character has some resemblances to the real life Michael Sinclair. McDonald has red hair as did Sinclair who was nicknamed 'The Red Fox'. Sinclair was the only person killed while escaping from Colditz. However, the nature of Sinclair's fatal escape attempt was very different to that portrayed by McDonald. *Lieutenant James Porteous (Jim Norton) - The Colditz Librarian. Although having made two previous escape attempts whilst in transit, having been confined to Colditz Porteous becomes a somewhat staid and unenthusiastic escaper who appears to be happy to sit out the war. A School Master before the war, Porteous strikes up a friendship with the equally (initially) reticent Sqn Ldr Tony Shaw. *Cathy Carter (Joanna David) - While not an internee, Carter's wife plays a decent- sized role in the series. Reluctant to let her new husband leave in the second episode, she is devastated to learn he has been shot down and worries that he has not survived. When she learns he is at a POW camp, she keeps in touch with him through letters. Good at crosswords and quick on the uptake, Cathy becomes embroiled in a scheme to connect escaping prisoners with the European underground. In this, she resembles Mary Lagan Bruce (the real-life wife of the 'Medium Sized Man' Dominic Bruce), who once sent her husband a silk escaping map (of Northern Germany) supplied to her by MI9 and concealed in the brass button of a uniform she sent him. This map was featured in the Imperial War Museum 'Great Escapes' exhibition and was subsequently donated to the museum of IX Squadron, RAF Marham, by their son, Brendan Bruce. ===American=== *Flight Lieutenant Phil Carrington (Robert Wagner) – Flight Lieutenant Carrington is an American officer who volunteered to serve with the British early in the war. As per the real life Micky Burn, he served as a journalist in Berlin before the war and has an intimate knowledge of Germany and German politics, admits to having had some admiration for National Socialism. Carrington appears to be sensible at first, but he is a maverick, which gets him in trouble with the Germans and the British alike. Carrington becomes involved in an escape attempt with Pat Grant, the character based on real life escapee Pat Reid. In reality the officer who escaped with Reid via Hans Larive's Singen route was Canadian Howard Wardle. In later episodes, Carrington is shown to have switched his commission to the US Army Air Corps, and, in that role, is recaptured and sent to Colditz along with the three characters listed below. *Lieutenant Jim Phipps (Garrick Hagon) – US POW who becomes the central element of an episode when the Germans categorise him as 'Prominente' on the basis of being the son of a US Ambassador. In reality Lieutenant John Winant Jr., was the son of John Gilbert Winant, US ambassador to Britain. *Lieutenant Colonel Max Dodd (Dan O'Herlihy) – Old-school and brash, Colonel Dodd arrives with Major Carrington on his second trip to Colditz, and rapidly becomes the Senior American Officer of that growing contingent. He does not take well to being a prisoner, and often clashes with the Kommandant. Unlike his counterpart Colonel Preston, he is more than willing to take substantial risks with his men in order to accomplish his objectives. In reality the Colonel among the three paratroopers captured in Hungary and sent to Colditz was Colonel Florimund Duke — the oldest American paratrooper of the war. *Captain Harry Nugent (Al Mancini) – arrives with Dodd and the return of Carrington. In reality the two real life paratroops arriving with Florimund Duke in August 1944 were Captain Guy Nunn, and Alfred Suarez. *Lieutenant Colonel Harrity (Ed Bishop) - Commander of the American troops who liberate the castle in the final episode. He offers Preston the chance to get some \\"justice\\", but Preston will have none of it and insists on proper treatment for the Germans. ===French=== *Capitaine André Vaillant (Gerard Paquis) – Capitaine Vaillant is a stereotypical riviera Frenchman who is self- serving, self-righteous, dashing, and a shameless womaniser. *Capitaine Henri Lefevre (Henri Szeps) - *Capitaine Duprez (Guido Adorni) - *Lieutenant Maurice Tailière (Boyd Mackenzie) - *Lieutenant Beausire (Stuart Fell) === German === ====Oflag IV-C==== *Kommandant (Bernard Hepton) - The Kommandant, known only by his forename \\"Karl\\", is a moderate and honourable Oberst (Colonel) of the Wehrmacht. He holds to the old Army ways of respecting enemy officers and adheres to the Geneva Convention to the best of his ability. He has difficulty believing that any authority but the OKW is legitimate, and often finds himself in dilemmas over orders he gets from the Waffen-SS or Reich Security. Fortunately, he has an ally in General Schaetzel, a respected figure in the OKW. With the help of Schaetzel, and Colonel Preston's cooperation, he constantly works to prevent the SS from taking control of the camp. He finds it boring in the camp and can't stand incompetence. When important visitors come round he is usually embarrassed by one prisoner or another. He is aware the British Officers get very restless and hot-headed, but he relies on Colonel Preston to keep them in check. When they do try something he tries to have a shout at Preston, only to find that Preston is made of stern stuff, hardly flinching when he is shouted at and always keeping a straight face; this annoys the Kommandant even more, but he knows there is nothing he can do. He has a young son, Erich, in the Luftwaffe and a wife named Lisa. He worries about Erich, he himself has seen war and fears for his son's safety and that he won't become blood thirsty. He just wishes that everything will run smoothly so that he can get on with his life, and that his son will return home. *Hauptmann Franz Ulmann (Hans Meyer) - Hauptmann Ulmann is the Security Officer at Colditz. A calculating and rather robotic individual most of the time, he takes his job of preventing escapes seriously and is sometimes ill at ease with the Kommandant's lax attitude. He took over early from Oberleutnant Lehr, a young and easygoing officer who was drafted to the front lines and was appalled at the lack of discipline among the security forces. Because of his careful planning and sharp eyes and mind, he is able to avert many escape attempts as well as many attempts of the SS to take over the camp. He seems to have been sent by the OKW specifically to help the Kommandant in these matters. While occasionally he comes up with a brilliant scheme, most of his captures are a result of thoroughness. He develops a warm relationship with Carrington over the course of the series. He believes there is no such thing as an escape-proof prison, but he plans to make security such that the prisoners will struggle anyway. Like the Kommandant, he is a Wehrmacht man who has no love of the SS. Ulmann is largely based on real life Reinhold Eggers who later wrote a book presenting the German side of the story. Eggers' book contains a foreword by a former Dutch POW, Damiaen Joan van Doorninck, who commented, \\"This man was our opponent, but nevertheless he earned our respect by his correct attitude, self-control and total lack of rancour despite all the harassment we gave him.\\" *Major Horst Mohn (Anthony Valentine) - Mohn is an entirely fictional character, who joins at the start of the second series. A paratrooper hero with the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (though the medal shown in the series is the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords), Major Mohn was severely wounded at Stalingrad by a Russian bayonet and served on Hitler's personal staff before coming to Colditz. He is a Nazi Party member in good standing, and very highly connected (although the series does not mention to whom). He constantly finds himself in conflict with the Kommandant, for he holds the philosophy that the war is still going on at Colditz and is frustrated by what he perceives as the treating of prisoners with \\"kid gloves\\". The prisoners loathe him and do whatever they can to foil him or antagonise him at every turn. Unfortunately for them, he is ruthlessly intelligent and occasionally pulls off a devastating capture. Major Mohn is a paratroop officer and his relationship with the SS appears to be fairly chilly. He is visibly upset with the SD orders given at the end of the episode \\"The Guests\\" and seems nervous around the Obergruppenführer and Hauptsturmführer in \\"Very Important Person.\\" It appears that the reason why Major Mohn would prefer to take SS orders unquestioningly than risk SS reprisals is that he appreciates, apparently better than the Kommandant, what the SS is capable of. In contrast to the honourable Kommandant and Ulmann, Mohn is a sinister and villainous character. However his belief in the cause is shaken when he learns that his brother died ignominiously, crushed by a Russian tank. *Lieutenant Anton Lehr (Grahame Mallard) - Lieutenant Lehr is the first Security Officer of Colditz, but in the fourth episode is posted to the front. He is easygoing and cheerful most of the time, although he gets the job done with apparent competence. He is not upset at the posting and looks forward to fighting for his country. In reality Paul Priem was the first Security Officer. Pat Reid described Priem as, \\"the only German with a sense of humour\\". *Major Willi Schaeffer (Michael Gough) - Major Schaeffer is second in command and a friend of the Kommandant. He does not approve of the war. He clashes with Ullmann over his alcohol consumption, and Ullmann warns the Kommandant that his behaviour could cause the SS to take over the camp. *Dr. Starb (Kenneth Griffith) - A very stuffy Major who serves briefly on the camp medical staff. He is irritated at the relaxed discipline of the British and decides to enforce saluting. He is a small, short-tempered man who likes to feel superior. He finds many things irritating and the smallest thing can make him angry. He feels that the prisoners and staff at Colditz are lazy and thick. When he gets Carter court-martialled for failing to salute, the Kommandant has him removed for fear of prisoner reprisals. Dr. Starb was apparently based on a real doctor who served in Colditz and had a prisoner court-martialed for failing to salute. * Unterfeldwebel Ernst Krueger (Leonard Fenton) - The canteen sergeant, has a strong propensity for playing card games in particular three card brag. Involves himself in playing cards with notorious card sharp Flt Lt Jack Collins which consequently results in him compromising his position. Is caught aiding and abetting a planned escape by Collins as a repayment for his losses in the card school and is subsequently transferred to the military prison at Leipzig to await court martial. A popular character with the other members of the garrison, Krueger is found guilty and subsequently shot by a firing squad which results in antagonism between the German guards and certain British prisoners, particularly Collins. * Unterfeldwebel Blatau (Roy Pattison) - An administrative clerk for Hauptmann Ulmann, Blatau prepares the briefing papers which Ulmann uses to thwart an SS takeover of Colditz. * Korporal Henneberg (Gertan Klauber) - A camp guard who professes religious piety by handing out Bibles to prisoners, however his outward persona disguises his true identity as that of a thief and bully. Henneberg begins to steal items from the prisoner’s Red Cross parcels, and his behavior results in him being murdered by Captain Alan Marshall. Aware of the actions of Henneberg, the Kommandant decides to disguise his murder as suicide in order to convince the Gestapo that there was no breach of order or discipline inside Colditz. The Kommandant explains the suicide of Henneberg as a consequence of him becoming melancholy upon receiving news that his (Henneberg’s) son, a serving soldier in the Wehrmacht, had been killed in action on the Eastern Front. ====Oflag VII-C==== *Kommandant (Michael Sheard) - Kommandant of Oflag VII-C. Oberst (Colonel) Reichtleig an archetypal German officer, who does all he can to intimidate the newly arrived British prisoners; pointing out the futility of any attempts to escape.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0544158/characters/nm0790410?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t10 ====Gestapo==== *Brauner (Peter Barkworth) - A chief plain-clothes Gestapo officer of unknown rank, Brauner is the stereotype of the sinister police organisation. He is intentionally intimidating with his precision and cold curiosity. He is not afraid to torture uncooperative subjects of his interrogations, as Phil Carrington discovers the hard way. *Sturmbannführer (Nigel Stock) and Hauptsturmführer (Terrence Hardiman) - The \\"Good Cop, Bad Cop\\" Gestapo team who attempt to determine Player's identity when one of their agents captures him. They seem complete opposites, an angry, loud-mouthed pompous grumpy old man and a calm, helpful, kind vegetarian. But in private, it is revealed, they are just as bad as each other: sly, sneaky and cruel. ====SS==== *Obergruppenführer Berger (David King) - Obergruppenführer Gottlob Berger was the real-life SS commander who took over the Leipzig/Colditz area late in the war and was in charge of the removal of the Prominente from Colditz. He is portrayed in the series as a boisterous but unyielding individual for whom everyone holds a measure of fear, even Major Mohn. *Hauptsturmführer Schankel (John Pennington) - Schankel is a yes-man who puts up with the patronising attitude of his superior officer with a smile. ====Miscellaneous==== *Baumann (Ralph Michael) - The civilian lawyer, sympathetic to prisoners and intent on imposing the letter of German law, who agrees to take Carter's case against Dr. Starb. *Erich (Martin Howells) - Erich, the son of the Kommandant, is a Luftwaffe officer in his early twenties. He is anxious to fly for the Luftwaffe, despite the deep concern of his father and mother. Much of the angst of the series centres on the Kommandant's worry that he will not return home. *Graf Paul von Eissinger (John Quentin) - Graf Eissinger is a contact of Player's father, who was a diplomat in Germany before the war. He is apparently wealthy and well- connected. He broke his back years ago when his horse fell on him. He had it shot dead. He regretted this later, because due to his broken back (which would not mend) he did not have to go to war. Although he is willing to help identify Player, he has the ulterior motive of using Player in a conspiracy to overthrow Hitler. Player turns this down and is sent to the PoW camp. *Gerda (Sarah Craze) - Gerda is the young German organist at the Colditz town church. She falls for the dashing Capitaine Vaillant and helps him to escape, feeling for him as she does for her brother who is a POW in Russia. == Episodes == === Series 1 === { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - ! style=\\"width:20px;\\" # !!

Exception for dramatic points include the Kommandant's son, Colonel Preston's wife and mother and the completely fictional Major Mohn who appears in series two. While there is not a direct one-to-one relationship between the real and televised characters, most of the televised characters are loosely based on one or several actual persons. The most obvious are Pat Grant (Pat Reid) and Hauptmann Ulmann (Reinhold Eggers).

It is north of the suburb of Campbelltown and is part of the Macarthur region. ==History== The name Leumeah recognises both early settler John Warby, who called his farm Leumeah, and the Tharawal people who originally inhabited the area. It means \\"Here I rest\\" and comes from the Tharawal language. Clans of the Tharawal roamed over a wide area from Botany Bay to the Shoalhaven River and inland to Campbelltown. They lived a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle, eating local foods (bush tucker) such as kangaroo, fish, yams and berries. They made tools out of stones, bones and shells to help them build bark shelters, canoes and possum-skin clothing.Liston, C: Campbelltown: The Bicentennial History, Allen & Unwin, 1988: p.1-2. John Warby was a convict explorer transported to Sydney on the Pitt in February 1792. In 1802, he was given the job of protecting the cattle roaming free in the Cowpastures area, as the area south west of Sydney was then known. He befriended the Tharawals and learnt some of their language. In 1816, he was granted at what is now Leumeah where he built his house, a barn and stables. The barn still stands as part of the Colonial Motor Inn. In 1887, a railway station was built in the area. Originally, it was named Holly Lea after the property of a local politician but local opposition swiftly got the name changed to Leumeah. In 1926, a substantial amount of land was released as a sub-division although the Great Depression deferred substantial growth in the area until after World War II. Subdivision continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s and in 1969, the suburb was formally named Leumeah. The first Campbelltown North Post Office opened on 16 September 1960 and was renamed Leumeah from 1961. The streets of Leumeah are named after famous dams, lakes of NSW, explorers and pioneer farmers. Continuing the theme from the suburb's own naming, Campbelltown Stadium, home of the Wests Tigers rugby league team, was originally called Orana Park after an aboriginal word for \\"welcome\\". == Heritage listings == Leumeah has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Holly Lea Road: Holly Lea and Plough Inn ==Commercial area== Leumeah shopping centre has an IGA supermarket, Australia Post and many local shops within walking distance of Leumeah Train Station, which is located on O'Sullivan Road and Wests Leagues Club on Old Leumeah Road.

The suburb was more religious than the country as a whole with greater numbers of Roman Catholics (29%), Anglicans (26%) and Muslims (4%) and fewer non-religious people (11%) than the national figures. There were a number of small groups of people from non-English speaking backgrounds including Arabic (3%), Filipino (1%), Hindi (1%), Samoan (1%) and Spanish (1%). Most families were couples with children (46%) although there was a slightly higher than average number of single families (22%). ==Sport== Campbelltown Stadium (formerly known as Orana Park & before that Alfred Duguid Oval) in Leumeah is one of the three home grounds of the Wests Tigers NRL team.

Lilli Pilli is located 26 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Sutherland Shire. There is also another Lilli Pilli in New South Wales (postcode 2536), located 12 kilometres south of Batemans Bay. ==History== Lilli Pilli was named for the lilly pilly, the native myrtle that grew on the point. Thomas Holt (1811–88) owned most of the land that stretched from Sutherland to Cronulla, including land on the point. In 1840, parish maps also showed that of land on the point were owned by Francis Mitchell. The public school opened in 1957, and celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2007.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , p51 ==Geography== Lilli Pilli is located on the north shore of the Port Hacking estuary. The only adjacent suburbs are Caringbah South, Port Hacking and Dolans Bay. The villages of Maianbar and Bundeena are located on the opposite bank of Port Hacking. Lilli Pilli is surrounded by Gannons Bay, Little Turriel Bay, Port Hacking River and Great Turriel Bay. Lilli Pilli Point is situated at the end of Lilli Pilli Point Road, off Port Hacking Road. Lilli Pilli Point Bushland Reserve overlooks The Royal National Park. This bushland reserve is a great secluded picnic area that is often protected from the wind. A rock ledge runs along the northern point up to Speed Alley. Many fishing spots can be found here, all the way to Little Turriell Bay. ==Commercial area== On the southern- end of Port Hacking road, a small group of shops are located in the adjacent suburb of Port Hacking. These include, \\"The Gum Tree Food Store\\", \\"Vintage Cellars\\", \\"D'lish on port\\", as well as a butcher, a hairdresser, and a beauty shop. However, these shops are located in Port Hacking. After 30 years in business, the Gum Tree Food Store shut its doors for the last time in May 2014. Following its closure, a convenience store was opened in early 2015. However, it has since closed and a bakery is expected to be opened in 2017. There is also a small group of shops located in Port Hacking Road near Lilli Pilli, but technically in Caringbah South. It features an IGA, a patisserie/cafe, a pizzeria, a Thai take-away, and a boutique gift shop. ==Transport== Transdev NSW operates bus route 977 from Lilli Pilli Point to Caringbah and Miranda. ==Schools== * Lilli Pilli Primary School is on Lilli Pilli Point Road. The Lilli Pilli Kindergarten is located nearby in Caringbah. The school has many sporting achievements, including the winning of the PSSA Soccer Division One Cup in 2008. Notable alumni include the Bewes and Adamiak cousins who were consecutive school captains. Lilli Pilli Primary School ==Sport and recreation== On The western side of Lilli Pilli Point Reserve there are some public baths and a fishing jetty. The baths are deep salt water baths that may be used by anyone that wishes to swim in the Port Hacking River protected by a net. There is a 20-metre hole just outside the baths where many fish swimming down river seem to gather and feed. The channel provides opportunities for catching fish on the changing tide. At low tide the channel can be swum and the sand bank can be walked on, almost the other side. Locals take their dogs across for play but are always careful about the rising tide which can pose problems if not watched.

Coordinates on world : 40°27′35″N 39°28′40″E ==History== Örümcek Forest in Gümüşhane Zigana Torul in Gümüşhane Highway to Gümüşhane city center Santa Ruins in Gümüşhane It is suggested that the ancient Thia ( in Greek, a settlement of Roman, Late Roman and Byzantine periods) was located 4 miles west of modern Gümüşhane, in modern Beşkilise. In Byzantine period, there was a town named Tzanicha or Tzantzakon ( in Byzantine Greek) means land of Zan / Laz people, possibly located to the west of Gümüşhane.Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World: Map by Map directory, p.1237.Procopius of Caesarea, Περί Κτισμάτων, book C, 7. Around 840 AD, the area was included in the new Roman (Byzantine) province of Chaldia (Χαλδία). It was later ruled by the Byzantine Empire of Trebizond. During Ottoman years, the sanjak of Gümüşhane fell under the administration successively Rum Province, Erzurum Province and Trabzon Province, and was divided into four kazas: Gümüşhane, Torul (capital city Ardassa), Şiran (Cheriana), and Kelkit (Keltik). The sanjak in which Gümüşhane was situated at some stage comprised 37 mines of argentiferous lead and six copper mines. There is no evidence that these mines were in use during Byzantine times. As for the name of the city during the Ottoman period, Greek-speaking population was also using the name Gümüşhane (Γκιμισχανά and Κιουμουσχανά) but, in the first decades of 19th century, the hellenized form Argyrópolis (Αργυρόπολις, from argyros \\"silver\\" and polis \\"city\\") was established.Terezakis Yorgos, Diocese of Chaldia (Ottoman Period), Encyclopaedia of the Hellenic world, Asia Minor. The Arghyropolis belonged to the Diocese of Chaldie (145 communities, 77,845 inhabitants). During the 1914-1918 Persecution of Greeks, the Turkish authorities boycott the Christians. The boycott deprived the Christians of all they possessed and reduced them to absolute poverty. The organizer of the boycott was the Djemal Azmi, Vali of Trebizonde, under whose orders were the Governor of Arghyropolis and others. In the sterile region of Argliyropolis the distress was great, because the inhabitants were entirely dependent for their existence on their local trade, and that from Russia. General mobilization was also among the causes conducive to the ruin of the Greek speaking communities, for the male inhabitants who supported their families were taken away from their homes. The Turkish officers treated the Greek speaking population in a brutal way, making many Greekophones to desert. This was the situation before the Russian advance. The Russian advance gave rise to a fresh outburst of fanaticism against the Greek element, the Turks from Turkish villages plundered the Christian villages of the region. During the Turkish retreat, the Turks pillaged many Greekophone villages of the region, the inhabitants took to the mountains and their property was plundered. Later on the retreat of the Russians, the Turks returned and the few inhabitants that remained in these villages, deprived of all resources and left to die of hunger. ==Geography== Gümüşhane is surrounded by high mountains, Zigana- Trabzon Mountains to the north, Çimen Mountains to the south, Giresun Mountains to the west and Pulur, Soğanlı Mountains to the east. Trekking is popular sport is at these mountains. Mount Zigana has a ski center on it and it is a well known tourist destination for winter sports. Abdal Musa Peak (3331 m.) is the highest peak within it. The main trees in the forests are Scotch pine and fir, and there are many animals and birds in the area. There are many lakes such as Karanlık Göl, Beş Göller, Artebel Gölü, Kara Göller which are at the peak of Gavurdağı Mountain, and are preserved as natural parks. All these mountains compose 56% of the area of Gümüşhane province. ===Climate=== Gümüşhane has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: Dsb on the border Dfb) with cold and snowy winters and warm summers. In the height of summer; July and August, temperatures at midday usually surpass 28 °C, summer nights tend to become very cool due to the high elevation of Gümüşhane, and in winter temperatures usually plummet to -10 °C and even go as low as -20 °C occasionally. ==Historic Sites : Architecture and Archaeology== Old Gümüşhane city, 1910s Ottoman era postcard Gümüşhane has a rich historical background so there are many historical places, mosques, churches, castles. The ancient city of Satala in the modern village of Sadak was the most important military camp of the ancient Roman Empire in the east. This place was ruled by the Colchians, Hittites, Assyrians, Urartu, Persians, Pontic Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. Today, rests of the Sadak village is protected by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. In addition, Süleymaniye Mosque is in the previous Gümüşhane settlement and it was commissioned by the Ottoman sultan Süleyman the Magnificent. Küçük Mosque and Çit Village Mosque are some of other popular mosques in the city. Besides, there are numerous churches within Gümüşhane. Santa Çakallı, Santa Terzili, Kalur Rock, Samamoni, and Theodor Churches are some examples of historical churches in Gümüşhane.Gümüşhane (en) Gümüşhane historical places (tr) During the medieval period one of the most important guardians of the road connecting Trabzon to Erzincan was the Byzantine fortress located about northwest of modern Gümüşhane. An archaeological and historical assessment of this site as well as a scaled plan were published in 1985.[13] The impressive circuit walls and defenses are clearly evident at the accessible west approach to the lofty outcrop. In addition to several rooms and cisterns, the castle has two chapels; the easternmost was once covered by a dome.Robert W. Edwards, “The Garrison Forts of the Pontos: A Case for the Diffusion of the Armenian Paradigm,” Revue des Études Arméniennes 19, 1985, pp.207-211, pls.39b-42b. ==Natural environment== Ecel Rocks in Gümüşhane Kürtün village in Gümüşhane Mountains of Gümüşhane There are numerous large and small caves which owe their formation to the geology - particularly the limestones - of Gümüşhane, including Alicli Agil Cave, Arili Cave, Altınbaşı Cave, Asarönü Ören Cave, Kartalkaya Cave, Ayiini Cave, K.Ardiçli Cave, Karçukuru Cave, Ardiçli Cave, Tepekli Cave, Uçbacalı Cave, Buz Cave and Ikisu Cave.http://www.visiontours.com.au/index.php/tourism-and- travel/activities/caves/ Retrieved 25 April 2017. A distinctive local wildflower, bearing purple blossoms in Spring and frequently to be found growing in rock crevices around the mouths of Gümüşhane's many caves, is a member of the nightshade genus Physochlaina : Physochlaina orientalis - a plant rich in medicinally valuable tropane alkaloids of the type found also in belladonna.Flora of Turkey and the East Aegean Islands ed. Davis,P.H., pub. University of Edinburgh Press 1978, reprinted 1997, 2001 and 2008. The cave in Gümüşhane most visited by tourists is the long Karaca Cave, popular because of its speleothems (= dripstone formations), including stalagmites, stalactites, columns and travertine pools. It is a fossil cave located between Torul and Gümüşhane, in which the lime-rich water percolating through fissures in the roof has slowly built up calcite structures of remarkable complexity. Other geological features of Gümüşhane include the numerous plateaux commanding views of the forested areas which surround them. These include the Zigana, Taşköprü, Artabel, Şiran and Kalis plateaux, which form fitting sites for the Summer festivals which are held there annually. ==Cuisine== Siron is a traditional dish in Gümüşhane Many native tourists participate in these festivals - not only for entertainment's sake, but also to shop for regional delicacies. Pestil and köme are renowned desserts of Gümüşhane, made from mulberries, honey, hazel nuts, walnuts and milk. In addition to köme and pestil, rosehips, apples, and walnuts are notable local foods put to use in the many different desserts which are numbered among the regional specialities of Gümüşhane. Nor is the town's rich food culture restricted to sweetmeats : mantı, lemis, erişte, borani, kuymak, evelek, dolması and siron feature among the savoury dishes local to Gümüşhane.Traditional food ==Ethnic groups== === Pontic Greek influence === The local residents of Gümüşhane region were Laz people also called Chan (Tzan; by Georgians) i.e. Chald (Halt; by themselves). Just after the fall of Trebizond (1461) and the town soon became a home for miners. Sultan Murad ΙΙΙ (1574–1595) appears to have granted extra privileges to the chief miners and the town prospered and soon became a centre of Hellenism. At the time, it had 60,000 residents. Its trade was increasing and the whole province of Chaldia was on the rise. Another example of its development was that they minted coins with the name Kioumous-hane on them. Another example was the settlement of chief mining families there such as the Sarasites, the Karatsades, the Stavracoglous, the Kalimachidises, the Grigorantons and others. There were also more jewellery shops opening, as well as more hagiography and other arts in the region. The rise in wealth and abundance soon brought positive changes to the communities. From the beginning of the 18th century new schools were opening, and from 1723 the Frontistirion (Greek Tuition Centre) of Argyropolis was in full operation. The tuition centre became an educational institution and spiritual centre of the region. In 1650 the diocese was elevated to archdiocese status, and hundreds of churches and temples were built. New mines rich in minerals were discovered in Ak-dag Maden and Argoni, which resulted in a large exodus of miners from Argyropolis to the new mines. The further dramatic fall in population followed the Russo-Turkish War of 1829–30, when many Greek speaking Pontians of the area collaborated with or welcomed the Russian army that occupied the area. So as to escape likely Turkish reprisals, the majority of the Greekophone Pontic population followed the Russian army as it withdrew back into Georgia and Southern Russia, many settling there and joining preexisting communities of Caucasus Greeks that had moved eastwards between the fall of the Empire of Trebizond in 1461 and the 1801 Russian annexation of Georgia, including another community of Pontic Greekophone miners who had settled in Lore, then Kingdom of Kartli of Georgia in 1778 invited by the king Heraclius II of Georgia. Some of the Pontic Greekophone mining families of Gumuşhane also settled in Nicomedia, Mesopotamia and other mining regions, from Tiflis (Tbilisi) to as far as Ak-Dağ and the Taurus. During those years tension between the Christian Greekophones and Muslim population was also growing due to the Greek Revolution and the public reversion to Greek Orthodoxy of many of the Stavriotes, Pontic Greekophones who had superficially adopted Turkish Islam in the early Ottoman period but who had remained crypto-Christian in private. Who were the crypto-Christians?, Crypto-Christians of the Trabzon Region of Pontos During those confusing and troubling times many people became benefactors of Argyropolis, such as the Sarasite family and the influential teacher Georgios Kyriakidis. Kyriakidis identified the need to extract large sums of money from the churches of Saint George, Saint Theodore, Τίμιου Σταυρού and Παναγίας for the educational needs of the town. Sale of church property as well as donations and consecrations resulted in the erection of a new school at the Frontistirion of Argyropolis, a school which was to operate until the Exchange (1923). The Frontistirion comprised a three- grade high school, a seven-grade primary school including scholarship classes, and a six-grade girls' school, as well as a carpet-making technical school. Another public building was the library, the Educational Society Kyriakidis, as well as the Metropolis of Chaldia. The Argyropolitans therefore are very much regarded as having some of the best resources in education, due mainly to their economic rise as a result of mining.Özhan Öztürk, Pontus: Antik Çağ’dan Günümüze Karadeniz’in Etnik ve Siyasi Tarihi Genesis Publishing. Ankara, 2011 pp. 695-701 After the turmoil and ethnic strife (1914–1923), a few ethnic Pontic Greeks managed to flee to Greece. They settled in the Macedonia region of Northern Greece. A small group which settled in Naousa brought precious items with them from their churches in town, as well as items from the library of the Frontistirion, including rare manuscripts and books. This collection is still in use today and is considered a prized asset of Naousa. The town was occupied by the Russian army on July 20, 1916, but the Russians withdrew on February 15, 1918, after the fall of the czar. After the exchange (1923) no Orthodox remained in the region. ==Economy== Historically, Gümüşhane had mulberry tree plantations for sericulture. ==Notable natives== * Hasan Fehmi (Ataç) (1879, Gümüşhane - 1961), Deputy during the Ottoman Empire and after declaration of republic first Minister of Agriculture and Minister of Finance of Turkey * Nihal Atsız (1905, İstanbul - 1975), Prominent Turkish nationalist writer, born into a family from Gümüşhane * Bahriye Üçok (1919, Trabzon - 1990), Turkish academic of theology, left-wing politician and writer, born into Ataç family of Gümüşhane * Tarık Akan (1949, İstanbul - 2016), Turkish film actor and producer, born into a family from Gümüşhane * Beren Saat (1984, Ankara - ), Turkish actress, born into a family from Gümüşhane * Turgay Erdener (1957, Gümüşhane - ), Composer and teacher * Aydın Doğan (1936, Kelkit - ), Entrepreneur and businessmen * Mehmet Scholl (1970, Karlsruhe - ), German football manager and former player, born into a family from Torul * Hikmet Temel Akarsu (1960, Gümüşhane - ), Turkish novelist, short-story writer, satirist and playwright * Yusuf Güney (1984, Trabzon - ), Turkish singer, born into a family from Kelkit * Armağan Çağlayan (1966, İstanbul - ), Turkish television producer and lawyer, born into a family from Gümüşhane on his maternal side. * Saint George Karslidis (1901, Tsalka - 1959) Greek Elder * Georgios Kandilaptis (1881, Gümüşhane - 1971), Greek scholar, journalist, teacher and writer * Ertuğrul Sağlam (1969, Zonguldak - ), Turkish football manager and former player, born into a family from Torul * Ziya Doğan (1961, Köse - ), Turkish football manager * Tolga Zengin (1983, Hopa - ), Turkish football goalkeeper, born into a family from Torul * Yunus Mallı (1992, Kaseel - ), Turkish footballer, born into a family from Şiran * Mithat Demirel (1978, Berlin - ), German former professional basketball player of Turkish descent. ==References== ==Literature== *The Encyclopedia of Pontian Hellenism.

All employees of the three companies subsequently became POWERGRID employees. ===POWERTEL=== POWERGRID's telecom company, POWERTEL, operates a network of 47,735 Kilometers and points of presence in 688 locations across India. ==Transmission network failures== About 2:35 a.m on 30 July 2012, the Northern Region Grid, which provides power to nine states in northern India including Delhi, experienced a widespread outage due to a grid disturbance. POWERGRID and POSOCO began work immediately to restore power. By 8:00 a.m. essential services had been restored, with 60 percent of the normal Northern Region Grid load restored by 11:00 a.m. Power supply was then restored progressively and by 12:30 p.m. power was extended to most of the cities and towns through POWERGRID substations. The Northern Region Grid was brought back to normalcy to meet the demand of about 30 GW at 7:00 p.m. On 31 July 2012, the Northern Region Grid collapsed a second time, hours after the power supply had been restored to the northern region following the previous day's disruption. Eastern transmission lines also failed, disrupting power supply in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, West Bengal, Assam and Punjab, among other states. After the power failures, then-Power Minister Veerappa Moily said that transmission grids would be independently audited in three months to ensure that the grids were fail-safe. ==See also== * India Sri Lanka HVDC Interconnection * Talcher–Kolar HVDC system * Chandrapur back-to-back HVDC converter station * Vizag back-to-back HVDC converter station * The Electricity Act, 2003 * Electricity sector in India ==Notes== == External links == * Power Grid Corporate Web-Site * Grid maps of southern region Category:Electric power transmission system operators in India Category:Converter stations Category:Electric power transmission infrastructure in India Category:Ministry of Power (India) Category:Government-owned companies of India Category:Companies based in New Delhi Category:Energy companies established in 1992 Category:Indian companies established in 1992 Category:NIFTY 50 Category:1992 establishments in India Category:BSE SENSEX ","title":"Power Grid Corporation of India"},{"id":"2581981","text":"Linley Point is a small peninsular suburb located on the Lower North Shore of Sydney , in the local government area of the Municipality of Lane Cove, in the state of New South Wales, Australia.

It is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. Llandilo is a small semi-rural outcrop between two creeks. A southern part of Llandilo was incorporated into an expansion of the suburb of Jordan Springs on 22 November 2019. ==History== Llandilo is named after the Welsh town of Llandeilo. ===Aboriginal culture=== Prior to European settlement, what is now Llandilo was home to the Mulgoa people who spoke the Darug language. They lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle governed by traditional laws, which had their origins in the Dreamtime. Their homes were bark huts called 'gunyahs'. They hunted kangaroos and emus for meat, and gathered yams, berries and other native plants. Shortly after the arrival of the First Fleet in Australia in 1788, an outbreak of smallpox decimated the local indigenous communities and made it easier for settlers to dispossess them of their land. ===European settlement=== The first land grant in the area was made to Samuel Terry in 1818. He named the area Terry Brook. By the 1860s it was known as Llandilo after a Welsh town. While the landholdings have reduced in size down to around one or , the area is still primarily rural as it has been for the past 200 years or so.

The town is located about south of Paris and east of Orléans in the Gâtinais. Montargis is the second largest city in the Loiret, after Orléans. It is near a large forest, and contains light industry and farming, including saffron. Due to its numerous canals and bridges, Montargis sometimes bills itself as the \\"Venice of the Gâtinais.\\" Though quite modern, it retains a medieval charm in its downtown area. ==History== Though the town is known to date to ancient times, during the Renaissance fanciful etymologies were invented to account for the place name Montargis, whether as mons argi, Mount of Argus, the place where the jealous goddess Juno charged Argus Panoptes with guarding her rival Io, or connected with the chieftain Moritas mentioned by Julius Caesar, in his Gallic Wars. Numerous Gallo-Roman artifacts have been found in the area, and many are in the town's Gâtinais Museum. Later, the town was a stronghold of the Frankish king Clovis I. Montargis was originally a seat of the house of Courtenay, who fortified a château on a hill overlooking the town. The town was ceded to the king of France in 1188. In the 14th and 15th centuries, it was a royal residence. ===Hundred Years' War=== In 1427, during the Hundred Years' War, the Earl of Warwick besieged the town with artillery, beginning bombardment on July 15. During the siege, the residents of Montargis sabotaged the dikes of numerous ponds in the district, flooding and drowning many of the besieging Plantagenets. On September 5, a French force of 1600 men broke the siege, led by Jean de Dunois and La Hire, commanders who would go on to lead the army of Joan of Arc. This marked the first important victory by the army of King Charles VII in the war, gratefully remembered by Charles later. After being wounded in an unsuccessful attempt to besiege Paris in September 1429, Joan of Arc passed through Montargis on her way to Gien. After the war, Charles VII, rewarded the town for its valor in the war by granting it various privileges. In 1490, his later successor Charles VIII officially declared the town Montargis Le Franc (\\"Montargis the tax-free\\"). This title is abbreviated as \\"MLF\\" in the official coat of arms (seen in the seal shown here). This privilege was renewed by his successors, and Montargis remained free of taxes for three centuries, until it was revoked during the French Revolution. ===Sixteenth century=== In 1528, King Francis I granted the town to his sister-in-law, Renée of France, Duchess of Ferrara and daughter of King Louis XII. After her husband Ercole II, the Duke of Ferrara died in 1559, Renée resided at Montargis. She sheltered there Protestant Huguenots fleeing from persecutions in Paris and elsewhere during the 16th century French Wars of Religion. ==Dog of Montargis== The best-known legend of Montargis is that of the \\"Dog of Montargis.\\" In the story, Aubry de Montdidier, a courtier of King Charles V of France, was murdered around 1400 in a forest near Montargis by Robert Macaire, an envious knight. After his death, Mondidier's dog showed a remarkable hostility to Macaire. King Charles decreed a trial by combat in the town between the dog and Macaire, who was armed with only a cudgel. After the dog won the battle, Macaire confessed to the crime and was hanged. A dramatic bronze statue of this fight is in the courtyard of the Girodet Museum in central Montargis, and the contest is depicted in a stained glass window in a local church as well. The story was the subject of a 19th-century melodrama, Le Chien de Montargis, ou la Forêt de Bondy, that held the stage for years in Paris and was performed in English and German translations. ==Industry== In the 1880s, a rubber factory was built in Châlette, a district of Montargis. It today employs 2000 workers to produce tires and parts for vehicles and appliances. ==Culture== Pralines, the crunchy confection made from almonds in cooked sugar, were first confected in Montargis in the time of Louis XIII. The original shop is still in business on Place Mirabeau.http://www.mazetconfiseur.com/english Mazet Confectioners The Baron Palamède de Charlus relates among his many other blandishments that he is the Damouseau de Montargis, in Marcel Proust’s A la Récherche du Temps Perdus. ==Notable people== * Eleanor of Leicester lived in exile as a nun at the abbey in Montargis, and died there in 1275 * Denis Jamet died there in 1625 * Jeanne-Marie Bouvier de la Motte-Guyon was born here in 1648 * Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson was born here in 1767, the town's art museum is named for him * Madeleine de Roybon d'Allonne (1646-1718), early settler of New France * Louis-Jacques Bresnier (1814–1869), 19th-century orientalist was born in Montargis. * Deng Xiaoping and Zhou Enlai lived in the town's Chinese community in the 1920s * Patricia Petibon was born here in 1970 * Louis Pierre Manuel (1751 – 17 November 1793) was a French writer and political figure of the Revolution. ==Twin towns== Montargis is twinned with: * Greven, Germany * Crowborough, United Kingdom ==References== * INSEE commune file ==External links== * Official website * Pictures of Montargis' forest of Paucourt * Decree of Charles VII granting privileges to Montargis * * Category:Communes of Loiret Category:Subprefectures in France Category:Burial sites of the House of Valois-Orléans Category:Orléanais ","title":"Montargis"},{"id":"2581995","text":"Abdon is an upland village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Abdon and Heath, in the Clee Hills area of English county of Shropshire. ==History== The name Abdon derives from 'Ab(b)a's estate' (Old English personal name Ab(b)a + tūn).

Like many in the South Wales Valleys, it was once a coal-mining village. ==History== The village of Abernant was established in 1801, as a direct result of the founding of the Abernant Ironworks by the Tappington family. In 1819 it was taken over by Rowland Fothergill, and later passed to his nephew, Richard Fothergill. Among the first houses to be built were those at Little Row and Moss Place. The streets of Abernant reflect the importance of industry in the area in the 19th century, with streets named Engineer's Row, Foreman's Row and Collier's Row etc. Abernant Railway Station opened in 1854 along the Vale of Neath branch line to Merthyr Tydfil. For some time the village was nicknamed The Trap, possibly because the Aberdare Iron Company Tramroad crossed the Parish Road to Abernant. The Marquis of Bute maintained a small cottage hospital in the area from 1875 until World War I, which was later used as the Trap Surgery until it was demolished in 1980. A number of collieries operated in Abernant, many originally operated by the Aberdare Iron Company. The collieries were: Werfa No.1 (1846–1910); Werfa No. 2 (1879–1910); Mountain Pit (1866–1927); Blaennant Colliery (circa 1840–1927); Forge Pit (1851–1910) and River Level Colliery (circa 1840–1939). In 1896, a flooding disaster occurred at River Level Colliery which killed six colliers. The disaster occurred after it was inundated by water from the abandoned Ysguborwen Colliery. Although the Abedare Iron Company was responsible for the production of much coal in the Abernant area, it was never as well documented as some of the other works in the Rhondda Valley. In December 1912, the village was subject to extensive flooding, the Abernant Road in particular. In the mid-1980s, NCB reported that they intended to reopen a mine in Abernant and exploit anthracite reserves. The Abernant pit was shut down in 1988. ==Landmarks== Abernant House was built by James Birch, cofounder with Jeremiah Homfray of Abernant Ironworks. In 1819 the ironworks were sold and the house was passed to Rowland Fothergill and later his nephew Richard Fothergill. Richard Fothergill was responsible for adding many extensions to the original building and landscaping of the grounds. On March 1, 1892, Emma Talbot of Margam founded the St Michael's Theological College but in 1907 the college moved to Llandaff, Cardiff. Since 1917 Abernant House has been used as the site of Aberdare General Hospital. On September 27, 1929, a fire gutted the main building, destroying its notable interior furnishings too. The hospital later reopened in April 1933, and in 1939 W M Llewellyn funded the construction of a new maternity ward. ==Religion== The main active churches are: * Bethel is a Baptist chapel opened in 1856 * St Matthew's Mission Church, Church of Wales, opened 1888 There are also defunct places of worship: * Bethesda Independent Chapel (opened 1860, disused by 2004) * Nazareth Calvinistic Methodist Chapel (opened 1860, closed 1965). ==Notable people== *Stuart Cable (1970–2010), the late former drummer of the Stereophonics and broadcaster lived in Abernant for a period. *Elaine Morgan (7 November 1920 – 12 July 2013) lived with her husband and wrote in a bungalow called Noddfa near Little Row, Abernant. ==Gallery== File:Abernant Road c,1900.jpgAbernant, c. 1900.

A soap opera, similar in format to Coronation Street, Empire Road depicted life for the African-Caribbean, East Indian and South Asian residents of a racially diverse street in the city of Birmingham. Cast members included Norman Beaton, Corinne Skinner-Carter, Wayne Laryea, Joseph Marcell, Rudolph Walker and Rosa Roberts. The programme also provided early TV exposure for Julie Walters who appeared in a few episodes. The series was made at BBC Pebble Mill with location work in the Handsworth area of Birmingham. The eponymously named theme song was recorded by Matumbi and also released as a single in 1978. The general premise of the series concerns the day-to-day life of a residential property landlord who also owns a minimarket - where his brother-in-law is a junior partner - and sometimes deals with social concerns of the time, namely race issues, family issues and mixed relationships. Problems that arise are usually solved or at least calmed by the protagonist family's patriarch using reasoning based on his life experience, wisdom and common sense.

It was heavily dependent on the coal industry and the population, as a result, grew rapidly in the late nineteenth century. Most of the industry has now disappeared and a substantial proportion of the working population travel to work in Cardiff and the M4 corridor. Many residents also work in the nearby towns of Aberdare and Pontypridd. ==History== Aberaman, to the south of Aberdare, was an agricultural area until the early nineteenth century. Prior to the industrial revolution, Aberaman was the home of the Mathew family, local gentry who owned land throughout Glamorgan and who came to prominence in the seventeenth century when three members of the family served as High Sheriff of Glamorgan. The family seat was at Aberaman Isha, later known as Aberaman House (and which still exists in 2014 but is much altered). The last of the Mathew family, Edward Mathew, died in 1788 and the estate was broken up after two centuries and divided between his three daughters and their husbands. In 1806, Anthony Bushby Bacon, an illegitimate son of Anthony Bacon, a prominent iron master at Merthyr Tydfil, bought Aberaman House. He shared the Hirwaun ironworks with his brother but proceeded to sell his share to his brother and with the proceeds from the sale, he purchased the Matthews estate at Aberaman, including Aberaman House. Bacon, also known as Anthony Bacon II, did not aspire to be an iron master like his father and, in 1814, sold the entire Cyfarthfa estate, which he alone had inherited, to Richard Crawshay. For the rest of his life he used the Aberaman estate as a summer residence. He died there on 11 August 1827. After his death, it passed to Crawshay Bailey, who owned the ironworks at Nantyglo and Beaufort. Bailey recognised the potential of the rich coal seams of the Aberdare and Rhondda valleys and bought up land in these areas in the 1830s. Amongst the lands he acquired was the Aberaman estate, which he bought from the executors of Anthony Bacon II, together with its mansion, by indenture dated 17 February 1837. It was several years before he began speculating for coal. By 1845, Crawshay Bailey had, in partnership with Josiah John Guest, built the Aberdare Railway and, around this time, the Aberaman Ironworks and a number of collieries associated with it were opened. Bailey remained the owner of the Aberaman Estate but despite the profitability of his colliery activities, the depression in the iron trade (see below) meant that the enterprise did not prove as successful as Bailey had hoped so he decided to sell the Aberaman estate and return to Monmouthshire. He disposed of the entire Aberaman estate including its collieries, ironworks, brickworks and private railway, to the Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Co. by indenture dated 2 February 1867 for the sum of £123,500. Bailey retired to Abergavenny. Around 1843, the valuable steam-coal seams on the Blaengwawr estate began to be exploited by David Davis, Blaengwawr. Davis was a self-made man whose family firm later became one of the most important in the South Wales coal trade, with interests in both the Aberdare and Rhondda valleys. During the second half of the nineteenth century, Aberaman continued to grow southwards. During the early years of the twentieth century the area known as Godreaman became built up, meaning that there was unbroken development between Aberaman and neighbouring Cwmaman, which was a settlement dependent almost wholly on the coal industry. By this time, Lewis Street at the heart of Aberaman village had developed into a small urban and commercial core around the Aberaman Hall and Institute (see below). ==Demography== It can be seen that the industrial developments of the mid-1840s were the catalyst for the growth of Aberaman as an industrial settlement. The earliest housing in the 1840s took the form of a ribbon development southwards from Aberdare along Cardiff Road. In the 1850s, the settlement grew out from Cardiff Road as, amongst others, Curre Street, Holford Street, Gwawr Street and Lewis Street were built. There were also settlements near the collieries, including Incline Row and Bell Place near Aberaman Colliery, and Blaengwawr Row and Blaengwawr Cottages adjacent to Blaengwawr Colliery. John Griffith, in his evidence to the inspectors compiling the 1847 Education Reports reported that Aberaman had only been in existence for eighteen months, yet its population stood at 1200. This figure was expected to increase to 4,800 within a year. Fifty carpenters and eighty masons were reported to be employed in the building of industrial housing. Two contemporary accounts give a vivid description of the conditions prevailing in Aberdare as the area struggled to cope with the population explosion. On 1 December 2016, following The Rhondda Cynon Taf (Communities) Order 2016, the community of Aberaman was split into two new communities, Aberaman North and Aberaman South, which are coterminous with the electoral wards of the same names. ==Industry== === Iron === Aberaman Ironworks was the last ironworks to be opened in the Aberdare Valley. It was established in 1845 by Crawshay Bailey and the first iron was produced in 1847. However the works were not successful. They closed temporarily in 1854 but re-opened the following year. In 1862 it appears that Bailey sought to sell the works for £250,000 but failed to find a buyer. Following Bailey's retirement the works were eventually taken over by the Powell Duffryn Company but were never worked again following their closure in 1866. === Coal === Aberaman Miners' Training Centre, 1951 Crawshay Bailey was also the pioneer of the coal industry at Aberaman, opening the Aberaman Colliery in 1845. This passed for the Powell DuffrynCompany in 1866 after their purchase of the Aberaman Estate. In 1909 the first Mines Rescue Station in South Wales was opened at the Aberaman Colliery and at this time over a thousand men were employed there. The manager of the colliery at this time was E.M. Hann who was a powerful figure in the South Wales coal trade for many years. Powell Duffryn continued to own the colliery until nationalisation in 1947 when it was taken over by the National Coal Board. Aberaman Colliery closed in 1965. ==Government== Aberaman currently comprises two electoral wards, Aberaman North and Aberaman South, for the purposes of electing members to the unitary Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council. Aberaman has formed an electoral ward since the formation of Glamorgan County Council in 1889 and Aberdare Urban District Council in 1894. ==Language== At the start of the twentieth century the vast majority of the inhabitants of Aberaman, many of whom were migrants from rural Welsh counties, were Welsh-speaking. By 2011 the proportion speaking Welsh had fallen to 9.2%. ==Religion== Nonconformist chapels in Aberaman included Gwawr (Baptist), Saron (Independent) and Libanus (Calvinistic Methodist), all of which dated from the growth of the village in the late 1840s. All have now closed. ==Culture== Much of the social life of Aberaman was centred on the imposing Aberaman Hall and Institute in Lewis Street. A campaign to develop a Public Hall and Institute at Aberaman dated from 1892 when a public meeting was held in Saron Chapel. Until that point the chapels had been dominant in public life and the development of a secular hall, in hindsight, could be seen as the beginning of their long decline. Many years elapsed before sufficient funds were raised to begin the building work and the ceremony to lay the foundation stone was held on 2 October 1907, on the site previously occupied by the Aberaman Reading Institute. The hall was officially opened by Keir Hardie MP on 14 June 1909. Designed by an Aberdare architect, Thomas Roderick, and built by John Morgan and Son, the hall's facilities included two billiards rooms, two games rooms, a swimming pool in the basement, Committee Room, a Lending Library and Reference Room, and a Lecture Hall. Its crowning glory was the main auditorium with seating for 1,800 people with a first floor offering additional capacity. Throughout the twentieth century the hall was the social and cultural centre for Aberaman. It was eventually destroyed by fire in November 1994. ==Schools== === Primary schools === *Blaengwawr Primary (Gwawr Street/Cardiff Road) *Oaklands Primary (Maes Y Deri) === Secondary schools === Aberaman was formerly home to Blaengwawr Comprehensive School, a secondary school in the heart of the community. This school was closed, however, at the end of the 2014 school year due to the establishment of Aberdare Community School. == Sport == The local soccer club currently plays in the MacWhirter Welsh League, Division One. The club was formed in 1892 and was a founder member of the Welsh League in the 1902-03 season. Its home ground is at Aberaman Park, situated between the village and nearby Abercwmboi. The striker, Hannah Lewis has scored 475 goals this season. She even scored one in the Ferny. ==Notable people== :See :Category:People from Aberaman * Patrick Hannan, journalist and broadcaster * Arthur Linton, cyclist * Tom Linton, cyclist * Jimmy Michael, cyclist * Alf Sherwood, former footballer ==See also== * Aberaman Athletic F.C. ==References== ==External links== *Aberaman Athletic AFC (Football Club) *St Margaret's Church, Aberaman *Photographs of Aberaman and surrounding area Category:Villages in Rhondda Cynon Taf Category:Former communities of Rhondda Cynon Taf ","title":"Aberaman"},{"id":"2582082","text":"Kingsburgh may refer to: * Kingsburgh, Highland, Scotland * Kingsburgh, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa * Kingsburgh, California, former name of Kingsburg, California, United States * Kingsborough, Queensland, a former mining town in Australia ","title":"Kingsburgh"},{"id":"2582102","text":"Nathan Marcus Adler Chief Rabbi of the British Empire from 1845 to 1890 Lists of Chief Rabbis cover Chief Rabbis, the leaders of the Jewish community in each country.

It considers the processes by which structures, including schemes, rules, norms, and routines, become established as authoritative guidelines for social behavior.Scott, W. Richard 2004. “Institutional theory.” in Encyclopedia of Social Theory, George Ritzer, ed. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. Pp. 408-14 Different components of institutional theory explain how these elements are created, diffused, adopted, and adapted over space and time; and how they fall into decline and disuse. == Overview == In defining institutions, accordings to William Richard Scott (1995, 235), there is \\"no single and universally agreed definition of an 'institution' in the institutional school of thought.\\" Scott (1995:33, 2001:48) asserts that: According to Scott (2008), institutional theory is \\"a widely accepted theoretical posture that emphasizes rational myths, isomorphism, and legitimacy.\\"Scott, W. Richard (2008) Institutions and Organizations: Ideas and Interests. Los Angeles, CA: Sage Publications. Researchers building on this perspective emphasize that a key insight of institutional theory is imitation: rather than necessarily optimizing their decisions, practices, and structures, organizations look to their peers for cues to appropriate behavior. According to Kraft's Public Policy (2007):Kraft's Public Policy: Kraft, Micahel E & Furlong, Scott R Public Policy: politics, analysis, and alternatives (2nd ed). CQ; London : Eurospan [distributor], Washington, D.C, 2007. Institutional Theory is \\"Policy-making that emphasizes the formal and legal aspects of government structures.\\" == Schools of institutional theory == There are two dominant trends in institutional theory: * Old institutionalism * New institutionalism Powell and DiMaggio (1991)DiMaggio, Paul J. and Powell, Walter W. (1991)‘Introduction’. In P. J. DiMaggio and W. Powell (eds.) ‘The New Institutionalism and Organizational Analysis’, pp. 1–38. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. define an emerging perspective in sociology and organizational studies, which they term the 'new institutionalism', as rejecting the rational-actor models of Classical economics. Instead, it seeks cognitive and cultural explanations of social and organizational phenomena by considering the properties of supra- individual units of analysis that cannot be reduced to aggregations or direct consequences of individuals’ attributes or motives. Scott (1995)Scott, W. Richard 1995. Institutions and Organizations. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. indicates that, in order to survive, organisations must conform to the rules and belief systems prevailing in the environment (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983;DiMaggio, Paul J., and Walter W. Powell 1983. “The iron cage revisited: Institutional isomorphism and collective rationality in organizational fields,” American Sociological Review 48:147-60. Meyer and Rowan, 1977Meyer, John W. and Rowan, Brian (1977) ‘Institutionalized organizations: Formal structure as myth and ceremony’. American journal of sociology 83: 340–363.), because institutional isomorphism, both structural and procedural, will earn the organisation legitimacy (Dacin, 1997; Deephouse, 1996; Suchman, 1995Suchman, Mark C. 1995. “Localism and globalism in institutional analysis: The emergence of contractual norms in venture finance.” In The Institutional Construction of Organizations: International and Longitudinal Studies, 39-63, W. Richard Scott, and Søren Christensen, ed. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.). For instance, multinational corporations (MNCs) operating in different countries with varying institutional environments will face diverse pressures. Some of those pressures in host and home institutional environments are testified to exert fundamental influences on competitive strategy (Martinsons, 1993; Porter, 1990) and human resource management (HRM) practices (Rosenzweig and Singh, 1991;Rosenzweig, P . and J. Singh. 1991. Organizational environments and the multinational enterprise. Academy of Management Review,16(2):340-361 Zaheer, 1995). Corporations also face institutional pressures from their most important peers: peers in their industry and peers in their local (headquarters) community; for example, Marquis and Tilcsik (2016) show that corporate philanthropic donations are largely driven by isomorphic pressures that companies experience from their industry peers and local peers. Non- governmental organisations (NGOs) and social organizations can also be susceptible to isomorphic pressures. More recent work in the field of institutional theory has led to the emergence of new concepts such as \\\\- institutional logics, a concept pioneered by Friedland & Alford (1991) and later by Thornton, Ocasio & Lounsbury (2012). The institutional logic perspective mostly take a structural and macro approach to institutional analysis \\\\- institutional work, a concept pioneered by Lawrence & Suddaby, (2006). By contrast with the logic perspective, it gives agentic power to social actors, and assumes those actors can influence institutions - either maintaining or disrupting them. === Challenges in different types of economies === There is substantial evidence that firms in different types of economies react differently to similar challenges (Knetter, 1989). Social, economic, and political factors constitute an institutional structure of a particular environment which provides firms with advantages for engaging in specific types of activities there. Businesses tend to perform more efficiently if they receive the institutional support. ==See also== * Institutional logics * Institutional work * Institutional analysis * Institutional economics ==References== Category:Political science theories ","title":"Institutional theory"},{"id":"2582115","text":"Aberarder () is a hamlet to the south of Loch Ruthven, Scottish Highlands and is in the Scottish council area of Highland.

Aberargies' place in most history books is as a small part of the bigger Parish of Abernethy, but there was at one time a thriving community, based on the utilisation of the River Farg to power water mills for various purposes from sawing timber to the milling of flax and meal. Mills have been recorded at Pottie, part of which still stands at the bottom of the Farg Glen, Ayton Farm, Mill House, Willow Bank, which also has some standing ruins, and Gowlie. The feu duty for most of these mills up until the late 19th century was payable to Balmerino Abbey Estates.

Benjamin for Architects (2011) Routledge, London, p. 0000. That in the age of mechanical reproduction and the absence of traditional and ritualistic value, the production of art would be inherently based upon the praxis of politics. Written during the Nazi régime (1933–1945) in Germany, Benjamin’s essay presents a theory of art that is “useful for the formulation of revolutionary demands in the politics of art” in a mass-culture society.Scannell, Paddy. (2003) \\"Benjamin Contextualized: On 'The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction'\\", in Canonic Texts in Media Research: Are There Any? Should There Be? How About These?, Katz et al. (Eds.) Polity Press, Cambridge. . pp. 74–89. The subject and themes of Benjamin’s essay: the aura of a work of art; the artistic authenticity of the artefact; its cultural authority; and the aestheticization of politics for the production of art, became resources for research in the fields of art history and architectural theory, cultural studies and media theory.Elliott, Brian. Benjamin for Architects, Routledge, London, 2011. The original essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of its Technological Reproducibility”, was published in three editions: (i) the German edition, Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner technischen Reproduzierbarkeit, in 1935; (ii) the French edition, L'œuvre d'art à l'époque de sa reproduction mécanisée, in 1936; and (iii) the German revised edition in 1939, from which derive the contemporary English translations of the essay.Notes on Walter Benjamin, \\"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\\", a commentary by Gareth Griffiths, Aalto University, 2011. ==Summary== In “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1935) Walter Benjamin presents the thematic bases for a theory of art by quoting the essay \\"The Conquest of Ubiquity\\" (1928), by Paul Valéry, to establish how works of art created and developed in past eras are different from contemporary works of art; that the understanding and treatment of art and of artistic technique must progressively develop in order to understand a work of art in the context of the modern time. ==Artistic production== In the Preface, Benjamin presents Marxist analyses of the organisation of a capitalist society and establishes the place of the arts in the public sphere and in the private sphere. Then explains the socio-economic conditions to extrapolate developments that further the economic exploitation of the proletariat, whence arise the social conditions that would abolish capitalism. That the reproduction of art is not a modern human activity, and reviews the historical and technological developments of the means for the mechanical reproduction of art — such as an artist manually copying the work of a master artist, and their effects upon society's valuation of a work of art — the industrial arts of the foundry and the stamp mill in Ancient Greece; and the modern arts of woodcut relief-printing and engraving, etching, lithography, and photography, techniques of mass production that permit greater accuracy in reproducing a work of art.Benjamin, Walter. “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1935) p. 01. ==Authenticity== The aura of a work of art derives from authenticity (uniqueness) and locale (physical and cultural); Benjamin explains that “even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: Its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be” located. That the “sphere of [artistic] authenticity is outside the technical [sphere]” of mechanised reproduction. Therefore, the original work of art is an objet d’art independent of the mechanically accurate reproduction; yet, by changing the cultural context of where the artwork is located, the existence of the mechanical copy diminishes the aesthetic value of the original work of art. In that way, the aura — the unique aesthetic authority of a work of art — is absent from the mechanically produced copy.Hansen, Miriam Bratu (2008). \\"Benjamin's Aura\\", Critical Inquiry No. 34 (Winter 2008) == Value: cult and exhibition == Regarding the social functions of an artefact, Benjamin said that “Works of art are received and valued on different planes. Two polar types stand out; with one, the accent is on the cult value; with the other, on the exhibition value of the work. Artistic production begins with ceremonial objects destined to serve in a cult. One may assume that what mattered was their existence, not their being on view.”Benjamin, Walter. “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1935) p. 4. The cult value of religious art is that “certain statues of gods are accessible only to the priest in the cella; certain madonnas remain covered nearly all year round; certain sculptures on medieval cathedrals are invisible to the spectator on ground level.”Benjamin, Walter. “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1935) p. 4. In practice, the diminished cult value of a religious artefact (an icon no longer venerated) increases the artefact’s exhibition value as art created for the spectators’ appreciation, because “it is easier to exhibit a portrait bust, that can be sent here and there [to museums], than to exhibit the statue of a divinity that has its fixed place in the interior of a temple.”Benjamin, Walter. “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1935) p. 4. The mechanical reproduction of a work of art voids its cult value, because removal from a fixed, private space (a temple) and placement in mobile, public space (a museum) allows exhibiting the art to many spectators. Further explaining the transition from cult value to exhibition value, Benjamin said that in “the photographic image, exhibition value, for the first time, shows its superiority to cult value.”Benjamin, Walter. “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1935) p. 4. In emphasising exhibition value, “the work of art becomes a creation with entirely new functions”, which “later may be recognized as incidental” to the original purpose for which the artist created the objet d’art.Benjamin, Walter. “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1935) p. 4. As a medium of artistic production, the cinema (moving pictures) does not create cult value for the motion picture, itself, because “the audience’s identification with the actor is really an identification with the camera. Consequently, the audience takes the position of the camera; its approach is that of testing. This is not the approach to which cult values may be exposed.” Therefore, “the film makes the cult value recede into the background, not only by putting the public in the position of the critic, but also by the fact that, at the movies, this [critical] position requires no attention.”Benjamin, Walter. “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1935) p. 5–6. ==Art as politics== The social value of a work of art changes as a society change their value systems; thus the changes in artistic styles and in the cultural tastes of the public follow \\"the manner in which human sense-perception is organized [and] the [artistic] medium in which it is accomplished, [which are] determined not only by Nature, but by historical circumstances, as well.\\" Despite the socio-cultural effects of mass-produced, reproduction-art upon the aura of the original work of art, Benjamin said that \\"the uniqueness of a work of art is inseparable from its being embedded in the fabric of tradition\\", which separates the original work of art from the reproduction. That the ritualization of the mechanical reproduction of art also emancipated \\"the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual\\", thereby increasing the social value of exhibiting works of art, which practice progressed from the private sphere of life, the owner's enjoyment of the aesthetics of the artefacts (usually High Art), to the public sphere of life, wherein the public enjoy the same aesthetics in an art gallery. ==Influence== In the late-twentieth-century television program Ways of Seeing (1972), John Berger proceeded from and developed the themes of “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1935), to explain the contemporary representations of social class and racial caste inherent to the politics and production of art. That in transforming a work of art into a commodity, the modern means of artistic production and of artistic reproduction have destroyed the aesthetic, cultural, and political authority of art: “For the first time ever, images of art have become ephemeral, ubiquitous, insubstantial, available, valueless, free”, because they are commercial products that lack the aura of authenticity of the original objet d’art.Berger, John.

Gungriffon and Gungriffon II originally appeared for the Sega Saturn console in 1996, with more recent appearances in Gungriffon Blaze for the PlayStation 2 and Gungriffon: Allied Strike for the Xbox. The Gungriffon games are focused on piloting mecha—large, usually bipedal military vehicles. This game series refers to these machines as Armored Walking Gun Systems (AWGS). With the exception of the High-MACS design, the mecha in this series have a distinctly realistic design philosophy. == Gungriffon == Year Game Takes Place: 2015 Platform: Sega Saturn Release Dates: Gungriffon was developed under the working title \\"3D Polygon\\". During development the game included a multiplayer mode with usage of the Saturn's link cable, but this was cut before release and the final game is single player only. It was released in Japan under the title Gungriffon: The Eurasian Conflict. There were plans to release the game in North America and Europe under the title \\"Iron Reign\\", but ultimately Sega reverted to using a shortened version of the original Japanese title. According to Greg Becksted, producer of the North American version of the game, the localization team changed the game's storyline slightly to better suit the U.S. market. Gungriffon received highly positive reviews, with critics hailing it as one of the best mech-based video games to date. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it their \\"Game of the Month\\" award, praising the responsive controls, sharp and realistic graphics, and exciting pace of the gameplay. Though most of them criticized the way the player mech easily gets caught on buildings, they all gave the game a strong recommendation, with Dan Hsu summarizing it as \\"the most exciting mech sim I've ever played, including any found on the PC.\\" Rad Automatic of Sega Saturn Magazine called Gungriffon \\"one of the best giant robot games ever\\", citing the polished graphics and the fact that missions are widely varied not just in the usual factors of terrain and difficulty, but even in elements such as tactical concept and lighting. Maximum's Rich Leadbetter praised the \\"very well pitched\\" difficulty, the impressive polygon models, and the variety of visuals. He criticized the lack of randomization and the fact that players do not need to start the entire game over when they fail a mission, but gave it an overall very positive assessment, calling it \\"what Krazy Ivan on PlayStation should have been\\". Scary Larry of GamePro likewise said that Gungriffon \\"makes Krazy Ivan and Ghen War look and feel like rusted heaps of scrap iron.\\" He was especially pleased with the player mech's ability to hover and the \\"Clean, almost state- of-the-art graphics\\".

O'Keeffe played 24 Tests and 2 ODIs between 1971 and 1977. ==Playing career== He was a spin bowler, bowling leg breaks. He never quite lived up to early expectations of being the next great Australian leg spin bowler, taking 53 wickets at an average of 38.07. He made his Test debut against England in the Fifth Test of the 1970–71 Ashes series after taking 6/69 and hitting 55 not out in the New South Wales match against the tourists, but did little and was dropped. Recalled for the vital Seventh Test on the spinning SCG pitch he took 3/48 and 3/96, but it was not enough to win the game and save The Ashes. He did however have some success with the bat averaging 25.76 and being called upon to open the batting in the second innings of the Centenary Test. One statistic that O'Keeffe himself uses to demonstrate his lack of penetration with the ball is that he is the bowler with the highest percentage of wickets out 'caught' in the history of Test match cricket (44 out of 53 wickets, 84%)http://www.howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Players/PlayerDismissBowlGraph.asp?PlayerID=1289 This is typical of his commentating style of making fun of his bowling abilities. He often talks of an incident during the 1972 Australian tour of England, when he appealed against a batsman for leg before wicket, and the umpire turned him down, saying that the ball was \\"doing too much\\", meaning that the ball was spinning so much that it would have turned away from the stumps. O'Keeffe said that the umpire's comment was a sarcastic jibe at his inability to spin the ball, something he likes to mock himself about. ==Post- playing career== O'Keeffe had varied careers post-cricket including as a commentator on ABC Radio. He was known for his humorous anecdotes, told in the manner of an after dinner speech at a cricketers club, and his distinctive laugh. He especially seemed to enjoy working with overseas commentators such as India's Harsha Bhogle whom he enjoyed confusing with his colourful Australian language. However, when he concentrated on the game he showed insight born of a career at the highest level together with study of the statistics and history of the game. In 2004 he released his autobiography According to Skull. He has also released a number of CDs containing some shorts of his commentating antics. On 27 December 2013, while providing commentary on the Melbourne Boxing Day Test between Australia and England, O'Keeffe announced his retirement from commentating after the Sydney Test in January 2014 (O'Keeffe had accepted a redundancy from the ABC). However, O'Keeffe returned to cricket commentary in December 2016 as part of Triple M's new cricket coverage. On 13 July 2018, it was announced that O'Keeffe had joined the Fox Sports cricket commentary team from the 2018–19 season. ===Controversy=== Commentating during the third Test of India's tour of Australia in 2018, O'Keeffe remarked that India's debutant opener Mayank Agarwal's first-class triple hundred \\"must have come against a Railways Canteen Staff XI.\\" After Agarwal went on to score 76 in his debut innings, Indian head coach Ravi Shastri hit back at O'Keeffe saying, \\"Mayank's got a message for Kerry. When you do open your canteen, he wants to come and smell the coffee. And he wants to compare it to the ones back home in India. Is the coffee better here in your canteen, or the one back home?\\" O'Keeffe apologized for his comments after a backlash from fans and former cricketers. Later, on day four of the same Test match, O'Keefe was jokingly asked by fellow commentator Shane Warne to pronounce \\"Cheteshwar Jadeja\\" after the former had struggled to pronounce Cheteshwar Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja's names throughout the day. Making light of his difficulties he commented, \\"Why would you call your kid Cheteshwar Jadeja?\\" The comments received backlash on social media for allegedly being \\"racist\\" in nature. India's bowling coach Bharat Arun stated that the team was \\"hurt\\" by O'Keeffe's \\"offensive\\" comments and added that the players wanted to \\"channelise that hurt towards doing better on the field.\\" After India won the Test match on day five, O'Keeffe wrote an open apology letter to the Indian team and fans. A day before the fourth Test, it was reported that Indian broadcaster Sony had decided to black out O'Keeffe's commentary by not using Fox Cricket's commentary feed when he is on air. This proved not to be the case and Sony continued to carry O'Keeffe's commentary. ==See also== * List of New South Wales representative cricketers ==References== ==External links== *Cricinfo article on Kerry O'Keeffe *Kerry O'Keeffe's Biography on ICMI Sport Speakers *Kerry O'Keeffe tells joke during Aus v Sri Lanka Final ODI at Gabba 2006 Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Australia One Day International cricketers Category:Australia Test cricketers Category:Australian cricket commentators Category:New South Wales cricketers Category:Somerset cricketers Category:World Series Cricket players Category:Australian cricketers Category:Cricketers from Sydney Category:D.

The series is notable for being the first British series to feature a female police officer as its leading character, ahead of the similarly themed BBC series Juliet Bravo by four months. ==Series history== The series starred Jill Gascoine as Detective Inspector Maggie Forbes, who has worked her way up through the ranks of the police force and is based at the fictional Seven Dials police station in London. Maggie's husband, a police constable, is murdered during the first episode, leaving her to juggle her career with single parenthood, raising her teenage son. The Gentle Touch largely dealt with routine police procedures and offered a frank depiction of relevant social issues (including racism, sexism, homosexuality, mental health and euthanasia). It was relatively low on action and violence in comparison to previous classic crime series such as The Sweeney, opting for a more realistic and low key approach. Although the series mostly focused on Maggie's professional life in a male-dominated field, it also showed her home life with her elderly father George and her teenage son Steve, whom in one episode she castigated for looking at porn. Occasionally, Maggie's romantic involvements were seen which sometimes clashed with her job. The Gentle Touch was a ratings success in the UK, where it was screened on Friday nights in a 9.00 p.m. slot (except for the final series which was shown on Saturday nights). One episode shown in January 1982 garnered over 18 million viewers and was the 5th most watched television programme in Britain that year. The Gentle Touch made Gascoine a household name, and ran for five series until 1984. The character of Maggie Forbes lasted longer as Gascoine returned in 1985 in the more action-orientated spin-off series C.A.T.S.

For the earlier period see Foreign relations of imperial China, and for the current foreign relations of China see Foreign relations of China. == Qing Dynasty == By the mid 19th century, Chinese stability had come under increasing threat from both domestic and international sources. Social unrest and serious revolts became more common while the regular army had Was too weak to deal with foreign military forces. Chinese leaders increasingly feared the impact of Western ideas. John Fairbank argues that in 1840 to 1895 China's response to the worsening relations with Western nations came in four phases. China's military weakness was interpreted in the 1840s and 1850s as a need for Western arms. Very little was achieved in this regard until much later. In the 1860s there was a focus on acquiring Western technology—as Japan was doing very successfully at the same time, but China lagged far behind. The 1870s to 1890s were characterized with efforts to reform and revitalize the Chinese political system more broadly. There was steady moderate progress, but efforts to leap forward such as the Hundred Days' Reform in 1898 roused the conservatives who stamped out the effort and executed its leaders. There was a rise in Chinese nationalism, as a sort of echo of Western nationalism, but that led to a quick defeat in war with Japan in 1895. An intense reaction against modernization set in at the grassroots level in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900.John King Fairbank, \\"China's Response to the West: Problems and Suggestions.\\" Cahiers d'Histoire Mondiale. Journal of World History. Cuadernos de Historia Mundial 3.2 (1956): 381. == Opium Wars == European commercial interests sought to end the trading barriers, but China fended off repeated efforts by Britain to reform the trading system. Increasing sales of Indian opium to China by British traders led to the First Opium War (1839–1842). The superiority of Western militaries and military technology like steamboats and Congreve rockets forced China to open trade with the West on Western terms.Brian Catchpole, A map history of modern China (1976), pp 21-23. The Second Opium War also known as the Arrow War, in 1856-60 saw a joint Anglo- French military mission including Great Britain and the French Empire win an easy victory. The agreements of the Convention of Peking led to the ceding of Kowloon Peninsula as part of Hong Kong.John Yue-wo Wong, Deadly dreams: Opium and the Arrow war (1856-1860) in China (Cambridge UP, 2002). French political cartoon from 1898 depicts helpless China being carved up and divided among the powers, (from left) Britain, Germany, Russia, France and Japan. === Unequal treaties === A series of \\"unequal treaties\\", including the Treaty of Nanking (1842), the treaties of Tianjin (1858), and the Beijing Conventions (1860), forced China to open new treaty ports, including Canton (Guangzhou), Amoy (Xiamen), and Shanghai. The treaties also allowed the British to set up Hong Kong as a colony and established international settlements in the treaty ports under the control of foreign diplomats. China was required to accept diplomats at the capital in Peking, provided for the free movement for foreign ships in Chinese rivers, kept its tariffs low, and opened the interior to Christian missionaries. Manchu leaders of the Qing government found the treaties useful, because they forced the foreigners into a few limited areas, so that the vast majority of Chinese had no contact whatsoever with them or their dangerous ideas. The missionaries, however, ventured more widely but they were widely distrusted and made very few converts. Their main impact was setting up schools and hospitals.Ssu-yü Teng and John King Fairbank, China's response to the West: a documentary survey, 1839-1923(1979) pp 35-37, 134-35. Since the 1920s, the \\"unequal treaties\\" have been a centerpiece of angry Chinese grievances against the West in general.Dong Wang, \\"The Discourse of Unequal Treaties in Modern China,\\" Pacific Affairs (2003) 76#3 pp 399-425. === Suzerain and tributaries=== For centuries China had claimed suzerain authority over numerous adjacent areas. The areas had internal autonomy but were forced to give tribute to China while being theoretically under the protection of China in terms of foreign affairs. By the 19th century the relationships were nominal, and China exerted little or no actual control.Amanda J. Cheney, \\"Tibet Lost in Translation: Sovereignty, Suzerainty and International Order Transformation, 1904–1906.\\" Journal of Contemporary China 26.107 (2017): 769-783. The great powers did not recognize China's fiefdom and one by one seized the supposed suzerain areas. Japan moved to dominate Korea (and annexed it in 1910)Andre Schmid, \\"Colonialism and the ‘Korea Problem’ in the Historiography of Modern Japan: A Review Article.\\" Journal of Asian Studies 59.4 (2000): 951-976. online and seized the Ryukyus;Ying-Kit Chan, \\"Diplomacy and the Appointment of officials in Late Qing China: He Ruzhang and Japan’s Annexation Of Ryukyu.\\" Chinese Historical Review 26.1 (2019): 20-36.

Britain took BurmaAnthony Webster, \\"Business and empire: A reassessment of the British conquest of Burma in 1885.\\" Historical Journal 43.4 (2000): 1003-1025. and Nepal; Russia took parts of Siberia. Only Tibet was left, and that was highly problematic since the Tibetans, as most of the supposed suzerainty, had never accepted Chinese claims of lordship and tribute. The losses humiliated China and marked it as a repeated failure. ===Christian missionaries=== Catholic missions began with the Jesuit China missions from France and Italy in the 16th century. For a while were highly successful in placing intellectuals and scientists in the royal court. The Pope, however, prohibited the priests from making accommodations to Confucianism or paganism. The Jesuits left, but returned in 1842. Converts were from the lower social strata, and numbered about 240,000 in 1840 and 720,000 in 1901. The Jesuits opened Aurora University in Shanghai in 1903 to reach an elite audience.Jean-Paul Wiest, \\"Bringing Christ to the nations: shifting models of mission among Jesuits in China.\\" The Catholic historical review 83.4 (1997): 654-681. German missionaries arrived in the late 19th century, and Americans arrived in force in the 1920s, largely to replace the French.John Harney, \\"Enshrining the Mission: The Bishop Sheehan Memorial Museum and Vincentian Visions of China.\\" American Catholic Studies (2015): 45-69. Online Beginning in Protestant missionaries started to come, to include thousands of men, their wives and children, and unmarried female missionaries. These were not individual operations, they were sponsored and financed by organized churches in their home country. The 19th century is one of steady geographical expansion, which was reluctantly allowed by the Chinese government every time it lost a war. At first they were limited to the Canton area. In the 1842 treaty ending the First Opium War missionaries were granted the right to live and work in five coastal cities. In 1860, the treaties ending the Second Opium War opened up the entire country to missionary activity. Protestant missionary activity exploded during the next few decades. From 50 missionaries in China in 1860, the number grew to 2,500 (counting wives and children) in 1900. 1,400 of the missionaries were British, 1,000 were Americans, and 100 were from continental Europe, mostly Scandinavia.Larry Clinton Thompson, William Scott Ament and the Boxer Rebellion: Heroism, Hubris, and the Ideal Missionary (2009), p. 14; Jane Hunter, 'The Gospel of Gentility (1984), p. 6 Protestant missionary activity peaked in the 1920s and thereafter declined due to war and unrest in China, As well as a sense of frustration among the missionaries themselves. By 1953, all Protestant missionaries had been expelled by the communist government of China.Nicolas Standaert, \\"New trends in the historiography of Christianity in China.\\" Catholic Historical Review 83.4 (1997): 573-613. In long-term perspective, the major impact of the missions was not the thousands of converts out of million of people, but introducing modern medical standards, and especially building schools for the few families eager to learn about the outside world.Miwa Hirono, Civilizing missions: International religious agencies in China (Springer, 2008). The hospitals not only cured sick people, they taught hygiene and care of children.Michelle Renshaw, \\"'Family-Centred Care' in American Hospitals in Late-Qing China.\\" Clio Medica 86.1 (2010). They lessened the hostility of Chinese officials.Xu Guangqiu, \\"The Impact of Medical Missionaries on Chinese Officials: Dr. Peter Parker and the Canton Hospital, 1835-1855\\" Journal of Presbyterian History (2019) 97#1 pp 16-28.Hu Cheng, \\"The Modernization of Japanese and Chinese Medicine (1914-1931).\\" Chinese Studies in History 47.4 (2014): 78-94. The key leader of the 1911 revolution, Sun Yat- sen spent four-year in exile in Hawaii, where he studied in Christian schools and eventually converted.Irma Tam Soong, \\"Christianity and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's schooling in Hawai'i, 1879-83.\\" Chinese America: History and Perspectives (2010) pp. 75-86. When missionaries returned home they typically preached a highly favorable view toward China, and a negative view toward Japan, helping promote public opinion in the West that increasingly supported China. At the local level across China, for the vast majority of the population, missionaries were the only foreigners they ever saw. Outside the protected international centers, they came under frequent verbal attack, and sometimes violent episodes. This led the international community to threaten military action to protect missionaries, as their diplomats demanded the government provide more and more protection. Attacks reached a crescendo during the Boxer Rebellion, which had a major anti-missionary component. The Boxers killed over 200 foreign missionaries and thousands of Chinese Christians. Dr. Eleanor Chesnut was killed by a mob in 1905. Likewise nationalist movements in the 1920s and 1930s also had an anti-missionary component. Sino-French War (1884-1885) === First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) === A weakened China lost wars with Japan and gave up nominal control over the Ryukyu Islands in 1870 to Japan. After the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894 it lost Formosa to Japan. After the Sino-French War of 1884–1885, France took control of Vietnam, another supposed \\"tributary state.\\" After Britain took over Burma, as a show of good faith they maintained the sending of tribute to China, putting themselves in a lower status than in their previous relations.(Original from the University of California) To affirm this, Britain agreed in the Burma convention in 1886 to continue the Burmese payments to China every 10 years, in return for which China would recognise Britain's occupation of Upper Burma.(Colonial period Korea; WWC-5)(Original from the University of California) Chinese generals in Pyongyang surrender to the Japanese, October 1894. Japan after 1860 modernized its military after Western models and was far stronger than China. The war, fought in 1894 and 1895, was fought to resolve the issue of control over Korea, which was yet another suzerain claimed by China and under the rule of the Joseon Dynasty. A peasant rebellion led to a request by the Korean government for China to send in troops to stabilize the country. The Empire of Japan responded by sending its own force to Korea and installing a puppet government in Seoul. China objected and war ensued. It was a brief affair, with Japanese ground troops routing Chinese forces on the Liaodong Peninsula and nearly destroying the Chinese navy in the Battle of the Yalu River. ====Treaty of Shimonoseki==== China, badly defeated, sued for peace and was forced to accept the harsh Treaty of Shimonoseki Signed on April 17, 1895.Frank W. Ikle, \\"The Triple Intervention. Japan's Lesson in the Diplomacy of Imperialism.\\" Monumenta Nipponica 22.1/2 (1967): 122-130. online China became responsible for a financial indemnity of £30 million. It had to surrender To Japan the island of Taiwan and the Pescatore Islands. Japan received most favored nation status, like all the other powers/ Korea became nominally independent, although Japan and Russia were vying for control. The most controversial provision ceded the Liaodong Peninsula to Japan. However this was not acceptable. Russia, taking the self-appointed mantle of protector of China, worked with Germany and France to intervene and forced Japan to withdraw from Liaodong Peninsula.Catchpole, A map history of modern China (1976), pp 32-33. To pay the indemnities, British French and Russian banks loaned China the money, but they also gained other advantages. Russia in 1896 was given permission to extend its Trans-Siberian Railway across Manchuria to reach Vladivostok, a 350-mile shortcut. The new Chinese Eastern Railway, was controlled by the Russians, and became a major military factor for them In controlling key parts of Manchuria. Later in 1896 Russia and China made a secret alliance, whereby Russia would work to prevent further Japanese expansion at China's expense. In 1898 Rush obtained a 25-year lease over the Liadong Peninsula in southern Manchuria, including the ice free harbor of Port Arthur, their only such facility in the East. An extension of the Chinese Eastern Railway to Port Arthur greatly expanded Russian military capabilities in the Far East.Rhoads Murphey, East Asia (1997) p 325. British cartoon shows the victory of \\"little\\" Japan over \\"large\\" China. in 1894. === Reforms in 1890s=== One of the government's main source of income was a five percent tariff on imports. The government hired Robert Hart (1835-1911), a British diplomat to run it from 1863. He set up an efficient system based in Canton that was largely free of corruption, and expanded it to other ports. The top echelon of the service was recruited from all the nations trading with China. Hart promoted numerous modernising programs.Jung Chang, Empress Dowager Cixi (2013) p. 80 His agency established a modern postal service and supervision of internal taxes on trade. Hart helped establish its own embassies in foreign countries. He helped set up the Tongwen Guan (School of Combined Learning) in Peking, with a branch in Canton, to teach foreign languages, culture and science. In 1902 the Tongwen Guan was absorbed into the Imperial University, now Peking University.Robert Bickers, \\"Revisiting the Chinese maritime customs service, 1854–1950.\\" Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History 36.2 (2008): 221-226.Henk Vynckier and Chihyun Chang, \\"'Imperium In Imperio': Robert Hart, the Chinese Maritime Customs Service, and its (Self-)Representations,\\" Biography 37#1 (2014), pp. 69-92 online ====Hundred Days Reform fails in 1898==== The Hundred Days Reform was a failed 103-day national, cultural, political, and educational reform movement from 11 June to 22 September 1898. It was undertaken by the young Guangxu Emperor and his reform-minded supporters. Following the issuing of over 100 reformative edicts, a coup d'état (\\"The Coup of 1898\\", Wuxu Coup) was perpetrated by powerful conservative opponents led by Empress Dowager Cixi. The Emperor was locked up until his death and key reformers were exiled or fled.Luke S.K. Kwong, \\"Chinese politics at the crossroads: Reflections on the Hundred Days Reform of 1898.\\" Modern Asian Studies 34.3 (2000): 663-695.Young-Tsu Wong, \\"Revisionism Reconsidered: Kang Youwei and the Reform Movement of 1898\\" Journal of Asian Studies 51#3 (1992), pp. 513-544 online === Boxer rebellion === The Boxer Rebellion (1897–1901) was an anti-foreigner movement by the Righteous Harmony Society in China between 1897 and 1901. They attacked and often killed missionaries, Christian converts, and foreigners. They held the international diplomats in Peking under siege. The ruler of China, the Dowager Empress Cixi, supported the Boxers and the Chinese government paid the penalty. The uprising was crushed by the ad hoc Eight Nation Alliance of major powers.Catchpole, A map history of modern China (1976), pp 34-35.Diana Preston, The Boxer Rebellion : The Dramatic Story of China's War on Foreigners That Shook the World in the Summer of 1900 (2000). Online On top of all the damage and pillage, China was forced to pay annual installments of an indemnity of $333 million American dollars to all the victors—actual total payments amounted to about $250 million. Robert Hart, the inspector general of the Imperial Maritime Customs Service, was the chief negotiator for the peace terms. The indemnity, despite some beneficial programs, was \\"nothing but bad\\" for China, as Hart had predicted at the beginning of the negotiations.Frank H.H. King, \\"The Boxer Indemnity—‘Nothing but Bad’.\\" Modern Asian Studies 40.3 (2006): 663-689. === Manchuria === Manchuria was a contested zone with Russia and Japan taking control away from China and in the process going to war themselves in 1904–1905.Ian Nish, The Origins of the Russo-Japanese War (1985). == Republican China == Empress Dowager Cixi (1835-1908) was in control of imperial policy from after 1861; she had remarkable political skills but historians generally blame her for major policy failures and the growing weakness of China. Her reversal of reforms in 1898 and especially support for the Boxers caused all the powers to join against her. Late Qing China remains a symbol of national humiliation and weakness in Chinese and international historiography. Scholars attribute Cixi's \\"rule behind the curtains\\" responsible for the ultimate decline of the Qing dynasty and its capitulatory peace with foreign powers. Her failures hastened the revolution to overthrow the dynasty.Ying-kit Chan, \\"A Precious Mirror for Governing the Peace: A Primer for Empress Dowager Cixi.\\" Nan Nü 17.2 (2015): 214-244. The Republican Revolution of 1911 overthrew the imperial court and brought an era of regional warlords. In terms of foreign policy the new government tried with limited success to renegotiate the unequal treaties. In 1931, Japan seized control of Manchuria over the objections of the League of Nations. Japan quit the League, which was helpless.Alison Adcock Kaufman, \\"In Pursuit of Equality and Respect: China’s Diplomacy and the League of Nations.\\" Modern China 40.6 (2014): 605-638 online . The most active Chinese diplomat was Wellington Koo.Stephen G. Craft, V.K. Wellington Koo and the emergence of modern China (University Press of Kentucky, 2015). == War with Japan: 1937–1945 == Japan invaded in 1937, launching the Second Sino-Japanese War. By 1938, the United States was a strong supporter of China. Michael Schaller says that during 1938: :China emerged as something of a symbol of American-sponsored resistance to Japanese aggression.... A new policy appeared, one predicated on the maintenance of a pro-American China which might be a bulwark against Japan. The United States hoped to use China as the weapon with which to contain Tokyo's larger imperialism. Economic assistance, Washington hoped, could achieve this result.Michael Schaller, The US Crusade in China, 1938-1945 (1979) p 17. Chiang Kai-shek with U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill at the Cairo Conference in 1943 Even the isolationists who opposed war in Europe supported a hard-line against Japan. American public sympathy for the Chinese, and hatred of Japan, was aroused by reports from missionaries, novelists such as Pearl Buck, and Time Magazine of Japanese brutality in China, including reports surrounding the Nanjing Massacre, called the 'Rape of Nanking'. By early 1941, the U.S. was preparing to send American planes flown by American pilots under American command, but wearing Chinese uniforms, to fight the Japanese invaders and even to bomb Japanese cities. There were delays and the \\"Flying Tigers\\" under Claire Lee Chennault finally became operational days after Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941) brought the U.S. into the war officially. The Flying Tigers were soon incorporated into the United States Air Force, which made operations in China a high priority, and generated enormous favorable publicity for the China in the U.S.Martha Byrd, Chennault: Giving Wings to the Tiger (2003) After Japan took Southeast Asia, American aid had to be routed through India and over the Himalayan Mountains at enormous expense and frustrating delay. Chiang's beleaguered government was now headquartered in remote Chongqing. Roosevelt sent Joseph Stilwell to train Chinese troops and coordinate military strategy. He became the Chief of Staff to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, served as U.S. commander in the China Burma India Theater, was responsible for all Lend-Lease supplies going to China, and was later Deputy Commander of South East Asia Command. Despite his status and position in China, he became involved in conflicts with other senior Allied officers, over the distribution of Lend- Lease materiel, Chinese political sectarianism and proposals to incorporate Chinese and U.S. forces in the 11th Army Group (which was under British command).Barbara Tuchman, Stilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911–45 (1971), pp. 231–232. Madame Chiang Kaishek, who had been educated in the U.S., addressed the U.S. Congress and toured the country to rally support for China.Laura Tyson Li, Madame Chiang Kai-Shek: China's Eternal First Lady (2006). Congress amended the Chinese Exclusion Act and Roosevelt moved to end the unequal treaties. Chiang and Mme. Chiang met with Roosevelt and Churchill at the Cairo Conference of late 1943, but promises of major increases in aid did not materialize.Jonathan Fenby, Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost (2005) pp 408-14, 428-433. The perception grew that Chiang's government, with poorly equipped and ill-fed troops was unable to effectively fight the Japanese or that he preferred to focus more on defeating the Communists. China Hands advising Stilwell argued that it was in American interest to establish communication with the Communists to prepare for a land- based counteroffensive invasion of Japan. The Dixie Mission, which began in 1943, was the first official American contact with the Communists. Other Americans, led by Chennault, argued for air power. In 1944, Generalissimo Chiang acceded to Roosevelt's request that an American general take charge of all forces in the area, but demanded that Stilwell be recalled. General Albert Coady Wedemeyer replaced Stilwell, Patrick J. Hurley became ambassador, and Chinese-American relations became much smoother. The U.S. had included China in top-level diplomacy in the hope that large masses of Chinese troops would defeat Japan with minimal American casualties. When that hope was seen as illusory, and it was clear that B-29 bombers could not operate effectively from China, China became much less important to Washington, but it was promised a seat in the new UN Security Council, with a veto.Herbert Feis, China Tangle: American Effort in China from Pearl Harbor to the Marshall Mission (1953) pp 376-79. == Civil War == When civil war threatened, President Harry Truman sent General George Marshall to China at the end of 1945 to broker a compromise between the Nationalist government and the Communists, who had established control in much of northern China. Marshall hoped for a coalition government, and brought the two distrustful sides together. At home, many Americans saw China as a bulwark against the spread of communism, but some Americans hoped that the Communists would remain on friendly terms with the U.S. Mao had long admired the U.S.—George Washington was a hero to him—and saw it as an ally in the Second World War. He was bitterly disappointed when the U.S. would not abandon the Nationalists, writing that \\"the imperialists who had always been hostile to the Chinese people will not change overnight to treat us on an equal level.\\" His official policy was \\"wiping out the control of the imperialists in China completely.\\"He Di, \\"The Most Respected Enemy: Mao Zedong's Perception of the United States\\" China Quarterly No. 137 (March 1994), pp. 144-158, quotations on page 147. online Truman and Marshall, while supplying military aid and advice, determined that American intervention could not save the Nationalist cause. One recent scholar argues that the Communists won the Civil War because Mao Zedong made fewer military mistakes and Chiang Kai-shek antagonized key interest groups. Furthermore, his armies had been weakened in the war against Japanese. Meanwhile, the Communists promised to improve the ways of life for groups such as farmers.Odd Arne Westad, Restless Empire: China and the World Since 1750 (2012) p 291 Stalin's policy was opportunistic and utilitarian. He offered official Soviet support only when the People's Liberation Army had virtually won the Civil War. Sergey Radchenko argues that \\"all the talk of proletarian internationalism in the Sino-Soviet alliance was but a cloak for Soviet expansionist ambitions in East Asia\\".Sergey Radchenko, \\"Sino-Soviet Relations and the Emergence of the Chinese Communist Regime, 1946–1950: New Documents, Old Story.\\" Journal of Cold War Studies 9.4 (2007): 115-124. == People's Republic of China == Countries of the world indicating decade diplomatic relations commenced with the People's Republic of China: 1949/1950s (dark red), 1960s (red), 1970s (orange), 1980s (beige) and 1990s/2000s (yellow). Countries not recognized by or not recognizing the PRC are in grey. === International recognition of the People's Republic of China === Since its establishment in 1949, the People's Republic of China has worked vigorously to win international recognition and support for its position that it is the sole legitimate government of all China, including Tibet (History of Tibet (1950–present)), Hong Kong (Foreign relations of Hong Kong), Macau (Foreign relations of Macau), Taiwan (Foreign relations of Taiwan), the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands and islands in the South China Sea. Upon its establishment in 1949, the People's Republic of China was recognized by Eastern Bloc countries. Among the first Western countries to recognize China were the United Kingdom (on 6 January 1950), Switzerland (on 17 January 1950Bilateral relations between Switzerland and China (page visited on 19 August 2014).) and Sweden (on 14 February 1950). The first Western country to establish diplomatic ties with China was Sweden (on 9 May 1950). Until the early 1970s, the Republic of China government in Taipei was recognized diplomatically by most world powers and held China's permanent seat in the UN Security Council, including its associated veto power. After the Beijing government assumed the China seat in 1971 (and the ROC government was expelled), the great majority of nations have switched diplomatic relations from the Republic of China to the People's Republic of China. Japan established diplomatic relations with the PRC in 1972, following the Joint Communiqué of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the U.S. did so in 1979. In 2011, the number of countries that had established diplomatic relations with Beijing had risen to 171, while 23 maintained diplomatic relations with the Republic of China (or Taiwan). (See also: Political status of Taiwan) Both the PRC and ROC make it a prerequisite for diplomatic relations that a country does not recognize and conduct any official relations with the other party. == Mao's foreign policies == In the 1947-1962 era, Mao emphasized the desire for international partnerships, on the one hand to more rapidly develop the economy, and on the other to protect against attacks, especially by the U.S. His numerous alliances, however, all fell apart, including the Soviet Union, Vietnam, North Korea, and Albania. He was unable to organize an anti-American coalition. Mao was only interested in what alliances could do for China, and ignored the needs of the partners. From their point of view China appeared unreliable because of its unstable internal situation, typified by the Great Leap Forward. Furthermore, Mao was insensitive to the fears of alliance partners that China was so big, and so inwardly directed, that their needs would be ignored.Michael Yahuda, Towards the End of Isolationism: China's Foreign Policy After Mao (1983) pp 120-22. With Mao in overall control and making final decisions, Zhou Enlai handled foreign-policy and developed a strong reputation for his diplomatic and negotiating skills.Yahuda, Towards the End of Isolationism (1983) p 18. Regardless of those skills, Zhou's bargaining position was undercut by the domestic turmoil initiated by Mao. The Great Leap Forward of 1958-60 was a failed effort to industrialize overnight; it devastated food production and led to millions of deaths from famine. Even more disruptive was the Cultural Revolution of 1966–76, which decimated a generation of leadership. When China broke with Russia around 1960, the main cause was Mao's insistence that Moscow had deviated from the true principles of communism. The result was that both Moscow and Beijing sponsored rival Communist parties around the world, which expended much of their energy fighting each other. China's focus especially was on the Third World as China portrayed itself as the legitimate leader of the global battle against imperialism and capitalism.Westad, Restless Empire ch 9John W. Garver, China's Quest: The History of the Foreign Relations of the People's Republic (2nd ed. 2018), ppWhat 85, 196-98, 228-231, 264. == Soviet Union and Korean War == After its founding, the PRC's foreign policy initially focused on its solidarity with the Soviet Union, the Eastern Bloc nations, and other communist countries, sealed with, among other agreements, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed in 1950 to oppose China's chief antagonists, the West and in particular the U.S. The 1950–53 Korean War waged by China and its North Korea ally against the U.S., South Korea, and United Nations (UN) forces has long been a reason for bitter feelings. After the conclusion of the Korean War, China sought to balance its identification as a member of the Soviet bloc by establishing friendly relations with Pakistan and other Third World countries, particularly in Southeast Asia.Chen Jian, China's road to the Korean War (1994) China's entry into the Korean War was the first of many \\"preemptive counterattacks\\". Chinese leaders decided to intervene when they saw their North Korean ally being overwhelmed and no guarantee American forces would stop at the Yalu. === Break with Moscow === By the late 1950s, relations between China and the Soviet Union had become so divisive that in 1960, the Soviets unilaterally withdrew their advisers from China. The two then began to vie for allegiances among the developing world, for China saw itself as a natural champion through its role in the Non-Aligned Movement and its numerous bilateral and bi-party ties. In the 1960s, Beijing competed with Moscow for political influence among communist parties and in the developing world generally. In 1962, China had a brief war with India over a border dispute. By 1969, relations with Moscow were so tense that fighting erupted along their common border. Following the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and clashes in 1969 on the Sino-Soviet border, Chinese competition with the Soviet Union increasingly reflected concern over China's own strategic position. China then lessened its anti- Western rhetoric and began developing formal diplomatic relations with West European nations.Dong Wang, \\"The Quarrelling Brothers: New Chinese Archives and a Reappraisal of the Sino-Soviet Split, 1959-1962.\\" Cold War International History Project Working Paper Series 2005) online.< == 1980s == Chinese anxiety about Soviet strategic advances was heightened following the Soviet Union's December 1979 invasion of Afghanistan. Sharp differences between China and the Soviet Union persisted over Soviet support for Vietnam's continued occupation of Cambodia, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and Soviet troops along the Sino-Soviet border and in Mongolia—the so-called \\"three obstacles\\" to improved Sino-Soviet relations.Michael B. Yahuda, End of Isolationism: China's Foreign Policy After Mao (1983).Michael Yahuda, \\"Deng Xiaoping: the statesman.\\" The China Quarterly 135 (1993): 551-572 online . In the 1970s and 1980s, China sought to create a secure regional and global environment for itself and foster good relations with countries that could aid its economic development. During the time of Mao, China was a closed country. After his death, authorities led by Deng Xiaoping began instigating reforms. In 1983, 74-year-old Li Xiannian became President of China, nominal head of state of China and one of the longest serving politicians in the leadership of China. He visited many countries and thus began opening China to the world. In 1985, Li Xiannian was the first president of China to visit the U.S. President Li also visited North Korea. 1986 saw the arrival of Queen Elizabeth II in an official visit. To this end, China looked to the West for assistance with its modernization drive and for help in countering Soviet expansionism, which it characterized as the greatest threat to its national security and to world peace. China maintained its consistent opposition to \\"superpower hegemonism\\", focusing almost exclusively on the expansionist actions of the Soviet Union and Soviet proxies such as Vietnam and Cuba, but it also placed growing emphasis on a foreign policy independent of both the U.S. and the Soviet Union. While improving ties with the West, China continued to closely follow the political and economic positions of the Third World Non-Aligned Movement, although China was not a formal member. ===Tiananmen Square Incident=== In the immediate aftermath of the Tiananmen Square incident in June 1989, many countries reduced their diplomatic contacts with China as well as their economic assistance programs. In response, China worked vigorously to expand its relations with foreign countries, and by late 1990, had reestablished normal relations with almost all nations. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in late 1991, China also opened diplomatic relations with the republics of the former Soviet Union.Samuel S. Kim, \\"Chinese Foreign Policy After Tiananmen,\\" Current History 89#548 (September. 1990), 245-52. ==21st century== During the first five years of Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping’s leadership the budget for diplomacy doubled. The aggressive style of Chinese diplomacy which emerged in the 21st century has been termed “Wolf Warrior Diplomacy.\\" The phrase is derived from the patriotic Chinese movie Wolf Warrior and its sequel Wolf Warrior 2, the film's tagline was \\"Even though a thousand miles away, anyone who affronts China will pay.\\" Efforts aimed at incorporating Chinese diaspora into China's foreign policy have also intensified with an emphasis placed on ethnic loyalty over national loyalty. China has been criticized for its aggressive diplomatic response to the COVID-19 outbreak which included spreading misinformation about how other countries were handling the outbreak. ===Social media=== Engagement on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter has become an integral component of Chinese diplomacy. From April 2019 to April 2020 the output of Chinese diplomat's Twitter accounts increased fourfold. ==See also== * International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919) ** Diplomatic history of World War I ** International relations (1919–1939) ** Diplomatic history of World War II ** Cold War * China–United States relations * History of Sino-Russian relations * Ten Major Relationships, Mao's policy speech of 1956 * Foreign relations of Taiwan ==Notes== ==Further reading== ===Surveys=== * Clyde, Paul H., and Burton F.

Aberbargoed once contained the largest ever colliery waste tip in Europe, although this has now been reclaimed and turned into a country park. == Mining == Coal mining operations in Bargoed Colliery started in 1897 when the Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Company started to sink the shaft. In 1901, the \\"Ras Las\\" nine-foot seam was discovered at a depth of 625 yards. The north and south shafts were completed. In November 1903, Sir Alfred Thomas, M.P. for East Glamorgan, started the engines to raise the first four trams of coal. By 1910, the pit was employing 1,943 miners and was the largest coal mine in the Rhymney Valley. On 10 December 1908, it broke the world record for production when a ten-hour shift produced 3,562 tons of coal. It further broke its own record on 23 April 1909 when 4,020 tons were raised in a ten-hour shift. Bargoed Colliery closed on 4 June 1977. By this time, only 360 men were employed there. There is a legend that has it, The Flame lived in Aberbargoed for 27 years before moving to Penpedairheol == Population == The population of Pont Aberbargoed was 351 in the census of 1851. Aberbargoed reached a peak in 1961 of 5,157, and had dropped to 3,882 according to the 1991 Census. Bargoed in 1921 had a population of 2, dropping to 1 by 1991. == Modern Day == The coal-mining waste tip that lay between Bargoed and Aberbargoed once towered to a height of 400 feet in the 1970s. The local school had a Plant a tree in '73 campaign in an attempt to make it more pleasurable on the eye. The tip has now been levelled and the area has been reclaimed with walkways. The colliery has gone and is now home to an Ambulance Station and other small industries. There are also developments with a new retail outlet in the area where the tip once stood. The large tip at Bedwellty is still there, but has been grassed over and now looks much like the surrounding countryside. Aberbargoed now has an extensive area of grasslands that are protected due to the finding of a rare butterfly: the Marsh fritillary Euphydryas aurinia has been found in the marshy area north of where Bedwellty School once stood. Recently a bypass has been built through the park allowing road users to bypass the town of Bargoed. == Notable people == :'''' * Sir Harold Josiah Finch (politician) * The jazz pianist and composer Geoff Eales was born in Aberbargoed. * Luke Evans (actor) * Listed on the War Memorial in the middle of the village is the name of Glyndwr Michael.

He began releasing acid house tracks in 1988, and by 2000, the project had become an Harsh Industrial/aggrotech project. Loamfield also released several albums under its side project Noisuf-X. == Beginnings == In 1988, Jan L. began producing music on a Commodore 64, in combination with organ sequences. Soon he upgraded to better equipment, suitable for producing high-quality music. In 1991 his first demo tape, called “Syndromic Noise“, was produced. It, and his next demo tape, are usually classified as hard trance. Soon he began performing live at techno parties. This earned him exposure in local techno-trance scenes. His music after this point was darker, and soon evolved to aggrotech/dark electro. This music caught the attention of independent label Dark Dimensions/SCANNER, who signed him in 2003. This was the beginning of X-FUSION as it exists today. He used several neo-classical/orchestral goth musical elements in latest albums, creating a unique crossover of Industrial/Aggrotech and Gothic/Darkwave music. The 2004 album Beyond the Pale reached number 6 on the Deutsche Alternative Charts, and the 2007 album Rotten to the Core reached #16 for the year. In 2008, Vast Abysm went to #2 and in 2009, Ultima Ratio also peaked at #2. ==Noisuf-X== Jan L with Noisuf-X at the E-tropolis Festival 2013, Berlin Noisuf-X is X-Fusion's side project.

The herbs are distilled using a process called semper idem (or \\"always the same\\"). The extracts are then matured for months in barrels made of Slovenian oak. Production ceased in 1939 due to lack of raw materials and was restarted in December 1949. The drink is usually associated with its portion-sized 20 ml bottle, designed in 1949 by Emil Underberg, grandson of the founder. The mini- bottle is protected by a straw paper sleeve, and the embossed Underberg label is glued on. All of its elements, including shape of the bottle, colour, packaging and the Underberg name are trademarked and copyrighted. Notable fans of Underberg in the modern era include MF DOOM, Amon Amarth and Chumlee. To promote the brand, the Underberg company rewards branded merchandise to its users after collecting a certain number of bottlecaps. ==Gallery== File:Underberg.jpgThe 20 ml bottle, wrapped in paper File:Underberg 12x20ml.jpgA metal case containing 12 little bottles of Underberg – 2007 Edition (Theme: Greece) File:Brasilberg.jpgBig Brasilberg bottle, a variety of Underberg sold in Brazil File:Underberg_4804613947_42da6d6764_t.jpgBox with the mini bottles ==See also== *Becherovka *Kräuterlikör *Unicum ==References== ==External links== * Category:German distilled drinks Category:Bitters Category:Herbal liqueurs Category:German brands Category:Purveyors to the Imperial and Royal Court Category:Companies based in North Rhine-Westphalia ","title":"Underberg"},{"id":"2582251","text":"Abercairny is an estate in the Scottish region of Perth and Kinross.

He is known for his anti-elitist views on high culture, as expounded in several books. He has twice chaired the Booker Prize committee, in 1982 and 2004, and chaired the judging panel for the first Man Booker International Prize in 2005. ==Education and career== He was born in Barnes, London, and educated at Richmond and East Sheen Boys' Grammar School, winning an Open Scholarship to St John's College, Oxford. He has held posts in a number of Oxford colleges, and is an emeritus fellow of Merton, where he became a Professor in 1975, retiring in 2002. ==Literary criticism== He has twice chaired the Booker Prize committee, in 1982 and 2004, and chaired the judging panel for the first Man Booker International Prize in 2005. He is chief book reviewer for the London Sunday Times and appears in radio and TV programmes including Saturday Review and Newsnight Review. ==Views== He is known for his anti-elitist views on high culture, as expressed for example in his book What Good Are the Arts? (2005). Carey's 1992 book The Intellectuals and the Masses: Pride and Prejudice among the Literary Intelligentsia, 1880–1939 was a critique of Modernist writers (particularly T. S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf, W. B. Yeats, D. H. Lawrence and H. G. Wells) for what Carey argues were their elitist and misanthropic views of mass society. In his review of the book Geoff Dyer wrote that Carey picked out negative quotations from his subjects. Stefan Collini responded that disdain for mass culture amongst some Modernist writers was already well-known among literary historians. ==Personal== Carey was born in April 1934 in Barnes, then on the Surrey/London border, the youngest of their four recorded children, to Charles W. Carey and Winifred E.

The main character is a ferry on Sydney Harbour named Fred, along with his older sister Kate, two other ferries, Lou and Bill, as well as Jean, a really jolly and colourful submarine. There is also the Captain, a Koala who is always found asleep behind Fred's wheel (due to koalas finding things very difficult to stay awake all day). Fred has a voluntary deck hand named Pete, a \\"know-it-all\\" Pelican (also best known for his catchphrase \\"No Worries!\\") who befriends Fred and follows him around the harbour, assisting Fred and tying him up at Wallaby Wharf. The show was a success during its limited run. It was created by Polka Dot Productions, a company set up by the Producer/Writer John Pye in 1992 with 25 episodes. John Pye, a model maker originally from Dagenham, London, UK, grew up watching the classic British children's TV shows, Ivor the Engine and Noggin the Nog (made by Oliver Postgate's Smallfilms). Not only did Pye write the scripts and the incidental music but was also responsible for making most of the models. The entire series was filmed by Pye and three friends in a loft in the inner Sydney suburb of Surry Hills. The narrator is Jack Osborn, who also provides the voices. A revamp was being made as of 2015; however, no further details have progressed since. ==Characters== *Fred-A yellow ferry, the main character. *Kate-A purple ferry, who is Fred's big sister. *Bill-A blue ferry. *Lou-A red ferry. *Jean-A blue submarine. *Spike-An Echidna mechanic. *Pelican Pete-Fred's constant companion and Deckhand. *Koala-Fred's Captain who is always falling asleep. *Emily-An Emu who loves to shop around the harbour. *Belinda Brushtail-A possum who works as a lighthouse keeper and always sleeps in the daytime. ==Episode list== # Fred Meets Pete (30 March 1992) # Fred's Birthday Party (31 March 1992) # Fred's Sister Kate (1 April 1992) # Fred Goes to the Doctor (2 April 1992) # The Ferry Race (3 April 1992) # Pete The Magician (6 April 1992) # Belinda's Blown Bulb (7 April 1992) # Kate's Lost Bell (8 April 1992) # Major Mitchell's Washing (9 April 1992) # Fred at the Fairground (10 April 1992) # Jean the Submarine (13 April 1992) # Pete's Nephew Percy (14 April 1992) # Fred's Bad Dream (15 April 1992) # Fred Joins a Band (16 April 1992) # Fred and the Seagulls (17 April 1992) # Fred the Floating Zoo (20 April 1992) # Kate the Painter (21 April 1992) # Kate's Fancy Dress Party (22 April 1992) # Fred's Fishing Trip (23 April 1992) # Night Time Noises (24 April 1992) # Pete the Water Skier (27 April 1992) # Kate at the Fairground (28 April 1992) # Fred and the Whales (29 April 1992) # Emily's Lost Shopping (30 April 1992) # Fred Says Goodbye (1 May 1992) ==Credits== * Told by: Jack Osborn * Director of Photography: Lawrence Kirkwood * Production Design: James Sawars * Production Assistant: Paul Lockwood * Models Made and Filmed at: Modelcraft Pty.

He made his first-class cricket debut for Western Australia in November 1959, scoring 89 and returning the figures of 0/49. However, Hawke failed to capitalize on this initial success and returned to South Australia at the end of the 1959/60 cricket season. His cricket also developed enough for him to make his Test debut on 15 February 1963 in the Fifth Ashes Test against England at the Sydney Cricket Ground, scoring 14 and recording match figures of 2/89. Hawke was a member of the 1963/64 Sheffield Shield winning South Australian team, and toured England (where he qualified for the British amateur golf championship and became Fred Trueman's 300th Test victim), India and Pakistan in 1964 and the West Indies in 1965. The West Indies tour found Hawke in top form as he took 24 wickets at 21.83 in the Test series, including match figures of 10–115 in the third Test at Bourda Cricket Ground, Georgetown, Guyana, as well as making his highest score, an unbeaten 45 at Sabina Park, Jamaica. Back in Australia Hawke was the top wicket taker in the 1965–66 Ashes series, taking 16 wickets (26.18) with Garth McKenzie also taking 16, but at the higher average of 29.18. In the Third Test at Sydney England reached 308/2 before Hawke had Colin Cowdrey, M.J.K. Smith, Dave Brown and Jim Parks all caught behind by Wally Grout in succession, and his 7/105 was his best bowling in Tests, but Australia still lost by an innings. In the second innings of the Fourth Test at Adelaide Hawke took 5/54, reducing England to 32/3 and 266 all out as Australia won by an innings to draw the series. Hawke's football career ended in 1966 when he dislocated his right shoulder. A screw was inserted in the point of the shoulder, which not only forced him to retire from football but also greatly affected his bowling. Nonetheless, he played home series against South Africa, Pakistan and India and toured South Africa in 1966–67 and England in 1968, where he played his final Test at Lord's. He finished his career after 27 Tests, 365 runs at 16.59, 91 wickets at 29.41 and a statement by his former Test captain, Richie Benaud, declaring Hawke as one of the finest medium-pace bowlers he had seen. Hawke began playing in the Lancashire League, first for Nelson and then East Lancashire and moved to Launceston, Tasmania to become coach of the Northern Tasmanian Cricket Association. He continued to play in the Lancashire Leagues until 1974 before returning to Adelaide where he worked as a sports journalist and cricket commentator. == Australian rules football == Hawke made his senior Australian rules football debut for South Australian National Football League (SANFL) club Port Adelaide in August 1957. Hawke stamped himself as a future champion when in his third game he kicked 15 goals for Port against South Adelaide before being surprisingly dropped two weeks later. Hawke quit Port at the end of 1957 to try his hand in Western Australia and made his West Australian National Football League (WANFL) debut in 1958 for East Perth Football Club, playing 42 matches and kicking 157 goals in two seasons with the Royals, including East Perth's 1958 and 1959 premierships. Hawke topped the WANFL's goalkicking list in 1959 with 114 goals, represented Western Australia against South Australia and gained local fame for apparently being the first footballer to perfect the drop punt over a long distance. Previously, the drop punt was only used over short distances on wet days but Hawke's innovation was said to have revolutionised the game in Western Australia. Playing for West Torrens Football Club in the SANFL and South Australia in the Sheffield Shield, Hawke continued to star in both football and cricket. Hawke was part of the 1963 South Australian football team that defeated Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground; the first time South Australia had won at the MCG since 1926, and in so doing became the first (and still the only) person to have represented both South Australia and Western Australia in Australian Rules football and cricket. == Later years == In July 1980, Hawke ate some peanuts which precipitated a total blocking of his bowel, requiring surgery. During surgery, infection set in and spread rapidly through his body, leading to multiple organ failure. Over the next two years Hawke suffered twelve cardiac arrests, gangrene, had a further thirty operations and was drip fed over that period. His survival was considered a medical marvel by doctors and he was the subject of study by researchers on how long a patient could be drip fed. In 1990, Hawke suffered heart failure and then blood poisoning, central nervous system damage, cirrhosis of the liver and later contracted Hepatitis B and C before a brain dysfunction in 1996 severely impaired his speech and led to severe bouts of depression. Due to his mounting medical expenses, Hawke sought to sell some of his cricket memorabilia in England. Unfortunately, the man to whom he entrusted the memorabilia, a fellow cricket writer, was later found to have pocketed the profits of the sale while informing Hawke the items had been damaged in transit.* Blake, M. (1994) \\"The Sorry Saga of the Stricken Test Bowler's 'vanishing' Memorabilia\\", p.8, The Age, 8 January 1994. In his final years the former hellraiser Hawke became a born again Christian and joined the evangelical Assemblies of God church. He died in Adelaide on Christmas Day, 2000, aged 61, survived by his third wife Beverley and a daughter, Janet, from his first marriage. Tributes poured in from throughout the sporting world: on day two of the 2000 Boxing Day Test, the Australian players wore black armbands as a mark of respect; the South Australian Government created the Neil Hawke Scholarship for young sportspeople and obituaries claimed that he was the finest all-round sportsman South Australia had produced. ==References== * Campbell, L.

Thus in essence the building is a central tower with lower wings on either side. ==History== To the best of common knowledge the building now dubbed the 'Palombarone' was originally erected in 1580 as the summer residence for the local Archbishop, also the Governor of the Basilica of the Holy House of nearby Loreto. It was a property of the Roman Catholic Church. It dominated the landscape for miles around due to its elevated position. Its presumed nature as an ecclesiastical residence may be not entirely accurate due to the presence of small square slanted breaches which are scattered across the tower section of the building. The purpose of these holes is not known but two principal theories exist - they are either the holes through which small cannons could be discharged, thus making the Palombarone a small fort used to guard an ancient border between lands now forgotten, or more probably to protect against Turkish invasions of the 16th century – the Ottomans were at the gates of Vienna at this time; or the holes served as perches for carrier pigeons - who were used extensively at this time and a thriving local market in the bird existed in this period. The building is believed to have fallen into disrepair with the end of the Papal States in the 1860s – it was probably around that time that local families moved in and rented the properties surrounding this property (which to this day is used as vineyards). The farmer-occupiers of the property eventually left the property in the mid-1970s and the building was abandoned. Extensive renovations to the property occurred in 1896 (as a simple marble plaque states on the front of the building) and again most probably in the 1950s. In 2000, the property was bought by the great-granddaughter of a woman who was born in the building a century and half before, Renata Simonetti Giorgi. She and her family have been renovating the dilapidated building since mid-2002 in an attempt to restore it to its former glory years of the late 16th century and as can be seen from the photo, huge progress has been made. ==Architecture== The building is in the 16th-century style of the local area, with masterful arches and a domed interior. The walls are extraordinarily thick, which tends to hold the interior temperature cool in the summer and warm in winter. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in le Marche ","title":"Palombarone"},{"id":"2582299","text":"Evelyn Lucy Colyer (later Munro, 16 August 1902 – 4 November 1930) was a female tennis player from Great Britain.

Abercastle has a working harbour which is managed by Abercastle Boat Owners Association. In 1876, The harbour was the landing-site of the first Atlantic Ocean single-handed sailing, west-to-east, starting from Gloucester, Massachusetts, by Alfred \\"Centennial\\" Johnson. ==History== Abercastle is an old trading harbour which exported local slate and grain, limestone, butter, honey, corn, and some coal. There are also the remains of nineteenth century limekilns. ==Alfred Johnson memorial== Alfred Johnson plaque Alfred Johnson landed at Abercastle on Saturday, August 12, 1876, after 66 days sailing from Gloucester, Massachusetts, becoming the first person to make the single-handed Atlantic crossing. Johnson, a Danish born fisherman used a small dory named 'Centennial'. He managed an average pace of about 70 miles (110 km) a day, quite respectable for such a small boat in the open sea, and survived a gale which capsized the boat. A plaque made of Welsh Slate is on the quay wall near the slipway and was unveiled by Alfred Johnson's grandson, Charlie Dickman on October 17, 2003. Local author Rob Morris has also written a book about the crossing called Alfred \\"Centennial\\" Johnson. St Davids poet Tony Davies also dedicated the following to Alfred Johnson: > Sixty six days, three thousand miles, > Record breaking, Abercastle smiles, > Liverpool, trip complete, > The courage of Captain Johnson and Centennial’s feat. > ==Carreg Samson== Carreg Samson Carreg Samson, also known as 'Carreg Sampson', Samson's Stone and the 'Longhouse' is a 5,000-year-old Neolithic Burial Chamber and the site of over 1,000 burials. Half a mile west of the Abercastle near the Pembrokeshire Coast Path, it has a cap stone 15 feet long and 9 feet wide supported on three of the seven upright stones. It is thought to have been a portal dolmen and was built over a pit. It is called 'Samson' because of a local legend that Samson placed it in position with his little finger. The whole burial chamber was once covered by a mound of earth or stones and once these were removed stones were used to block the holes in the sides of the tomb so that it could be used as a shelter for sheep. Excavations in 1968 found an early Neolithic bowl. ==Facilities== The harbour faces northwest and is therefore sheltered from south-westerly gales, providing a safe haven for the local fishing fleet. There is a public telephone and free parking for a small number of cars. The slipway goes to soft sand and is not suitable for non off-road vehicles. The coastal bus “The Strumble Shuttle” calls at Abercastle. ==Activities== Fishing boats at Abercastle Popular for fishing and diving, there are also several recorded climbing sites in the area although they are suitable for group use. The harbour is a good launching site for sea kayaking. The coastal path that follows the coast of Pembrokeshire passes through Abercastle, and is popular with tourists and local walking groups. ==Shipwreck== The 3,800 ton wreck of SS Leysian lies on the west side of the harbour, about 50m from the cliffs. She ran aground and sank a few months later in 1917 with no loss of life. As it is at a depth of around 15m the wreck is popular with divers who report much wreckage, and a large range of fish, including a large pollock which lives in the wreck. A small shark has also been reported nearby. A detailed survey of the wreck began in June 2019. ==References== == External links == * Alfred 'Centennial' Johnson * Photos of Abercastle and surrounding area on geograph.org.uk Category:Villages in Pembrokeshire Category:Coast of Pembrokeshire ","title":"Abercastle"},{"id":"2582311","text":"Icon of the Protection, 19th century, Russia The Intercession of the Theotokos, or the Protection of Our Most Holy Lady Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary, is a feast of the Mother of God celebrated in the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic Churches. The feast celebrates the protection afforded the faithful through the intercessions of the Theotokos (lit. Mother of God, the Eastern title of the Virgin Mary). In the Slavic Orthodox Churches it is celebrated as the most important solemnity besides the Twelve Great Feasts and Pascha. The feast is commemorated in Eastern Orthodoxy as a whole, but by no means as fervently as it is in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. It is not a part of the ritual traditions of, and therefore is not celebrated by, the Oriental Orthodox Churches or some jurisdictions that allow Western Rite Orthodoxy. Yet the feast is perfectly consistent with the theology of these sister churches. It is celebrated on October 14 (OS October 1).\\"Protection of the Holy Virgin\\", Tranfiguration of Our Laord Russian Orthodox Church, Baltimore, Maryland The Western Rite Communities of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia (ROCOR) do celebrate this feast on their calendar (www.rocor-wr.org). ==Etymology== The Protection of the Theotokos or the Intercession of the Theotokos (, Pokrov, , Pokrova), like the (, Skepḗ) has a complex meaning. First of all, it refers to a cloak or shroud, but it also means protection or intercession. For this reason, the name of the feast is variously translated as the Veil of Our Lady, the Protecting Veil of the Theotokos. It is often translated as Feast of the Intercession or Feast of the Holy Protection. With some reservations, the Pokrov icon may be related to the Western Virgin of Mercy image, in which the Virgin spreads wide her cloak to cover and protect a group of kneeling supplicants (first known from Italy from about 1280). == Tradition == Russian icon of Pokrov Icon, showing a broad protective cloak. Mid 17th century, Ukraine. According to Eastern Orthodox Sacred Tradition, the apparition of Mary the Theotokos occurred during the 10th century at the Blachernae church in Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) where several of her relics (her robe, veil, and part of her belt) were kept. On Sunday, October 1 at four in the morning, St. Andrew the Blessed Fool-for-Christ, who was a Slav by birth, saw the dome of the church open and the Virgin Mary enter, moving in the air above him, glowing and surrounded by angels and saints. She knelt and prayed with tears for all faithful Christians in the world. The Virgin Mary asked Her Son, Jesus Christ, to accept the prayers of all the people entreating Him and looking for Her protection. Once Her prayer was completed, She walked to the altar and continued to pray. Afterwards, She spread Her veil over all the people in the church as a protection. St. Andrew turned to his disciple, St. Epiphanius, who was standing near him, and asked, \\"Do you see, brother, the Holy Theotokos, praying for all the world?\\" Epiphanius answered, \\"Yes, Holy Father, I see it and am amazed!\\" According to the Primary Chronicle of St. Nestor the Chronicler, the inhabitants of Constantinople called upon the intercession of the Mother of God to protect them from an attack by a large Rus' army (Rus' was still pagan at the time). According to Nestor, the feast celebrates the destruction of this fleet sometime in the ninth century. ==Icon== The icon of the feast, which is not found in Byzantine art, depicts in its upper part the Virgin Mary surrounded by a luminous aureole. She holds in her outstreched arms an orarion or veil, which symbolizes the protection of her intercession. To either side of her stand numerous saints and angels, many of whom are recognizable to the experienced church-goer: the apostles, John the Baptist, St. Nicholas of Myra, etc. Below, St. Andrew the Fool for Christ is depicted, pointing up at the Virgin Mary and turning to his disciple Epiphanius. Usually, the veil with which the Virgin protects mankind is small and held either in her outstretched hands or by two angels, though a version similar to the Western European Virgin of Mercy image, with a larger cloak covering people is found in some Eastern Orthodox icons. == Feast== The Holy Virgin protecting the Ukrainian cossack hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky (at the right of image). Late 17 to early 18th century, Ukraine. The Feast of the Intercession commemorates the miracle as a joyous revelation of the Theotokos' protection, which is spread over the world, and the Mother of God’s great love for mankind. It is a religious holy day or feast day of the Byzantine Rite Eastern Orthodox Churches. It is not found in Oriental Orthodoxy nor some jurisdictions of Western Rite Orthodoxy though it is perfectly consistent with the theology and beliefs of these sister churches. It is held annually on October 14, which corresponds to October 1 on the \\"Old Style calendar\\" i.e. the Julian calendar still used in some Eastern Orthodox Churches. It is served as an All-Night Vigil, with many of the same elements as occur on Great Feasts of the Theotokos. However, Pokrov has no Afterfeast. The Western Rite Communities of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia (ROCOR) do celebrate this feast on their calendar. (www.rocor-wr.org) Some, but not all, regions of the Russian Federation celebrate the Feast of Intercession as a work holiday. In Ukraine, it is celebrated on October 14 as a religious, national, and family holiday. The Mother of God as the Intercessor and Patron became firmly established among Ukrainians: princes, kings, cossacks, and hetmans chose the Mother of God as their patroness and protectress. An icon in the National Art Museum of Ukraine shows the Virgin Mary protecting the Ukrainian cossack hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky. By decree of the Ukrainian President, October 14 — Pokrova Feast Day was promulgated also as Ukrainian Cossack Day (). October 1 (in the Julian calendar) is also the feast of St. Romanus the Melodist, so he is often depicted on the same icon, even though he and St. Andrew lived at different times. He is often shown directly below the Virgin Mary, standing on a bema, or on a kathedra, chanting from a scroll. The scroll represents the various kontakia which have been attributed to him. The feast day of St. Andrew, the Fool-for-Christ, falls on the following day, October 2 (in accordance with the Orthodox liturgical tradition of the Synaxis). == Churches dedicated to Pokrov == Pokrov Cathedral on the Moat, better known as Saint Basil's Cathedral Many Orthodox churches worldwide are named after this feast. The first churches dedicated to feast of Pokrov appeared in Russia in the 12th century. Probably the most famous Russian church named for the feast day is Saint Basil's Cathedral, Red Square, Moscow, which is officially entitled \\"the Church of Intercession of Our Lady that Is on the Moat\\" () or shortly \\"Intercession Cathedral upon moat\\" (). p. 126. The other one is the Church of Intercession in Bogolyubovo near Vladimir on the Nerl River (, Tserkov Pokrova na Nerli). Both churches are on the United Nations' World Heritage List, the latter as part of the site White Monuments of Vladimir and Suzdal. There is also a Church of the Intercession of the Holy Virgin in St. Petersburg.St. Petersburg website. Accessed February 7, 2010. Other notable churches commemorating this feast are Intercession of the Holy Virgin Russian Orthodox Church in Manchester, England,Pokrov Church of the Russian Orthodox church website from UK. Accessed February 7, 2010. and the Russian Orthodox Church of the Intercession of the Holy Virgin & St. Sergius in Glen Cove, New York. Saint Mary the Protectress in Irondequoit, New York is a notable Ukrainian Orthodox Church dedicated to the feast of Pokrova. A great many Ukrainian churches are also named in honour of this feast in Canada. In north Wales there is the Church of the Holy Protection (Eglwys yr Amddiffyniad Sanctaidd) at 10 Manod Road, Blaenau Ffestiniog, where the liturgy is celebrated partly in Welsh, also English, Greek, and Church Slavonic. The church, under Archimandrite Deiniol, is under the omophor the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the diocese of Western Europe under the Ecumenical Patriarch. Previously it belonged to the Belarusian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, and previous to that to the Diocese of Sourozh of the Moscow Patriarchate. == See also == * Blachernitissa * Western Mater Misericordia imagery * The Protecting Veil, a musical work by John Tavener, inspired by the Orthodox feast * Defender of Ukraine Day == Notes == == References == == Bibliography == * Покров Пресвятой Богородицы The article was used for iconography description. * Basil Lourié.

A police drama series, the action was centred on members of the Special Branch anti-espionage and anti-terrorist department of the London Metropolitan Police. ==Production== The first two series were shot mainly in a studio on videotape with filmed location inserts; a standard method of the time but one which suffered from jarring differences in picture quality between interior and exterior scenes. The location scenes of some episodes were shot on outside broadcast cameras, leading to smoother transitions between location and studio work for those episodes. Series 1 and 2 starred Derren Nesbitt as Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Jordan, working to Detective Superintendent Eden (Wensley Pithey) and subsequently Det. Supt. Inman (Fulton Mackay). The episodes featuring Eden (the first nine of Series 1) were recorded in black and white, while all subsequent episodes were recorded on colour videotape. The show was revamped in 1973 after Thames Television's Euston Films subsidiary took over production using film, which allowed for a less studio-based series. Euston Films had pioneered the technique of shooting action and adventure series entirely on location using 16mm film, for a more gritty and realistic look. These episodes starred George Sewell as DCI Alan Craven and Roger Rowland as Bill North. In series 3 episode 2, Patrick Mower debuted as Craven's colleague and often antagonist, DCI Tom Haggerty. By the 1974 series Bill North had been axed, having had a nervous breakdown, though he returned for one episode later in the run. Representing the Ministry in the first two series was Moxon, and later Strand, who appeared in the fourth series. Played by Morris Perry and Paul Eddington respectively, Moxon and Strand were similar: supercilious civil servants who kept an unwanted eye on the detectives and their budgets. They sometimes manipulated them in order to pursue obscure matters of state, such as in the first series episode \\"Reliable Sources\\", where Moxon connives to have Eden sidelined into a Home Office working party role. The theme music for series 1 was by Norman Kay. For series 2, 3 and 4 it was by Robert Sharples under the pseudonym Robert Earley. The 1973/74 series of this police drama is notable for being the first production by Euston Films, later responsible for such series as The Sweeney and Minder. The influence on The Sweeney is clear, although the rough- and-tumble nature of that show is fairly lacking in Special Branch. Both Sewell and Mower later starred as villains in The Sweeney, while Sweeney star Dennis Waterman appeared in the 1974 Special Branch episode \\"Stand and Deliver\\" as a criminal. Mower later went on to star in the 1977–78 BBC police series Target. The 1973 and 1974 series have been released on Region Two DVD by Network, and both sets include an episode from the original Thames TV series. The 1969 series was released as a four-disc DVD set by Network in January 2007, and the 1970 series was released as a Website Exclusive in November 2007. All four series were released on DVD by Network in 2008, in a 16-disc box-set featuring all 53 episodes. Other actors appearing included: Paul Darrow (\\"Short Change\\"), Garfield Morgan and Rula Lenska (\\"Something About A Soldier\\"), Jacqueline Pearce (\\"Catherine The Great\\"), Cyd Hayman (\\"Rendezvous\\"), Susan Jameson as Detective Sergeant Mary Holmes (\\"Date of Birth\\", \\"Intercept\\", and \\"Downwind of Angels\\"), John Bindon (\\"Intercept\\"), Peter Bowles and Janet Key (\\"Downwind of Angels\\"), Nicolette McKenzie (\\"Diversion\\"), Denis Lill (\\"Diversion\\"), Kenneth Colley (\\"Date of Birth\\") and Stephanie Beacham (\\"Threat\\").

Set in space, the science fiction game follows the Kushan exiles of the planet Kharak after their home planet is destroyed by the Taiidan Empire in retaliation for developing hyperspace jump technology. The survivors journey with their spacecraft-constructing mothership to reclaim their ancient homeworld of Hiigara from the Taiidan, encountering a variety of pirates, mercenaries, traders, and rebels along the way. In each of the game's levels, the player gathers resources, builds a fleet, and uses it to destroy enemy ships and accomplish mission objectives. The player's fleet carries over between levels, and can travel in a fully three-dimensional space within each level rather than being limited to a two-dimensional plane. Homeworld was created over two years, and was the first game developed by Relic. Studio co- founders Alex Garden and Luke Moloney served as the director and lead programmer for the game, respectively. The initial concept for the game's story is credited to writer David J. Williams, while the script itself was written by Martin Cirulis and the background lore was written by author Arinn Dembo. The music of the game was written by composer Paul Ruskay as the first title from his Studio X Labs, with the exception of Samuel Barber's 1936 Adagio for Strings, considered the defining theme of the game, and a licensed track from English rock band Yes, \\"Homeworld (The Ladder)\\". Homeworld is listed by review aggregator Metacritic as the highest rated computer game of 1999, and the fourth-highest on any platform for the year. Critics praised the game's graphics, unique gameplay elements, and multiplayer system, though opinions were divided on the game's plot and high difficulty. The game sold over 500,000 copies in its first six months, and received several awards and nominations for best strategy game of the year and best game of the year. A release of the game's source code in 2003 sparked unofficial ports to macOS and Linux, and three more games in the Homeworld series have been produced: Homeworld: Cataclysm (2000), Homeworld 2 (2003), and Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak (2016). Gearbox Software purchased the rights to the series from then- owners THQ in 2013, and released a remastered collection of Homeworld and Homeworld 2 in 2015 for Windows and macOS which was also highly regarded. Gearbox announced the fifth game in the series, Homeworld 3, on August 30, 2019; the game development is being crowdfunded through Fig, and is slated for a Q4 2022 release. ==Gameplay== Homeworld is a real-time strategy game set in space. Gameplay, as in most real-time strategy titles, is focused on gathering resources, building military forces, and using them to destroy enemy forces and accomplish an objective. The game includes both single-player and multiplayer modes; the single-player mode consists of one story-driven campaign, broken up into levels. In each level, the player has an objective to accomplish before they can end the level, though the ultimate objective of the mission can change as the level's story unfolds. Between each of the 16 levels is a hand-drawn, black-and-white cutscene with narrative voiceovers. alt=A group of enemy ships attack the burning mothership with beam and missile weapons The central ship of the player's fleet is the mothership, a large base which can construct other ships; unlike other spacecraft, in the single-player campaign the mothership is unable to move. Present in each level are stationary rocks or dust clouds, which can be mined by specialized harvesting ships (resource collectors) which then empty their loads at the mothership in the form of \\"resources\\", the game's only currency. Resources can be spent by the player on building new ships, which are constructed by the mothership. Buildable ships come in a variety of types, which are discovered over the course of the game. They include resource collectors, fighters and corvettes, frigates, destroyers, and heavy cruisers, as well as specialized non-combat ships such as research vessels and repair corvettes. Fighter ships need to dock with support ships or return to the mothership periodically to refuel, while salvage corvettes can capture enemy ships and tow them to the mothership to become part of the player's fleet. In some levels, new ship types can be unlocked by capturing an enemy ship of that type, through research performed at the research vessel, or through plot elements. At the beginning of the campaign, the player may select between controlling the \\"Kushan\\" or \\"Taiidan\\" fleet; this affects the designs of the ships and changes some of the specialized ship options, but has no effect on the plot or gameplay. Each level's playable area is a sphere, bisected by a circular plane. Ships can be directed to move anywhere in that sphere, either singularly or in groups. The game's camera can be set to follow any ship and view them from any angle, as well as display the ship's point of view. The player may also view the \\"Sensors Manager\\", wherein they can view the entire game map along with all visible ships. Ships can be grouped into formations, such as wedges or spheres, in order to provide tactical advantages during combat with enemy ships. Non-specialized ships are equipped with weapons to fire upon enemy ships, which include ballistic guns, beam weapons, and missiles. As a ship is damaged by weapons its health bar depletes, visual effects such as fire and smoke are added, and it can eventually explode. When all mission objectives are completed, the player is given the option to make a hyperspace jump to end the level. This may be postponed in order to gather more resources or build more ships. When the hyperspace jump is initiated, all fighters and corvettes return to the mothership while larger ships line up next to it, and blue rectangles pass over the ships and teleport them to the next level. The player retains their fleet between levels, and the difficulty of each mission is adjusted to a small extent based on how many ships are in the player's fleet at the beginning of each level. In multiplayer games, the objective is typically to destroy or capture the enemy mothership(s), though other battle- oriented victory conditions are available. In this game mode, the mothership is capable of slow movement, and all research options permitted by the map are available via a technology tree, rather than dependent on a plot point. Multiple maps are available, as are options to turn off the need to research technologies or fuel consumption for smaller ships. ==Plot== alt=Black-and- white drawing of a small woman, connected to wires, in front of wide open door, with two queues of large, suited soldiers in \\"at attention\\" pose flanking her either sides A century prior to the start of the game, the Kushan, humanoid inhabitants of the desert planet Kharak, discovered a spaceship buried in the sands, which holds a stone map marking Kharak and another planet across the galaxy labelled \\"Hiigara\\", meaning \\"home\\". The discovery united the clans of Kharak, who knew they were not indigenous to Kharak and craved to solve the mystery of how they came to this hostile planet. Together, they spent the next century developing and building a giant mothership that would carry 600,000 people to Hiigara, with neuroscientist Karan S'jet neurally wired into the ship as Fleet Command to replace an unsustainably large crew. The game opens with the maiden voyage of the mothership, testing the hyperspace drive which teleports the fleet to a new destination. Instead of the support ship that was expected to be there, the mothership finds a hostile alien fleet. After defeating them, the mothership returns to Kharak, to discover that the planet has been razed by another alien fleet, and that only the 600,000 migrants in suspended animation have survived. A captured enemy captain claims that the Kharak genocide was the consequence of their violation of a 4,000-year-old treaty between the interstellar Taiidan Empire and the Kushan, which forbids the latter from developing hyperspace technology. After destroying the remnants of both alien fleets, the nascent Kushan fleet sets out for Hiigara, intent on reclaiming their ancient homeworld. Their multi-stage journey across the galaxy takes them through asteroid fields, a giant nebula, a ship graveyard and several Taiidan outposts. Along the way, they fight other descendants of their Hiigaran ancestors who have turned to piracy. They also meet the Bentusi, a race of traders, who sell them advanced technology. After discovering that the Bentusi have given aid to the exiles, the Taiidan attempt to destroy them, but are stopped by the Kushan fleet. The Bentusi then reveal that the Kushan had once ruled their own empire, before being destroyed by the Taiidan and exiled from Hiigara. In gratitude for the Kushan's intervention, they promise to summon the Galactic Council to consider the Kushan's claim to Hiigara. As their journey continues, the Kushan fleet gives sanctuary to the Taiidan rebel Captain Elson. With his help, they rally a rebellion to distract the Taiidan fleets. He aids them in penetrating the Hiigaran system blockade, and in engaging the central Taiidan fleet led by the Taiidan emperor. The emperor manages to knock Karan into a coma for the duration of the battle, but the combined Kushan and rebel fleets defeat the Taiidan regardless. The Galactic Council arrives shortly thereafter and confirms the Kushan's claim to Hiigara, a lush world in contrast to the desert planet of Kharak. When the Kushan make landfall, Karan insists that she be the last one to set foot on the planet. ==Development== Relic Entertainment was founded in Vancouver, Canada, on June 1, 1997, and began work on Homeworld as their first title. Relic co-founders Alex Garden and Luke Moloney served as the director and lead programmer for the game, respectively, while Erin Daly was the designer and Aaron Kambeitz the lead artist. Garden was 22 years old when he founded the company. Writer David J. Williams is credited with the original story concept, while the script itself was written by Martin Cirulis and the background lore was written by author Arinn Dembo. Cirulis and Dembo, credited jointly as \\"Marcus Skyler\\", were selected by the publisher, Sierra Studios, partway through development to expand the story concept of Relic and Williams. Sierra agreed to publish the game early in development based on, according to Garden, \\"two whiteboard presentations and no demo\\". The development of the game took over two years; the game systems were largely complete by the final eight months, which Relic spent polishing and improving the game, including adding the whole-map Sensors Manager view. In a February 1999 interview, Garden said the game's testers had found it to be much harder to play than it was for the developers, leading to the addition of features like short briefings at the beginning of levels to explain new concepts. The game was initially expected to be released at the end of 1998; Garden stated in a 1999 interview that the team found creating the core game itself much easier than getting it to the quality level they wanted, and that if they had known how difficult it was going to be they may have chosen not to do the project. He claimed that Sierra did not put much pressure on the studio to release the game before it was ready, and that Relic felt much more pressure from impatient fans. Several ideas for the game, including ship customization, convoy routes, and different unit types for the Kushan and Taiidan fleets were cut during development as they could not be done well enough for the project. Relic did not specifically set out to create a real-time strategy game; Garden and Relic were primarily focused on making a game with exciting large-scale space battles, and chose the genre in order to support that. As a result, they did not try to make innovative gameplay changes in the real-time strategy genre, but instead worked on making implementing the genre in a fully 3D space to make the space battles they envisioned. Garden told Computer Games Magazine in 1998 that \\"there's no sort of design philosophy behind it. The fact that it's real-time strategy was almost a fluke.\\" The original Star Wars film trilogy was one of the game's primary inspirations, along with the 1970s television series Battlestar Galactica: in a 1998 interview with PC Zone, Garden stated that his original concept for the game was \\"a 3D game that looked like you were watching Star Wars but had a storyline like Battlestar Galactica\\". He drew further inspiration from correcting what he felt were the limitations of the first-person space flight game Star Wars: X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter. He felt that having the player control a ship from a cockpit view detracted from the feeling of the overall battles, and so chose to have the player control a whole fleet from an external view. According to art director Rob Cunningham, the visual design of the game was inspired by the sci-fi art by Peter Elson, Chris Foss, and John Harris, as well by Star Wars movies and Masamune Shirow. The vertical design of the mothership and the horizontal galaxy in the background were intended to give the player a visual alignment to orient themselves in 3D space. The focus on the combat drove several other areas of focus for the development team: according to Garden, Relic spent considerable effort on making high-quality ship models, computer-controlled flight tactics, and maneuvers like immelmann turns because \\"everyone is going to zoom right in on the first battle, just to watch\\". They felt that the advanced unit-level maneuvers in the context of large fleet-wide battles would increase immersion in the game for players, and create a \\"Star Wars feeling\\" to the battles. To accentuate this, instead of recording stock sound files for units to use when maneuvering, the team instead recorded several thousand smaller clips which are combined to describe exactly which ships were taking which action, and are then modified by the game's audio engine to reflect the position and motion of the ships relative to the player's camera. The working title for the game was Spaghetti Ball, chosen for Garden's early vision of the battles in the game as a mass of tangled flight paths as ships maneuvered around each other, contained within a larger sphere of available space. Although early previews expressed concern about the difficulties of controlling so many ships in 3D space, according to Garden the team felt that moving the game's camera and controlling the fleet were two wholly separate actions, and by treating them as such it made designing them and using them much simpler. The sound design, audio production, and music composition for the game was contracted to composer Paul Ruskay and Studio X Labs, which he founded in February 1999 after starting on Homeworld in October 1998. In addition to his original music compositions, Ruskay used a recording of the 1936 piece for string orchestra by Samuel Barber, Adagio for Strings, in an early scene in the game when the player finds the destruction of Kharak. The piece, in turn, became a central theme on the soundtrack. Adagio for Strings was proposed by Garden, who heard it on the radio and felt it fit the mood of the game \\"perfectly\\"; Ruskay had a new recording of the piece made by a University of California choir, as the license fees for the recording Garden heard were too high for the studio. The closing song of the game, \\"Homeworld (The Ladder)\\", was composed for the game by English rock band Yes. Yes were in Vancouver at the time recording The Ladder, and learned of the in-development Homeworld. Lead singer Jon Anderson was interested in writing something based on a videogame, and wrote the lyrics to fit with the game. The soundtrack was released in a 13-track album that was bundled with the Game of the Year Edition of Homeworld in May 2000, and again in a 37-track Homeworld Remastered Original Soundtrack digital album alongside the Homeworld Remastered Collection in March 2015. ==Reception== Homeworld was highly regarded by critics upon release; it is listed by review aggregator Metacritic as the highest rated computer game of 1999, and the fourth-highest on any platform for the year. The graphics were highly praised; Michael Ryan of GameSpot claimed it had \\"some of the most impressive graphics ever\\", while Jason Levine of Computer Games Magazine said that \\"no game—ever—has made space itself look like this\\". Eurogamer's review praised the \\"big, brash and colourful\\" backgrounds, which was echoed by Levine and John Keefer of GameSpy. Multiple reviewers, such as Vincent Lopez of IGN, also praised the detail and variety of the spaceships, and Jason Samuel of GamePro noted that Relic was able to use their graphics engine to create the game's intricate cutscenes rather than relying on prerecorded videos. Greg Fortune of Computer Gaming World added that the rotatable camera was one of the \\"real joys of the game\\", allowing the player to view the action from any angle or ship's viewpoint and \\"creating an impressively sweeping cinematic feel\\". The sound and music were also lauded; Levine claimed the sound was \\"on par with the graphics\\", praising how it changed when the player zoomed into or away from a battle, while Eurogamer and Lopez applauded the \\"atmospheric\\" soundtrack for creating the mood of the game. The gameplay advances were also highly praised by critics: Lopez claimed that \\"Relic not only tackled space, but may have just changed strategy games forever.\\" Reviewers praised the full 3D nature of the game as elevating it from its otherwise standard real-time strategy gameplay systems; Levine said that the 3D was what made the game unique, and Ryan explicitly termed the base gameplay as \\"fairly similar to any tried-and-true real-time strategy game\\" but said that the 3D elements and connected mission structure turned it into a \\"different breed\\" of game. Fortune, however, focused instead on the difficulty of the missions themselves, praising the challenge and variety of tactics needed to complete the game and lauding it for having \\"some of the best fleet battles ever seen in a computer game\\". Levine, Ryan, Keefer, and Lopez all noted the connected mission structure as an innovation in the genre: by limiting the resources to build ships and pulling the same fleet through the missions, Homeworld converted what would usually be a set of disconnected missions into \\"chapters\\" of a continuous game. They felt this connected the player to their fleet as more than disposable units, and added a level of strategy to the game. Keefer and Levine did note, however, that this added a great deal of difficulty to the game, especially for more casual players, as the player could make decisions in earlier levels that rendered later ones very difficult to complete without an explicit difficulty level to counteract it. Ryan and Keefer also considered the 3D movement disorienting at first, though Levine and Samuel said the controls were \\"as easy as possible\\". Homeworlds single-player plot received mixed reviews; Lopez claimed it would keep players \\"rapt with attention\\", Samuel summarized it as a \\"superb story\\", and Levine said that it was \\"the first computer game to capture the grandeur and epic feel of the Star Wars movies\\". The Eurogamer review, however, considered it only \\"(mostly) engaging\\", and Keefer said that \\"although the story line is fluid and intriguing\\", for each mission \\"the overall theme is the same: Kill the enemy\\", while Ryan criticized the length for such a \\"meager single-player game\\". The multiplayer gameplay was praised, especially against human opponents: Levine stated that \\"multiplayer in Homeworld is a joy\\", while the Eurogamer review called it the game's strongest part. The Eurogamer review, along with Samuel, also called the multiplayer mode more difficult and engaging than the single-player game. ==Legacy== Homeworld was released to strong sales and won multiple awards; it sold more than 250,000 copies in its initial weeks, and over 500,000 in its first six months. In the United States alone, the game's sales surpassed 95,000 copies by the end of 1999, while sales in Germany reached 60,000 units by April 2000. It debuted in third place on Germany's computer game sales rankings for October 1999, before dropping to 25th, 31st and 32nd in the following three months, respectively. Homeworld also received a \\"Silver\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. Homeworld won Best Strategy Game at the 1999 Game Critics Awards prior to release, and was nominated for Computer Game of the Year and Computer Strategy Game of the Year at the 2000 Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Interactive Achievement Awards. It was awarded Game of the Year by IGN and PC Gamer, won Strategy Game of the Year by Computer Gaming World and was nominated for the same by Computer Games Magazine, and won Best Original Storyline and Best Original Score at the 2000 Eurogamer Gaming Globes awards. It also won PC Gamers \\"Special Achievement in Music\\" and \\"Special Achievement in Art Direction\\" prizes. Maximum PC claimed in 2003 that Homeworld \\"did what no game had successfully done before: create a truly three-dimensional space-combat strategy game\\". HardwareMAG similarly claimed the \\"revolutionary\\" and \\"ground-breaking\\" status of the game in the real-time strategy genre in 2004, as did Computer Gaming World in 2003. Homeworld inspired a series of real-time strategy games in the same universe, beginning in September 2000 when Sierra Studios released a stand-alone expansion by Barking Dog Studios, Homeworld: Cataclysm. Taking place 15 years after the events of Homeworld, the story centers on Kiith Somtaaw—a Hiigaran clan—and its struggles to protect Hiigara from a parasitic entity known as the Beast. A full sequel, Homeworld 2, was developed by Relic Entertainment and released by Sierra in late 2003. The game, set a century after the original Homeworld, pits the Hiigarans against a powerful, nomadic raider race called the Vaygr. A fourth game in the series, Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak, was developed by Blackbird Interactive and published by Gearbox Software in 2016. A prequel to the series, it is set on the planet of Kharak instead of in space, and features a war between Kushan clans during the discovery of the buried spaceship from Homeworld. Gearbox announced the fifth game in the series, Homeworld 3, on August 30, 2019; the game development is being crowdfunded through Fig, and is slated for a Q4 2022 release. Additionally, in 2003 Relic released the source code for Homeworld under license to members of the Relic Developer Network. The source code became the base of several source ports to alternative platforms, such as Linux. ==Remaster== alt=A group of enemy space ships attack the burning mothership with beam and missile weapons. In 2004, Relic Entertainment was bought by THQ, which confirmed in 2007 that it had acquired the rights to the series from Relic and Sierra. No further game in the series was made before THQ declared bankruptcy in 2013; on April 22, 2013, Gearbox Software announced that they had bought the rights to the series at auction for US$1.35 million. On July 19, 2013, Gearbox announced the production of remakes of Homeworld and Homeworld 2 as Homeworld HD, later renamed Homeworld Remastered Collection. The following month, collection producer Brian Burleson stated that Gearbox had purchased the property with the express purpose of making a collection including the original and remastered versions of the game. He also noted that neither game had code in a releasable or playable state when purchased, and they ended up recreating many of the original development tools with the assistance of the Homeworld mod community. A later posting by a developer at Gearbox further praised the mod community for their assistance in getting the original code to be playable on modern computers. The stand-alone expansion Homeworld: Cataclysm was not announced for a remake, despite the outspoken interest of Gearbox, as they were unable to find the original source code for the game. Released digitally on February 25, 2015, for Windows computers by Gearbox and on August 6, 2015, for macOS by Aspyr Media, the collection includes the original and remastered versions of the two games. A retail edition of the PC version of the game was released by Ubisoft on May 7, 2015. In addition to compatibility fixes for modern computers, the \\"classic\\" version of Homeworld removes local multiplayer and the licensed Yes song; the \\"remastered\\" version adds a new game engine for the two games, and upgraded visuals, graphical effects, models, and sound. It also initially removed some functionality not present in Homeworld 2, such as the fuel system, ballistic projectile modeling, and tactical ship formations; some of these were restored in a 2016 patch. As of February 2017, Steam Spy estimates that over 700,000 copies of the Homeworld Remastered Collection have been sold on the Steam distribution platform. The remastered version was warmly received by critics; reviewers such as IGN's Dan Stapleton and Game Informers Daniel Tack praised the story as still \\"fantastic\\" and \\"emotional\\", while Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot claimed that the gameplay was still entertaining 16 years later, and Tom Senior of PC Gamer applauded Gearbox's visual updates to the game. Reviewers were more mixed on the gameplay changes included as part of the upgrade to a new game engine; VanOrd noted that some of the changes did not fit with the original game, while Tack made note of several bugs due to the gameplay modifications. Overall, the updated game was highly praised, however, with Senior concluding bluntly that \\"Homeworld is simply incredible and everyone should play it.\\" ==References== ==External links== * (archived) * Official website for Homeworld Remastered Collection Category:1999 video games Category:Sierra Entertainment games Homeworld Category:MacOS games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Real-time strategy video games Category:Relic Entertainment games Category:Space opera video games Category:Steam Workshop games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Video games with available source code Category:Video games with expansion packs Category:Windows games Category:Supernovae in fiction ","title":"Homeworld"},{"id":"2582363","text":"Abercrave Inn Abercraf () is a village within the historic boundaries of the county of Brecknockshire, Wales, administered as part of the unitary authority of Powys. == Location == Abercraf lies in the extreme south of the county, in the Upper Swansea Valley 2.5 miles (4 km) northeast of the small town of Ystradgynlais. It is situated just outside the boundaries of the Brecon Beacons National Park and the Fforest Fawr Geopark, which lie to the immediate north, east, and west of the village. ==Coal and iron== A small ironworks was established in 1824 by the local coalowner, Thomas Harper. Its purpose was to exploit two patents granted to Harper and his fellow coalowner, John Christie (also owner of the Brecon Forest Tramroad) in 1823 (no 4848) and 1824 (no 4909) for the use of the local anthracite coal in smelting. The British Iron Company bought the works in 1825 for £19,541 and at the same time leased minerals on the nearby mountain, Cribarth. The venture soon proved unsuccessful and the furnaces were blown out in 1826 after it was discovered that production costs greatly exceeded the selling price. Coal continued to be worked from the taking; it was still in production in 1841 when the local agent gave a statement to the Children's Employment Commission. The coal pits in nearby Caehopcyn ceased production in the 1960s, although the Nant Helen open cast coal mine continues to operate in the region. ==Amenities== Abercraf has a number of public houses, a rugby union club (Abercrave RFC), junior/primary school, fire station and a Miners' Welfare Hall, a testament to the village's coal mining past. The Wales Ape and Monkey Sanctuary lies just outside the village. Abercraf lies beneath the slopes of the miniature mountain of Cribarth, famous for its 'Sleeping Giant' outline, clearly visible from the nearby A4067 Swansea to Brecon road. The Giant is formed from a combination of the natural topography of the mountain and, in the case of the Giant's face, alterations to this topography from disused limestone quarries. The Giant's nose is surmounted by a trig point. ==Popular culture== According to Douglas Adams' 1983 humorous toponymic dictionary of neologisms \\"The Meaning of Liff\\", to Abercrave is \\"To strongly desire to swing from the pole on the rear footplate of a bus\\". ==Notable residents== *Professional boxer Nipper Pat Daly was born in Abercraf and lived there until the age of five. *Professional Rugby Union Player Adam Jones was born in Abercraf. *Inventor of the Penny Farthing Oliver Dorn lived there for a week. ==References== ==External links== *www.geograph.co.uk : photos of Abercraf and surrounding area Category:Villages in Powys Category:Swansea Valley Category:Fforest Fawr ","title":"Abercraf"},{"id":"2582370","text":"Benjamin Thompson's cradle, exhibited within the house The Benjamin Thompson House (also known as the Count Rumford Birthplace) is a historic house museum and National Historic Landmark at 90 Elm Street, in the North Woburn area of Woburn, Massachusetts. It is significant as the birthplace of scientist and inventor Benjamin Thompson (1753–1814), who became Count Rumford of the Holy Roman Empire as well as Sir Benjamin Thompson of the United Kingdom. His birthplace was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1975 in recognition of Rumford's scientific accomplishments, which notably include the development of the Rumford stove, a fireplace design that was significantly more efficient at retaining heat in the house than older and larger fireplaces. ==Description and history== The Rumford House is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a gambrel roof and a large central chimney. The exterior is sheathed in clapboards, and decoration is limited to a modest front door surround. The interior includes a great deal of well-preserved original hardware and woodwork. The house was built in 1714 by Ebenezer Thompson. His grandson, Benjamin Thompson, Jr., later to become Count Rumford, was born on March 26, 1753, in the west end of this house, which his parents had lived in since their marriage. Young Benjamin's father died on November 7, 1754, and he lived in the house with his grandfather and his mother until she married Josiah Pierce, Jr., of Woburn, and he was taken to live in his house.Life Story of Benjamin Thompson Jr. Benjamin Thompson was a Loyalist during the American Revolution, and fled the country in 1775 when the British evacuated Boston. He returned late in the Rev War commanding the King's American Dragoons, who saw action in the Southern states. He returned to England after the British surrender. He eventually settled for a time in the Holy Roman Empire, where he acquired the title of Count Rumford, and where he performed his groundbreaking research into the design of heating systems. This research resulted in a series of improvements to home heating systems, notably the Rumford stove, a shallow fireplace that more efficiently projected heat into a room than older and larger fireplaces. While in Munich, Thompson oversaw reforms of the indigent welfare system of Bavaria, and designed the city's famous English Garden. Thompson was also an inveterate and practical tinkerer, developing new versions of everyday utensils. He also proposed in 1799 the establishment in the United Kingdom of a research organization, which resulted in the founding of the Royal Institution. Although he never returned to the country of his birth, he did endow a professorial chair at Harvard College, and established the Rumford Prize, an annual award given by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He died in Paris in 1814. ==Current ownership== The birthplace of Benjamin Thompson is now owned by the Rumford Historical Association, founded in 1877 to maintain it as a site of historic interest. In its museum are reconstructed models of Count Rumford's scientific experiments and inventions. A copy of a portrait of Count Rumford by Gainsborough is on display. The house also has a library of Rumford biographies and essays. It is open Sunday afternoons 1 - 4:30PM from June through October and by appointment. Admission is free.The Life and Legend of Count Rumford ==See also== * Loammi Baldwin, childhood friend of Benjamin Thompson * National Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex County, Massachusetts * List of National Historic Landmarks in Massachusetts ==References== ==External links== * Official Count Rumford website * Biography of Benjamin Thompson (Jr.) * Life and Legend of Count Rumford * Woburn Historical Society: 14 min Film on Rumford's Theory of Heat Category:Woburn, Massachusetts Category:National Historic Landmarks in Massachusetts Category:Historic house museums in Massachusetts Category:Science museums in Massachusetts Category:Biographical museums in Massachusetts Category:Museums in Middlesex County, Massachusetts Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Middlesex County, Massachusetts Thompson, Benjamin Category:Houses completed in 1714 ","title":"Benjamin Thompson House–Count Rumford Birthplace"},{"id":"2582386","text":"The Canberra Institute of Technology (CIT) is a vocational education provider in Canberra, the Australian Capital Territory, and is one of a system of TAFEs.

It is situated around north-east of Port Talbot and just west of Cymmer, and is also close to the River Afan. Abercregan was once a thriving mining community but since the decline of the British coal industry, much of the housing has been demolished and most of its inhabitants have moved to neighbouring villages. The 1980s and 1990s saw the closure of the village school, the boys club, post office and the last remaining shop 1989. The local authority decided to turn the school into a Field Study Centre, which was later closed and relocated to Margam Park. The building was demolished following the closure. Now a small village of around 30 houses, Abercregan is in surroundings which have returned to their former pre-industrial rural condition. Abercregan is within the boundaries of the Afan Forest Park which is a joint venture between Forest Enterprise and local businesses which provide for and promote green tourism in the area. Following campaigning by local residents, Abercregan is now home to the only designated village green in the Neath Port Talbot area. Abercregan United Football Club, is nicknamed 'The Shire'. The nickname was bestowed on the club by local celebrity Matthew ‘Joe’ Pitman and is a reference to the shire in Lord Of The Rings which he thought resembled the village. The club has a proud history winning many league titles and cups since its formation.

The same month MegaFon CEO Ivan Tavrin obtained a 12% stake of VK.com, Russia's most popular social networking website, from VK's founder Pavel Durov. On February 2014 board of directors of MegaFon has approved a deal to buy a 100% voting stake in SMARTS Volgograd, a unit of mobile firm SMARTS which covers the Volga and central regions of the country. In the same month, MegaFon commercially launched fragment network LTE Advanced (LTE-A) within the Garden Ring in Moscow. Formerly MegaFon network tested LTE-A in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. For this Megafon uses bands in the range 2600 MHz own unique combination of frequency spectrum and network resource of Skartel as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO). ==Hardware branding== Starting in 2015, the company began production of hardware under \\"MegaFon\\" brand. These include fixed and mobile phones as well as tablet computers branded as MegaFon Login. They are produced in Taiwan and may bear technical indexes such as \\"SP-AI\\" and \\"MT3A\\". See Russian article :ru:МегаФон Login for details in Russian ==Ownership== The company went public in 2012, listing on stock exchanges in Moscow and London. In July 2018, the company's board of directors announced that being a public company was no longer considered a strategic priority and that it would seek to repurchase its GDRs shares from the market and delist, initially from the London Stock Exchange. GDRs were delisted in London in October 2018. The GDR repurchase consolidated more than 75% of ownership in the company, which triggered a mandatory offer to minority shareholders in December 2018. Shares were delisted from the Moscow Exchange in June 2019. Formally shares in the company are now split between USM Telecom (43.68%) and a wholly owned USM subsidiary, AF Telecom Holding (56.32%). ==Outside Russia== ===Georgia=== The Georgian National Communications Commission (GNCC) has accused MegaFon of illegal business operations and participation in the military and economic annexation of Georgia. According to the GNCC, MegaFon has provided unlicensed mobile phone coverage in the conflict zones of Georgia beginning in 2005, in particular the South Ossetia region. The company covered mostly the areas of dislocation of the Russian military forces present in Georgia under the CIS peacekeeping mandate. The rest of the area was mostly covered by the Georgian mobile phone carriers \\"Geocell\\" Ltd. and \\"Magticom\\". In the spring of 2008, GNCC received complaints from Georgian mobile communication companies regarding the destruction of their communication facilities in the region and installation of MegaFon antennas. The GNCC conducted survey monitoring trips to establish the presence of MegaFon's unlicensed coverage. The GNCC imposed two fines on MegaFon: the first in the amount of 5,000 GEL ($3,750) in July 2008, and the second, for the recurrence of violation, in the amount of 500,000 GEL (approx. $350,000) in September 2008. Because Georgian law envisages criminal liability for illegal business activities, the GNCC has notified the General Prosecutor of Georgia on the alleged violations committed by MegaFon. The Prosecutor General of Georgia was expected to initiate criminal proceedings against key officials of MegaFon. On October 2, 2008, Tbilisi City Court upheld the GNCC's decision, finding MegaFon liable for providing unlicensed telecommunication services in Georgia. MegaFon's appeal of the second administrative fine was to be heard by Tbilisi City Court in November 2008. ===Tajikistan=== MegaFon's only subsidiary outside Russia is Tajikistan's TT Mobile. ===Uzbekistan=== Kommersant reported on September 7, 2006, that MegaFon is negotiating in buying an 85% stake in Uzbek mobile operator Coscom from the MCT Corpation. The other 15% stake in Coscom would be held by Coscom management and private shareholders. Analysts estimated Coscom is worth between US$180–200 million. Coscom's has over 300,000 customers. ===Iran=== BBC Persian reported on May 13, 2008 that Megafon had opened an office in Tehran. ==Sponsorship== * KHL hockey league * For the 2009 Formula One season, MegaFon was one of the sponsors for the Renault F1 Team. * Megafon was a national partner for 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014 * Russian e-sports team Virtus Pro * English Premier League team Everton == Criticism == By November 2012 MegaFon received a number of orders from Russian telecommunication and consumer market authorities to amend contracts with its 63 million subscribers and to make these contracts compliant with requirements of Russian law. All MegaFon's attempts to challenge these orders in Russian arbitration courts were unsuccessful.Arbitration case А63-11458/2010Arbitration case А37-395/2011 Also in 2012, several arbitration cases in Russian courts ruled that MegaFon violated consumer rights.Arbitration case A68-1413/2012Arbitration case A73-4102/2012Arbitration case A37-2296/2011 MegaFon did not meet requirements of Russian legislation and did not report any legally required certificates of compliance to the Federal Communications Agency Rossvyaz. ==References== * Helsingin Sanomat 28 March 2006 * Russia at Heart of German Probe – Moscow Times July 26, 2005 *European Commission to investigate TeliaSonera deals in Russia – Helsingin Sanomat 28 March 2006 ==External links== *MegaFon English corporate site *Alfa Group Accused of Bribing to Buy MegaFon June 13, 2006 *Reuters: Georgia's Communications Commission Fines Russia's Megafon; Decries 'Economic Annexation' *Reuters:Georgia threatens to multiply Russia MegaFon fine *Reuters: Georgia files charges against Russia's MegaFon *Reuters: Megafon Goes to Court in Georgia over Disputed South Ossetia Operations *EurasiaNet: THE FIGHT BETWEEN TBILISI AND MOSCOW OVER SOUTH OSSETIA GOES CELLULAR *Reuters: Court Upholds Fine Against Megafon for Illegal Operations in Georgia *Guardian: Dreams of empire strike back Q: What do Osama bin Laden and Vladimir Putin have in common?

He gives his name to the Fraser Darling effect. ==Early life== Fraser Darling was born in Soresby Street in Chesterfieldhttps://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf in northern England, the illegitimate son of Harriet Cowley Ellse Darling and Cpt. Frank Moss. His mother was the daughter of a prosperous family from Sheffield. Her family wanted the child to be fostered and forgotten about. However, she would not cooperate and refused to part with Frank. His father, whom he never met, left for East Africa around the time of his birth, and was killed in action on the Kenya-Tanganyika border in 1917. In 1966 Darling revealed to his son that the pioneering plant geographer, Charles Edward Moss, was his uncle.Letter from F. Fraser Darling to Alasdair Fraser-Darling, 26 March 1966. St Andrew's University Library Special Collections, ms38449. ==Career== After running away from school at the age of 15, Darling was sent to work on a farm in the Pennines. He then studied at the Midland Agricultural College (now part of the University of Nottingham), at Sutton Bonington in the Borough of Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire, and obtained diplomas in agriculture and dairying. Soon afterwards he married Marion Fraser (\\"Bobbie\\") and took the double-barrelled surname Fraser Darling, which, although he was divorced from Bobbie in 1948, he used until the end of his life. While working as a Clean Milk Advisor in Buckinghamshire, and longing for a research post in Scotland, Fraser Darling heard about the work of the Institute of Animal Genetics at Edinburgh University, and in the early 1930s the Director, Francis Albert Eley Crew, offered him a place there to study for a PhD. From 1929–1930 he was Director of the Commonwealth Bureau of Animal Breeding and Genetics, part of the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux, at Edinburgh. In 1934 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Francis Albert Eley Crew, William Christopher Miller, A D Buchanan Smith (Lord Balerno), and John Michael Robson.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf Living at Dundonnell and later in the Summer Isles, Fraser Darling began the work that was to mark him as a naturalist-philosopher of original turn of mind and great intellectual drive. He described the social and breeding behaviour of the red deer, gulls, and the grey seal respectively, in the three academic works A Herd of Red Deer, Bird Flocks and the Breeding Cycle and A Naturalist on Rona. The Fraser Darling effect, proposed by Fraser Darling in 1938, is the simultaneous and shortened breeding season that occurs in large colonies of birds. The outbreak of the Second World War put an end to Fraser Darling's hopes of undertaking further research on the grey seal and, being too old for active military service, he chose to farm rather than leave the west coast of Scotland for wartime civilian work. Between 1939 and 1943 Fraser Darling reclaimed derelict land to agricultural production on Tanera Mòr in the Summer Isles. In 1942, the wartime Secretary of State for Scotland, Thomas Johnston, asked him to run an agricultural advisory programme in the crofting areas of the Scottish Highlands and Islands. He agreed, and for two years he travelled, taught and wrote articles that were later published in book form as Crofting Agriculture. In 1944 he was appointed as Director of the West Highland Survey based at Kilcamb Lodge on the Strontian Estate in ArdnamurchanHunter, James (1984), Forgotten Blueprint for the Highlands, The Weekend Scotsman, 20 October 1984 The aim of the West Highland Survey, Fraser Darling wrote, was \\"to gather a solid body of facts... which would serve as a foundation for a future policy for the region\\". To gather these facts, he recruited five assistants, all young Highlanders: people personally acquainted with the crofting life who could converse with crofters in their native Gaelic rather than in the English of officialdom. Concerns at the Department of Agriculture about the radical nature of the findings of the survey and its implied criticism of the policies it had been pursuing led to repeated delays to its publication. It was finally published as West Highland Survey: An Essay in Human Ecology in 1955. In the concluding sentence of his introduction Fraser Darling wrote that: \\"the bald unpalatable fact is emphasized that the Highlands and Islands are largely a devastated terrain, and that any policy which ignores this fact cannot hope to achieve rehabilitation.\\" The \\"devastation\\", he further concluded, was the inevitable outcome of bad land use. The Highlands had first been stripped of their natural forest cover, then they had been subjected to repeated burning, to intensive grazing, to overstocking and to other forms of maltreatment which had drained their soils of fertility and made them steadily less productive.Fraser Darling, Frank (1955), West Highland Survey: An Essay in Human Ecology, Oxford University Press Frank Mears drew on the preliminary report of the West Highland Survey (1948)Fraser Darling, Frank (1948), Preliminary Report of the West Highland Survey in his interim report on planning and redevelopment in the County of Sutherland (1951).Mears, F.C. (1951), County of Sutherland: Interim Report on Planning and Development, Sutherland County Council, June 1951, p. 20 In 1949, Julian Huxley, UNESCO's first Director-General, invited Fraser Darling to be one of UNESCO's representatives at the United Nations conference on conservation at Lake Success on Long Island. Huxley had been interested in Fraser Darling's studies on animal behaviour since the early 1940s, and the two had corresponded while Fraser Darling was living on Tanera Mor. His 1969 BBC Reith Lectures (entitled Wilderness and Plenty) were an important contribution to the growing debate on man's responsibility for his natural environment. They were described at the time as \\"an eloquent statement of the dependence of all living things on one another\\". Fraser Darling received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1971. He died in Forres in Morayshire in north-east Scotland in October 1979.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf ==Family== Darling married three times: firstly in 1922 to Marion Fraser (dissolved); secondly in 1948 to Averil Morley (d.1957); thirdly in 1960 to Christina MacInnes Brotchie. ==Honours and awards== *1933–1936: Awarded Barnard Medal *1934: Elected Fellow, Royal Society of Edinburgh *1936–1939: Appointed Carnegie Research Fellow *1947: Awarded Mungo Park Medal, Royal Scottish Geographical Society *1970: Awarded Knighthood *1970–1973: Appointed member of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution *1972: Awarded Centenary Medal, US National Park Service *1973: Created Commandeur, Order of the Golden Ark (Netherlands) ==Selected bibliography== * 1932 – Colour Inheritance in Bull-terriers.

Tang stood as a candidate for the opposition Workers' Party in the Cheng San Group Representation Constituency at the 1997 general election. The Worker's Party team in the constituency was defeated by the team from the governing People's Action Party (PAP) by 45.2% of the votes to 54.8%. During the election campaign, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong accused Tang of being an anti-Christian and anti-Muslim Chinese chauvinist. After the election, Tang was sued for defamation by several of the PAP's leaders, who accused him of making statements during the campaign which unreasonably questioned their integrity. Tang went to self-imposed exile to Australia soon after the election and has not returned to Singapore since then. The plaintiffs in the lawsuits obtained default judgements against Tang in all their suits. ==Biography== Tang was born in 1935 to parents who came from agricultural backgrounds. He was one of eight children in his family. He started his formal education only at the age of 13, when he began attending Yeung Ching Primary School in 1949. He graduated from high school in 1957. He then began studying at Nanyang University in 1962, and moved to the University of Singapore the following year. He graduated in 1967 and joined the bar a year later at the age of 38. Tang served for several years as the Chairman of the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, and also sat on the board of management of The Chinese High School and Hwa Chong Junior College. ===1997 general election=== Tang stood as a candidate for the Workers' Party in Cheng San the Group Representation Constituency at the 1997 general election. The party's team in the constituency also included the party's leader, former Member of Parliament J.B. Jeyaretnam. During the election campaign, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong accused Tang of being a Chinese chauvinist because of comments Tang had made at other public events in the past. Goh stated that he was therefore making himself \\"a special candidate\\" in Cheng San GRC (even though it was not his constituency) because he felt that Tang must be kept out of Parliament if Singapore's inter-racial harmony was to be protected. Tang insisted that all he had ever tried to do was to \\"better represent the Chinese community and ask questions on their behalf\\". He vigorously denied that he was a Chinese chauvinist and accused the PAP of trying to win votes by sowing fear into the electorate. Tang also came under fire from the PAP after he raised the issue of the Hotel Properties Ltd case during the election campaign. This issue arose after the Stock Exchange of Singapore had previously criticised Hotel Properties Ltd for its \\"tardiness\\" in disclosing details of sales of its condominium units to directors and their family members.Ven Sreenivasan and Michelle Low, \\"Analysts support SES censure of HPL,\\" in: Business Times, 24 April 1996, p. 15Warren Fernandez, \\"Full details of condo deals revealed,\\" The Straits Times, 22 May 1996, p. 1 Former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who had purchased one of the units and whose brother was a director of Hotel Properties Ltd, claimed that Tang was trying to smear his name and milk this issue for political capital. On election day, the Worker's Party's team in Cheng San GRC lost to the PAP's team by 44,132 votes (45.2%) to 53,553 (54.8%). This was the highest percentage of the vote garnered by any opposition losing candidates, and was therefore enough to secure one of the team's members a seat as a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP). The party selected Jeyaretnam to become its NCMP. === Post-election legal action === After the election, Tang was sued for defamation by eleven PAP politicians, including Goh, Lee and Deputy Prime Ministers Lee Hsien Loong and Tony Tan, who accused him of making statements during the campaign which falsely questioned their integrity. A total of 13 judgements were entered against Tang for defamation. Tang also subsequently faced charges from the Inland Revenue Department for evading taxes. Tang left Singapore for Johor, Malaysia, shortly after the election. His wife's passport was then impounded but later released. Eventually Tang found refuge in Australia, where he was reunited with his wife. After Tang left Singapore, the plaintiffs in the lawsuits obtained the Mareva injunction against him to restrain him from disposing of assets and to require him to disclose the whereabouts of his assets. When Tang failed to file an affidavit disclosing his assets, the plaintiffs obtained default judgements against Tang in all their suits. Damages were assessed by a judge of the High Court at a total of S$8,075,000. Tang's appeals against the default judgements were argued by the British Queen's Counsel Charles Gray before the Court of Appeal in September 1997, but was unsuccessful.

It has continued, in a variety of forms, until the modern era. ==Ancient Greek debates== In Greek times, the debate was largely philosophical and did not conform to present notions of cosmology. Cosmic pluralism was a corollary to notions of infinity and the purported multitude of life-bearing worlds were more akin to parallel universes (either contemporaneously in space or infinitely recurring in time) than to different solar systems. After Anaximander opened the door to an infinite universe, a strong pluralist stance was adopted by the atomists, notably Leucippus, Democritus, and Epicurus. While these were prominent thinkers, their opponents—Plato and Aristotle—had greater effect. They argued that the Earth is unique and that there can be no other systems of worlds. David Darling, \\"Pluralism (plurality of worlds)\\" This stance neatly dovetailed with later Christian ideas and pluralism was effectively suppressed for approximately a millennium. ==Medieval Islamic thought== Many medieval Muslim scholars endorsed the idea of cosmic pluralism. Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (676–733) wrote \\"Maybe you see that God created only this single world and that God did not create humans besides you. Well, I swear by God that God created thousands and thousands of worlds and thousands and thousands of humankind.\\" Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi (1149–1209), in dealing with his conception of physics and the physical world in his Matalib, rejects the Aristotelian and Avicennian notion of the Earth's centrality within the universe. Instead he argues that there are \\"a thousand thousand worlds (alfa alfi 'awalim) beyond this world such that each one of those worlds be bigger and more massive than this world as well as having the like of what this world has.\\"David A. Weintraub (2014). \\"Islam,\\" Religions and Extraterrestrial Life (pp 161-168). Springer International Publishing. To support his theological argument, he cites the Qur'anic verse, \\"All praise belongs to God, Lord of the Worlds,\\" in surah fatiha emphasizing the term \\"Worlds.\\" Two Qur'anic verses support the idea of God being Lord of multiple worlds: 1:2 and 41:09. Qur'an 16:8 says \\"He has created other things of which ye have no knowledge.\\" Cosmic pluralism was depicted in fictional Arabic literature. \\"The Adventures of Bulukiya\\", a tale from the One Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights), depicted a cosmos consisting of different worlds, some larger than Earth and each with their own inhabitants. ==Scholastic thinkers== Eventually the Ptolemaic-Aristotelian system was challenged and pluralism reasserted, first tentatively by scholastics and then more seriously by followers of Copernicus. The telescope appeared to prove that a multitude of life was reasonable and an expression of God's creative omnipotence; still powerful theological opponents, meanwhile, continued to insist that although the Earth may have been displaced from the center of the cosmos, it was still the unique focus of God's creation. Thinkers such as Johannes Kepler were willing to admit the possibility of pluralism without truly supporting it. ==Renaissance== Giordano Bruno introduced in his works the idea of multiple worlds instantiating the infinite possibilities of a pristine, indivisible One. Bruno (from the mouth of his character Philotheo) in his De l'infinito universo et mondi (1584) claims that \\"innumerable celestial bodies, stars, globes, suns and earths may be sensibly perceived therein by us and an infinite number of them may be inferred by our own reason.\\" Teaching this was among the charges the Inquisition made against him.Luigi Firpo, Il processo di Giordano Bruno, 1993. ==Enlightenment== During the Scientific Revolution and the later Enlightenment, cosmic pluralism became a mainstream possibility. Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle's Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes (Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds) of 1686 was an important work from this period, speculating on pluralism and describing the new Copernican cosmology.Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds— Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle Pluralism was also championed by philosophers such as John Locke, astronomers such as William Herschel and even politicians, including John Adams and Benjamin Franklin. As greater scientific skepticism and rigour were applied to the question it ceased to be simply a matter of philosophy and theology and was properly bounded by astronomy and biology. The French astronomer Camille Flammarion was one of the chief proponents of cosmic pluralism during the latter half of the nineteenth century. His first book, La pluralité des mondes habités (1862) was a great popular success, going through 33 editions in its first twenty years. Flammarion was one of the first people to put forward the idea that extraterrestrial beings were genuinely alien, and not simply variations of earthly creatures.Flammarion, (Nicolas) Camille (1842–1925)— The Internet Encyclopedia of Science ==Modern thought== In the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries the term \\"cosmic pluralism\\" became largely archaic as knowledge diversified and the speculation on extraterrestrial life focused on particular bodies and observations. The historic debate continues to have modern parallels, however. Carl Sagan and Frank Drake, for instance, could well be considered \\"pluralists\\" while proponents of the Rare Earth hypothesis are modern skeptics. Modern Islamic scholars like Abdullah Yusuf Ali point to the Qur'an (42:29) to argue for life on other planets: \\"And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the living creatures that He has scattered through them\\". The verses uses the word da’bbah, which denotes living creatures on the surface of a planet. ==See also== *Buddhist cosmology *Extraterrestrial life *Exoplanet *Exotheology *Extraterrestrial life in fiction *Hindu cosmology *Mediocrity principle *Mormon cosmology *Planetary habitability ==References== ==Further reading== * (later titled \\"Außerirdische Welten.

The church is situated at the confluence of Nerl and Klyazma Rivers in Bogolyubovo, Suzdalsky District, Vladimir Oblast, 13 km north-east of the ancient capital of Vladimir. The church was commissioned by Andrei Bogolyubsky.Dmitriĭ Olegovich Shvidkovskiĭ, Russian Architecture and the West, (Yale University Press, 2007), 36. According to some sources, it was built to commemorate Andrei's victory over the Bulgars and his son Izyaslav, who was slain in the battle.Janet Martin, Medieval Russia:980-1584, (Cambridge University Press, 1996), 84. The exact construction date of the church is unknown. The monument is built in white stone, and has one dome and four columns in the interior. Its proportions are elongated on purpose to make its outline seem slenderer, although this architectural solution restricts its use for holding services. For centuries, the memorial church greeted everyone approaching the palace at Bogolyubovo. In spring, the area would be flooded, and the church appeared as if floating on water. The church itself has not been touched by later generations; only the dome's shape has been slightly changed, and porch-galleries were added in the 12th-century, rebuilt in 18th- century and then demolished. The walls are still covered with 12th-century stonecarvings. In 1992, the church was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of the site White Monuments of Vladimir and Suzdal.

The department is headquartered at 900 South Fremont Avenue in Alhambra, California.\\"Contact Public Works.\\" Los Angeles County Department of Public Works. Retrieved on September 27, 2009. Services are provided primarily to the unincorporated county with some services provided to contract cities. Flood control and watershed management services are provided to all of the county except the Antelope Valley. As part of its flood control and water supply responsibilities, the Department of Public Works has 15 major dams and 27 spreading grounds in the county. Pacoima Dam is one of the largest owned by Public Works and survived the Northridge earthquake in 1994 intact. Water from the dams is released into flood-control channels and some is diverted into spreading basins where it percolates into the ground and recharges the groundwater. The surface water is not used directly as it requires more cleaning than groundwater. Near the coast, the department has constructed sea water barriers that use injection wells to create a fresh water barrier to prevent salt water intrusion from the ocean into the groundwater.Amy Pyle and Leslie Berger, Boy's Death Prompts Calls for Changes, Los Angeles Times, February 15, 1992 The DPW is a leader in watershed management. It provides storm drain education programs, publishes and enforces best management practices for activities that may affect the watershed, and manages watersheds to provide a balance between flood control, recreation, and protecting the natural environment. ==History== The department was formed in 1985 in a consolidation of the county Road Department, the Flood Control District (in charge of dams, spreading grounds, and channels), and the County Engineer (in charge of building safety, land survey, waterworks). For 25 years, the County Engineer Department was housed in the historic Higgins Building, a 10-story Beaux-Arts style commercial building that was designed and built by noted architect Arthur L. Haley and engineer Albert Carey Martin in 1910, at the corner of Second and Main Streets in Downtown Los Angeles. After \\"overseeing construction projects large and small from one of the city's strongest buildings, the county determined that the department needed more modern quarters and pulled up stakes in 1977,\\" according to the Los Angeles City Planning Department, which designated the building as the Historic- Cultural Monument #873. In 1977, the County Engineer Department moved to the corner of 5th Street and Vermont Ave., Los Angeles until the merge of the three departments. At that time the department was called the Department of County Engineer-Facilities. For years, the Flood Control District and the County Road Department were headquartered in buildings at Alcazar Street in East Los Angeles by the Los Angeles County General Hospital. Major divisions of the Public Works Department were located at various locations in Los Angeles city for a number of years, until the 12-story glass building in Alhambra, California was purchased and refurbished. This tallest structure in Alhambra was formerly the western headquarters of Sears, Roebuck and Company, where some fixture units still bear the label \\"Sears\\". The steel frames were strengthened in 2006 after it was learned from the Northridge earthquake that the welded joints were not adequate to withstand a major earthquake.Lynn O'Shaughnessy and Tracy Wood, County Skirts the Rules; Campaign Donor Profits Big, Los Angeles Times, November 7, 1988 ==Former Directors== * Thomas A.

Rock School was made by British production company RDF Media and was shown on Channel 4 in the UK, RTL 7 in the Netherlands, Channel Ten and Channel V in Australia, TVNZ2 in New Zealand, VH-1 in the United States and Latin America, TV 2 Zebra in Norway, Nelonen in Finland, TV4 in Sweden, Much Music in Canada, Vitaya in Belgium and ORF eins in Austria. A comedy film with a similar theme, starring Jack Black, called School of Rock, was released in 2003, before the first series began. The creative team and Simmons insisted that they did not make the show because of the film, and that the show had been in the works since 2002. Following the end of series 2, Simmons appears not to be planning any further series', due to his commitments with Kiss. ==Series one== The first series was broadcast in the autumn of 2005 and took place at Christ's Hospital, a co-educational boarding school near Horsham, West Sussex, which is famous for its strong musical tradition. The chosen class of year 9 students were all classically trained and it was insinuated that they had no interest in rock music. The band consisted of Josh Bell (also known as \\"The Emperor\\") as lead singer, Dudley Beal (\\"Dudders\\") as drummer, Jesse Newton (\\"Bagpuss\\") as guitarist, Kwamé Asiedu (\\"Mr. Cool\\") on keyboards and bassist Camilla Biggs (who refused to have a \\"rock name\\"). Stylists were Fiona Musson (\\"FiFi\\") and Frances Scott (\\"Francis\\"), while the stage managers were Lucian and Richard White (\\"Mr White\\"). On 21 October, the manager, Rodney Serunjogi (\\"Rods\\"), revealed the band's name to be \\"The Class\\". After a difficult start, the band successfully played to a crowd of Motörhead fans at the Hammersmith Apollo, and in the final episode of the series The Class got an all-expenses paid trip to Los Angeles, where all the members came together to perform a special tribute of \\"God gave rock 'n roll to you\\" for Simmons in a local venue. The highlight of the programme was arguably Josh, \\"Emperor\\", so-called because of his love of the game Warhammer. The 13-year-old sparked plenty of controversy among his classmates as his weird antics made him an outsider. A fluent speaker of Quenya and learning Klingon by the end of the series, Josh was completely tone-deaf but was chosen by Simmons for his determination and perseverance. Simmons confessed that he saw something of himself in Josh, as he had faced similar adversity as an outsider when growing up in New York City. Completely transformed by the experience, Josh saw himself as a rock god by the end of filming and had even grown his hair in homage to Queen guitarist Brian May; however, this new persona irritated his classmates, who thought his arrogance had got the better of him. Josh married in 2014 and was ordained as a Church of England deacon at Norwich Cathedral in June 2018. == Series two == Following strong international sales for the first series, a second series began filming in October 2005 at Kirkley Community High School in Lowestoft, Suffolk (now East Point Academy) and began airing on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom on Sunday 29 January 2006. A new twist to this series was that instead of classically trained musicians, Simmons was working with students from a comprehensive school. Unlike the first series the pupils were from year 11 rather than year 9. Their task at the end of the series would be to open for Judas Priest, Rob Zombie, and Anthrax in Long Beach. In the first episode we meet Chris Hardman, also known as \\"Lil' Chris\\" (due to his diminutive stature), who can sing, play guitar, drum, and write songs. At the end of the first episode he goes on holiday with his family, causing Simmons to appoint Ellie Chapman as the replacement vocalist. The band, then \\"No Comment\\" and consisting of Ellie Chapman (vocals), Samanie Warren (guitar), Lindsey Rose (bass), Jess (keyboards) and Sammi Reeve (drums) spend the second episode preparing for their first gig, where they played to an audience of predominantly old age pensioners at a local bowls club, as well as worrying about their positions in the band upon Chris's return. Episode two also features Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi, who was brought in by Simmons to inspire the group. In the third episode, the band hold auditions for a backup drummer in light of Sammi's volatile temper and tendency to walk out on them. These auditions were open to both class members and select non- members as well. Simmons chooses an outsider Lauren Pashley, raising the suspicion that he was looking to form an all-female band. They go on tour with Chris and Ellie taking turns on vocals, but neither impresses Simmons, putting both of their positions into doubt. On the second show of the tour, the band were promised they would get to play \\"My Generation\\" as an encore with Ellie singing, but Simmons felt they had not sufficiently impressed the crowd and did not warrant the encore. Suzi Quatro also features in episode three, showing Lindsey some techniques on the bass guitar. As part of their final preparations the band gave a live performance in Golden Cross, Coventry. In the final episode Simmons reveals the final line-up of the band, dropping an obviously devastated Ellie and opting for Chris, who he felt was more charismatic. He also renamed the band \\"Hoax UK\\", inspired by a slogan on Chris's cap. They successfully played their opening slot with their song \\"Kicking Off\\", written by Chris and classmate Rob: :I want to learn to fly, I want to climb so high, It's kicking off Bought a ticket out this hole, Play my rock and roll, We're kicking off Gonna take my life, Take My life to new levels, Going to shake it all up until my heart rate trebles The lyrics may have been prophetic, as a week after the performance Chris was contacted by record producers Ray Hedges and Nigel Butler, who appeared in the show to help the class with songwriting. They worked with him on a song called \\"Checkin' It Out\\". The song was released as a single in September 2006 and reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. Chris went on to release an album in December 2006. The female members of the band, including Samanie, Ellie and Lauren formed a band of their own known as The Upraw. Lauren and Lily left the band, but have been replaced by two new members; Toni (Drums) and Katie (keyboard). They released a single called \\"Make My Way\\" in May 2006. According to the Upraw's website, Ellie and Katie have now left, with the three remaining members functioning as a three piece. Hardman was found dead at the age of 24 from suicide by hanging on 23 March 2015, after having suffered from depression as his career stalled in the years leading up to his death; he had considered taking his own life on previous occasions. ==References== ==External links== *Rock School at Channel4.com *Gene Simmons' Rock School at VH1 * *Article from The Telegraph containing a diary of the show by Little Chris (series 2) Category:Channel 4 original programming Category:Christ's Hospital Category:Kiss (band) Category:Television series by RDF Media Group Category:2000s British reality television series Category:2005 British television series debuts Category:2006 British television series endings ","title":"Rock School"},{"id":"2582573","text":"Tetrasulfur tetranitride is an inorganic compound with the formula S4N4. This gold-poppy coloured solid is the most important binary sulfur nitride, which are compounds that contain only the elements sulfur and nitrogen. It is a precursor to many S-N compounds and has attracted wide interest for its unusual structure and bonding. Nitrogen and sulfur have similar electronegativities. When the properties of atoms are so highly similar, they often form extensive families of covalently bonded structures and compounds. Indeed, a large number of S-N and S-NH compounds are known with S4N4 as their parent. ==Structure== S4N4 adopts an unusual “extreme cradle” structure, with D2d point group symmetry. It can be viewed as a derivative of a hypothetical eight-membered ring of alternating sulfur and nitrogen atoms. The pairs of sulfur atoms across the ring are separated by 2.586 Å, resulting in a cage- like structure as determined by single crystal X-Ray diffraction. The nature of the \\"transannular\\" S-S interactions remains a matter of investigation because it is significantly shorter than the sum of the van der Waal's distances but has been explained in the context of molecular orbital theory. The bonding in S4N4 is considered to be delocalized, which is indicated by the fact that the bond distances between neighboring sulfur and nitrogen atoms are nearly identical. S4N4 has been shown to co-crystallize with benzene and the C60 molecule. ==Properties== S4N4 is stable to air. It is, however, unstable in the thermodynamic sense with a positive enthalpy of formation of +460 kJ mol−1. This endothermic enthalpy of formation originates in the difference in energy of S4N4 compared to its highly stable decomposition products: :2 S4N4 → 4 N2 \\\\+ S8 Because one of its decomposition products is a gas, S4N4 can be used as an explosive. Purer samples tend to be more explosive. Small samples can be detonated by striking with a hammer. S4N4 is thermochromic, changing from pale yellow below −30 °C to orange at room temperature to deep red above 100 °C. ==Synthesis== was first prepared in 1835 by M. Gregory by the reaction of disulfur dichloride with ammonia, a process that has been optimized: :6 S2Cl2 \\\\+ 16 NH3 → S4N4 \\\\+ S8 \\\\+ 12 NH4Cl Coproducts of this reaction include heptasulfur imide (S7NH) and elemental sulfur. A related synthesis employs sulfur monochloride and NH4Cl instead: :4 NH4Cl + 6 S2Cl2 → S4N4 \\\\+ 16 HCl + S8 An alternative synthesis entails the use of [(Me3Si)2N]2S as a precursor with pre-formed S-N bonds. [(Me3Si)2N]2S is prepared by the reaction of lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide and SCl2. :2 [(CH3)3Si]2NLi + SCl2 → [((CH3)3Si)2N]2S + 2 LiCl The [((CH3)3Si)2N]2S reacts with the combination of SCl2 and SO2Cl2 to form S4N4, trimethylsilyl chloride, and sulfur dioxide: :2[((CH3)3Si)2N]2S + 2SCl2 \\\\+ 2SO2Cl2 → S4N4 \\\\+ 8 (CH3)3SiCl + 2SO2 ==Acid- base reactions== S4N4·BF3 S4N4 serves as a Lewis base by binding through nitrogen to strongly Lewis acidic compounds such as SbCl5 and SO3. The cage is distorted in these adducts. :S4N4 \\\\+ SbCl5 → S4N4·SbCl5 :S4N4 \\\\+ SO3 → S4N4·SO3 The reaction of [Pt2Cl4(PMe2Ph)2] with S4N4 is reported to form a complex where a sulfur forms a dative bond to the metal. This compound upon standing is isomerised to a complex in which a nitrogen atom forms the additional bond to the metal centre. It is protonated by HBF4 to form a tetrafluoroborate salt: :S4N4 \\\\+ HBF4 → [S4N4H+][BF] The soft Lewis acid CuCl forms a coordination polymer: :n S4N4 \\\\+ n CuCl → (S4N4)n-μ-(-Cu-Cl-)n Dilute NaOH hydrolyzes S4N4 as follows, yielding thiosulfate and trithionate: :2 S4N4 \\\\+ 6 OH− \\\\+ 9 H2O → S2O + 2 S3O + 8 NH3 More concentrated base yields sulfite: :S4N4 \\\\+ 6 OH− \\\\+ 3 H2O → S2O + 2 SO + 4 NH3 ===Metal complexes=== S4N4 reacts with metal complexes. The cage remains intact in some cases but in other cases, it is degraded. S4N4 reacts with Vaska's complex ([Ir(Cl)(CO)(PPh3)2] in an oxidative addition reaction to form a six coordinate iridium complex where the S4N4 binds through two sulfur atoms and one nitrogen atom. ==S4N4 as a precursor to other S-N compounds== Many S-N compounds are prepared from S4N4. Reaction with piperidine generates [S4N5]−: :3 S4N4 \\\\+ 4 C5H10NH → (C5H10NH2)+[S4N5]− \\\\+ (C5H10N)2S + ⅜ S8 \\\\+ N2 A related cation is also known, i.e. [S4N5]+. Treatment with tetramethylammonium azide produces the heterocycle [S3N3]−: :S4N4 \\\\+ NMe4N3 → NMe4[S3N3] + ⅛ S8 \\\\+ 2 N2 Cyclo-[S3N3]− has 10 pi-electrons: 2e−/S plus 1e−/N plus 1e− for the negative charge. In an apparently related reaction, the use of PPN+N3 gives a salt containing the blue [NS4]− anion: :2 S4N4 \\\\+ PPN(N3) → PPN[NS4] + ½ S8 \\\\+ 5 N2 The anion NS4− has a chain structure described using the resonance [S=S=N–S–S]− ↔ [S–S–N=S=S]−. S4N4 reacts with electron-poor alkynes. Chlorination of S4N4 gives thiazyl chloride. Passing gaseous S4N4 over silver metal yields the low temperature superconductor polythiazyl or polysulfurnitride (transition temperature (0.26±0.03) K), often simply called \\"(SN)x\\". In the conversion, the silver first becomes sulfided, and the resulting Ag2S catalyzes the conversion of the S4N4 into the four-membered ring S2N2, which readily polymerizes. :S4N4 \\\\+ 8 Ag → 4 Ag2S + 2 N2 :S4N4 → (SN)x ==Se4N4== The selenium compound Se4N4 is known and has been the subject of some research. In addition, adducts of aluminium chloride with Se2N2 have been isolated; this is formed from Se4N4. ==Safety== S4N4 is shock-sensitive. Purer samples are more shock-sensitive than those contaminated with elemental sulfur. ==References== Category:Explosive chemicals Category:Inorganic compounds Category:Sulfur compounds Category:Nitrides ","title":"Tetrasulfur tetranitride"},{"id":"2582593","text":"The King Caesar House is a historic house located at 120 King Caesar Road, Duxbury, Massachusetts. It is operated as a non-profit museum by the Duxbury Rural and Historical Society. The Federal style house, completed in 1809, was built for Ezra Weston II (1772–1842) and his wife, Jerusha Bradford Weston (1770–1833). Like his father, Weston was known as \\"King Caesar\\" for his success in shipbuilding and shipping. During the 1830s and 1840s, the firm of E. Weston & Sons ran the largest mercantile operation on the South Shore of Massachusetts.Browne, 79. In 1841, U.S. Senator Daniel Webster, during a speech in Saratoga, New York, made the claim that Weston was, \\"the largest ship owner, probably, in the United States.\\"Webster quoted in Weston, 13. ==Historic significance== ===Weston family=== The Weston firm was established by Ezra Weston I (1743–1822) who began building small sloops and schooners on Powder Point in Duxbury in 1764. Ezra I earned the nickname \\"King Caesar\\" due to his audacious character and his influence on local politics.Browne, 35. After his death, the nickname passed to his son Ezra II who greatly expanded the firms activities, built up a fleet of large sailing vessels, and made the Weston name known across the Atlantic.Browne, 73. The firm experienced its heyday in the 1820s and 1830s during which Ezra Weston II presided as sole owner. The vessels built by the Weston firm varied widely in size and configuration, from the 25 ton schooner Sophia, to the ship Hope, launched in 1841 at 880 tons, the largest vessel built in Duxbury and the largest merchant vessel launched in Massachusetts up to that time.Bradford, 110. Although Ezra Weston II built many schooners for fishing and the coastal trade, the majority of his vessels were large brigs and ships which traded around the world. Over the course of three generations, the Weston firm built or otherwise acquired more than 110 sailing vessels.Browne, 127-132. From the King Caesar House, Ezra Weston II directed the affairs of his fleet and presided over a ten-acre shipyard, a farm, a ropewalk, a sailcloth mill, and a large work force of sailors, carpenters and laborers. After the death of Ezra Weston II in 1842, his three sons inherited the firm and continued to operate it until 1857. The firm's activities declined sharply after his death, however, and his sons evidently did not possess the same talent for business as \\"King Caesar.\\"Browne, 111-114. The King Caesar House passed to the second son, Alden Bradford Weston (1805–1880). After the firm ceased operation, the family fortune was rapidly spent by Alden Weston's two brothers while Alden lived an austere lifestyle in the King Caesar House. Alden Weston married late in life but had no children. He died alone in the King Caesar House in 1880.Browne, 124. The house then fell to King Caesar's grandchildren, Alden Weston's nieces and nephews. Most of them lived in the Boston area and had little desire to keep the Duxbury mansion.Browne, 1. === Later owners === In 1886, Frederick Bradford Knapp (1857–1932) purchased the King Caesar House and the surrounding estate. Knapp, former Superintendent of Buildings at Harvard College, aimed to establish a preparatory school, converting King Caesar's barns into gymnasiums and classrooms. The school was known as the Powder Point School for Boys and quickly earned an excellent reputation. During this period, the King Caesar House served as the Headmaster's House, and Knapp resided there with his family. The Powder Point School for Boys operated successfully for nearly 40 years but eventually merged with Tabor Academy in the 1920s.Browne, 67. Frederick B. Knapp died in 1932. By that time the mansion was in decline. His heirs sold it in 1937 to Dr. Hermon Carey Bumpus, Sr., former director of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, who thoroughly restored the mansion.Browne, 65. In 1945, the King Caesar House was purchased from Dr. Herman Carey Bumpus, Jr. by Miss Alice Moran, a lawyer from New York City who had lived there for years with an Austrian couple, Emil Weber and Elizabeth Weber-Fulop. After the three moved into the house, the servants' quarter in the rear was converted into an artist's studio for Weber-Fulop, who was a painter of high repute. Emil Weber and his wife, Elizabeth, both passed away in the mid -1960s, leaving Miss Moran alone. In 1966. she offered to sell the house to the Duxbury Rural and Historical Society.Rybka, F. James. Reference \\"Bohuslav Martinu, The Compulsion to Compose\\" Scarecrow Press, 2011, p 195. After a community fundraising effort, the Duxbury Rural and Historical Society procured the necessary funds to purchase and repair the house.

His mother was also from an eminent architectural family, the Shaws. Philip Charles Hardwick's maternal grandfather was John Shaw Senior (1776–1832) and his uncle was John Shaw Jr (1803–1870). Hardwick trained under his father and also Edward Blore. He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy between 1848 and 1854. The former Great Hall with a statue of George Stephenson by Edward Hodges Baily. Philip Charles worked in the City of London, where he became the leading architect of grandiose banking offices, mainly in an Italianate manner. He designed five City banks, including Drummond's in Trafalgar Square (1879–81), and was architect to the Bank of England from 1855 to 1883. He was employed outside London designing branch offices at Hull (1856) and Leeds (1862–65). His best known work was the Great Hall of London's Euston railway station (opened on 27 May 1849). The Great Hall was demolished in 1962 to make way for construction of the current Euston Station building. Hardwick, like his grandfather Thomas Hardwick, was the Surveyor to St Bartholomew's Hospital in London and also a major benefactor. He was also an adviser in the new War Office and Admiralty competition of 1884. While he had been a favourite architect of Queen Victoria to design the Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens but his design fell short with the advisory committee. Arthur William Blomfield was Hardwick's pupil in 1852–55. ==Family history== Hardwick retired to Wimbledon and married in Bath in the early 1870s. Two of his sons went into the military and served in South Africa during the Boer War; one of them, Lieutenant Stephen Thomas Hardwick, was killed in gunfire during the battle of Tweefontein in 1901. Hardwick's daughter, Helen, married Sir Henry George Lyons (1864–1944), later a director of the Science Museum in London.

It was the site of a major tank battle in 1965. The Battle of Asal Uttar was the largest tank battle of the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War. The battle led to the creation of Patton Nagar (or Patton City/Graveyard) at the site of the battle viz, Khem Karan. ==History== Khem Karan is an old town. Guru Tegh Bahadur (1621–1675) visited it. It used to be in Lahore district before partition of British India in 1947. It became a part of Amritsar district after the partition. Now it is in Tarn Taran district. Many of the town's residents migrated from nearby villages in modern Pakistan between 1947 and 1965, such as Nathuwala, Qadiwind, Rohiwal, and Sehjra. The towns Muslim residents migrated primarily to the city of Kasur, 8 km away in Pakistan. The town used to be easily accessible to the city of Kasur, Pakistan only 8 km away, and to Ferozepur 35 km away, but since India and Pakistan enacted border controls in 1953, and further restricted travel in 1965, the residents of the Khem Karan have been essentially cut off from both towns - Kasur lies in Pakistan, while the road to Ferozepur cuts through Pakistan, resulting in a detour of an extra 70 kilometre's drive. The townpeople, and those from surrounding villages, must now travel a long distance to Patti, Amritsar or Tarn Taran to procure any major goods, causing great inconvenience, and economic stagnation. ==India- Pakistan war of 1965== The tank battles of 1965 form part of military history as the most intense armored battles between the end of World War II and the 1991 Gulf War. Close to a four hundred tanks, on both sides, took part in the pitched battles and offensives. At the start of the war, Indian strength was limited to one armored division and one independent armoured brigade, along with six armoured regiments supporting infantry divisions. Pakistan had two armored divisions, with the then very modern M-48 Patton tanks. India had an equivalent tank in the Centurion, but their strength was limited to only four armored regiments. ==Demographics== India census, Khem Karan had a population of 13,446. Males constitute 55% of the population and females 45%. Khem Karan has an average literacy rate of 61.55%, lower than the state average of 75.84%: male literacy is 67%, and female literacy is 54.85%.

The Kulisteinen, also known as the Kuli stone and listed as N 449 in the Rundata catalog, is a stone with a runic inscription that was originally located at Kuløy in Smøla municipality, Norway. ==Description== For over 900 years the Kuli stone had been at Kuløy, but then 1913 it was moved to Vitenskapsmuseet i Trondheim. It had a cross on the broad side, indicating that it was a Christian marker. Then in 1956 curator Aslak Liestøl noticed that the stone had a runic inscription along the narrow edge. It reads in Old Norse: \\"Tore and Hallvard erected this stone ... (for) twelve winters/years Christianity had been in Norway\\". In the mid-1990s the inscription was subjected to laser scanning and microcartography in an attempt to arrive at a more sure reading. It was then suggested that the word translated \\"been\\" (vært) above should be read as um rétt, and that this could mean that Christianity had \\"supplied law and order\\" for twelve years. The runic stone would then have been propaganda for the new religion, Christianity. There are, however, serious paleographic and philological/linguistic problems with the new reading and interpretation. It was first suggested by Nils Halan that the inscription refers to a national event, the establishment of the law that formally made Christianity the religion of Norway at the Moster Thing in either 1022 or 1024 by King Olaf Haraldsson. The Kuli stone was later dated to 1034 since it was originally found adjacent to a Viking Age boardwalk dated dendrochronologically to that year, on the assumption that the two were contemporaneous. Others have suggested that the inscription refers to the conquest of Norway in 995 by King Olaf Tryggvason and his forced conversions. The transcription and translation below use that accepted in the Rundata database. The runic text refers to Nóregi, or Norway. One other Viking Age runestone refers to Norway, the larger Jelling Stone DR 42, which was raised by King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark and uses the name Norveg.

The suburb is located along the Swan River. The Midland railway line passes through the suburb and it is serviced by the Ashfield railway station. The housing was originally established as small collection of railway houses near the train line. In the late 1950s early 1960s the area experienced a small boom of housing (400 houses) mostly built by the then State Housing Commission partly funded by the sale of half the properties to individuals. In the late 1960s the State Housing started to reacquire some of those properties. During the late 1990s the suburb underwent a revamp driven by the State Housing Commission, now called the Department of Housing. This occurred in conjunction with the infill sewage project which was created to convert Perth homes from septic tanks and leach drains to mains sewage. They bulldozed houses on land where they had adjoining properties. For every three houses removed five to seven were built in their place. The majority of these were sold off to low income and first home buyers. The Department of Housing still owns about 22% of the houses (as opposed to their stated goal of 10%), and uses their housing stock as subsidised rental accommodation.

It lies west of Colmar, on the eastern slopes of the Vosges mountains. ==History== Archeological finds indicate the area was already inhabited during Ancient Rome. When the Germanic tribes invaded and crossed the Rhine, the Thuringii settled here and possibly gave their name to the town, which was first Thorencohaime and then Thuringheim. During the High Middle Ages Thuringheim is listed as belonging partly to the abbey of Munster and partly to the manor of Haut-Landsberg, centered in Kientzheim. Turckheim became a free imperial city in 1312, and in 1315, the construction of ramparts was begun, which are still in good condition. It already had city rights and market rights in 1354, and from 1354 to 1679, Turckheim was part of the Décapole, a league of ten free imperial cities of the Holy Roman Empire. After the Peace of Westphalia (1648), Turckheim and the other Alsatian towns refused to swear allegiance to the French king. During the Franco-Dutch War, the village of Turckheim was taken by French armies, led by Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Viscount of Turenne, which subsequently defeated armies of Austria and Brandenburg in what became known as the Battle of Turckheim (1675). Features of the village of Turckheim, especially the gates, help to identify the town in a fan currently in the Fan Museum in Greenwich, England. In 1678, with the signing of the Treaties of Nijmegen, the French king assumed control over Turckheim. In 1871, at the end of the Franco- Prussian War, the town, with the rest of the Alsace, became part of the German Empire. In 1918, it reverted to France. Turckheim is one of only a few remaining towns in France with a municipal night watchman, who makes the rounds at 10 p.m. between 1 May and 31 October and on the three Saturdays preceding Christmas. Maintained for tourist reasons, the position commemorates the 13th-century night watchman who prevented a fire. ==Notable residents== * Victor Sieg (1837 – 1899), composer and organist, was born in Turckheim.

Spelling variations for fish flake in Newfoundland include flek, fleyke, fleake, flaik and fleack. The term's first recorded use in connection with fishing appeared in Richard Whitbourne's book Newfoundland (1623, p. 57). In Norway, a flake is known as a hjell. ==Construction== The flake consists of a horizontal framework of small poles (called lungers), sometimes covered with spruce boughs, and supported by upright poles, the air having free access beneath. Here the cod are spread out to bleach in the sun and air after the fish has been curing all summer in stages under a heavy spreading of salt. There are two types of common known flakes during the height of the fishing season: one a permanent structure as described above, and the other, called a hand flake, that can be erected on short notice and provides for more area in the event that a fishing season is rather bountiful. ===Flake and fish store=== The fish flake was a permanent structure that was part of the landscape of a fishing village. These were located not far from the fishing stages that were built on the shoreline. The flake was built high off the ground and required stable construction with a sloping ramp to gain access to it. The ramp was required such that fishermen carrying a full load of fish on barrows were able to negotiate its ascent. At one end of the flake was built a building that served dual purposes. The construction of the building, called a fish store, was of two story construction and had to be large enough to accommodate a season's voyage of fish on the top level. In the lower section of the fish store was kept the gear that was used for fishing: buoys, ropes, killicks, grapples, and other miscellany. The top level of the store was of an open structure with areas that could be sectioned off to contain neat stacks of dried fish. As the drying process depended on the weather, dry fish spent up to two months in this facility. At the start of the drying season, usually mid-August to early September, the fish would be carried to the flakes and spread out for drying. ===Hand flake=== The hand flake was built and utilized only when the amount of fish caught during a season called for it; as such these were considered temporary structures. Hand flakes were built low to the ground at about waist height with the surface area about the width of a person's reach stretched in various lengths. These were placed in very tight rows to maximize available drying area. These were conveniently located next to or in close proximity to the main flake for quick storage of the fish whenever the weather was inclement. It was very vital that the fish be kept dry during the curing process to prevent rot and most importantly to prevent fly spits that would lead to maggots. Any of these occurrences could ruin a harvest. ==History== Captain George Cartwright had noted the use of flakes in his journal in the 1770s and in common use at that time. The journal of James Younge depicted a sketch of a flake c. 1663; and the illustration from Moll's map (c. 1712) shows little difference in the basic design of the flake. These structures took on a very distinct appearance within a fishing village, so much so that in his book Voyage to Newfoundland and the Southern Coast of Labrador, Edward Chappell (1818, pp. 44–45) gives a description of the flakes of St. John's not long before the great fire that destroyed most of St. John's: :On first entering the bays and ports of Newfoundland, the attention of a stranger is mostly attracted by the remarkable appearance exhibited by the innumerable stages erected along the sea-shore for the salting and drying of cod. The shores around the harbour of St. John's are entirely covered with them, and their construction is particularly simple. Numerous supporters, exactly resembling \\"Kentish\\" hop- poles, are first fixed in the ground: over these is placed a horizontal platform of similar poles; and the whole is finally overspread with a covering of dry fern. This sort of structure is called, by the fishermen, a Fish Flake: but there are other stages, erected in a similar manner, although standing partly in the water, with a hut at their extremity, for the reception and salting of cod, previous to its final removal to the \\"Flakes\\", for the purpose of being dried in the sun. Flakes were used well into the twentieth century, but the demand for dried fish lessened as cold storage and freezer units came into use. However, in the mid 1980s flakes were still being used in smaller outport communities to dry fish for family use and local sale of dried salt- cod. ==Fish drying process== Prior to the widespread use of freezer technology the Newfoundland fishery was dependent on salt as a preservative and curing agent. This process was necessitated because it was unfeasible for vessels to take their catch back to Europe on every trip to the fishing grounds on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Certainly to obtain the best price for the fish caught during the fishing season the quality of the fish was of prime importance and care was taken to ensure a profitable catch. When the fish was taken from the saltbulk it was then washed of excess salt and film that had formed during the curing process. The salted cod was then transported to the fish flakes by two men carrying a barrow. The fish was then spread out in a very neat and tidy order by placing them alternately heads and tails. These were first laid face-up, which is flesh side exposed to the sun. As the fish dried it was then flipped over to dry the back side of the salted cod. Before nightfall when the air became damp the fish was gathered up and placed in neat piles called faggots to minimize the exposed area of the fish. As the fish became dry enough for marketability, it was then stored in the fish store until most if not all of the season's harvest was dried in this fashion. The drying of fish may have taken up to a week to completely dry. The whole process of drying the complete season catch may have taken a month or two as space and manpower permitted. ==See also== * Fishing stage * List of communities in Newfoundland and Labrador ==External links== *The fishery from Heritage Newfoundland and Labrador *Dictionary of Newfoundland English Category:Culture of Newfoundland and Labrador Category:Fish processing ","title":"Fish flake"},{"id":"2582725","text":"Obernai (Alsatian: Owernah; ) commune in the Bas-Rhin department in Alsace in north-eastern France.

The Obernai name first appears in 1240, when the village acquires the status of town under the tutelage of the Hohenstaufen family. The town then prospered. It became a member of the Décapole in 1354, an alliance of ten towns of the Holy Roman Empire in Alsace. Obernai's status reaches its apex in the 15th and 16th century. In 1562, Emperor Ferdinand I visited the prosperous town of Obernai. The Thirty Years' War (1618–48) damaged the town, which was occupied by the Imperial troops, then by the Swedes. The town was ransomed and ceded to France in 1679, and started to recover some of its prosperity, without totally recapturing its former glory. The town was annexed by Germany in 1871 with the rest of Alsace, then returned to France after World War I in 1918.

Dough and Dynamite == Plot == The story involves Chaplin and Chester Conklin working as waiters at a restaurant. Charlie is especially inept and his comic carelessness enrages the customers. The workers in the restaurant's bakery go on strike for more pay, but are fired by the unsympathetic proprietor. Charlie is put to work in the bakery where his lack of skills upsets his boss and co-worker Chester Conklin. Meanwhile, the vengeful strikers have arranged to smuggle a loaf of bread concealing a stick of dynamite into the bakery. During a free-for-all involving Charlie, Chester, and their boss, the dynamite dramatically explodes. At the end of the film, Charlie emerges groggily from a pile of sticky dough. ==Mack Sennett's recollections== In Mack Sennett's 1954 autobiography, King of Comedy, he recalled he was absent from Keystone Studios for most of the filming of Dough and Dynamite. Before Sennett left, he put Chaplin and Conklin jointly in charge of creating a new comedy with basically no guidelines. The two comedians began creating a film in which each man was a roominghouse boarder competing against one another in trying to woo the landlady, but they abandoned the idea after a short time. When they saw a \\"help wanted\\" sign outside a local bakery, the idea of a slapstick comedy set within a bakery came to both men almost simultaneously. Sennett claimed, however, that it was his idea to have a stick of dynamite concealed in a loaf of bread. Sennett declared Dough and Dynamite to be Chaplin's breakout film with Keystone. ==Reviews== The New York Dramatic Mirror praised Chaplin's efforts in Dough and Dynamite, writing, \\"In a comparatively short time, Charles Chaplin has earned a reputation as a slapstick comedian second to none. His odd little tricks of manner and his refusal to do the most simple things in an ordinary way are essential features of his method, which thus far has defied successful imitation.\\" Moving Picture World commented, \\"Two reels of pure nonsense, some of which is very laughable indeed. Chas. Chaplin appears as a waiter in a French restaurant and bakery. He has a terrible time breaking dishes and getting the dough over the floor. The bakers go on strike and at the last the whole place is blown up by dynamite. This is well-pictured and very successful for this form of humor.\\" ==Cast== * Charles Chaplin - Pierre * Chester Conklin - Jacques * Fritz Schade - Monsieur La Vie, Bakery Owner * Norma Nichols - Mme.

Fessenden House is a historic house at 45 Waban Hill Road in the village of Chestnut Hill in Newton, Massachusetts. It was the residence from 1919 to his death in 1932 of the inventor Reginald A. Fessenden (1866–1932), called \\"the father of radio broadcasting,\\" because he was the first to broadcast the human voice and music by radio. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976 in recognition of Fessenden's accomplishments. ==Description and history== The Fessenden House is an architecturally undistinguished three story brick building, with a stuccoed exterior and a tile roof. It has vernacular styling that includes a hooded entry, large central chimney, and a generally asymmetrical massing. The interior follows a fairly typical central hall plan. Both the exterior and interior of the house are relatively unaltered since Fessenden's ownership; the only notable alteration is the addition of awnings on some of the east- facing windows. Reginald A. Fessenden was born in Quebec in 1866, and entered Bishop's University as a precocious young mathematical prodigy, but left in 1884 without graduating. In 1886, he took a position at the Edison Machine Works, working for inventor Thomas Edison. During an academic period teaching at Purdue University and at the University of Pittsburgh, Fessenden engaged in research on the nascent subject of wireless telegraphy. Much of the rest of his life he was employed in industry, either directly or as a consultant, but was often living near poverty, and produced a stream of inventions. In 1904 he invented the rotary spark-gap transmitter, and in 1906 he built a large transmitter in Massachusetts from which he successfully made a voice transmission. He also discovered the means to recombine separate frequencies to form a coherent audible sound. At his death he was described by inventor and businessman Elihu Thomson as \\"the greatest wireless inventor of the age, greater than Marconi.\\" Fessenden purchased the Newton house in 1919, and it was his home until his death in 1932. Although he spent most of later years in Bermuda, this house is the place with the longest-lasting association with his life in the United States. It is still a private home and is not open to the public. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark on January 7, 1976, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, in recognition that it is one of the few places with a long-term association with Fessenden. ==See also== * National Register of Historic Places listings in Newton, Massachusetts * List of National Historic Landmarks in Massachusetts ==References== The house in 2012 Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Newton, Massachusetts Category:National Historic Landmarks in Massachusetts ","title":"Reginald A.

She is the wife of Prince Pieter- Christiaan of Orange-Nassau, van Vollenhoven. ==Early life== Anita van Eijk was born in Neuchâtel, Switzerland, the daughter of Leonardus Antonius van Eijk and J.C.M. van Eijk-Steens. She spent her early childhood in Aix-en- Provence, France, before the family headed back to the Netherlands where she undertook her primary school education. The family then moved to Singapore, where she studied at the United World College of South East Asia, before returning to the Netherlands, where she completed an International Baccalaureate at the Rijnlands Lyceum in Oegstgeest. She studied English and literature at Leiden University and afterwards communications at the University of Amsterdam, where she graduated in 1996. During her university years, Anita undertook an internship in London at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency.

She was convicted of first-degree murder of a restaurant owner and a police officer in 1981.California Department of Justice: Court No 7643, Prob File No 17517: The People of the state of California vs. Annika Maria Deasy, defendant. In April 2009, after 27 years in a California prison, Östberg was handed over to Swedish authorities and transferred to Sweden, and incarcerated in the Hinseberg women's prison north of Örebro. She was later fully released. ==Childhood and marriage== Annika Östberg grew up in Hässelby in Stockholm, and moved with her mother to California in the 1960s. She ran away from home to San Francisco, where she became a drug addict. She married Brian Deasy and gave up drugs, but when the marriage failed she resumed her drug habit. ==Prior criminal record== Östberg was convicted of theft in 1973 and received 18 months probation. Also in 1973, she was convicted of possession of a controlled substance and received three years probation. In 1976 she was convicted of providing liquor to a minor and received 12 months probation, one day in jail, and was ordered to pay a $65 fine. In 1972, a man was stabbed to death in Östberg's apartment in San Francisco. Östberg admitted perpetrating the crime and was found guilty.Metro \\"Östberg inte alls oskyldigt dömd\\" av Stefan Wahlberg 19 maj 2005 ==The murders== On April 30, 1981, Östberg and her boyfriend Bob Cox robbed and killed ex-restaurant owner Joe Torre. Östberg sold stolen meat to restaurants and had made an appointment in a warehouse with Torre. While she pretended to bring the meat out of the truck, Bob Cox shot him. They robbed Torre and drove away. When their vehicle broke down on the highway the next day, Sgt Helbush stopped to render aid. According to Lake County district attorney Lester Fleming, evidence exists that Östberg may have shot Sgt Helbush as he walked back to his patrol car. Östberg stated that while she pretended to search for her driver's licence, Cox shot Helbush in the back of the head. Östberg told Cox to get rid of the body. They stole the policeman's wallet and the police car. A patrol soon found Helbush's body when he failed to report back. Policeman Don Anderson discovered his colleague's stolen police car on a road in the Cobb Mountain area. After a short pursuit, Cox crashed the stolen car on a sharp curve near intersection 175 at Dry Creek Road . During a shootout during which Östberg helped Cox to reload, Cox was wounded by several shots from the police and surrendered. Östberg tried to reach a gun before a police officer arrested her. Östberg explained the crimes in detail at her hearings and blamed her drug abuse. However, drug tests showed that she was not using narcotics at the time. ==Sentence== In 1983, Annika Östberg received a sentence of 25 years to life for the 1981 murders. At that time it was customary for well-behaved prisoners to be set free after serving approximately half of their sentence. Documents from that period indicate that Östberg's lawyers believed she could be out after 12 ½ years. Previously, life prisoners served their sentences according to the law and their behavior in prison. However, this was not the case after 2000. Politics changed throughout the years, and as the sentencing laws changed, so did the mindset of the Board of Prison Terms and the Governor's office in Sacramento. ==Parole hearings== Östberg was denied parole and was refused transfer to Sweden in 1997, 2002, 2005, and 2008.\\"No parole for Swede in American prison\\", Stockholm News, September 19, 2008 ==Campaigns== Relatives of the victims, the police, and other Americans pushed for Östberg to remain in jail. They received support from California's Governor, who declared that she is a vicious killer. The Board of Prison Terms determined that Östberg was not ready for parole because she had acted in a cold-blooded manner and the motive was trivial. The Parole Board was critical of the Swedish media, who presented a one-sided view of Östberg. Many in USA want someone to get death penalty or at least full lifetime for the murders. Campaigns in Sweden urged for her sentence to be time-determined and that she be allowed to serve the remaining imprisonment in her home country. Claims were made that her sentence was inhumane, as Östberg was not the one who personally shot the restaurant owner and policeman, and that Östberg had served enough time for her involvement in the murders. In opposition to these claims, others note that Östberg plead guilty, that her sentence was fair and correct under California law, that her connection to Sweden is extremely limited, and that she has been treated no differently than any other inmate convicted of similar crimes. ==Swedish reactions== The Annika Östberg case upset many Swedes, since it is claimed that she was not armed and did not commit any murder. The Swedish media claimed that she was only present on the scene, and did not do anything, and was held as a scapegoat for her boyfriend, who committed suicide before his trial. It was written that she would not get any penalty at all if it was in Sweden. Relatives had contacted the media, and this version was initially used as they had trouble getting information from California. Later the Swedish media admitted to her having a higher degree of involvement in the episode. She implied that she committed the killings in statements to the police. She confessed to avoid death penalty, which would have been hard to avoid if she actually shot the victims. Some believe that if she was convicted in Sweden she would get 6–7 years imprisonment. In another case in Sweden, the 1988 Åmsele murders, the girlfriend was sentenced to two years for doing nothing to prevent Juha Valjakkala from committing a triple murder. That girl did not reload a gun or similar, but just watched the murders silently. In that case the boyfriend was sentenced to lifetime in prison. Under California law she is just as culpable as her boyfriend because she was an active participant. Her lawyers negotiated a plea bargain that spared her from a death sentence. There has been criticism against the Swedish media, also in Sweden, who has decided to protect a Swedish woman, who has got a harsh treatment by foreign authorities. The criticism says that the media has avoided to describe what she did during the events. Swedish media could not avoid writing in a way giving readers in Sweden. The well known police academy professor Leif GW Persson said: \\"She is a very heavy criminal. Media has touched that very gently. I assume that is because they want her to be released, then it is hard to do a correct description of the case.\\". ==Transfer to Sweden and release== The question of being transferred to a Swedish prison is outside the scope of a parole hearing. California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger refused in an interview in August 2005 with Swedish television to let her be transferred to Sweden to serve the remaining period in her native country. In April 2009 she was finally transferred after years of silent diplomatic activity. It is believed that the financial crisis in the United States and the fact that prisoners are a burden on the economy was one reason for the transfer. Östberg became one of the first prisoners to be transferred under the new rules. On November 16, 2009, a Swedish court decided that her life sentence should be time-limited so that she can be released in May 2011, more than 30 years after her arrest. On August 8, 2010, Östberg hosted the program Sommar on Sveriges Radio. She was released on May 2, 2011, after having been locked up for 30 years, since May 1, 1981, a longer prison time than almost any Swedish citizen. ==Bibliography== * * * ==References== Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Swedish people imprisoned abroad Category:Swedish female murderers Category:Swedish people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by California ","title":"Annika Östberg"},{"id":"2582803","text":"The monument commemorating the battle, at Montapertaccio () One of the two 60-foot-tall flagpoles in the Siena Cathedral. During the battle of Montaperti (1260), Bocca degli Abati, a Sienese spy, brought the Florence flag down causing panic among the Florentine soldiers and ultimately their defeat. The Battle of Montaperti was fought on 4 September 1260 between Florence and Siena in Tuscany as part of the conflict between the Guelphs and Ghibellines. The Florentines were routed. It was the bloodiest battle fought in Medieval Italy, with more than 10,000 fatalities. An act of treachery during the battle is recorded by Dante Alighieri in the Inferno section of the Divine Comedy. ==Prelude== The Guelphs and Ghibellines were rival factions that nominally took the parts of the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire, respectively, in Italy in the 12th and 13th centuries; in practice, their allegiances often had more to do with competing local interests than with the contesting claims of the papacy and the Empire. In the mid-13th century, Guelphs held sway in Florence whilst Ghibellines controlled Siena. In 1258, the Guelphs succeeded in expelling from Florence the last of the Ghibellines with any real power; they followed this with the murder of Tesauro Beccharia, Abbot of Vallombrosa, who was accused of plotting the return of the Ghibellines. The feud came to a head two years later when the Florentines, aided by their Tuscan allies (Bologna, Prato, Lucca, Orvieto, San Gimignano, San Miniato, Volterra, and Colle Val d'Elsa), moved an army of some 35,000 men (including 12 generals) toward Siena. The Sienese called for help from King Manfred of Sicily, who provided a contingent of German mercenary heavy cavalry, as well as the Holy Roman states of Pisa and Cortona. The Sienese forces were led by Farinata degli Uberti, an exiled Florentine Ghibelline. Even with these reinforcements, though, they could raise an army of only 20,000. ==The battle== Banners of Terni's Ghibellines at Montaperti (in first half of 13th century) The Ghibelline army consisted of four divisions,Marchionni, Roberto. Sienese's Battles (1) Montaperti. Siena: Roberto Marchionni Editore, 1996. with a well worked out but risky plan involving an ambushing force in the rear of the Florentine army. The first division, led by Count d'Arras, the seneschal of Count Giordano (the German mercenary commander), consisted of 200 German knights and 200 Sienese crossbowmen,Marchionni, 41. who maneuvered unseen south of the battlefield around the Monselvoli-Costaberci Ridge and took up a position south of Monselvoli Hill along the road to Asciano with orders to charge the Guelfs upon hearing the Ghibellines shout “San Giorgio\\" (\\"Saint George\\").Marchionni, 43. The second division, led by the German commander, Count Giordano d'Agliano made up the vanguard of the Sienese main body and consisted of 600 German knights and 600 infantry. The third division, led by the captain of the Sienese forces, Count Aldobrandino Aldobrandeschi, formed the main body of the Ghibelline army, consisting of about 600 Tuscan knights and 17,000 Sienese and allied infantry. The fourth division, commanded by Niccolò da Bigozzi, centurion of the Terzo di Camollia, made up the rearguard with the specific task of guarding the Sienese carroccio, and consisted of 200 Sienese knights and a few hundred armed priests and monks. At least, from Umbria, there was the most historical and fiercer Ghibelline city-state: Terni (rewarded by a little more than two decades by Frederick II with the black eagle in a gold field in its national banner: \\"... for the loyalty and vigor of his men ... \\"and commanded by an old, solid and proud aristocracy of Germanic lineage: House of Castelli in the first place, a family descendant from the Frankish princes of Terni, but also the Houses of Camporeali and Cittadini). According to Sienese tradition, the day before the battle, the Ghibelline army marched thrice around the Ropole Hill in full view of the Guelf army, changing uniforms each time and mounting non-combatants on pack animals in order to create the impression that their army was three times as large as it actually was.Marchionni, 40. In addition, the Ghibellines conducted harassing night raids on the Guelf camp. The result sowed caution in the Florentine commanders, who decided on a strategic withdrawal and had begun to break camp when the Sienese army crossed the Arbia River, probably on a bridge at Taverne d'Arbia early on 4 September, and began advancing. The Florentines had no choice but to offer battle. The battle took place at the foot of the Monselvoli-Costaberci Ridge about six kilometers east of Siena. The Ghibelline-Sienese army was arrayed north to south with the vanguard (German knights) on the north, or left wing, and the main body stretched out to the south. To the east, facing them, with the tactical advantages of being uphill and with a rising sun behind them were the Guelf-Florentines, in a defensive posture. The precise organization of the Guelf army is not known but it is nearly certain that they positioned their main body of infantry (some 30,000) on the south opposite the Sienese infantry with their cavalry (some 3,000 knights) on the north facing the German and Tuscan knights. The Sienese- Ghibelline army waited until the sun was well up in order to deny that advantage to the enemy, and the battle finally started around 10:00 with a charge of the German knights, which forced the right wing of the Guelfs to withdraw. The Tuscan knights of the Ghibelline third division entered the melee, and while the knights were thus engaged on the north end of the battlefield, the Sienese and allied infantry attacked the Florentines on the steepest side of Monselvoli. The battle raged with the Florentines gradually gaining the upper hand due to the weight of superior numbers until about 15:00, when Niccolò da Bigozzi (in command of the Sienese 4th Division) attacked and stabilized the situation. At about this same time, a group of Tuscan Ghibelline exiles, who were fighting in the Sienese-Ghibelline army, convinced some relatives fighting on the opposite side to betray the Guelfs. A knight with Ghibelline sympathies, but fighting with the Florentines (Bocca degli Abati), joined the Sienese cause by charging the standard-bearer of the Florentine cavalry and cutting off the hand that held the Florentine battle flag. Bocca and the other Ghibelline sympathizers in the Guelph ranks then charged the Florentine Carroccio, but without success. By then it was late in the day and the Guelphs had the sun in their eyes. Around 18:00, the prearranged cry of “San Giorgio” went up from the Ghibelline ranks, and Count Arras led his German knights from ambush directly against the Florentine commander (who was probably Iacopino Rangoni da Modena, Uberto Ghibellino or Buonconte Monaldeschi – the chronicles differ) and killed him. This led to the beginning of a rout of the Florentine-Guelph forces. The greater part of the Florentine cavalry was destroyed, their camp sacked, and their carroccio was captured.Marchionni, 44. It is estimated that 10,000 men died on the Guelph side, 4,000 went missing, and 15,000 were captured, the rest running for their lives. Some 600 Ghibelline soldiers died.Marchionni, 45. After the battle, the German soldiers in the Sienese army used part of their pay to found the Church of San Giorgio in via Pantaneto—the Germans had called on Saint George as their battle-cry during the fight.. ==Depiction in the Divine Comedy== Dante studied under Florence's Chancellor Brunetto Latini, who was himself away from the battle scene, on embassy in Castile seeking help for Guelph Florence from Alfonso X el Sabio. Dante would have learned of the battle, its preparations (documented by Latini in the Libro di Montaperti), strategies and treachery, as well as those of the Battles of Benevento and Tagliacozzo, from the Chancellor,Julia Bolton Holloway, Twice-Told Tales: Brunetto Latino and Dante Alighieri using material also to be gleaned later by Giovanni Villani, the Florentine merchant and historian. As a result, Dante reserved a place in the ninth circle of Hell for the traitor Bocca degli Abati in his Divine Comedy. The Ghibelline commander Farinata degli Uberti is also consigned to Dante's hell, not for his conduct in the battle, but for his alleged heretical adherence to the philosophy of Epicurus. ==See also== * Dante Alighieri * Guelphs and Ghibellines * Manfred of Sicily * Siena * Florence * Montaperti ==Sources== ==External links== *Excerpt from the Chronicle of Giovanni Villani *Excerpt from The Divine Comedy: the ninth circle of Hell Category:1260 in Europe Category:1260s in the Holy Roman Empire Category:Conflicts in 1260 Montaperti 1260 Montaperti 1260 Category:Battles in Tuscany Category:Wars of the Guelphs and Ghibellines Category:13th century in the Republic of Florence Category:13th century in the Republic of Siena ","title":"Battle of Montaperti"},{"id":"2582816","text":"Lawesson's reagent, or LR, is a chemical compound used in organic synthesis as a thiation agent. Lawesson's reagent was first made popular by Sven-Olov Lawesson, who did not, however, invent it. Lawesson's reagent was first made in 1956 during a systematic study of the reactions of arenes with P4S10. ==Preparation== Lawesson's reagent is commercially available. It can also be conveniently prepared in the laboratory by heating a mixture of anisole with phosphorus pentasulfide until the mixture is clear and no more hydrogen sulfide is formed, then recrystallized from toluene or xylene. As Lawesson's reagent has a strong and unpleasant smell, it is best to prepare the compound within a fume-hood and to treat all glassware used with a decontamination solution before taking the glassware outside the fume-hood. One common and effective method of destroying the foul smelling residues is to use an excess of sodium hypochlorite (chlorine bleach). ==Mechanism of action== Lawesson's reagent has a four membered ring of alternating sulfur and phosphorus atoms. With heating, the central phosphorus/sulfur four-membered ring can open to form two reactive dithiophosphine ylides (R-PS2). Much of the chemistry of Lawessons's reagent is in fact the chemistry of these reactive intermediates. :300px In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. ==Applications== The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several groups. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones. :Thionation of a ketone to give a thioketone using Lawesson's reagent In one study, reaction of maltol with LR results in a selective oxygen replacement in two positions. :Maltol reaction with LR A combination of silver perchlorate and Lawesson's reagent is able to act as an oxophilic Lewis acid with the ability to catalyze the Diels-Alder reaction of dienes with α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. Alcohols may be converted to thiols by treatment with Lawesson's reagent. Lawesson's reagent reacts with sulfoxides to form a thio product, which are then desulfurized to form thioethers. Therefore, it can be used as a reducing agent for sulfoxide. ==See also== * Woollins' reagent ==References== ==External links== * Category:Reagents for organic chemistry Category:Sulfur heterocycles Category:Phosphorus heterocycles Category:Four-membered rings ","title":"Lawesson's reagent"},{"id":"2582836","text":"Search Engine Watch (SEW) provides news and information about search engines and search engine marketing.

Berg en Terblijt ( or ) is the official Dutch name of a village in the municipality of Valkenburg aan de Geul in the province of Limburg in the Southern part of the Netherlands. ==History== The area now known as Berg en Terblijt has been inhabited since the Early Middle Ages. Between the 500 and 800 A.D., a couple of farming communities have been established at the Langen Akker, on the eastern side of the village, and around the Schone Poel, which is on the western side of the village.\\"V.Th.J. Claessens, A.H.H. Houben, H.L. Reaven, \\"Berg en Terblijt: van twee heerlijkheden naar een gemeente\\". Valkenburg aan de Geul, 1981, page 31-32 The Schone Poel has been argued to be a traditional small Frankish, being designed in a triangular form with farms around a central drinking pool. Until the late 1500s there had been a tradition of winemaking in the area of Berg en Terblijt. Even during the Eighty Years' War a couple of vineyards were producing wines from local varieties of vines,\\"V.Th.J. Claessens, A.H.H. Houben, H.L. Reaven, \\"Berg en Terblijt: van twee heerlijkheden naar een gemeente\\". Valkenburg aan de Geul, 1981, page 18-49 a tradition that has returned with the recent climate change that have made it possible once more to produce quality wines so far north. Berg en Terblijt was a combination of Berg (4000 inhabitants) and Terblijt (100 inhabitants). Berg derived its name from its location, on top of a hill, overlooking Maastricht. The area of Berg en Terblijt is wooded and crossed by the Geul river. In 1982 the area was merged with , forming the new municipality of Valkenburg aan de Geul. ==People: economy, leisure== As Berg is situated along the edge of the Plateau of Margraten, a very fertile loess plain about 160 meters above NAP it has been an agricultural community for most of its history. Only in the last decades has the production of foodstuffs like grains and fruits lost most of its former importance.\\"V.Th.J. Claessens, A.H.H. Houben, H.L.

Being close to tourist hotspots Valkenburg and Maastricht, the village offers some bed and breakfast and hotel accommodation, as well as a camping site. Since the early 1990s the village has had an own radio-station, Falcon Radio. In recent years the local television-station of TV Valkenburg has been broadcasting on cable in the municipality of Valkenburg aan de Geul, including Berg en Terblijt Berg en Terblijt has a very active community life with various sports clubs (football, handball, tennis, badminton, judo billiards), a concert band, a mixed choir, a young adults club (Jonkheid), and a carnival club. ==References== * Information about Berg en Terblijt ==External links== *Berg en Terblijt seen from above (Google Maps) *5.775311&spn;=0.018176,0.054245&t;=k Schone Poel as seen from above (Google Maps) Category:Former municipalities of Limburg (Netherlands) Category:Populated places in Limburg (Netherlands) Category:Valkenburg aan de Geul ","title":"Berg en Terblijt"},{"id":"2582846","text":"The Lotus Eaters was a BBC television drama made in 1972 and 1973. The series, written by Michael J. Bird, dealt with the lives of various British expats living on the island of Crete, and their reasons for being there. ==Plot== The central characters were a married couple, Erik (Ian Hendry) and Ann Shepherd (Wanda Ventham), who ran a tavern called \\"Shepherd's Bar\\". Ann is revealed in the first episode to be a sleeper agent of British Intelligence, Erik having been a broken-down drunk whom she was made to marry as part of her cover story. Other episodes dealt with the other expats who frequented the bar. The most intriguing character in both series is the Greek police captain, Michael Krasakis (Stefan Gryff). In the second series the British Intelligence aspect is developed, until a clash with Soviet and Chinese agents results in both Ann and Erik having to leave Crete. In the final scene, about to board a plane leaving Heraklion airport, they have a partial reconciliation, since each is the only person the other can trust. == Cast == Main cast: * Ian Hendry as Erik Shepherd * Wanda Ventham as Ann Shepherd * Maurice Denham as Nestor Turton * Stefan Gryff as Captain Michael Krasakis * Anthony Stamboulieh as Nikos Recurring cast – Series 1 only: * James Kerry as Donald Culley (eps. 1, 3, 8–9) * Thorley Walters as Major Edward Woolley (eps. 1–4) * Sylvia Coleridge as Miriam Woolley (eps. 1–4) * Julia Goodman as Kirsten McLuhan (eps. 1–2, 4–5, 7, 9) * Martin Howells as Mark Potter (eps. 1–2, 4–5, 7, 9) * Karan David as Katerina (eps. 1–6, 8–9) * Carol Cleveland as Leigh Mervish (eps. 1–4, 7) * Karl Held as Philip \\"Pip\\" Mervish (eps. 1–4, 7) Recurring cast – Series 2 only: * Timothy Carlton as Gerard Mace * John Horsley as Sir Hugh Russell (eps. 2–4) * Paul Maxwell as Sam Webber (eps. 2–6) * Susan Engel as Imogen Lundqvist (eps. 2–6) * Frank Duncan as Cotton * Godfrey James as Nicholson * Ronald Howard as Dr John Dartington (eps. 2–6) * Calliope Petrohilos as Ariadne Mazonaki (eps. 2–6) ==Production== The Lotus Eaters was filmed in the Cretan resort of Aghios Nikolaos and derived its title from the Lotus Eaters of Greek mythology, where those who ate the fruit of the lotus tree lost the desire to return home.

The town is named after a local property of the same name that was established in 1833 by William Nairn. The Northam to Kalgoorlie Eastern Goldfields Railway line passes through the town and includes a crossing loop. The railway was built through the area in 1894. Land was set aside for a townsite in 1898 and the town was gazetted in the same year. The surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops. During its heyday of the 1950s–90s the town's local farmers were the largest producers of chaff (feed for racehorses) in Western Australia. The product was sought after by buyers throughout Western Australia as well as Asia and the Middle East. The town is a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling and had a Type B structure in the 1970s. The post office within the town is reputed to be the smallest in Australia. The town also has an excellent tavern dating back to the golden days of the once-important rail head. The town is situated on the Golden Pipeline heritage trail. The pipeline passes through Grass Valley. Grass Valley and surrounding districts are serviced by the Grass Valley Bush Fire Brigade, supported by over 50 local volunteer members. The Brigade has one appliance being a 4.4B (4,000L, 4WD, Broadacre) truck, although it has been recognized for over 10 years that a second appliance is desperately needed to adequately protect the district. The Grass Valley fire district is the largest fire district within the Shire of Northam and the Brigade is the second most active Brigade in regards to call-outs in the Shire. The Grass Valley Fire Shed is located on the corner of Wilson St and Keane St, Grass Valley on the site of the old Grass Valley school which ran from 1899-1945. ==References== () Category:Towns in Western Australia Category:Wheatbelt (Western Australia) Category:Grain receival points of Western Australia ","title":"Grass Valley, Western Australia"},{"id":"2582858","text":"The building of the former Devonshire Club The Devonshire Club was a London gentlemen's club which was established in 1874 and was disbanded in 1976. Throughout its existence it was based at 50 St James's Street. The major Liberal club of the day was the Reform Club, but in the wake of the 1868 Reform Act's extension of the franchise, the waiting list for membership from the larger electorate grew to such an extent that a new club was formed to accommodate these new Liberal voters. The clubhouse was on the western side of St James's Street. The original intention was to call it the 'Junior Reform Club', along the model of the Junior Carlton Club formed in 1866, but complaints from the Reform Club's members led it to being named the Devonshire, in honour of its first chairman, the Duke of Devonshire, an aristocrat from a long line of Liberals. The club was fortunate in obtaining the St James's Street premises of Crockford's Club, a renowned eighteenth century club which had closed down in 1845. The Devonshire did well in its first decade, but found itself in an awkward position from the 1880s upon the establishment of the National Liberal Club. With a further extension of the franchise in 1885, the much larger National Liberal was aimed at these new electors, and the Devonshire came to possess neither the prestige of Brooks's or the Reform, nor the broader appeal of the National Liberal. The Devonshire soon lost its political flavour. In the 1960s the Golfers Club shared the premises using a club room at the back of the building and there was also a Masonic temple on site, catering for those lodges without premises. After a great deal of financial trouble in the 1970s (mirrored in many other clubs of the time, including the Reform, the Carlton, the St James's, the United University, the Junior Carlton, the Army and Navy, and the United Service Club), it finally closed in 1976, with its membership being absorbed by the East India Club. ==Further reading== *Henry Turner Waddy, The Devonshire Club and Crockford's (E.

Interior view looking towards rear of building, 1940. The 1790 House, also called the Joseph Bartlett House or the Bartlett–Wheeler House, is a historic house located at 827 Main Street, Woburn, Massachusetts, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is close to the Baldwin House, with the Middlesex Canal running between them. The 1790 House, originally on Main Street, has been moved closer to the canal to make room for a hotel. It now faces more south than its original facing of southwest. ==History== The Federal style house was originally built in 1790 on the banks of the Middlesex Canal, for Woburn lawyer Joseph Bartlett. Shortly before completion it was purchased by Col. Loammi Baldwin, noted engineer, who hoped to convince expatriate scientist and inventor Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, to return to his home town. Although this idea never came to fruition, author Frances Parkinson Keyes, who later spent childhood summers in the home, refers to it repeatedly in her memoirs as the Count Rumford House. The house also features in her autobiography, Roses in December. In 1815 Hall Jackson Kelley conducted a private school for boys in the house, and there he first read the newly published Journals of Lewis and Clark. Kelley conceived a passion for the Pacific Northwest and became the prime advocate of the United States settlement of Oregon. He then migrated west to become a legendary \\"mountain man\\" and explorer. The house was purchased by the BNMC MA Realty LLC in March 2014. Previously, the house was owned by Woburn Daily Times Inc since 1981 and is currently used as office space. Before that it was owned by the North Congregational Church of Woburn, and used as a Sunday School. ==Structure== The structure stands two stories tall beneath a hip roof, seven bays wide and four bays deep. It is of frame construction covered with clapboard, except at the front where it is imitation ashlar; wood quoins ornament its corners. A two tier Doric porch projects from the front facade, with single-story Tuscan pillars supporting the porch, and two-story Doric pillars at the corners. The upper level has a balustrade with Chinese railings. The two sides and rear also contain entrances, and the rear facade was once graced with a large Palladian window. (As of 2005, the rear facade seems to have been obliterated in a large-scale extension to the building.) There are two interior end chimneys. At one time there was a large barn filled with old books behind the building; this was torn down in the late 1960s. ==See also== * List of historic houses in Massachusetts * National Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex County, Massachusetts ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1790 Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Middlesex County, Massachusetts Category:Woburn, Massachusetts Category:Federal architecture in Massachusetts Category:Historic district contributing properties in Massachusetts ","title":"1790 House"},{"id":"2582871","text":"Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co.

It follows a more eastern route than the Østfold Line, with which it adjoins at both Ski Station and Sarpsborg Station, serving the Indre Østfold district. The line is single track and electrified. The Eastern Line serves the hourly L22 lines of the Oslo Commuter Rail, operated by the Norwegian State Railways. There is no regular traffic south of Rakkestad Station, although the line can be used for freight trains when the Western Line is closed. The line was built at the same time as the Østfold Line, but opened three years later, on 24 November 1882. Stations were designed by Balthazar Lange.

The line is single track and electrified at . It is the only railway in Norway to feature ERTMS, with both GSM-R and European Train Control System (ETCS) Level 2. The line's peak elevation of is reached at Eidsberg Station.Bjerke & Holom: 50 The term Østfold Line is most commonly used to describe the section from Oslo via Moss to Kornsjø. This is sometimes also referred to as the Western Line. Both uses exclude the section from Ski via Askim to Sarpsborg, known as the Eastern Line. At other times Østfold Line is used to refer to the entire network, both via Moss and Askim. Sometimes Western Line is used to only describe the section from Ski via Moss to Sarpsborg. Although the eastern and western branches were initially planned as equals, the western has become dominant due to it always having had a higher standard and serving all through trains. ==History== ===Planning=== The lack of early interest in a railway in Østfold was caused by the ice-free Oslofjord and the perceived non-necessity of build a line where a suitable waterway already existed.Langård & Ruud: 17 Proposals for a railway through the county then known as Smaalenene were first launched with two independent letters to the editor in 1866. They exemplified the debate which would follow, with one proposing a route along the coast through the larger coastal towns, while the other proposed an inner route via Askim and Rakkestad. Preliminary surveys were carried out the following year, which also investigated two routes to the Swedish border, one via Tistedalen and one along Iddefjord. The government was at first less enthusiastic, in part because they were concerned that no line would be built on the Swedish side.Langård & Ruud: 19 Mysen Station in 1922. The station building was demolished in 1989 By 1872 the disagreement over an interior or coastal route was raging and a compromise was proposed in which the line would be built with two branches.Langård & Ruud: 20 The government recommended a twin-armed line on 5 April 1873 and was approved in Parliament on 5 June. Detailed surveying was led by Carl Abraham Pihl and concluded on 31 March 1874. He wanted the route to take the shortest possible way from Askim to Rakkestad, bypassing Mysen. The short-cut was not endorsed by Parliament. With increasing cost estimates, Parliament decided to reduce the standard on the Eastern Line. The line was approved with 59 against 42 votes in Parliament on 4 June 1874.Langård & Ruud: 23 ===Construction=== Construction commenced in 1874, initially only on the section from Oslo to Halden. Work was subdivided into eleven sections on the Western Line and four on the Eastern Line. The former received a rail weight of 30 kilograms per meter (60 lb/ft).Langård & Ruud: 24 Work on the Eastern Line did not start until 1877. It received a track weight of only 25 kilograms per meter (50 lb/ft). A recession hit in 1877 and the government stopped all construction for a period, initially only continuing it on the Western Line. This caused an uproar along the line and municipal councils sent inn demands that construction resume. Funding was thus granted again in 1878. About 1,100 people were hired to work on the Eastern Line. Most of the workforce were Swedish immigrants.Langård & Ruud: 26 Groundwork was conducted directly by the railway based on accords, with the track was laid by contractors. Slitu Station during the 1920s The Østfold Line was the first railway in Norway were all bridges were built with iron. This allowed for the construction of viaducts at some places, which changed the mass balance allowing the line to follow a better gradient. The most prominent on the Eastern Line was the Solberg Viaduct, the Hobøl Viaduct and the Langnes Bridge. The bridges and viaducts were all designed by Axel Jacob Petersson.Langård & Ruud: 30 The Western Line from Oslo to Halden was taken into revenue service on 2 January 1879.Langård & Ruud: 50 Construction of the Eastern Line was delayed and was opened in stages.Langård & Ruud: 58 The section from Ski to Spydeberg taken into use on 1 February 1882. Next followed the line to Slitu on 17 July. Ordinary operations commenced on 24 November.Bjerke & Holom: 37 Rakkestad Station became the center of its namesake municipality and was one of several stations which received a grain silo ===Steam operations=== From the 1890s there were two morning trains which ran from Mysen to Oslo. The station was therefore equipped with a roundhouse for two locomotives. Langård & Ruud: 75 A military battery was established at Langnes Bridge in 1899.Langård & Ruud: 84 Askim Station became a hub for three branch lines. The Kykkelsrud Line was built in 1899to allow access to the pulp mill Glommens Træslliperi. It was extended to Kykkelsrud between 1914 and 1918 in conjunction with the construction of Kykkelsrud Power Station.Langård & Ruud: 109 The Vamma Line was completed in 1909 and later extended. It was used to construct Vamma Power Station. The first was the Solbergfoss Line, which opened in 1918 to allow the construction of Solbergfoss Power Station.Langård & Ruud: 110 The line proved popular and continued with passenger train operations until 4 January 1965.Langård & Ruud: 111 Hafslund built the Hafslund Line from the Eastern Line to their main plant. Built between 1897 and 1899, it remained in use until 1974. The same years there was also a branch line from Rakkestad Station to Rakkestad Tegelverk.Bjerke & Holom: 54 Heia Station was typical for new stations established in 1928, with a simple shed and platform near a level crossing Railcars were introduced on the Eastern Line in 1928. This was a move to make the train more competitive against buses and trucks, which had better surface coverage than the train. The railcars would initially stop at request, normally at level crossings. This was formalized in 1932, when 38 new stations were official established.Langård & Ruud: 117 A large number of these were closed in 1947. The Østfold Line was electrified in 1940, after which all trains on the Eastern Line stopped at Ski for transshipment. Throughout the 1950s there grew up more urban areas around some of the largest stations.Langård & Ruud: 151 The most prominent were Askim, Mysen and Rakkestad, which all received a prominent town center and grain silos.Langård & Ruud: 154 ===Electric operations=== The Eastern Line was finished electrified on 4 December 1958. The allowed for faster and direct services to the capital. The electrification cost 17 million kroner. Services were predominantly offered with NSB Class 68 multiple units.Langård & Ruud: 164 Later NSB Class 69 became prominent, but the Eastern Line was among the last lines to see them in regular use. When NSB Class 72 was introduced in 2002, the Eastern Line was among the first places it was introduced.Langård & Ruud: 203 Passenger services between Rakkestad and Sarpsborg were terminated on 15 June 2003. Knapstad Station was upgraded with a new platform in 2012 A triangular track was installed at Hafslund Station south of Sarpsborg, operative from 7 April 1995. Trains which wanted to run from the Eastern Line southwards towards Halden previously had to drive into Sarpsborg Station and then change direction. The new connection line made this unnecessary.Bjerke & Holom: 47 Four stations with very low patronage, Drømtorp, Langli, Langnes and Askim Næringspark, were closed in 2012. The Eastern Østfold Line was chosen as a trial line for implementing the European Rail Traffic Management System in Norway. Trials first ran in November 2013 on the section from Rakkestad to Sarpsborg, as this line did not have regular traffic. The entire line was upgraded for a total 1.2 billion kroner in the following years. In addition to a new signaling system and centralized traffic control, the platforms and stations at Kråkstad, Tomter, Spydeberg, Askim and Mysen were modernized. At the same time NSB started using their newest Class 75 multiple units. The upgrades were official opened on 31 August 2015. ==Operations== NSB Class 72 commuter train at Kråkstad Station Regular trains on the Eastern Østfold Line consist of an hourly service from Mysen to Ski and onward via the Østfold Line to Oslo Central Station and then onwards along the Drammen Line to Skøyen Station. In addition there are some rush-hour trains which operate all the way to Rakkestad. Travel time from Mysen to Oslo S is one hour and four minutes, and 41 minutes to Ski. There is no regular freight traffic on the line. However, if there are closures of the Western Østfold Line, the Eastern Line can be used as a bypass if the trains are equipped with ERTMS. ==Architecture== Tomter Station was one of the third-class stations designed by Balthazar Lange Peter Andreas Blix was hired to design the stations on the Østfold Line, but quit before those on the Eastern Line were designed. The job thus fell to his successor Balthazar Lange, who continued largely in the same style as Blix. The Eastern Line received standardized designs. Second-class stations were built at Spydeberg, Askim and Rakkestad, each which were . Third-class stations were built at Kråkstad, Tomter, Slitu, Mysen, Eidsberg, Gautestad and Ise. All the buildings were wooden with rich decorations, especially on the gables. Langård & Ruud: 39 ==Future== The Follo Line is under construction and is scheduled for completion in 2021. It will allow trains to run directly from Ski to Oslo in 11 minutes, down from 23 minutes today. The National Rail Administration has expressed desires to cut the travel time from Mysen to Oslo to 45 minutes. Removal of less used stations, better signaling and the Follo Line are the means by which they hope to achieve this. Critical for this is to reroute the access from the Eastern Line in to Ski Station. With the current layout, they come in from the east and as such cannot access the new line without crossing over all the tracks. To avoid this, a new connection needs to be built with the Eastern Line leaving Ski Station to the south, the one track flying over Western Line and then following a new route to a point around Kråkstad Station. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * Category:Østfold Line Category:Railway lines in Viken Category:Railway lines opened in 1882 Category:1882 establishments in Norway Category:Electric railways in Norway ","title":"Eastern Østfold Line"},{"id":"2582905","text":"First of May may refer to: * May 1, the day * International Workers' Day, aka Labor Day, chosen by an organization of socialist and communist political parties * First of May, a village and municipality in Entre Ríos Province of Argentina * A reference to May Day in the context of a fertility or Spring holiday * First of May Bookshop, an Edinburgh bookshop that sold LGBT books in the late 1970s - early 1980s * First of May (1958 film), a French comedy film * The First of May (1998 film), an American independent film * First of May (2015 film), Taiwanese film * \\"First of May\\" (Bee Gees song), a 1969 song by the Bee Gees * \\"First of May\\", a 2003 song by Jonathan Coulton * \\"First of May\\", poem by Langston Hughes * First of May, subtitle of Symphony No. 3 by Dmitri Shostakovich * First of May, A novice performer or worker in his first season.

In five years at the club, Mahon made a total of 144 appearances, scoring fourteen goals. He played in the 2000 Football League Cup Final as Tranmere lost 2–1 to Leicester City at Wembley on 27 February 2000. On 4 July 2000 he moved to Portugal, joining Portuguese Liga club Sporting Clube de Portugal on a free transfer. He played the first half in a 4–0 defeat in the Champions League to Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on 25 October, he was loaned to First Division club Blackburn Rovers on 15 December for the rest of the season, making his debut two days later as an 89th-minute substitute in a 2–0 victory over their Lancashire rivals Burnley at Turf Moor. He was a regular first-team squad member and made eighteen league appearances as Blackburn finished in second place and were promoted to the Premier League. ====Blackburn Rovers==== On 29 June 2001 he signed for Blackburn Rovers permanently for a transfer fee of £1.5M. He made his Premier League debut on 22 August in a 2–2 draw with Manchester United at Ewood Park. Three days later he scored Blackburn's first goal in a 2–1 home win over Tottenham Hotspur. He made a total of thirteen league appearances in the 2001–02 season as Blackburn finished in tenth place. He was an unused substitute when Blackburn won the 2002 League Cup, beating Tottenham 2–1 at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, on 24 February 2002. After just two league appearances, in the 2002–03 season, on 20 January 2003 Mahon was sent on loan to Second Division Cardiff City for the rest of the season as the Bluebirds won promotion to the First Division. On 8 September 2003 he was loaned out to Ipswich, where he made eleven league appearances and scored one goal against Bradford in a three-month loan spell. He returned to Blackburn on 22 December, and made three further league appearances. ====Wigan Athletic==== Mahon signed for Wigan Athletic on 6 February 2004, stating that he wanted regular first-team football. He made his debut the following day in a 3–1 victory over Ipswich Town at Portman Road. The following season he made 27 league appearances scoring seven goals as Wigan won promotion to the Premier League. After starting the 2005–06 season in the first team, he dropped out of favour halfway through the campaign and was allowed to leave, despite being seen as an ongoing squad player by Paul Jewell. On 23 March 2006 he joined Burnley on loan for the rest of the 2005–06 season, making his debut the following day against Norwich City. Jimmy Bullard, a Wigan Athletic player, said that all the players wore black armbands when Mahon left the club. ====Burnley==== After eight appearances on loan, he joined Burnley permanently on 8 June for £200,000 on a three-year contract. Burnley's then-manager Steve Cotterill described Mahon as \\"an absolute gem, [he is] the jewel in our crown\\" and it appeared that Cotterill planned to build Burnley's team around Mahon in the 2006–07 season; however, injuries and a loss of form during the 2006–07 season saw Mahon become a fringe first-team player. In the 2007–08 season, he returned to the first eleven and appeared to have regained the form that he showed when first arriving at Turf Moor. However, injuries plagued his season once again, and he started just 15 games, scoring one goal. The 2008–09 season started the same way, with his being a fringe squad player for the Clarets. On 14 March 2009, Cotterill's successor as Burnley manager, Owen Coyle, stated that fellow Championship club Blackpool had made an enquiry to take Mahon on loan for the rest of the season, saying, \\"I won't stand in his way because Alan needs to play. He is a terrific professional who I have so much time for and I am trying to do right by him.\\" Blackpool caretaker manager Tony Parkes confirmed Blackpool's interest in Mahon. Three days later he joined the Tangerines on loan until the end of the season. He made his debut on 21 March in a 1–1 draw with Southampton at Bloomfield Road. In June 2009 Mahon was released by Burnley at the end of his contract, alongside Gabor Kiraly and Steve Jones. ====Tranmere Rovers==== On 6 July 2009 he signed a three-year contract with former club Tranmere Rovers. He scored his first goal for Tranmere in a 3–2 defeat against Walsall on 12 September 2009. In July 2011 and following a series of injuries that kept him out of the first team for the whole of the 2010–11 season, Mahon's contract with Tranmere was terminated by mutual consent. ===International career=== Mahon played for the Republic of Ireland national under-19 football team in the 1996 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship finals in Luxembourg and made his senior international debut on 26 April 2000 as a 54th-minute substitute in a 1–0 friendly defeat to Greece at Lansdowne Road, Dublin.

He was a two-time All-Australian, two-time Richmond best and fairest winner and recipient of the league's Rising Star award in his debut year in 2005. Between 2013 and 2016, he served as Richmond's vice-captain. Deledio was drafted to Richmond with the number one overall pick in the 2004 AFL draft and made his debut in round 1 of the 2005 season. ==Early life and junior career== Deledio was born in Kyabram, Victoria, in 1987 to Judy and Wayne Deledio. His father played a single game for in 1975, then spent a season with Brunswick in the Victorian Football Association before heading back to the country. Deledio began playing competitive football at age 8. Playing well above his age bracket, Deledio starred alongside future teammate Troy Chaplin, who was one year his senior, in the local under-13 competition. At age 15, Deledio played his first game of senior football for the Kyabram Bombers in the Goulburn Valley Football League. He won best-afield honours for his performance in the match. In 2003 Deledio was a joint winner of the Kevin Sheehan Medal as the best player in the under-16 national championships. Deledio played for the Murray Bushrangers in the TAC Cup in 2003 and 2004, the leading junior competition in the country. In 2004, his final season, he kicked 21 goals from just 11 games and averaged 23.9 disposals as well. He was also named as a half-forward in the 2004 TAC Cup team of the year. He went on to represent the Victorian Country side at the under-18 national championships, winning All- Australian honours in the process. Deledio attended Kyabram High School prior to his AFL draft selection and subsequent move to Melbourne. He enrolled at Caulfield Grammar School to complete his year 12 studies in 2005, but pulled out after just two days. Instead, he would complete his studies at Richmond, in private tutoring sessions alongside fellow underage club recruits Richard Tambling and Luke McGuane. In addition to his footballing prowess, Deledio was also a promising young cricket player. A fast-bowler, he represented Victoria at the 2003–04 under-17 national championships. He was also highly capable with the bat, scoring an 85 in the competition's final and leading the Victorians to a national championship. Following this performance, the then coach of the Victorian Bushrangers David Hookes invited Deledio to join the state men's team. Deledio would however decline the offer, instead leaving cricket behind to focus on the prospect of a future career in the AFL. ==AFL career== ===Richmond=== ====Debut year (2005)==== Deledio was selected by the Richmond Football Club with the first overall pick in the 2004 National Draft. He made his debut at age 17 years and 343 days in Round 1 the following year, in a Richmond loss to . He recorded 9 disposals and 6 marks for the match. He kicked his first career goal in a Round 4 game at the MCG against . Deledio was nominated for the Rising Star award following his Round 8 match against Collingwood in which he recorded 13 disposals. He played all 22 games in his debut season and on 31 August 2005, he was rewarded with the AFL Rising Star award, receiving 43 of a possible 45 votes. Deledio followed this by also winning the Richmond Best First-Year player award and AFL Players' Association Best First-Year Player Award as voted by his peers. He also represented the club at the 2005 AFL Grand Final Sprint and won. Capping off his debut season, Deledio was chosen to represent Australia in the International Rules series for 2005, becoming the youngest Australian player in the competition's history. ====An emerging talent (2006–2007)==== Deledio played 21 out of 22 matches in 2006 and was again a consistent performer, only missing the one game with an injured knee. He was often the target of attention from opposition taggers due to his abilities, and found it difficult to break the tag. However he still produced impressive figures, averaging 18.8 possessions and 6.5 marks a game. In 2007 Deledio developed into a highly versatile player, who often provided difficult match-ups for the opposition. He played multiple roles across the season, including stints in the midfield and on both the forward and back flanks. In the forward line he used his speed and judgement well to lead into space and take strong marks, kicking 21 goals for the season and placing third on the club's goal-kicking tally. Out of defence, he often used his electric pace to provide run and carry and deliver pinpoint passes into the forward line. Deledio's best game of the 2007 season came in Tigers' Round 19 win against Collingwood, where he kicked a career-high five goals and earned three Brownlow Medal votes. Deledio averaged 18.4 possessions and 5.4 marks a game for the season and placed fifth in the club's best-and- fairest, earning the Kevin Bartlett Medal. ====Jack Dyer Medalist (2008–2009)==== Deledio in August 2009 Deledio began the 2008 season in the forward line for the Tigers, but pushed up the ground later in the season. He surpassed 30 possessions for the first time in Round 6 against Hawthorn before doing so again in Round 10 against Sydney and in round 11 against Adelaide. He won the AFL Army Award for his courage shown in round 7 against the Saints when he flew backwards into a pack to take a mark and heavily collided with a Saints player. He topped the club for inside 50s that year, and averaged a club second 24.6 disposals per game. Deledio was rewarded for his consistent season with his first Jack Dyer Medal as the club's best-and-fairest player, polling 250 votes to take out the award. He was also announced in the 40-man All-Australian squad for 2008 though did not make the final team. Deledio had another great year in 2009. His best game for the year came against Adelaide in Round 14, where he racked up 31 disposals and kicked one goal. He was the club leader for disposals and inside 50s that year, as well as placing second in tackles and third in clearances. He was rewarded with a second consecutive Jack Dyer Medal. Deledio finished with a total of 190 votes just ahead of Daniel Jackson (175) and skipper Chris Newman (162), thus becoming the youngest player to win the award back-to-back (at the age of 22 years and 5 months) since Kevin Bartlett in 1967–1968, and the youngest player in the AFL to win a best-and-fairest award back-to-back since Michael Voss at Brisbane in 1995–96. He signed a new 3-year contract in 2009, keeping him at Richmond until the end of the 2012 season. ====A star of the club (2010–2012)==== 2010 saw Deledio have another solid year as he became a solid defence playmaker for Richmond alongside his captain, Chris Newman, averaging 25.3 disposals. Richmond began the 2010 season horribly, losing 10 of their first 11 games, their only win being in round 10 against Port Adelaide. The Tigers soon turned their season around, however, going on to win five of their next seven games, with Deledio playing a vital role in these wins. Deledio was included in the 40 man All-Australian Squad for the second time in his career. He unluckily missed out on selection in the side to Collingwood's Harry O'Brien. Deledio had his most consistent year to date in 2011, playing all 22 games and averaging 26.3 disposals, becoming acknowledged as an elite half back. Deledio was once again picked in the 40-man All-Australian squad. Despite his fantastic year, Deledio unluckily missed out on an All-Australian side selection. On 21 December 2011, at the Club’s Annual General Meeting, Deledio became the youngest life member in Richmond’s history. Deledio qualified for the honour when he reached the 150-game milestone in Round 24, 2011 (at 24 years and 139 days old). With his contract set to expire at the end of the 2012 season, Deledio was among the very first to be able to explore free agency, with the midfielder being named by Richmond a restricted free agent prior to the 2012 season; however in March 2012, he signed a new five-year deal believed to be worth more than $3 million, keeping him contracted to the Tigers until the end of the 2017 season. The 2012 season saw Deledio become one of the AFL's most valuable players, averaging 28 possessions per game.AFL Match Statistics 2012 In the Dreamtime at the 'G clash against Essendon in Round 8, Deledio starred for the Tigers in the loss, racking up 35 possessions to win the Yiooken Award as the best player on the ground.Yiooken Award Winner 2012 Apart from early in 2009, Deledio had consistent played good football, despite some critics citing that he hasn't lived up to expectations. However, after the Round 8 \\"Dreamtime at the G\\" Clash between Essendon & Richmond, Current Tigers head coach & Former Essendon premiership player Damien Hardwick felt that Brett had finally become a true AFL elite player, quoting that: \\"His contested ball work has come on in leaps and bounds,\\" [and] \\"That was probably the one area of his game that I thought needed work but he's just been enormous in that area this year. He's become an elite player of the competition.\\" ====Leadership and a first final (2013)==== Deledio played all 23 games in 2013, averaging 23.8 possessions per game.AFL Match Statistics 2013. Afl.com.au. Retrieved on 21 June 2017. He finished fourth in the club's best and fairest, winning the 'Fred Swift Medal'. In Round 3 against the Western Bulldogs, Deledio kicked a goal within 8.9 seconds of the match starting, making it the fastest goal in AFL history, beating the former record of 9.1 seconds held by Gary Ablett, Jr. After 194 matches, Deledio finally played his first AFL final in Richmond's elimination final loss to Carlton at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. His 194-match wait until a maiden final is the longest of any current player in the AFL. ====Injuries and a move to half forward (2014–2016)==== Deledio in August 2009 Deledio had a slow start to the year due to an ongoing lower leg injury he was trying to nurse while playing, but as his fitness improved, so did he and so did Richmond as a whole. He played across the half-forward line in the latter half of the year and from round 15 and onwards he averaged 27 disposals per game, 1.4 goals per game, 6.2 marks per game, 5.5 inside 50s per game and least importantly he averaged 1.2 brownlow votes per game. His new position meant he had easier access to goals, kicked 11 goals in the last 5 Home & Away games of the year,Brett Deledio of the GWS Giants AFL Games Played Stats.

After struggling through the team's Round 1 clash victory over Carlton he faced four weeks recovery on the sidelines. He would return to the side for the team's Round 6 match against North Melbourne.http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-05-05/deledio-could-sub-in title=Deledio could sub in Deledio's second match back from injury against Collingwood earned him much praise as he helped Richmond get across the line to defeat Collingwood by 5 points, the first time they had defeated Collingwood since 2007. Deledio continued his varied role of midfield/forward, racking up 30 disposals, 13 marks and 2 goals/2 behinds, being arguably the best on ground. A talking point rose as Deledio now had 2 goals and 4 behinds for the season, fairly rare for Deledio who was known for his accurate kicking. The result of this was possibly due to a new kicking style he had been practicing in the off-season. Deledio continued the season in fantastic form, stamping himself in as 'Richmond's most important player' as stated by many commentators, some of them being Bruce McAvaney and ex-player commentators Matthew Richardson and Matthew Lloyd. At the time of the Adelaide crows loss where Deledio was absent through illness, mMany experts also noted that statistics proved that Richmond had a significant winning advantage when Deledio was in the side. Stats read that Richmond played 9 games without Deledio over the 14 and 15 seasons, only managing to win 2. On the other hand, the 32 matches with Deledio had resulted in 21 wins. Deledio's most notable performance was against in form top 4 side Hawthorn. Deledio booted 3 goals in the first quarter and then sealed the win with a goal at the start of the final quarter. It was the first time he had kicked more than 3 goals since the 2008 season, yet had many 3 goal games since then. During the H&A; season Deledio averaged 21.9 disposals, 6.2 marks, 1.5 goals, 0.9 behinds, 2.9 tackles, finishing off arguably his best season in his career despite an injury riddled start to the year.Brett Deledio of the GWS Giants AFL Games Played Stats.

Between Rd 7 and Rd 23, Deledio averaged 8.7 score involvements per game, ranked second in the league only to the 2015 Coleman Medal winner Joshua Kennedy. Deledio was selected in the 2015 All-Australian team and the 2015 AFLCA All- Australian team. Deledio was nursed through the 2016 pre-season, only making a half-game appearance against Port Adelaide in the NAB CUP. In this match he kicked a 9-point Super goal, meaning $500 worth of Sherrin footballs were donated to his junior club. Deledio suffered a quad injury that put him out until Round 6 vs. Port Adelaide.Brett Deledio set to return for Richmond clash with Port Adelaide. Herald Sun (27 April 2016) In his return match he showed similar form to previous seasons, racking up 22 disposals, laying 6 tackles and kicking a goal. Deledio continued to play good football, making the most of his versatility and playing numerous roles throughout the season. During the Rd 17 match vs. the Essendon Bombers his potential best on ground performance was cut short at half time due to a sharp pain in his calf muscle – a problem that had hindered his fitness for the third season straight. He sat out the remainder of the 2016 season as a precaution, deciding to rest and concentrate on remaining healthy for the 2017 season. Deledio finished 2016 as the club's then all-time career tackles record holder, with 688 recorded across his 243 games. He also ranked 11th for games played for the club at this time. ===Greater Western Sydney=== At the conclusion of the 2016 season, he was traded to Greater Western Sydney. He struggled to overcome a calf injury early in the season, failing to play a match at any level through the first 19 matches until finally making his debut for the Giants in round 20 where he kicked a goal. In 2019 Deledio began serving as a development coach with the Giants' AFL Women's team. ==Player profile== Deledio is a utility, a very versatile player who adept at any position from half-back through half- forward. As a junior, he played predominantly in the forward line, but due to his pace, fitness and elite disposal, he was shifted to the midfield in his latter days of junior football. Early on at Richmond he alternated between playing as a midfielder and as a half-forward, playing well in both positions. In 2008 and 2009 he won Jack Dyer Medals in a predominantly midfield role. Upon Damien Hardwick's arrival in the 2010 season, Deledio had a move to the half-back line to make use of his elite kicking and prolong his career. In 2012 though, Deledio was moved again into the midfield where he earned All- Australian selection for the first time. Since 2014 Deledio has been contained to a mostly half-forward role. He won All-Australian selection on half-forward after a 1.5 goal per game season in 2015. He is an elite ball user and was rated as Richmond's best kick by his peers and by numerous media pundits. ==Statistics== : Brett Deledio – Stats – Statistics. AFL Tables (18 April 1987).

A stylish young woman of the mid-17th century. She wears şalvar (trousers), a long, sheer gömlek (chemise), and an ankle-length purple entari (outer robe) with the ends tucked up. The fur lining of her yelek (jacket or vest) marks her as wealthy and high-ranking. While the Palace and its court dressed lavishly, the common people were only concerned with covering themselves. Starting in the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, administrators enacted sumptuary laws upon clothing. The clothing of Muslims, Christians, Jewish communities, clergy, tradesmen, and state and military officials were particularly strictly regulated during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent. In this period men wore outer items such as 'mintan' (a vest or short jacket), 'zıbın', 'şalvar' (trousers), 'kuşak' (a sash), 'potur', an entari or kaftan (a long robe), 'kalpak', 'sarık' on the head; 'çarık', çizme (boots), 'çedik', 'Yemeni' on the feet. The administrators and the wealthy wore caftans with fur lining and embroidery, whereas the middle class wore 'cübbe' (a mid-length robe) and 'hırka' (a short robe or tunic), and the poor wore collarless 'cepken' or 'yelek' (vest). Women's everyday wear was şalvar (trousers), a gömlek (chemise) that came down to the mid-calf or ankle, a short, fitted jacket called a zıbın, and a sash or belt tied at or just below the waist. For formal occasions, such as visiting friends, the woman added an entari or kaftan, a long robe that was cut like the zıbın apart from the length. Both zıbın and kaftan were buttoned to the waist, leaving the skirts open in front. Both garments also had buttons all the way to the throat but were often buttoned only to the underside of the bust, leaving the garments to gape open over the bust. All of these clothes could be brightly colored and patterned. However, when a woman left the house, she covered her clothes with a ferace, a dark, modestly cut robe that buttoned all the way to the throat. She also covered her hair and face with a pair of veils. Headgear was the most potent indicator of male social status. While commoners wore \\"külah's\\" covered with 'abani' or 'Yemeni', higher-ranking men wore a wide variety of turbans. 'Political crises of the 17th century were reflected as chaos in clothes. The excessively luxurious compulsion of consumption and showing off in the Tulip Era lasted till the 19th century. The modernization attempts of Mahmud II in the 1830s first had its effects in the state sector. While the 'sarık' was replaced by the 'fez', the people employed in the Sublime Porte began to wear trousers, 'setre' and 'potin'. === Tanzimat period === During the 'Tanzimat' and 'Meşrutiyet' period in the 19th century, the common people still keeping to their traditional clothing styles presented a great contrast with the administrators and the wealthy wearing 'redingot', jacket, waistcoat, boyunbağı (tie), 'mintan', sharp-pointed and high-heeled shoes. Women's clothes of the Ottoman period were observed in the 'mansions' and Palace courts. 'Entari', 'kuşak', 'şalvar', 'başörtü', 'ferace' of the 19th century continued their existence without much change. In the 16th century, women wore two-layer long 'entari' and 'tül', velvet shawl on their heads. Their outdoor clothing consisted of 'ferace' and 'yeldirme'. The simplification in the 17th century was apparent in an inner 'entari' worn under a short-sleeved, caftan- shaped outfit and the matching accessory was a belt. Women's wear becoming more showy and extravagant brought about adorned hair buns and tailoring. Tailoring in its real sense began in this period. The sense of women's wear primarily began in large residential centers such as Istanbul and İzmir in the 19th century and women gradually began to participate in social life, along with the westernization movement. Pera became the center of fashion and the Paris fashion was followed by the tailors of Greek and Armenian origin. In the period of Abdul Hamid II, the use of 'ferace' (a concealing outer robe shaped like a modestly cut version of the indoor dress) was replaced by 'çarşaf' of different styles. However, the rural sector continued its traditional style of clothing. ==Ottoman influence on Western female dress== Interactions between Ottomans and Britons occurred throughout history, but in the 18th century, European visitors and residents in the Ottoman Empire markedly increased, and exploded in the 19th century.Charlotte Jirousek. Ottoman Costumes: From Textile to Identity. S Faroqhi and C. Neumann, ed. Istanbul: Eren Publishing, 2005. http://char.txa.cornell.edu/influences.htm As such, fashion is one method to gauge the increased interactions. Historically, Europeans clothing was more delineated between male and female dress. Hose and trousers were reserved for men, and skirts were for women.Inal, Onur. \\"Women's Fashions in Transition: Ottoman Borderlands and the Anglo-Ottoman Exchange of Costumes.\\" Journal of World History 22.2 (2011): 243–72. Web. p. 234 Conversely, in the Ottoman Empire, the male and female dress was more similar. A common item worn by both was the şalvar, a voluminous undergarment in white fabric shaped like what is today called \\"harem pants\\".Inal, p. 252 To British women traveling in the Ottoman Empire, the şalvar quickly became a symbol of freedom because they observed that Ottoman women had more rights than British women did. Lady Mary Wortley Montague (1689–1762), whose husband was the British Ambassador to Constantinople, noted in her travels in her \\"Embassy Letters\\" that Ottoman women \\"possessed legal property rights and protections that far surpassed the rights of Western women\\".Jirousek, p. 8 These female travelers often gained an intimate view of Ottoman culture, since as women, they had easier access to the Muslim Elite harems than did men.Inal, p. 264 Şalvar successfully spread into Europe at the end of the 19th century as various female suffragists and feminists used şalvar as a symbol of emancipation. Other British women of distinction, such as Lady (Janey) Archibald Campbell (1845–1923), and Lady Ottoline (Violet Anne) Morrell (1873–1938) wore şalvar \\"in an attempt to symbolize their refusal of traditional British standards and sexual differences\\".Inal, p. 258 Şalvar also spread beyond Europe when Amelia Jenks Bloomer modified these \\"Turkish trousers\\" to create American \\"bloomers\\".Jirousek, p. 9 Another area where the Ottomans influenced female Western dress was in layering. Initially, layering had a practical use for the ancestors of the Ottoman Empire, who were pastoral nomads and horse riders, and needed to wear layers to adapt to changing temperatures.Jirousek, p. 2 But as the Ottoman Empire came into being, the layering of garments would distinguish one's gender, class, or rank within particular communities, while also displaying many sumptuous fabrics, thus signaling one's wealth and status. Layering also had spiritual significance. For instance, in Islamic art, layering different patterns represents a spiritual metaphor of the divine order that seems to be incomprehensible, but is actually planned and meaningful.Jirousek, p.2 In Europe, in the 16th century, skirts began to have a layered appearance. Previous to the 16th century, skirts were slit only at the bottom, but now, the slit bisected the front of the skirt to reveal a contrasting layer underneath. Often, the underlayer would coordinate with a layered sleeve.Jirousek, p. 12 Hanging sleeves were also a European concept that was derived from the Ottomans, although they arrived in Europe much earlier than layered skirts. In the 12th century, religious and scholarly peoples would wear coats that had hanging sleeves, similar to Turkish-style outer kaftans. These hanging sleeves meant one could see the second layer of fabric underneath the outer layer.Jirousek, p. 12 Although hanging sleeves had been present in Europe since the 12th century, they did not escape Lady Mary Montague's fascination in the 18th century. In a letter dated March 10, 1717, she wrote to the Countess of Marabout Hafiz (Hafsa) Sultan, a woman who was a favorite of the deposed Sultan Mustafa: \\"But her dress was something so surprisingly rich, that I cannot forbear describing it to you. She wore a vest called donalmá, which differs from a caftan by long sleeves and folding over the bottom. It was of purple cloth, straight to her shape, and thick-set on each side, down to her feet, and round the sleeves, with pearls of the best water, of the same size as their buttons commonly are.\\"Inal, p.253 ==Republican period== The common clothing styles prevailing in the mid 19th century imposed by religious reasons entered a transformation phase in the Republican period. In this period the 'şapka' and the following 'kılık kıyafet' reform being realized with the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in Kastamonu in 1925 had a full impact in Constantinople. Women's 'çarşaf' and 'peçe' were replaced by a coat, scarf, and shawl. Men began to wear hats, jackets, shirts, waistcoats, ties, trousers and shoes. With the industrialization process of the 1960s, women entered the work-life and tailors were substituted by readymade clothes industry. The contemporary fashion concept, as it is in the whole world, is apparent in both social and economic dimensions in Turkey as well. ==Modern use== Modern Turkish designers such as Rıfat Özbek, Cemil İpekçi, Vural Gökçaylı, Yıldırım Mayruk, Sadık Kızılağaç, Hakan Elyaban, and Bahar Korçan draw inspiration from historical Ottoman designs, and Ottoman or Ottoman-inspired patterns are important to the Turkish textile industry. ==Gallery== Religious garb Image:Constantinople(1878)-rabbi.pngA Rabbi (1878) Image:Constantinople(1878)-Armenian patriarch.pngArmenian Orthodox Patriarch (1878) Image:Constantinople(1878)-Greek priest.pngGreek Orthodox Priest (1878) Image:Constantinople(1878)-ulema.pngTurkish Muslim alim (1878) Classical period Image:Constantinople(1878)-Turkish peasant.pngTurkish Peasant (1878) Image:Constantinople(1878)-zeybek.pngTurkish Zeybek (1878) Decline Image:Constantinople(1878)-New Picture (51).pngTurkish Man (1878) Image:Constantinople(1878)-Turkish mrs. in house.pngTurkish Woman at home (1878) Image:Constantinople(1878)-vield turk girl.pngVeiled Turkish Woman (1878) Image:Constantinople(1878)-bag carrier.pngPorter (1878) Image:Constantinople(1878)-begging dervis.pngMendicant Dervish (1878) Image:Constantinople(1878)-dervis.pngDervish (1878) Image:Constantinople(1878)-boy.pngTurkish Boy (1878) Image:Constantinople(1878)-boy2.pngTurkish Boy (1878) Image:Constantinople(1878)-girl.pngTurkish Girl (1878) Image:Constantinople(1878)-girl12.pngGypsy Girl (1878) Image:Constantinople(1878)-sitting on edge.pngMen aboard a ferry (1878) Image:Constantinople(1878)-types to edge2.pngMen aboard a ferry (1878) Image:Constantinople(1878)-woman.pngOdalisque (1878) Image:Constantinople(1878)-woman2.pngWoman outdoors (1878) ===Folk costumes in 1873=== * Vilayet of Constantinople File:Les costumes populaires de la Turquie en 1873 - Partie 1 - Planche 001.jpg1.

He bowled medium pace and could swing the ball both ways, whilst when wickets were affected by rain he was able to get on a good deal of off-break. He suffered during his career from Glamorgan's lack of agile, athletic fieldsmen, which meant he was often plagued by dropped catches - otherwise his figures would have been much better. On occasions, he was a dangerous tail-end batsman, who once hit Wilfred Rhodes for 36 runs from 3 overs and hit Dick Howorth for 31 runs off an eight-ball over in his last season with Glamorgan. John Arlott said of him, \\"he bowled more overs, conceded more runs, took more wickets, scored the fastest 50, made more ducks and was not out more often than anyone else in the county's history\\". == Career == === Beginnings === Mercer was born in Southwick, West Sussex, and began his cricket with Sussex after World War I in 1919. He found he had very little opportunity because Sussex had so many medium-pace bowlers of similar type on their professional staff, notably Maurice Tate and the Relf brothers. Mercer got a bit of bowling in 1920 but his lack of opportunities in 1921 led him to qualify for the newly promoted first-class county Glamorgan. === 100 Wickets === He started slowly, but by 1925 - when Glamorgan's utterly abysmal batting caused them to suffer a record number of defeats in the Championship - he was a well-established bowler and took over 100 wickets for the first time. === Awards === The following year, with Glamorgan's batting much improved, the county rose to eighth and Mercer's superb bowling - highlighted by eight for 39 against Gloucestershire and the dismissal of Somerset for 59 and 77 on a sticky wicket at Cardiff Arms Park - put him in second place in the averages and won him a Cricketer of the Year nomination from Wisden in a year when an Ashes tour intensified competition for the honour. === Touring === Mercer then went on tours of India and Ceylon without doing anything spectacular, and in 1927 when pitches were almost always soft and wet (often so much so as to be really easy for batting) he did not do as well as expected until late in the season. However, in 1929 with fourteen for 119 against the touring South Africans, Mercer perhaps justified those who wondered why he was always overlooked for representative cricket. === 1929-1937 === In this season, he claimed a personal best 145 wickets, but strains in his thigh caused a gradual decline during the early 1930s and Mercer did not even take 50 wickets in 1934. However, 1935 and 1936 saw him back at his very best, with the latter season seeing him take all ten wickets in an innings at New Road, Worcester and twelve wickets for 123 against Leicestershire. He finished the season with 116 wickets when no other Glamorgan bowler exceeded 46, but in 1937 he lost so much form that he was in and out of the team. Ordinarily, Glamorgan would have ended Mercer's contract, but the erratic availability of their best bowlers meant he stayed with them for another two years, during which he produced his famous hitting spree against Worcestershire at Cardiff when Glamorgan were faced with certain defeat (the weather saved them). === 1939 onwards === During 1939, Glamorgan announced Mercer would not be retained for 1940, but war brought an end to county cricket until 1946. Mercer then took up an appointment as coach of Northamptonshire, and even played one match for them at the extraordinary age of fifty-four. Mercer's vitality was shown by the fact that he lived to the age of ninety-four, dying in Westminster in 1987. ==External links== * First- class bowling figures Category:1893 births Category:1987 deaths Category:People from Southwick, West Sussex Category:People from Sussex Category:English cricketers Category:Sussex cricketers Category:Glamorgan cricketers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:Northamptonshire cricketers Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:English cricket coaches Category:English cricket umpires Category:Wales cricketers Category:Players cricketers Category:North v South cricketers Category:Cricketers who have taken ten wickets in an innings Category:English cricketers of 1919 to 1945 Category:H.

For every question the contestant got correct, they received $20 in cash. Five questions usually were asked per person, for a possible $100.

On some occasions, this money was refused. Once per episode, there was a speed round, where contestants could get $20 for every question they answered correctly within one minute. At the end, contestants got a chance at a $100 bonus question, with that amount in cash given to them if they got it right. Once per episode, Burns would give the unsuspecting contestant a chance at up to $500 more (this was called the Lightning Round), if s/he would take on the role of quizmaster.

The station has an island platform and is served by Northern Trains‘ / - via branch services, on which it is the last stop before the terminus. ==History== Meols Cop railway station opened on 1 November 1887, originally as part of the Liverpool, Southport and Preston Junction Railway from to . It is the only part of that line still in use, having replaced a section of the Manchester and Southport Railway. The LP&SJR; struggled financially from opening and was absorbed by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway in July 1897. Within four years, the new owners of the line had diverted services to their established terminus at Chapel Street along with those of the West Lancashire Railway from , with Central being relegated to use as a goods depot. The line through Meols Cop was electrified in February 1909 by the L&YR; to exploit the area's potential for commuter traffic, with the popular electric service between Southport & being diverted there over the north to east side of the triangular junction with WLR, which was sited immediately to the west. Services then reversed at the station before continuing to either Southport or & Crossens. The L&Y; subsequently opened a carriage maintenance depot within the triangle nearby to maintain their new Electric Multiple Unit fleet in 1912. In February 1911 a connection from the LS&PJR; route to join the Wigan line at Pool Hey Junction was opened, which allowed trains from Wigan (and ) to Southport to serve the station \\\\- this would later allow the closure of the original M&SR; route via Blowick and the removal of the busy level crossing there. For much of the station's life though, its train service was provided mainly by the Crossens to Southport EMUs (a few of which continued through to/from ) and the Southport to Altcar trains, which from 1906 were provided by steam railmotors. By 1926, the Altcar Bob service had been cut back to Barton and it was subsequently withdrawn completely by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in September 1938. Goods traffic continued over the line until complete closure in January 1952. The third rail was only used for access to the carriage works after the September 1964 closure of the Southport-Crossens service, which became a victim of the Beeching Axe (along with the WLR main line) despite being used by over 2 million passenger per year. This left the station with a much reduced service to Southport & Wigan, which initially was only provided at morning & evening peak periods. From 14 June 1965, all trains on the Wigan route were routed through the station with the closure of the Blowick line, but it was not until the spring 1967 timetable change that off-peak calls were reinstated. The Wigan to Southport line had not been recommended for closure by Beeching in his 1963 report, but British Rail subsequently submitted a closure proposal for the route and Meols Cop station in May 1967. This was eventually rejected by the Minister for Transport exactly a year later, securing the station's future. Goods traffic however ceased to be handled in November 1967, with the closure of the goods yard. The Meols Cop Electric depot closed on 14 February 1970,\\"Meols Cop Triangle & Electric Car Sheds\\" Disused Stations Site Record; Retrieved 27 March 2016 and the third rail was lifted shortly afterwards. The station remained well served though, with over 20 trains calling in each direction in the May 1975 timetable and this frequency remained more or less unchanged for the next two decades. Sunday services however ceased in the mid 1980s and the station became unstaffed in 1990, subsequently losing its wooden buildings to demolition in March 2000 (replacement 'bus stop' style shelters being erected the following month). However, Sunday services have resumed. In early January 2016, CCTV Cameras were installed at the station.Meols Cop Gets CCTV Cameras ==Facilities== This station is unmanned and only accessible via stairs.

It recounted events in an international oil company – the \\"Mogul\\" of the title. The first series was mostly concerned with the internal politics within the Mogul organisation, with episodes revolving around industrial espionage, internal fraud and negligence almost leading to an accident on a North Sea oil rig. The series' upbeat theme music was by Tom Springfield, brother of Dusty. ==Cast== *Brian Stead (Geoffrey Keen 1965–72), Mogul's tough Deputy Managing Director. *Peter Thornton (Ray Barrett 1965–72), company field agent (i.e. \\"troubleshooter\\"). *Alec Stewart (Robert Hardy 1966–70), ruthlessly ambitious \\"troubleshooter\\" keen to rise up the promotional ladder. *Willy Izard (Philip Latham 1965–72), head of finance at Mogul. *Robert Driscoll (Barry Foster 1965), Mogul's head of public relations. *Derek Prentice (Ronald Hines 1965), head of personnel at Mogul. *Jane Webb (Philippa Gail 1965–66, 1970–71), Stead's efficient secretary. *Eileen O'Rourke (Isobel Black 1967–68), ambitious public relations assistant at Mogul. *\\"Steve\\" Thornton (Justine Lord 1965–66, 1968), glamorous woman unhappily married to troubleshooter Peter Thornton. *Roz Stewart (Deborah Stanford 1966–70), Alec Stewart's wife, keen to strike out in business on her own, opening a London boutique. *James Langley (John Carson 1971–72) *Dr. Ginny Vickers (Jayne Sofiano 1967–69) *Charles Grandmercy (Edward de Souza 1967–68) *Joan Izard (Margaret Ward 1965, 1967, 1969, 1971) *Julie Serres (Virginia Wetherell 1967) *Miss Jenkins (Beryl Cooke 1970–71) ==The Troubleshooters== Although Mogul was popular, it did not do as well as hoped for. However, it was renewed for a second series with the format radically changed. The show was renamed The Troubleshooters and it altered its focus, broadening its horizons by showing the actual workings of the company. The series now focused on the younger, dynamic Mogul field agents - the eponymous \\"troubleshooters\\" - like Peter Thornton, who flew around the world to \\"hotspots\\" to protect the company's interests. ==Storylines== The show's storylines concentrated on disasters such as explosions and earthquakes, company take-overs, racial and political tensions, the discovery of new oil fields and the negotiation of drilling rights. There was extensive use of stock footage of locations. As time went on, The Troubleshooters began to experiment with ongoing narratives as storylines arched over several series. Because of the nature of his profession requiring him to be away from home, Peter Thornton found his marriage to the glamorous Steve collapsing. Brian Stead was diagnosed with a heart condition, and he struggled to maintain control of Mogul at the top. Ranged against him was new \\"troubleshooter\\" Alec Stewart, a young, ruthless operative keen to progress in the organisation with his eye on Stead's position. Stead kept sending Stewart out on dangerous assignments in the hope that he would fail, but Stewart was able to work every situation to his advantage. In the latter series, a rival oil company to Mogul was introduced – Zenith. The Troubleshooters never shied away from portraying Mogul as a faceless, uncaring and profit-driven corporation. Some episodes showcased industrial crisis through the perspective of striking Teesside dockyard workers and foregrounded ecological concerns through storylines about local opposition to a Mogul refinery in Wales and a chemical offshoot of Mogul's, which developed a crop spray with deadly side effects. There was also no loyalty or sentimentality amongst the Mogul men – Peter Thornton, sent to the Arctic by Brian Stead to investigate possible oil concessions, nearly freezes to death and considers getting out of the oil business entirely. In another episode, Thornton is sent to Saigon, against the backdrop of the Vietnam war. Alec Stewart is arrested in Algiers as a spy and imprisoned – although eventually released, he receives little trust or support from his colleagues. Brian Stead, returning to Berlin for the first time since 1945 to oversee a natural gas drilling deal, finds his past coming back to haunt him in a nasty plot to discredit him by a rival company. ==The Troubleshooters and the real-life oil industry== The Mogul organisation was reputed to have been based on BP and there were many similarities and coincidences in terms of the international events The Troubleshooters predicted. # BP struck oil in Alaska and three days later, Mogul did the same on television. However, this particular episode had been produced four months earlier. # In another episode, Mogul took over a chemical company – and BP did the same a few days later. # The Troubleshooters predicted that there would be a channel tunnel and also that men would live in underwater houses to probe the seabed for oil. Both predicitions came true. # An episode was made that showed an explosion in the North Sea, just before a real-life explosion occurred, and the RAF was forced to set fire to the sea as warning to shipping. # The series also predicted to within 0.1 of a penny, the price that oil companies would charge the Gas Council for North Sea gas. # Lead actor Geoffrey Keen, who played Brian Stead, even found himself invited to the Oil Industries Club dinner, where he was warmly greeted by his \\"fellow\\" executives. ==Conclusion== The Troubleshooters lasted for seven series from 1965 to 1972, making the transition from black-and-white to colour along the way. In the final episodes, Brian Stead maintains control of Mogul and fends off hostile enemies, but at the cost of his own health. Stead eventually steps down as company director, but not before finally naming his successor. Today the legacy of The Troubleshooters lies in its bridging the gap between \\"quality drama\\" and populist entertainment and charting a linear path trod by later British television serials, such as The Brothers and Howards' Way. The series struck a chord with the 1960s audience thanks to its format - a potent combination of the oil business, globe trotting power politics, corporate wheeler-dealing and sex. It had parallels with the contemporaneous ATV board- room drama The Plane Makers (later renamed The Power Game). ==Archive status== The series was subject to the BBC's wiping policy of the era, but some episodes still remain in the BBC archive, including the series opener \\"Kelly's Eye\\". Only one colour episode survives as broadcast (\\"Camelot on a Clear Day\\", a copy of which can be viewed at the National Media Museum in Bradford, UK); all other existing colour episodes only survive in the form of black-and-white film recordings.

For this reason we shun poetry and poetic licence in all its forms. # While acknowledging the value of genre fiction, whether classical or modern, we will always move towards new openings, rupturing existing genre expectations. # We believe in textual simplicity and vow to avoid all devices of voice: rhetoric, authorial asides. # In the name of clarity, we recognise the importance of temporal linearity and eschew flashbacks, dual temporal narratives and foreshadowing. # We believe in grammatical purity and avoid any elaborate punctuation. # We recognise that published works are also historical documents. As fragments of our time, all our texts are dated and set in the present day. All products, places, artists and objects named are real. # As faithful representation of the present, our texts will avoid all improbable or unknowable speculations on the past or the future. # We are moralists, so all texts feature a recognisable ethical reality. # Nevertheless, our aim is integrity of expression, above and beyond any commitment to form.

The guidebook illustrates points of interest along the way and includes an accommodation guide for the whole route. ==History== The Essex Way was conceived as a result of a competition organised by the CPRE in 1972. ==Adjoining paths== The Essex Way crosses several other long-distance footpaths including St Peter's Way (a walk from Chipping Ongar to Bradwell-on-Sea), the Three Forests Way (a circular walk linking Epping, Hatfield and Hainhault forests), the Saffron Trail (a 71-mile/114 km walk from Southend-on-Sea to Saffron Walden) and the Essex Clayway (a route linking the Essex Way at Coggeshall to St Peter's Way at Mundon). ==Transport== The Essex Way is well served by public transport, especially by train services. == Maps == Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 \\"Explorer Maps\\": Epping Forest & Lee Valley No. 174, Chelmsford and The Rodings No.183, Braintree and Saffron Waldon No.195, Sudbury, Hadleigh. ==References== ==External links== *Full route description from Harwich to Epping with photos and maps *Essex Way route maps, trail narrative, accommodation guide and details of the annual Essex Way relay *Colne Valley Pages *Ramblers Association *Photos of the Essex Way on geograph.org.uk Category:Long-distance footpaths in England Category:Footpaths in Essex Category:County-themed walking routes in the United Kingdom ","title":"Essex Way"},{"id":"2583037","text":"Shooting Stars is a television drama series spun off from the Singapore Idol singing competition in 2005, starring some of the top idols that year. The cast includes Taufik Batisah, Sylvester Sim, Olinda Cho, Daphne Khoo, Jeassea K. Thyidor, Alfarahizah Awangnit, David Wu, Brendon Lim, and Maylene Loo. The show premiered on August 9, 2005 and ended on October 11, 2005. ==Character bio== Taufik Batisah plays a pizza delivery boy who struggles to balance the realities of his life with his dreams of singing. With an overly pragmatic girlfriend who expects an idealistic future together without understanding his love for music, he envies and views well-heeled best friend Aaron as having a great life without realising how controlled Aaron’s life is. Talented and with a keen sense of music, Taufik will discover his own capacity for freedom from the music classes. Sylvester Sim is a coffee shop owner's son and assistant who is brooding and quiet. Sylvester pines for long-time love interest Dawn but lacks the courage to express his feelings. While concerned about his widowed father, Sylvester is adamant about pursuing his dreams of music, despite his dad’s indignant efforts to get him to take over his drinks stall. His willingness to brave any storm for party-animal Dawn ends in disastrous effects. Olinda Cho is a tomboy who stumbles along each day as it passes, with no real aim in life. With nothing to worry about and a well-provided life, Olinda hides an insecure self beneath a nonchalant attitude. Olinda especially flounders when human relationship matters crop up. Daphne Khoo is a mechanical engineering student who is forced by her karaoke champion mum to join the singing class. Living up to expectations is not easy, especially such high ones which Daphne’s karaoke champion mother sets for her. Forced to join a singing class, Daphne drags a good friend along, who, leaning on his good looks to steal her thunder, threatens their future class attendance as they face up to the possibilities of being kicked out. Jeassea K. Thyidor is an Indonesian housewife who fills the gaps in her leisurely life with her singing course while her rich Indonesian husband is away. All is fun in her class as she learns from her idol George until she finds out a twisted secret about her husband. Alfarahizah Awangnit plays Su, who is Taufik's girlfriend. Materialistic and yearning for the better life, Su ignores Taufik’s dreams of singing, only urging him to upgrade himself. Her ultimate goal is to attain the ultimate high life of a big house, big car, and the works. David Wu plays the gang's music teacher, George. Eccentric and at a crossroads, he is searching for a protégé to groom so that he may take a backseat. Also the central figure upon which the other young characters’ lives revolves around, George anchors his students in their various attempts to pursue their dreams. Brendon Lim plays Aaron, the well-heeled best friend of Taufik, who shares Taufik’s love for boxing. While Taufik perceives suave Aaron as being the rich and lucky half of the two, Aaron in truth leads a controlled life that leaves little freedom for his own dreams. Maylene Loo plays Sylvester's girlfriend Dawn. Dawn runs from her problems by indulging in dangerous drugs-and-alcohol cocktails. Unknowingly attracting Sylvester into her dark life to protect herself from her own party-animal lifestyle, she allows Sylvester in her heart and gets intimate with him.

Sly, Taufik, Jeassea, Olinda, and Daphne meet by chance to study under George's tutelage, and they each come with his or her own set of aspirations, struggles, and obstacles. Striving beyond their adversities and learning to accept differences along the way, these youths learn the rudiments of singing. As this art becomes a common language through George's eccentric but patient guidance, the five troubled youths find their own directions and celebrate their common passion for music. ==Episode guide== ===Episode 1=== At a crossroad in his life, George, a renowned songwriter/performer, begins nurturing hopes of grooming a successor.

Touched, George decides to take Taufik in. Taufik's girlfriend Su and his best friend Aaron don't get along. Su wants Taufik to be realistic about his goals; she thinks a frivolous singing class is a waste of money. However, Aaron believes Taufik should chase his dream.

Fortunately, both are able to control their emotions. With his support, she gets a chance to perform at a posh jazz club, singing to a live audience. ===Episode 10 (Finale)=== George decides to bring the singing course to a close. Instead of holding a usual lesson, he takes his students to a long, suspended bridge and tells them to cross it blindfolded. His last lesson has to do with overcoming fear. Taufik imagines his mother's encouraging voice to shake off his fear of losing his own voice. Sly drowns out the doubt in his head by singing the song he has composed for Dawn. Daphne panics but imagines Ethan at the end of the bridge and moves on eagerly. Jeassea lets go of her self-consciousness and struts across the bridge. Olinda gives George a cheeky grin and runs across. Watching them cheering each other from afar, a proud George decides it is time he left them to grow on their own. Two years pass.

Band of the Kazakh Republican Guard at the Spasskaya Tower Military Music Festival and Tattoo in 2014. A military tattoo is a performance of music or display of armed forces in general. The term comes from the early 17th-century Dutch phrase doe den tap toe (\\"turn off the tap\\"), a signal sounded by drummers or trumpeters to instruct innkeepers near military garrisons to stop serving beer and for soldiers to return to their barracks, and is unrelated to the Tahitian origins of an ink tattoo.Little Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins Julia Cresswell - 2014- Page 106 0199683638 tattoo. Tattoos on the skin came into English in the 18th century from the Polynesian languages of the Pacific Islands—Captain Cook's journals are the first to record the word. The military tattoo sounded by drum or bugle to recall soldiers to their quarters in the evening was originally written tap-too. It comes from Dutch doe den tap toe, literally 'close the tap'. The tap was on a cask, closing it signalled time for drinking was over and soldiers should go home The tattoo was originally a form of military music, but the practice has evolved into more elaborate shows involving theatrics and musical performances. It is also used to designate military exhibitions such as the Royal International Air Tattoo. ==Etymology== Quebec City Military tattoo, Quebec, Canada The term dates from around 1600 during the Thirty Years' War in the Low Countries (Belgium and the Netherlands). The Dutch fortresses were garrisoned with mercenary troops that were under federal command since 1594. The Dutch States Army had become a federal army, consisting mostly of Scottish, English, German and Swiss mercenaries, but commanded by a Dutch officer corps. Drummers from the garrison were sent out into the towns at 21:30 hrs (9:30 pm) each evening to inform the soldiers that it was time to return to barracks. The process was known as ' (Dutch for \\"turn off the tap\\"), an instruction to innkeepers to stop serving beer and send the soldiers home for the night. The drummers continued to play until the curfew at 22:00 hrs (10:00 pm). Tattoo, earlier tap-too and taptoo, are alterations of the Dutch words ' which have the same meaning. Taptoo was the earlier used alteration of the phrase and was used in George Washington's papers in which he said:\\"In future the Reveille will beat at day-break; the troop at 8 in the morning; the retreat at sunset and taptoo at nine o'clock in the evening.\\" Over the years, the process became more of a show and often included the playing of the first post at 21:30 hrs and the last post at 22:00. Bands and displays were included and shows were often conducted by floodlight or searchlight. Tattoos were commonplace in the late 19th century with most military and garrison towns putting on some kind of show or entertainment during the summer months. Between the First World War and the Second World War elaborate tattoos were held in many towns, with the largest in Aldershot in the United Kingdom. ==Notable examples== ===Europe=== Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo, 2010 * One of the best-known tattoos is held on the Esplanade in front of Edinburgh Castle each August as part of the annual Edinburgh Festival.

The series was filmed on location in England and France. Wish Me Luck is similar to Tenko and the 1970s BBC drama Secret Army, in that it deals with strong female characters coping under extreme conditions in wartime. The organisation for which the series' women agents worked, the Outfit, was based on the real-life Special Operations Executive. Season 1 and 2 were based on the exploits of SOE agent Nancy Wake and much of the dialogue was copied from her autobiography The White Mouse. The series also addressed social issues and divisions under wartime conditions. A great deal of attention was also paid to creating the social context of the operatives, the drama of their work, against the backdrop of an intensely detailed local \\"colour\\" in both wartime Britain and France.

Running the 'Outfit' back in London were Jane Asher and Julian Glover. There were 23 episodes in all . Other key characters were played by Terrence Hardiman, Jeremy Northam, Stuart McGugan, Felicity Montagu, Mark Anstee, Trevor Peacock and Nigel Le Vaillant. The first series was directed by Gordon Flemyng, the second and third series by Bill Hays. ==Plot== ===Series 1 === Episode 1 opens with Liz Grainger, codename Celeste (Buffery) apparently undergoing violent German interrogation. It transpires that this is part of her training for 'The Outfit', a secret organisation run by Colonel James 'Cad' Cadogan (Glover) and Faith Ashley (Asher), who are now recruiting civilians to boost their numbers. The rest of the episode combines scenes of Liz's training to go to France as an undercover agent - and that of fellow recruit Mathilde (Matty) Firman, codename Aimee (Hamilton) - with flashbacks showing how they came to be recruited. Matty is a factory worker from Stepney, who escaped to London from France with her French mother early in the war and is steered to The Outfit by an officer who witnesses her at a dance slapping a man for calling the French collaborators. She is desperate to contribute more effectively to the war effort because of her French and Jewish heritage. Liz, whose husband is serving overseas and whose brother Jack has recently been killed in the war, has moved to Devon with her daughter Vicky to escape the Blitz. She is recruited almost by accident, following her response to a radio appeal for French holiday snaps to help the war effort (in circumstances resembling those of the recruitment of real life agent Odette Hallowes). Liz initially refuses to undertake work which would entail leaving her daughter but is persuaded by Cad to undergo training, in which she does well, and becomes determined to volunteer. Cad overrides the reservations of some of his colleagues about sending civilian women (particularly a mother) to France and recommends her as a courier. Also to be sent is former actor, Colin Beale, codename Cyrano (Northam) whom Liz and Matty have befriended during training. In contrast Matty, despite excelling in her training as a wireless operator, is rejected for undercover work: her talkative nature makes her a security risk. In Episode 2, Matty has returned to Stepney and the factory, but Cad is regretting rejecting her since their recruitment pool is dwindling. He relents and calls Matty back, initially for wireless receiving (\\"godfather\\") work in England, where she makes friends with fellow-trainee Lois Mountjoy (Abigail McKern). Liz is now at the final stage of training, and Matty makes the most of her second chance by being top of the class. Meanwhile, Cad, Faith and their colleagues discuss the worsening situation in 'Area 3', around Brague. Kit Vanston, codename Gregoire (Jackson), the resident agent out there, is convinced that the Germans are planning a major operation in the dock area but can do nothing without back-up. There are doubts about the local Communists and resistance and messages coming through are virtually unreadable because Kit doesn't have a wireless operator. Liz and Colin are to be rushed out there to help - Liz has a childhood friend, Claudine De Valois, as a contact in the area. News from the training school is that Matty is the only wireless trainee at the standard required to go into the field and she is added to the team. Lois is to act as her \\"godmother\\" at home. The three are briefed, say their goodbyes and prepare to leave immediately. At the outset of Episode 3, Liz, Matty and Colin have arrived by plane in Area 3 where they are met by members of the communist resistance, headed by Maurice (Vincenzo Nicoli), and to their astonishment, local villagers, revealing worryingly lax security arrangements. Maurice directs Colin to the docks and Liz and Matty to Kit Vanston's hideout. Liz engineers things so that she meets Kit first; she has met him before as he was a friend of her brother's. He is abrasive and contemptuous that the new courier and wireless operator are women. After some difficulty finding an appropriate billet, Matty establishes herself in her cover identity as a district nurse. However, she has trouble getting a transmission through and ends up staying on air long enough for her radio location to be pinpointed by a German detector van. German troops burst into her billet and begin to search. In episode 4, Matty prepares to face the German raid, while Liz connects with her friend Claudine (Shelagh McLeod), whose chateau home has been taken over by the Germans, headed by Colonel Krieger (Clarke). Claudine is running a makeshift library and making herself as pleasant as she can to Krieger. Liz arrives while Claudine is entertaining the Colonel but they manage to stage a reasonably convincing impromptu reunion in front of him; Claudine eventually agrees to help Liz, who gets acclimatised to her new life as a courier. Liz and Kit bond over their respective recent bereavements (Kit's wife and children have been killed in the Blitz). Meanwhile, Colin is spying successfully at the docks and Matty is called in for routine questioning by the Germans. She apparently puts on a convincing display for Krieger but after she has gone he gives orders for her to be watched. By Episode 5, the strain of being behind enemy lines is starting to tell. Cad is informed of a British operation planned for Brague which his operatives will be expected to support. Colin is exhausted. Liz has to flee from a German spot-check; she and Kit grow closer. Matty, bored and frustrated, recklessly dyes her hair a conspicuous red. When Liz is taken ill Claudine takes her place passing information to Matty. Cad plans for Liz to go back to London to brief in person, as Matty's transmissions are troubled by poor reception. Kit orders Matty to ask Cad to send a replacement for Liz so Liz need not come back to France, and later confesses to Liz it is because he has fallen for her. Claudine pumps Krieger's mistress, Therese, for information and discovers that Krieger has found out about the plane coming to get Liz - his men will be waiting. She rushes to Matty who transmits it in the nick of time for Cad to cancel the operation so Liz is not caught. However Krieger realises that it must have been Claudine who passed the information to the British and offers her a deal: either she turns double agent or he will hand her over to the Gestapo. Episode 6 sees Liz arrive back safely in London after a rescheduled pick-up to find that her husband, Laurence (Le Vaillant), is also due home at any minute. Cad offers her a job in London since she will not be going back to France and asks her to brief Nigel Piggott, codename Alain, the sabotage expert who is to replace her in Area 3. Matty's mother (who appears to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder) realises Matty is in France when Liz visits her, bringing a gift of French perfume from Matty. Liz and Laurence's reunion proves to be rather stilted; back home in Devon, Liz puts an injured rabbit out of its misery by killing it with a rock, prompting Laurence to question what her war work is. He is aghast when she tells him the truth. Unknown to the remaining team in France, Claudine has yielded to Krieger's threats and in return for a promise of safety for herself and Liz, gives information about Matty, including drawing a sketch of her, which Krieger immediately recognises as the district nurse. Colin and Matty jump into bed together as a ruse when the Germans raid just after Matty has been transmitting, and end up sleeping together for real. The following morning, the Germans come back, having recognised Matty from Claudine's sketch. Matty puts up a spirited fight but is captured. In Episode 7, Matty is imprisoned and brought before Krieger for interrogation. Krieger knows about her codename, role, and even about Cad. Matty refuses to cooperate, avoiding Krieger's attempts to trap her into giving information about the other agents. However, she can't resist gloating that Celeste is safe in England, belying Claudine's continued attempts to convince Krieger that Liz is innocent. Krieger forces Claudine to collect messages by threatening to reveal her betrayal of Matty to the resistance (who would kill her) and puts one of his men to undertake Matty's transmissions. Lois, receiving the messages, attempts to convince her superiors that it is not Matty's 'touch' but her warning is ignored. Eventually she persuades Cad to attempt a trap which turns out to be inconclusive. He decides he has to send an agent in to find out if their arrangements are still secure before the planned operation. Liz, whose marriage has become strained because Laurence cannot handle the fact that his wife's war work has been more active than his own, agrees to go back to France, much to the horror of both Faith and Laurence. She has a passionate reunion with Kit, who has just found out via Claudine that Matty is in German hands. Matty is taken from her cell by the Gestapo. Episode 8 opens with scenes of Matty being tortured. Krieger intervenes, knowing that he can only save his own career by getting Matty's confession himself. Later, Krieger's commanding officer makes it clear that Krieger must deliver from Matty the name of the leading British agent in the area... or else. Liz arrives back at Claudine's and quickly realises Claudine betrayed Matty. Kit gets a message to London to confirm Matty's capture, and plans to break Matty out of Gestapo headquarters, with the help of Maurice and the resistance. Claudine agrees to try to distract Krieger while the rescue is taking place. However, Cad has realised there could be more to be gained by feeding the Germans false information - but the price of that is leaving Matty imprisoned. Matty's mother, convinced that Matty has been captured, commits suicide. Faith is forced to admit to Matty's grandfather that Matty is a prisoner. Kit, Liz, Colin and Nigel finalise their rescue plan but at the last moment orders come from London that they must not attempt rescue. Kit decides to go ahead anyway. Kit and Liz admit their feelings for each other while Colin and Nigel break into Matty's cell. Colin gets Matty out but Nigel is killed as they escape. In the aftermath, Krieger arrests Claudine - but is then himself led away in handcuffs for his own failure. Cad is castigated by his superiors. The series ends with Matty's arrival home to the delight of her grandfather, while Liz heads back to Devon. ===Series 2 === Series 2 opens in Autumn 1943 with the execution by firing squad of three members of 'The Outfit' in South-Western France. Liz is now working alongside Cad and Faith in London, and has the task of contacting the bereaved relatives, including John Ashton's widow, Vivien (Farleigh), while Faith interviews potential young recruit Emily Whitbread (Snowden). Cad receives direct approval from the Prime Minister for the work they are doing, and also gets a visit from Vivien, offering to volunteer herself. Colin has been on a leaders' course, and is to be sent out to head up Area 7. Kit Vanston, for whom Liz clearly still has feelings, is being brought home. Liz helps train the new recruits, but admits to Faith that since hearing Matty has gone back into the field, she is missing being in France herself. Vivien (codename Solange) and Emily (codename Zoe) pass their training and prepare to leave for France with Colin. Emily sleeps with her boyfriend as a final fling. Kit arrives back, after more than a year leading Area 3, and is met by Liz. In Episode 2, Colin, Vivien and Emily parachute into Area 7, and are met by brusque Outfit agent Gordon, codename Gaspard (McGugan) and local resistance leader Josef (William Simons), but Colin fractures his ankle in the drop. Emily quickly settles into her billet, posing as a relative of widowed shopkeeper Marie Ferrier (Gillian Raine), whose son Luc (Anstee) has just gone off to join the Maquis, and her father, Leon (John Boswell). Their neighbour Annette (Carmel McSharry) is revealed to be short of money and seems suspicious of Emily. Vivien's cover is as nanny to her wealthy friend Juliet (Bobbie Brown), who lives in a nearby chateau. Liz and Kit's relationship blooms when she helps him settle back home. He updates her on the news from Area 3: Maurice was captured and tortured to death by the Gestapo after she left. Liz's mother guesses Liz is having an affair and warns her not to risk her marriage; Liz tries to break it off with Kit who asks her to marry him. She refuses. Meanwhile, in France, Emily fears she is pregnant, Vivien seems to have a hidden agenda, and Colin rouses the suspicions of a young milice officer. He later finds her searching his rooms and has to shoot her. Colin is in shock at the beginning of Episode 3. Vivien and Gordon hastily get rid of the milicienne's body. Emily's pregnancy is confirmed, much to Cad's fury, but she decides to have an abortion so as to continue her work. Vivien's secret is revealed: 19 years ago she had a baby in France and released her for adoption; she seeks the help of a priest in trying to trace her - but he appears to be a collaborator. Colin is having a breakdown - much to the contempt of Gordon, who takes temporary charge - and Cad and Faith worry about who can be sent to replace him. Returning home unexpectedly one night, Liz finds Laurence in bed with another woman. He blames her for being a bad wife and mother, which Liz takes to heart, despite her anger that she gave Kit up needlessly to save her marriage; she agrees to Laurence's demand for a divorce and custody of Vicky and volunteers to lead Area 7 herself. Faith summons Kit to talk Liz out of it, but Kit's chauvinist attitude enrages Liz - they row and part on bad terms. Colin escapes to Spain on foot as Liz (with a new codename of Collette) sets off for France. Episode 4 see Liz arrive in Area 7 where she immediately sets about tightening security. She briefs Gordon that they must disable a U-boat transmitter; they have a resistance contact, Jeanne, working at the base, who arranges for Vivien, under a new identity, to work there as well. Vivien hears from the priest with news of her daughter, Yvette, and disobeys orders to go to Toulouse in search of her. She meets Yvette's adoptive mother but Yvette left home some time ago. Gordon confides his distrust of Vivien to Liz, who finds out about her unauthorised absence and other lapses of security, and takes her to task. Colin has finally got back to England. Cad and Faith visit him in hospital, and then go on to meet their new liaison with the Free French Forces, Paul Daubert. Liz and Gordon finalise their plans to attack the transmitter base unaware that they are walking into a trap: Jeanne has been caught out by the Germans and revealed the raid plans to Sturmbannführer Voller (Donald Gee) of the SD (Sicherheitsdienst) to protect her son. In the resulting shoot-out, Jeanne shouts a last-minute warning and is killed, and Gordon is shot. Liz and Vivien get him out. Josef saves Emily. Episode 5 reveals the aftermath of the failed raid: Vivien and Liz rush the critically injured Gordon to Marie's for makeshift surgery by a doctor friend of Leon's; Annette's suspicions increase; Liz worries who could have betrayed them while showing her increased mettle as leader. The Germans find Emily's transmitter in a barn, and Liz decides she must move to a new safe house, to the dismay of Marie and Leon who have become very attached to her. Vivien finally gets an address for Yvette (Trevyn McDowell) and goes to visit her without revealing who she is; they get on well, but Vivien is shocked to meet Yvette's boyfriend: a German Wehrmacht lieutenant. Cad gets a visit from his son, about to leave on active service, and then agrees with Paul Daubert that they must send an overall co-ordinator to France. Kit accepts the job with enthusiasm; he has admitted to Colin his frustration at being inactive. First, however, Cad wants Kit to go to Area 7 to help Liz destroy a vital factory, but warns him not to let his feelings for Liz cloud his judgment. Gordon recovers sufficiently to be sent home - hidden in a coffin. Emily lingers too long at Marie's while Leon tries to fix her radio; the Germans raid. Emily escapes but Leon is killed and Marie arrested. She is brought before Voller and faces torture, as Emily and Liz meet to regroup. By Episode 6, the situation is perilous. Liz gets a message to London via Area 6. Vivien lunches with Yvette - and finds herself socialising with Voller. Emily, now radio- less, and in a new identity, witnesses a badly beaten Marie being forced on a transporter train. She finds Luc in his hideaway to break the news, and also discovers the informer was Annette. Haunted by the sacrifice Marie and Leon have made for her she asks to carry out the reprisal execution of Annette, but finds someone has beaten her to it. Josef tells Liz Vivien has been seen dining out with German officers; Liz orders Emily to message London to request Vivien's immediate removal but unknown to her, Vivien reads the message. Colin has recovered, and Cad tells him Gordon is safe and Liz is doing well. Cad's son is killed in action, and he is grief-stricken; Faith has to take the decision to recall Vivien. Kit arrives in Area 7. Initially shocked, Liz is relieved to have back-up she can trust but is determined to keep things professional; she has become a clear-sighted and capable leader, somewhat to Kit's dismay. Meanwhile, Vivien's continued recklessness catches up with her: Voller has recognised her from a photograph of when she worked at the transmitter base. Vivien confesses to Yvette that she is her mother; Yvette angrily rejects her. As she storms out, Voller and his men arrest them both. The series climax sees Liz, Kit, Emily and Josef finalising their plans to bomb the factory unaware that Vivien is being questioned by Voller, and about to be handed over to the Gestapo. A German officer, while arranging the necessary transport with a local man, Felix, reveals Vivien is to be sent by car to Bordeaux - but Felix turns out to be part of the resistance. Luc gets his message and rushes to warn Liz that Vivien has been arrested. Liz immediately decides they must ambush the car, and demands a plane from London to get Vivien and Yvette out. Cad organises the plane, but it can only take one person. Liz and Kit break into the factory and set up a booby trap with a grenade. The factory is spectacularly destroyed and they all escape. Now they must rescue Vivien. During the ambush of the car, Voller accidentally kills Yvette when Vivien lunges at him, and is himself killed by Luc. With only seconds to get away, Vivien hysterically refuses to leave Yvette's body. Vivien is risking all their lives; Liz warns her she will shoot her if she has to - and then does. Kit persuades a shaken Liz to take the available place on the plane since the Area 7 unit is finished. Emily prepares to go with Luc into the mountains. Liz and Kit say their goodbyes and Liz flies away. ===Series 3=== The third and final series is based on the actions of the Maquis du Vercors and the events in Vassieux-en-Vercors, though the locations used are given fictional names, such as the village being named Couermont and the plateau \\"Le Crest\\". Jane Snowden, Michael J Jackson, Jane Asher, Stuart McGugan and Mark Anstee all reprise their roles, with agents \\"Dominique\\" (Catherine Schell) and \\"Antoine\\" (Jeremy Nicholas) joining the cast. The series focuses on the build-up to a planned uprising by the resistance in Le Crest, led to by Renard (Trevor Peacock), with the belief that supplies will soon arrive from Great Britain. However Nicole (Felicity Montagu), a woman who had befriended Emily in the opening moments of the series is feeding all this information to the Nazis and General Stuckler (Terence Hardiman) orders the resistance to be quashed and troops are parachuted in, leading to a bloody finale. Other notables appearances in this series are Shirley Henderson who plays a young Jewish girl named Sylvie and Glyn Grain who plays Bonnard, the estranged husband of Dominique. ==DVD releases== The complete series of Wish Me Luck is available on DVD in both the UK and USA. ==External links== * *Wish Me Luck appreciation site Category:1988 British television series debuts Category:1990 British television series endings Category:1980s British drama television series Category:1990s British drama television series Category:ITV television dramas Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:World War II television drama series Category:London Weekend Television shows Category:English-language television shows ","title":"Wish Me Luck"},{"id":"2583076","text":"Bridge below the school, Kelmscott, Western Australia, 23 March 1928 Kelmscott is a southeastern suburb of Perth, Western Australia in the local government area of the City of Armadale.

It was notable for being one of the first television programmes to be shot on location using videotape and outside broadcast equipment, rather than film, as had usually been the case for non-studio shooting until this point. It was the first rural soap opera. Its budget was £500,000. The series dealt with life in a small country town and provided an early TV role for Kate O'Mara as a student vet, a far cry from her later TV roles. 49 half hour episodes were produced, all written by Peter Lambda and his wife Betty Paul. The village of Heydon, north of Reepham, Norfolk was used for the main outside filming, and County School railway station was also used for some scenes.

The workers alleged that between 1972–1977 RSA had issued insurance certificates to asbestos manufacturer Turner & Newall but excluded cover for asbestosis, in breach of the Employers' Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969. RSA responded that asbestos-related injury was excluded from the policy because it was a risk the company was not willing to underwrite, that Turner & Newall was instead self-insured against asbestosis and should therefore be responsible for any compensation. In February 2002 RSA set aside £384 million to double its reserves available for asbestos claims which, combined with claims of £215 million arising from the 11 September attacks, wiped out its 2001 profits. RSA put up seven of its subsidiaries for sale in an attempt to raise a further £800 million to cover liabilities for asbestos insurance claims in the United States. Friends Ivory & Sime subsequently acquired RSA's UK asset management subsidiary in May 2002 for £240 million. The situation was further compounded by RSA having to reserve £1.2 billion against liabilities for guaranteed annuities, the product which caused the collapse of Equitable Life, and was also facing a fine from the Financial Services Authority for failure to meet the deadline in the pension mis-selling review. Two months later Friends Provident acquired RSA's offshore life unit International Financial Services Limited, based on the Isle of Man, for £133 million. In July 2002 RSA sold its group risk business to Canada Life for £60 million. RSA was forced to close its life business, with the loss of 1,200 jobs, in August 2002. In November 2002 Turner & Newall launched a suit against RSA on behalf of former employees who had suffered asbestos-related disease, claiming that the insurer was liable because it provided employer liability policies to the engineering firm. In an effort to reduce costs, RSA chairman Sir Patrick Gillam said it would sell its US business RSUI and \\"float most of its Asia Pacific operations\\", bringing total job losses in the UK to 4000. The case was heard at the High Court of Justice in January 2003. RSA argued that a policy clause which excluded cover for pneumoconiosis also excluded other asbestos-related disease such as asbestosis and peritoneal mesothelioma. Colin Edelman QC, representing T&N;, told Mr Justice Lawrence Collins that the defence which RSA had the \\"temerity\\" to put forward was \\"just ridiculous\\" and that the insurer was trying to \\"wriggle out of its liability\\". On 9 May 2003 the court ruled that RSA was liable for the compensation claims. In September 2003 RSA cut 1,000 jobs in the UK and asked shareholders for £960 million to cover further asbestos claims. ===Inflated repair costs=== In September 2011, Judge Platt of the Romford County Court in his judgement attacked the method in which RSA recovered their costs by putting a subsidiary within the motor claims process to inflate profits. Several insurers are now refusing to pay RSA's requests for payment without sight of the original invoice. On 15 June 2012, RSA Insurance was successful in a High Court ruling; the company said the ruling meant \\"its practices have been deemed legal and its stance vindicated\\". Within hours, Allianz Insurance lodged an appeal against RSA. Since then RSA has started to make bilateral agreements, the first announced on 29 June 2012 with Cooperative Insurance. ===Hillsborough disaster=== A fatal event at an English FA Cup match, widely known as the Hillsborough disaster, implicated RSA. A human crush resulted in 96 fatalities and 766 injured persons. The Royal Sun Alliance Insurance Company (which, as Sun Alliance, was the insurer for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club in 1989) refused to waive its entitlement to privilege, thus denying the Hillsborough Independent Panel access to its material. Strenuous efforts were made to persuade the company to allow the Panel confidential access to the material, but it maintained its refusal. RSA were entitled to do this as they are under no obligation to release information relating to the amount of compensation paid out to victims and families; in any case the release of that information would not have affected the result on who was to blame for the Hillsborough disaster. ==See also== * List of companies based in London ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * * Category:Financial services companies established in 1996 Category:Companies based in Liverpool Category:Insurance companies of the United Kingdom Category:Companies listed on the London Stock Exchange Category:Financial services companies based in the City of London Category:1996 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"RSA Insurance Group"},{"id":"2583094","text":"Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba S.A.

The cost of Internet access is CUC$1.00 per hour (or CUC$0.20 for domestic intranet access and CUC$1.00 for email), which is still high in a country where state salaries average $25 CUC a month. ==Mobile telephone system== The first mobile telephone system was Cubacel, using AMPS and later D-AMPS. The company was a joint venture with Sherritt International. Later, a second system, C-com, was set up using GSM. In 2005, the Cuban government bought Sherritt out and merged Cubacel and C-com into a division of ETECSA. The two names continue as brands. ETECSA announced that its D-AMPS network will be deactivated on March 31, 2009. From then on, GSM-900 and GSM-850 will be the only services. Although ETECSA has new rates for their mobile communications, incoming and outgoing phone calls are still being paid in Cuban Convertible Pesos (CUC). This makes receiving and making calls very expensive for Cubans, even for tourists. The price of receiving or making a call with a cell phone in Cuba is currently 0.35CUC/minute during peak hours (7:00am – 10:59pm) and 0.10CUC/minute during off peak hours (11:00pm – 6:59am).http://www.etecsa.cu/?page=telefonia_movil⊂=cubacel_tarifa (1 CUC = 1 USD)http://www.bc.gob.cu/Espanol/Acuerdo30-11.asp == New Installation == ETECSA now is working on the installation of new public telephones and has decided to import from a new model from Italy, according to officials working near the Farmacia Escribano near the Ciencias Medicas in the city of Sancti Spiritus.

He published works on Australian history, authoring 13 books, his final being Land of Vision and Mirage: Western Australia since 1826. His book, Daphne Street, published by Fremantle Press, describes his early surrounds, and is an attempt to write national history at the local level. He was a frequent contributor to radio in Western Australia and did much to bring Western Australian history and socio-political development to life. Part of his career was spent setting up the Australian Studies Centre (now the Menzies Centre) at the University of London in the United Kingdom. He was Chairperson of the Western Australian Maritime Museum's Archaeology Advisory Committee. Bolton was a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society (London), Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia, Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities, and Fellow of the Royal Western Australian Historical Society. He served as the Chancellor of Murdoch University from 2002 to 2006. In 2008, he published a single-volume short history of Western Australia since the start of British settlement in 1826, covering the social, cultural, political and economic development of the most geographically isolated area in the world. Bolton died on 4 September 2015, in Perth, at the age of 83. He was married to Carol Grattan and has two sons and five grandchildren. ==Awards== Bolton was the recipient of several prestigious awards including his appointment as Officer of the Order of Australia (1984) in recognition of distinguished service to Australia for his services to education. In 2001, Bolton received the Centenary of Federation prize at the New South Wales Premier's History Awards for Edmund Barton: The One Man for the Job, a biography of Australia's first Prime Minister. The one-off prize was intended to recognize a major work contributing to the understanding of Australian political, social and cultural issues during the Federation period. The biography was also shortlisted for the Colin Roderick Award (2000) and the National Biography Award (2001).https://www.allenandunwin.com/browse/books/general- books/history/Edmund-Barton-Geoffrey-Bolton-9781865084091 Since 2004, the State Records Office of Western Australia has hosted The Geoffrey Bolton Lecture series, acknowledging his service on various committees of the State Archive and his long period of use and promotion of archives. The aims of the Geoffrey Bolton Lecture are to encourage the expression of ideas and debate about the meaning and nature of history, culture and society, grounded in archival research; and to provide archival and historical context to national debate on contemporary issues. In recognition of his major contribution to Australian history and the community, Bolton was named the Western Australia's 2006 Australian of the Year. ==Memorials== There are a number of eponymous memorials to Bolton. In 2014 a new street, central to the Elizabeth Quay waterfront development, then under construction, was named Geoffrey Bolton Avenue in acknowledgement of the contribution made by Bolton to conserve, record and teach the history of Western Australia. At a dedication ceremony held on 21 February 2017, Murdoch University renamed its library The Geoffrey Bolton Library to recognize Bolton's long association with the University. ==Publications== Citations to this author abbreviate his name to G.

She is remembered because of dated inscriptions on images of bodhisattvas and the Buddha that she erected in three cities near the Ganges river. They mark her success in attracting money and patronage to the Sarvāstivāda, the sect of Buddhism to which she belonged. ==Life and work== Buddhamitrā was born around 60 in Mathurā. Her parents were wealthy Buddhists. She entered into the sangha and became a Buddhist nun. Her teacher was a monk named Bala, who belonged to the Sarvāstivāda, an early school of Buddhism. Both teacher and student were educated in the entire threefold knowledge of Buddhism (the Tripiṭaka) and were noted for their efforts. Accompanied at first by a monk named Pushyavuddhi, beginning in about 117, Buddhamitrā and Bala built monuments at Śrāvastī and at Sārnāth. They had the help of two of the region's satraps or governors, Vanaspara and Kharapallāna, the \\"great satrap\\". For the next six years, or until about 123, Buddhamitrā then went to Kosam, where she built several monuments. For example, one of the images at Kosam is a standing stone bodhisattva which today can be seen in the Allahabad Museum. Satya Shrava gives a translation of the inscription, originally written in Brāhmī characters in a mixture of the Sanskrit and Prākrit. It reads, \\"In the year 2 of mahārāja Kanishka, in the 2nd month of hemanta, i.e., the winter season, on the 8th day, the image of Bodhisattva is set up by the nun Buddhamitrā, well versed in the Tripitaka, at the promenade of the Lord Buddha.\\" Buddhamitrā and Bala were not interested in only converting others to their religion. To quote A Rough Guide to Kushan History, \\"[P]atronage, not conversion was the goal of Buddhamitra.\\" She sought, successfully, money from wealthy and powerful people to promote Buddhism, and specifically for followers of the Sarvāstivāda school. The prestige of each patron enhanced the legitimacy of Sarvāstivāda. Her desire was to reach the leaders of the Kushan Empire. Buddhamitrā lived at the time of the Fourth Buddhist council and it is likely given her political connections and learning that she was involved.\\"No women are mentioned in the sources. Yet the importance of women in inscriptions implies that some were probably involved.\\" in She is a remarkable figure, because despite living in a patriarchal society she has left a mark in history where many male kings have been entirely forgotten. Her niece, who was a nun named Dhanavati (or Dhanadevī), in 148 built a memorial in honor of Buddhamitrā in the city of her birth. Shrava gives a translation of the inscription: ==Record== The female gender of someone named Buddhamitrā has been known since at least the 1960s or 1970s. A Rough Guide to Kushan History says, \\"The evidence for Buddhamitra comes completely from inscriptions.\\" Just as other scholars have, Theo Damsteegt catalogs these inscriptions, in his case, in his 1978 doctoral dissertation, Epigraphical Hybrid Sanskrit, which identifies Buddhamitrā as a nun.\\"...In Kosam III the donor is the nun Buddhamitrā; in Sārnāth I–II it is the monk Bala, with the same nun Buddhamitrā as one of the co-donors (Sārnāth I); at Set-Mahet it is the monk Bala. Both Bala and Buddhamitrā are, moreover, referred to in a Mathurā inscription which dates from the year 33 (I Ros., Pl.) and records a donation of a sister's daughter of Buddhamitrā, viz. M 24.\\" in Including all of the known works by and about Buddhamitrā, in 1993, Satya Shrava published a book of the inscriptions of the Kushan Empire rulers of India that have dates, along with a photograph of each one. Peter Skilling refers to this historical record and to a female named Buddhamitrā in 2001, in \\"Nuns, Laywomen, Donors, Goddesses: Female Roles in Early Indian Buddhism\\". Thea Mohr and Jampa Tsoedren give the female gender of someone named Buddhamitrā in a footnote in their book Dignity & Discipline: Reviving Full Ordination for Buddhist Nuns (2010), which identifies Buddhamitrā as a nun, one who had committed the entire Tripitaka to memory.\\"Not only the Buddhist canonical scriptures, but also inscriptions in ancient India testify to the learnedness of Buddhist nuns. One of these inscriptions indicates that a nun had performed the impressive deed of memorizing the entire Tripitaka.\\" and part of the footnote: \\"Inscriptions no. 38 and 925 in Lüders 1973; 8 and 94 refer to the nun Buddhamitra as a trépitikå....\\" in ==Further reading== * and ==Notes== Category:Indian Buddhists Category:Kushan Empire Category:60 births Category:Buddhist nuns Category:Buddhism and women Category:Year of death unknown Category:Indian Buddhist nuns Category:1st-century Buddhist nuns ","title":"Buddhamitra"},{"id":"2583108","text":"Rewind is the debut album by Hexstatic, released on Ntone (sister label to Ninja Tune) in March 2000.

It was produced by Gerard Glaister as a follow-up to the long- running series Howards' Way. Filmed in and around the village of Compton near Newbury, the series was set in the world of horse racing. It starred Mark Greenstreet as Mike Hardy, an aspiring horse trainer keen to set up his own stables. Other major characters included local gambler John Grey (David McCallum) and widow Rachel Ware (Susannah York). The first series of 13 episodes was given the prime time Sunday night slot on BBC1 which had previously been occupied by another Glaister creation Howards' Way and a horse-racing storyline from that earlier programme provided much of the inspiration for Trainer. However, with ratings of around 6 million, the second series was reduced to ten episodes and shown on Wednesday evenings. Many changes were made for the second series to try to increase its popularity. The self-contained story-per-episode format of the first series made way for a more soap-like continuous story, new characters were introduced and storylines focussed more on their intertwined personal lives. However, the midweek slot and racier plots did not bring in the additional viewers needed to justify a third series. The last episode of the second series ended with a murder- mystery cliffhanger, which would never be resolved. Trainer ran for two series and was the last TV project for producer Gerard Glaister. Glaister commissioned Simon May to compose the theme music, following their collaboration on Howards' Way. The opening titles were accompanied by an instrumental theme. As with later series of Howards' Way, it was decided to add lyrics for the version for the closing titles. Mike Read was commissioned to write lyrics for May's composition. The resulting song, \\"More to Life\\", was performed by Cliff Richard, and entered the UK singles chart at number 23. ==Cast== * Mark Greenstreet ...

Situated in the narrow valley of the Gellone river where it meets the steep-sided gorge of the Hérault River, Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert is essentially a medieval village located on the Chemin de St-Jacques (Way of St. James) pilgrim route to Santiago de Compostella. ==Geography== The area of the municipality of Saint- Guilhem is nearly 40km² in area. The town is serviced by two departmental roads D122 and D4. and the nearest towns are Ganges, a city near the source of the Hérault, about 35 km away, Montpellier also 35 km away, Gignac 15 km away, Saint-André-de-Sangonis 12 km away and Lodève (via A 75, Gignac and Aniane) 35 km distant. The town, which has retained a medieval appearance, is located on the borders of the Massif Central, in the middle valley of the Hérault, north of the department of the same name. The territory of the town lies in an intramontane zone formed by the extension of the Séranne mountain and the Cellette mountain a few kilometers from the Garrigues of the plain of Languedoc. ===Hydrography=== It is watered by the Hérault and Verdus Rivers. The Hérault River, the Combe des Arboussets and the Poujols are the main rivers that water the town. ==History== The village has maintained its historic state. Because of its isolation, in 806 Saint Guilhem established the monastery of Gellone here. In 804, the count of Toulouse and duke of Aquitaine Guilhèm in langue d 'oc (saint Guillaume) founded at a time when the valley was virtualaly uninhabited hence considered \\"desert\\". The abbey was originally called The Abbey of Gellone, until after Guillaume died in 812 when it was named The Abbey of Guillaume, and then the Abbey of Saint-Guilhem after his canonization in 1066. The Abbey of Aniane, nearby, was founded around 782 by a relative of Guillaume. The abbey became a very important pilgrimage site in the middle ages due to a relic of a piece of the true cross was housed here. The town developed around the abbey. In the Middle Ages, the abbey fell within the territory of the diocese of Lodeve.

When pro-Royalist riots broke out in Kent in December 1647, Livesey was sent to quell them; he remained in the south-east during 1648, quelling a 600-strong pro-Royalist riot in Horsham and harshly suppressed further suspected Royalist activity in the county. During July, he pursued the Earl of Holland's insurgents after they attempted to capture Reigate Castle, and then defeated them at Kingston in Surrey, thus ending the threat of a Royalist uprising in the environs of London. Appointed a Commissioner, Livesey was a signatory to the King's death warrant and was an active Member of the Rump Parliament, where he emerged as deeply hostile to Royalists and Papists. Like other Republicans, he opposed the establishment of the Protectorate in 1653, but occupied himself with local duties: he served as High Sheriff of Kent between 1655 and 1656. Denounced as a regicide at the Restoration, he and his wife fled to the Low Countries. Sir Michael died in 1663,Livesey Memorial at All Saints', Eastchurch, Kent and Dame Elizabeth Livesey, daughter of Sir Henry Fynes (1587–1641), died without issue in 1666. ==See also== * Livesey baronets ==References== Category:1611 births Category:1663 deaths Category:People from the Isle of Sheppey Category:History of Kent Category:Regicides of Charles I Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of England Category:High Sheriffs of Kent Category:English MPs 1640–1648 Category:English MPs 1648–1653 ","title":"Michael Livesey"},{"id":"2583120","text":"The International Business Law Consortium (IBLC) describes itself as an affiliation of independent law firms, tax and audit advisors and related professionals cultivating transnational legal knowledge to promote efficient and effective professional services and guide businesses in a global community.http://iblc.com/ accessed 20 May 2014, 16:15 CEST The IBLC was established in 1996Yearbook of the Union of International Associations http://www.uia.org/s/or/en/1100014236 accessed 20 May 2014 16:31 CEST under the auspices of the Center for International Legal Studies as a means of assisting law firms affiliated with the Center to participate in and further the Center's programs, and to translate these benefits to the delivery of transnational legal services.

Lying entirely within Hidalgo County, New Mexico, it is the only section of the old U.S. Route 80 (US 80) in New Mexico which still retains its number. The route was re-designated NM 80 in 1989. This is the reason why NM 80 has an even number designation despite the highway being north/south. From the south, AZ 80 acts as a continuation of NM 80 into Arizona. ==History== An abandoned section of US 80 (Rivers Road) in Rodeo. In 1903, New Mexico Territorial Road 4 (NM 4) was designated from the Arizona border near Rodeo through Lordsburg and Deming to NM 1 in Las Cruces. Upon creation of New Mexico's first state highway system in 1912, NM 4 was re-designated as New Mexico State Road 4. In Lordsburg, NM 4 passed the western terminus of NM 42, which ran northeast to NM 11 in Silver City. In 1917 the Dixie Overland Highway auto trail was designated between San Diego, California and Savannah, Georgia over part of NM 4. The Dixie Overland Highway was joined by the Bankhead Highway in 1920 and the Old Spanish Trail in 1923. In 1923, NM 4 was truncated to Lordsburg, and NM 42 extended over its former route to Arizona. NM 80 southbound On November 11, 1926, the U.S. Numbered Highway System was established in a joint effort by the United States Department of Agriculture and the American Association of State Highway Officials. NM 42 became part of U.S. Route 80 from Arizona to Lordsburg and U.S. Route 180 from Lordsburg to Silver City. Nationally, US 80 ran from San Diego to Savannah, replacing the earlier auto trails designated along NM 4 and NM 42. US 180 ran from Florence Junction, Arizona to the new U.S. Route 85 northeast of Silver City via Lordsburg. The arrival of the U.S. Highways in New Mexico caused the New Mexico State Highway Department to institute a statewide remembering in 1927 to better include the new routes. As such, NM 42 and the remainder of NM 4 were entirely removed from the state highway system in favor of US 80 and US 180. The route between Arizona and Lordsburg would continue to hold the US 80 designation for the next 63 years. Following the creation of the Interstate Highway System in 1956, Interstate 10 slowly replaced US 80. Starting in 1964, US 80 was truncated eastward in increments from San Diego. in 1989, Arizona and New Mexico requested AASHTO to remove US 80 west of Anthony, New Mexico. The request was approved. The remaining section of US 80 from Benson, Arizona to Roadforks became Arizona State Route 80 and New Mexico State Road 80. The remainder of US 80 was removed from New Mexico in 1991. ==Route description== NM 80 northbound through Granite Gap. Despite being an even numbered highway, New Mexico State Road 80 is signed as a north/south route. This odd situation is due to the fact NM 80 takes its number from the now defunct US 80, which was an east/west highway as well as the fact the highway continues as AZ 80 into Arizona. NM 80 begins at the Arizona state line and eastern terminus of Arizona State Route 80. The highway travels northeast alongside the town of Rodeo. On the north side of the highway is the now abandoned track bed of the former El Paso and Southwestern Railroad. On the northeast end of town at Shady Lane, Rivers Road curves off to the northeast. This is an older section of US 80 that used to lead to a railroad overpass, when the EP&SW; was still operational. After the line was abandoned, US 80, now NM 80, was rerouted to a gentle curve bisecting the old track bed. The old overpass has long since been demolished. NM 80 travels straight north from this point on. 8 miles from the Arizona border, NM 80 intersects the eastern terminus of NM 533. Four miles north of NM 533 is the western terminus of NM 9, which heads east to Animas and Columbus. Continuing north, NM 80 passes Rodeo Airport, then curves northeast, skirting the base of both Granite Peak and Blue Mountain. At the eastern base of Blue Mountain is the western terminus of NM 143 NM 80 then makes a straight shot north through a desolate flat desert landscape until it reaches Roadforks. The small unincorporated area has a few service stations and small businesses for both NM 80 and I-10 travelers. NM 80 continues for a few hundred feet north, before ending in a trumpet interchange at I-10 Exit 5. While NM 80 ends here, US 80 would have continued east along much of the current route of I-10 to the Texas border. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * List of state roads in New Mexico ==References== ==Further reading== # Bygone Byways # US Highway 80 The Broadway of North America # American Roads U.S. Highway 80 ==External links== 080 Category:Transportation in Hidalgo County, New Mexico Category:U.S. Route 80 ","title":"New Mexico State Road 80"},{"id":"2583142","text":"Bon-y-maen, sometimes spelt Bonymaen, () is a community in Swansea, Wales located about north east of Swansea city centre.

The Byzantines liked colour and pattern, and made and exported very richly patterned cloth, especially Byzantine silk, woven and embroidered for the upper classes, and resist-dyed and printed for the lower. A different border or trimming round the edges was very common, and many single stripes down the body or around the upper arm are seen, often denoting class or rank. Taste for the middle and upper classes followed the latest fashions at the Imperial Court. As in the West during the Middle Ages, clothing was very expensive for the poor, who probably wore the same well-worn clothes nearly all the time;Payne, Blanche; Winakor, Geitel; Farrell-Beck Jane: The History of Costume, from the Ancient Mesopotamia to the Twentieth Century, 2nd Edn, p128, HarperCollins, 1992. this meant in particular that any costume owned by most women needed it to fit throughout the full term of a pregnancy.Dawson (2006), 43 ==On the body== San Vitale church in Ravenna. Few later emperors would dress so simply as in a mosaic as Justinian I here, though his dress is far richer at every point than his attendants. He and they have the tablion diagonally across their torsos. This bishop probably wore this style of dress, which is very close to modern church vestments, for most of the time. Note what appears to be shoes and socks. In the early stages of the Byzantine Empire the traditional Roman toga was still used as very formal or official dress. By Justinian's time this had been replaced by the tunica, or long chiton, for both sexes, over which the upper classes wore other garments, like a dalmatica (dalmatic), a heavier and shorter type of tunica, again worn by both sexes, but mainly by men. The hems often curve down to a sharp point. The scaramangion was a riding-coat of Persian origin, opening down the front and normally coming to the mid-thigh, although these are recorded as being worn by Emperors, when they seem to become much longer. In general, except for military and presumably riding- dress, men of higher status, and all women, had clothes that came down to the ankles, or nearly so. Women often wore a top layer of the stola, for the rich in brocade. All of these, except the stola, might be belted or not. The terms for dress are often confusing, and certain identification of the name a particular pictured item had, or the design that relates to a particular documentary reference, is rare, especially outside the Court. The chlamys, a semicircular cloak fastened to the right shoulder continued throughout the period. The length fell sometimes only to the hips or as far as the ankles, much longer than the version commonly worn in Ancient Greece; the longer version is also called a paludamentum. As well as his courtiers, Emperor Justinian wears one, with a huge brooch, in the Ravenna mosaics. On each straight edge men of the senatorial class had a tablion, a lozenge shaped coloured panel across the chest or midriff (at the front), which was also used to show the further rank of the wearer by the colour or type of embroidery and jewels used (compare those of Justinian and his courtiers). Theodosius I and his co-emperors were shown in 388 with theirs at knee level in the Missorium of Theodosius I of 387, but over the next decades the tablion can be seen to move higher on the Chlamys, for example in ivories of 413-414.Kilerich, 275 A paragauda or border of thick cloth, usually including gold, was also an indicator of rank. Sometimes an oblong cloak would be worn, especially by the military and ordinary people; it was not for court occasions. Cloaks were pinned on the right shoulder for ease of movement, and access to a sword. Leggings and hose were often worn, but are not prominent in depictions of the wealthy; they were associated with barbarians, whether European or Persian. Even basic clothes appear to have been surprisingly expensive for the poor. Some manual workers, probably slaves, are shown continuing to wear, at least in summer, the basic Roman slip costume which was effectively two rectangles sewn together at the shoulders and below the arm. Others, when engaged in activity, are shown with the sides of their tunic tied up to the waist for ease of movement. ==Iconographic dress== Moses has iconographic dress, the others everyday contemporary clothes, 10th century The most common images surviving from the Byzantine period are not relevant as references for actual dress worn in the period. Christ (often even as a baby), the Apostles, Saint Joseph, Saint John the Baptist and some others are nearly always shown wearing formulaic dress of a large himation, a large rectangular mantle wrapped round the body (almost a toga), over a chiton, or loose sleeved tunic, reaching to the ankles. Sandals are worn on the feet. This costume is not commonly seen in secular contexts, although possibly this is deliberate, to avoid confusing secular with divine subjects. The Theotokos (Virgin Mary) is shown wearing a maphorion, a more shaped mantle with a hood and sometimes a hole at the neck. This probably is close to actual typical dress for widows, and for married women when in public. The Virgin's underdress may be visible, especially at the sleeves. There are also conventions for Old Testament prophets and other Biblical figures. Apart from Christ and the Virgin, much iconographic dress is white or relatively muted in colour especially when on walls (murals and mosaics) and in manuscripts, but more brightly coloured in icons. Many other figures in Biblical scenes, especially if unnamed, are usually depicted wearing \\"contemporary\\" Byzantine clothing. ==Female dress== Modesty was important for all except the very rich, and most women appear almost entirely covered by rather shapeless clothes, which needed to be able to accommodate a full pregnancy. The basic garment in the early Empire comes down to the ankles, with a high round collar and tight sleeves to the wrist. The fringes and cuffs might be decorated with embroidery, with a band around the upper arm as well. In the 10th and 11th century a dress with flared sleeves, eventually very full indeed at the wrist, becomes increasingly popular, before disappearing; working women are shown with the sleeves tied up. In court ladies this may come with a V-collar. Belts were normally worn, possibly with belt-hooks to support the skirt; they may have been cloth more often than leather, and some tasselled sashes are seen.Dawson (2006), 50-53;57 Neck openings were probably often buttoned, which is hard to see in art, and not described in texts, but must have been needed if only for breast-feeding. Straight down, across, or diagonally are the possible options.Dawson (2006), 53-54 The plain linen undergarment was, until the 10th century, not designed to be visible. However at this point a standing collar starts to show above the main dress. Hair is covered by a variety of head-cloths and veils, presumably often removed inside the home. Sometimes caps were worn under the veil, and sometimes the cloth is tied in turban style. This may have been done while working - for example the midwives in scenes of the Nativity of Jesus in art usually adopt this style. Earlier ones were wrapped in a figure-of-eight fashion, but by the 11th century circular wrapping, possibly sewn into a fixed position, was adopted. In the 11th and 12th centuries head-cloths or veils began to be longer.Dawson (2006), 43-47 With footwear, scholars are more certain, as there are considerable numbers of examples recovered by archaeology from the drier parts of the Empire. A great variety of footwear is found, with sandals, slippers and boots to the mid-calf all common in manuscript illustrations and excavated finds, where many are decorated in various ways. The colour red, reserved for Imperial use in male footwear, is actually by far the most common colour for women's shoes. Purses are rarely visible, and seem to have been made of textile matching the dress, or perhaps tucked into the sash.Dawson (2006), 57-59 Dancers are shown with special dress including short sleeves or sleeveless dresses, which may or may not have a lighter sleeve from an undergarment below. They have tight wide belts, and their skirts have a flared and differently coloured element, probably designed to rise up as they spin in dances.Dawson (2006), 59-60 A remark of Anna Komnene about her mother suggests that not showing the arm above the wrist was a special focus of Byzantine modesty.Dawson (2006), 61 Although it is sometimes claimed that the face-veil was invented by the Byzantines,Dawson (2006) 61, gives two examples; Review of Herrin book Byzantine art does not depict women with veiled faces, although it commonly depicts women with veiled hair. It is assumed that Byzantine women outside court circles went well wrapped up in public, and were relatively restricted in their movements outside the house; they are rarely depicted in art.Michael Angold, Church and Society in Byzantium Under the Comneni, 1081-1261, pp. 426-7 & ff;1995, Cambridge University Press, The literary sources are not sufficiently clear to distinguish between a head-veil and a face-veil. Strabo, writing in the 1st century, alludes to some Persian women veiling their faces (Geography, 11. 9-10). In addition, the early 3rd-century Christian writer Tertullian, in his treatise The Veiling of Virgins, Ch. 17, describes pagan Arab women as veiling the entire face except the eyes, in the manner of a niqab. This shows that some Middle Eastern women veiled their faces long before Islam. ==Colour== Two embroidered roundels from an Egyptian 7th century tunic As in Roman times, purple was reserved for the royal family; other colours in various contexts conveyed information as to class and clerical or government rank. Lower-class people wore simple tunics but still had the preference for bright colours found in all Byzantine fashions. The races in the Hippodrome used four teams: red, white, blue and green; and the supporters of these became political factions, taking sides on the great theological issues—which were also political questions—of Arianism, Nestorianism and Monophysitism, and therefore on the Imperial claimants who also took sides. Huge riots took place, in the 4th to 6th centuries and mostly in Constantinople, with deaths running into the thousands, between these factions, who naturally dressed in their appropriate colours. In medieval France, there were similar colours-wearing political factions, called chaperons. ==Example== census before Governor Quirinius, mosaic in the Chora Church (1315-20). See text A 14th-century mosaic (right) from the Kahriye-Cami or Chora Church in Istanbul gives an excellent view of a range of costume from the late period. From the left, there is a soldier on guard, the governor in one of the large hats worn by important officials, a middle-ranking civil servant (holding the register roll) in a dalmatic with a wide border, probably embroidered, over a long tunic, which also has a border. Then comes a higher-ranking soldier, carrying a sword on an untied belt or baldric. The Virgin and St Joseph are in their normal iconographic dress, and behind St Joseph a queue of respectable citizens wait their turn to register. Male hem lengths drop as the status of the person increases. All the exposed legs have hose, and the soldiers and citizens have foot-wrappings above, presumably with sandals. The citizens wear dalmatics with a wide border around the neck and hem, but not as rich as that of the middle-level official. The other men would perhaps wear hats if not in the presence of the governor. A donor figure in the same church, the Grand Logothete Theodore Metochites, who ran the legal system and finances of the Empire, wears an even larger hat, which he keeps on whilst kneeling before Christ (see Gallery). == Hats == Medal of John VIII Palaeologus by Pisanello, who saw him at Ferrara in 1438 Many men went bareheaded and, apart from the Emperor, they were normally so in votive depictions, which may distort the record we have. In the late Byzantine period a number of extravagantly large hats were worn as uniform by officials. In the 12th century, Emperor Andronikos Komnenos wore a hat shaped like a pyramid, but eccentric dress is one of many things he was criticised for. This was perhaps related to the very elegant hat with a very high-domed peak, and a sharply turned-up brim coming far forward in an acute triangle to a sharp point (left), that was drawn by Italian artists when the Emperor John VIII Palaiologos went to Florence and the Council of Ferrara in 1438 in the last days of the Empire. Versions of this and other clothes, including many spectacular hats, worn by the visitors were carefully drawn by Pisanello and other artists. They passed through copies across Europe for use in Eastern subjects, especially for depictions of the three kings or Magi in Nativity scenes. In 1159 the visiting Crusader Prince Raynald of Châtillon wore a tiara shaped felt cap, embellished in gold. An Iberian wide brimmed felt hat came into vogue during the 12th century. Especially in the Balkans, small caps with or without fur brims were worn, of the sort later adopted by the Russian Tsars. == Shoes == Byzantine men's shoes of partially gilded leather, 6th century, Walters Art Museum. Not many shoes are seen clearly in Byzantine Art because of the long robes of the rich. Red shoes marked the Emperor; blue shoes, a sebastokrator; and green shoes a protovestiarios. The Ravenna mosaics show the men wearing what may be sandals with white socks, and soldiers wear sandals tied around the calf or strips of cloth wrapped round the leg to the calf. These probably went all the way to the toes (similar foot-wrappers are still worn by Russian other ranks). Some soldiers, including later Imperial portraits in military dress, show boots nearly reaching the knee - red for the Emperor. In the Imperial Regalia of the Holy Roman Emperors there are shoes or slippers in Byzantine style made in Palermo before 1220. They are short, only to the ankle, and generously cut to allow many different sizes to be accommodated. They are lavishly decorated with pearls and jewels and gold scrollwork on the sides and over the toe of the shoe.Photo that does not show the gold embroidery very well. Also see Commons images of the Regalia. More practical footwear was no doubt worn on less formal occasions. Outside labourers would either have sandals or be barefoot. The sandals follow the Roman model of straps over a thick sole. Some examples of the Roman cuculus or military boot are also seen on shepherds. ==Military costume== This stayed close to the Greco-Roman pattern, especially for officers (see Gallery section for example). A breastplate of armour, under which the bottom of a short tunic appeared as a skirt, often overlaid with a fringe of leather straps, the pteruges. Similar strips covered the upper arms, below round armour shoulder-pieces. Boots came to the calf, or sandals were strapped high on the legs. A rather flimsy-looking cloth belt is tied high under the ribs as a badge of rank rather than a practical item. Dress and equipment changed considerably across the period to have the most efficient and effective accoutrements current economics would allow. Other ranks' clothing was largely identical to that of common working men. The manuals recommend tunics and coats no longer than the knee.Dawson (2007), p. 16 As an army marches first of all on its feet, the manual writers were more concerned that troops should have good footwear than anything else.Dawson (2007), p. 18 This ranged from low lace up shoes to thigh boots, all to be fitted with \\"a few (hob) nails\\".Strategikon. Leo, Taktika A head-cloth (\\"phakiolion\\" or \\"maphorion\\") which ranged from a simple cloth coming from below the helmet (as still worn by Orthodox clergy) to something more like a turban, was standard military headgear in the Middle and Late Empire for both common troops and for ceremonial wear by some ranks;Dawson (2006), 44-45; Phokas, Composition on Warfare, on common troops, Constantine Porphyrogenitus, Treatise on Imperial Military Expeditions they were also worn by women. ==Imperial costume== Emperor and Empress in the loros costume, Nicephorus III and Maria of Alania. 1074-81 The distinctive garments of the Emperors (often there were two at a time) and Empresses were the crown and the heavily jewelled Imperial loros or pallium, that developed from the trabea triumphalis, a ceremonial coloured version of the Roman toga worn by Consuls (during the reign of Justinian I Consulship became part of the imperial status), and worn by the Emperor and Empress as a quasi-ecclesiastical garment. It was also worn by the twelve most important officials and the imperial bodyguard, and hence by Archangels in icons, who were seen as divine bodyguards. In fact it was only normally worn a few times a year, such as on Easter Sunday, but it was very commonly used for depictions in art.Parani, 18-27 The men's version of the loros was a long strip, dropping down straight in front to below the waist, and with the portion behind pulled round to the front and hung gracefully over the left arm. The female loros was similar at the front end, but the back end was wider and tucked under a belt after pulling through to the front again. Both male and female versions changed style and diverged in the middle Byzantine period, the female later reverting to the new male style. Apart from jewels and embroidery, small enamelled plaques were sewn into the clothes; the dress of Manuel I Comnenus was described as being like a meadow covered with flowers. Generally sleeves were closely fitted to the arm and the outer dress comes to the ankles (although often called a scaramangion), and is also rather closely fitted. The sleeves of empresses became extremely wide in the later period.Parani, 19-27 Glove from the Imperial Regalia of the Holy Roman Emperors in Vienna, including enamelled plaques. Palermo, c. 1220 The superhumeral, worn throughout the history of Byzantium, was the imperial decorative collar, often forming part of the loros. It was copied by at least women of the upper class. It was of cloth of gold or similar material, then studded with gems and heavily embroidered. The decoration was generally divided into compartments by vertical lines on the collar. The edges would be done in pearls of varying sizes in up to three rows. There were occasionally drop pearls placed at intervals to add to the richness. The collar came over the collarbone to cover a portion of the upper chest. The Imperial Regalia of the Holy Roman Emperors, kept in the Schatzkammer (Vienna), contains a full set of outer garments made in the 12th century in essentially Byzantine style at the Byzantine-founded workshops in Palermo. These are among the best surviving Byzantine garments and give a good idea of the lavishness of Imperial ceremonial clothing. There is a cloak (worn by the Emperors with the gap at the front), \\"alb\\", dalmatic, stockings, slippers and gloves. The loros is Italian and later. Each element of the design on the cloak (see Textiles below) is outlined in pearls and embroidered in gold. Especially in the early and later periods (approximately before 600 and after 1,000) Emperors may be shown in military dress, with gold breastplates, red boots, and a crown. Crowns had pendilia and became closed on top during the 12th century. ==Court dress== Court life \\"passed in a sort of ballet\\", with precise ceremonies prescribed for every occasion, to show that \\"Imperial power could be exercised in harmony and order\\", and \\"the Empire could thus reflect the motion of the Universe as it was made by the Creator\\", according to the Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, who wrote a Book of Ceremonies describing in enormous detail the annual round of the Court. Special forms of dress for many classes of people on particular occasions are set down; at the name-day dinner for the Emperor or Empress various groups of high officials performed ceremonial \\"dances\\", one group wearing \\"a blue and white garment, with short sleeves, and gold bands, and rings on their ankles. In their hands they hold what are called phengia\\". The second group do just the same, but wearing \\"a garment of green and red, split, with gold bands\\". These colours were the marks of the old chariot racing factions, the four now merged to just the Blues and the Greens, and incorporated into the official hierarchy. Archbishop John Maximovich in 1934, in clerical garb with many Byzantine features Various tactica, treatises on administrative structure, court protocol and precedence, give details of the costumes worn by different office-holders. According to pseudo-Kodinos, the distinctive colour of the Sebastokrator was blue; his ceremonial costume included blue shoes embroidered with eagles on a red field, a red tunic (chlamys), and a diadem (stephanos) in red and gold. As in the Versailles of Louis XIV, elaborate dress and court ritual probably were at least partly an attempt to smother and distract from political tensions. However this ceremonial way of life came under stress as the military crisis deepened, and never revived after the interlude of the Western Emperors following the capture of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204; in the late period a French visitor was shocked to see the Empress riding in the street with fewer attendants and less ceremony than a Queen of France would have had. ==Clerical dress== This is certainly the area in which Roman and Byzantine clothing is nearest to living on, as many forms of habit and vestments still in use (especially in the Eastern, but also in the Western churches) are closely related to their predecessors. Over the period clerical dress went from being merely normal lay dress to a specialized set of garments for different purposes. The bishop in the Ravenna mosaic wears a chasuble very close to what is regarded as the \\"modern\\" Western form of the 20th century, the garment having got much larger, and then contracted, in the meantime. Over his shoulder he wears a simple bishop's omophorion, resembling the clerical pallium of the Latin Church, and a symbol of his position. This later became much larger, and produced various types of similar garments, such as the epitrachelion and orarion, for other ranks of clergy. Modern Orthodox clerical hats are also survivals from the much larger and brightly coloured official headgear of the Byzantine civil service. ==Hair== Men's hair was generally short and neat until the late Empire, and often is shown elegantly curled, probably artificially (picture at top). The 9th century Khludov Psalter has Iconophile illuminations which vilify the last Iconoclast Patriarch, John the Grammarian, caricaturing him with untidy hair sticking straight out in all directions. Monk's hair was long, and most clergy had beards, as did many lay men, especially later. Upper-class women mostly wore their hair up, again very often curled and elaborately shaped. If we are to judge by religious art, and the few depictions of other women outside the court, women probably kept their hair covered in public, especially when married. ==Textiles== Manuscript illumination of Emperor Nicephorus III Botaniates (1078-81) flanked by St John Chrysostomos and the Archangel Michael As in China, there were large Byzantine Imperial workshops, apparently always based in Constantinople, for textiles as for other arts like mosaic. Although there were other important centres, the Imperial workshops led fashion and technical developments and their products were frequently used as diplomatic gifts to other rulers, as well as being distributed to favoured Byzantines. In the late 10th century, the Emperor sent gold and fabrics to a Russian ruler in the hope that this would prevent him attacking the Empire. Most surviving examples were not used for clothes and feature very large woven or embroidered designs. Before the Byzantine Iconoclasm these often contained religious scenes such as Annunciations, often in a number of panels over a large piece of cloth. This naturally stopped during the periods of Iconoclasm and with the exception of church vestments for the most part figural scenes did not reappear afterwards, being replaced by patterns and animal designs. Some examples show very large designs being used for clothing by the great - two enormous embroidered lions killing camels occupy the whole of the Coronation cloak of Roger II in Vienna, produced in Palermo about 1134 in the workshops the Byzantines had established there. A sermon by Saint Asterius of Amasia, from the end of the 5th century, gives details of imagery on the clothes of the rich (which he strongly condemns):Asterius of Amasia Online English translation - near the start > When, therefore, they dress themselves and appear in public, they look like > pictured walls in the eyes of those that meet them. And perhaps even the > children surround them, smiling to one another and pointing out with the > finger the picture on the garment; and walk along after them, following them > for a long time. On these garments are lions and leopards; bears and bulls > and dogs; woods and rocks and hunters; and all attempts to imitate nature by > painting.... But such rich men and women as are more pious, have gathered up > the gospel history and turned it over to the weavers.... You may see the > wedding of Galilee, and the water-pots; the paralytic carrying his bed on > his shoulders; the blind man being healed with the clay; the woman with the > bloody issue, taking hold of the border of the garment; the sinful woman > falling at the feet of Jesus; Lazarus returning to life from the grave.... Both Christian and pagan examples, mostly embroidered panels sewn into plainer cloth, have been preserved in the exceptional conditions of graves in Egypt, although mostly iconic portrait-style images rather than the narrative scenes Asterius describes in his diocese of Amasya in northern Anatolia. The portrait of the Caesar Constantius Gallus in the Chronography of 354 shows several figurative panels on his clothes, mostly round or oval (see gallery). The silk shroud of Charlemagne manufactured in Constantinople c. 814 Early decorated cloth is mostly embroidered in wool on a linen base, and linen is generally more common than cotton throughout the period. Raw Silk yarn was initially imported from China, and the timing and place of the first weaving of it in the Near Eastern world is a matter of controversy, with Egypt, Persia, Syria and Constantinople all being proposed, for dates in the 4th and 5th centuries. Certainly Byzantine textile decoration shows great Persian influence, and very little direct from China. According to legend agents of Justinian I bribed two Buddhist monks from Khotan in about 552 to discover the secret of cultivating silk, although much continued to be imported from China. Resist dyeing was common from the late Roman period for those outside the Court, and woodblock printing dates to at least the 6th century, and possibly earlier - again this would function as a cheaper alternative to the woven and embroidered materials of the rich. Apart from Egyptian burial-cloths, rather fewer cheap fabrics have survived than expensive ones. It should also be remembered that depicting a patterned fabric in paint or mosaic is a very difficult task, often impossible in a small miniature, so the artistic record, which often shows patterned fabrics in large-scale figures in the best quality works, probably under-records the use of patterned cloth overall. ==Gallery== Image:Chronography 354 gallus caesar.pngThe Caesar Constantius Gallus in a later copy of the Chronography of 354, with one of the best surviving indications of what the pictures on clothes described by Asterius looked like.

Claise Brook and Claisebrook Cove are within the suburb. ==Land use== Primarily an industrial area in the early twentieth century, it was the location of the East Perth Gas Works, East Perth Power Station (which was decommissioned and the building is being renovated for other purposes), the East Perth railway yard, and engine sheds. From the early 1980s, virtually all of the residential real estate on the western side of Lord Street became home to commercial enterprises; the buildings remain, either single or duplex dwellings previously inhabited mostly by migrant families. ==Population== In the 2016 Census, there were 10,596 people in East Perth. 30.3% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were England 6.7%, China 4.0%, India 3.7%, Malaysia 3.4% and South Korea 2.9%. 47.6% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 6.6%, Korean 2.7%, Cantonese 2.6%, Portuguese 2.0% and Spanish 1.9%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 33.3% and Catholic 18.4%. ==Cemetery== East Perth is the location of Perth's significant early colonial era cemetery, which contains graves of many early colonial families. Its condition is marginal due to the loss of many headstones and lack of adequate record of graves, only 800 of the estimated 10,000 grave sites have been identified. ==Railway== The former East Perth railway yard and engine sheds were removed in the 1960s and have been redeveloped into the Railway headquarters - consolidating a very scattered system of offices and sections for the railways. East Perth serves as the main hub for country and interstate rail services and Road Coach services. Departing from the station are services such as the Prospector, AvonLink, tourist trains, and the Indian Pacific. The original East Perth railway station is now called Claisebrook, and while it has the same number of platforms that it did in the 1960s, the original buildings have given way to modern shelters. It is also the location of the Goongoongup Bridge on the railway to Bunbury for the South Western Railway. ==Redevelopment Authority== East Perth Redevelopment Authority (EPRA) was established in 1991http://www.mra.wa.gov.au/Documents/Corporate/EPRA-Annual-Reports/EPRA- Annual-Report-2005.pdf to manage the redevelopment and urbanisation of the suburb.http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/23604/20020213-0000/www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/media/archivemedia.nsf/9af6c28061d8b880482569ff002ca12e/7f6588877073a75e48256840003fa9aa02ec.html In EPRA merged with other redevelopment authorities to become the Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority (MRA).http://www.mra.wa.gov.au/ In 2019, the MRA became part of DevelopmentWA. ==Sports== Sporting attractions include the WACA Ground and Gloucester Park trotting ground. == Education == Educational facilities include Trinity College, a day school for boys, years 4–12. ==See also== *Restaurant Amusé ==Notes== ==References== * Bodycoat, Ronald.

It stretches from Dijon in the north to the river Dheune to the south, overlooking the valley of the Saône to the east. The east-facing slope of the Côte d'Or is home to some of the greatest names of Burgundy wine, such as Gevrey-Chambertin, Clos de Vougeot, Meursault and Montrachet. The northern half, the Côte de Nuits, produces red wine almost exclusively. The Côte de Beaune, around Beaune in the south, produces a mix of white wine and red wine. The Route des Grands Crus (Route Nationale 74) runs along the foot of the ridge and is popular with tourists. Scientists have not yet conclusively determined what factors cause the few small parcels of land on the Côte d'Or to produce superlative wines.Hugh Johnson and Jancis Robinson, The World Atlas of Wine 7th ed. Octopus Publishing Group, 2013 p.50 ==History== The area was settled by the Celts, and there is considerable evidence of Roman occupation in the area. Later it came under the influence of the Dukes of Burgundy, with the Cistercians from Cîteaux Abbey playing a prominent role in the development of the vineyards. ==Geology== If the Paris hydrological and geological basin is viewed as a saucer with Paris at its centre, the Côte d'Or may be seen as a segment of its south-eastern rim; the counterpart of the chalk cliffs of the Pays de Caux, on the English Channel coast to the north-west. The River Seine rises near the Côte d'Or and enters the sea near the Pays de Caux, having passed through Paris. The Côte d'Or scarp arises where a broad, relatively shallow graben has formed as a result of an interaction between the forces raising the alpine ridges and the Massif Central. The Jurassic limestone contributes the chemically basic component of the mixture of requirements for a good vineyard, while the scarp provides the drainage and aspect. At the Côte d'Or, the middle and upper Jurassic rocks overlook the Oligocene, Pliocene and Quaternary rocks of the plain through which the Saône flows southward towards the Mediterranean Sea. The côte therefore forms part of the watershed between northern and southern Europe. On the far side of the plain rise the Jura Mountains, for which the Jurassic period was named. The Route des Grands Crus ==Comblanchien stone== Near Nuits-Saint-Georges, part of the middle Jurassic limestone has been metamorphosed into marble. The metamorphism seems to have arisen from the volcanic disturbances in the already existing (Variscan) Massif Central, set off by the Alpine orogeny. The Massif Central is represented locally by its northern extension, the Morvan, which lies between Nevers and the Côte d'Or. There is a famous vein of fine-grained marble called Pierre de Comblanchien extending from the village of Comblanchien, just south of Nuits-Saint-Georges. The quarries lie in the Côte north and south of the village, overlooking Route Nationale 74. The stone comes in a variety of shades, from beige to the pink of bindweed (Convolvulus). It is not susceptible to frost damage and is capable of accepting a polish. ==See also== *Burgundy wine *French wine ==References== ==Further reading== * A bit out of date, and doesn't cover all of Burgundy, but is still the definitive guide.

Baldivis is a semi-rural residential suburb south of Perth, Western AustraliaPerth , and southeast of the regional centre of Rockingham. It is located within the City of Rockingham local government area. Housing estates in the suburb include Tuart Ridge, Settlers Hills, Settlers Townside, The Rivergums, Baldivis Central, Baldivis North, Baldivis Gardens, The Chimes, Brightwood, Evermore Heights, The Ridge, The Chase, Highbury Park, Heritage Park, The Dales, Avalon, Woodleigh Grove, Sherwood and Parkland Heights. ==History== The name of Baldivis was thought up by settlers in the area who were attracted to the region by the 1920s Group Settlement Scheme. The name derives from three ships which travelled to Western Australia in 1922, all within six weeks of each other, bringing settlers under the scheme. They were named BALranald, DIogenes and the JerVIS Bay. It was the maiden voyage for all three ships and they were all built in the same shipyard in the same year. Land parallel to the eastern side of Baldivis Road was set aside for a tramway between Jandakot in the north and Karnup to the south, to provide access to the Group Settlement Scheme land. Although part of the tramway was constructed, it was never constructed in Baldivis. The tramway reserve is retained for open space. Many of the road names in Baldivis (e.g. Sixty Eight Road, Fifty Road, etc.) originate from the group numbers. Land in the western portion of Baldivis was zoned for urban development in the 1990s, and the suburb has been progressively developed for residential. The first residential estate to be developed was Settlers Hills, by Stockland. ==Geography== The western half of Baldivis (generally west of Baldivis Road) is composed of undulating sand and limestone soil with occasional wetlands. The high point is known as Tamworth Hill, which is the site of a water reservoir. Much of this land has been developed for residential use. East of Baldivis Road the land is generally flat and comprises sand and clay soils; the exception being the sandy hill known as Dog Hill. These areas are generally used for rural purposes. The western portion of Baldivis contains tuart trees; some of the trees have been retained within the residential areas. ==Transport== Baldivis is serviced by the Transperth 563 bus route, operated by Transdev WA, which operates from Warnbro Train Station. This route services the Baldivis Town Centre during business hours, travelling through Settlers Hills via Arpenteur Drive through Evermore Heights, The Ridge and Terminate in The Dales (Smirk Road). Route 567 services The Rivergums and Heritage Park. It also connects the Baldivis community with a regular service to the Baldivis Town Centre. Both routes run 7 days a week running every 30 minutes and every 10 minutes in peak hours. Route 568 services Baldivis Central and the newly developed Town Side estate and Retirement village. Route 565 services through newly established Baldivis Quarter. The Kwinana Freeway runs through Baldivis, providing vehicle access to Perth and Bunbury. Safety Bay Road links Baldivis with neighbouring suburbs to the west like Rockingham and Warnbro. The principal shared path along the Kwinana Freeway provides bicycle access to Perth. ==Facilities== There is plenty for Residents to enjoy within Baldivis. *Fifty Road Recreation Centre and Sporting Grounds which are home to the Baldivis Brumbies, Baldivis Scouts and the Annual Baldivis Fair. * The Mary Davies Library and Community Centre was opened in 2014 and is home to many associations, clubs, dance groups, lessons and community groups for meetings and events. *The Volunteer Bush Fire Brigade building is situated on Eighty Road. *There is a bike pump park at the Rivergums estate. *The Tramway reserve is a protected walkway spanning the length of Baldivis *The Baldivis Children's forest is located on Mandurah Road ===Education=== There are ten schools in Baldivis, with more opening in the near future: * Baldivis Primary School, a government school which first opened in 1924 as a \\"bush school\\", and moved to its present location in Fifty Road in 1978.

Salad burnet is a perennial herbaceous plant growing to 40–90 cm tall, typically found in dry grassy meadows, often on limestone soils. It is drought-tolerant, and grows all year around (remains evergreen in cooler temperatures). Salad Burnet also has a respectable history, called a favorite herb by Francis Bacon, and was brought to the New World with the first English colonists, even getting special mention by Thomas Jefferson. == Usage == === Culinary === Young burnet leaves are used as an ingredient in both summer drinks, salads, dressings, and sauces having a flavor described as \\"mildly cucumber, a bit tart, a little hot\\" and is considered interchangeable with mint leaves in some recipes, depending on the intended effect.

Since the 1980s, New Formalists have argued that American poetry needs to return to rhyme, regular rhythm, and the telling of non-autobiographical stories. Otherwise, they say, poetry will never again have the readership still enjoyed by novels and creative nonfiction or regain the vital role poetry once played in American culture. New Formalism has always consisted of poets from many different racial and ethnic backgrounds, religious and political beliefs, lifestyle choices, and sexual orientations. However, mainstream literary critics during the 1980s, many of whom were college and university professors, chose to oversimplify the debate by alleging that it was a battle in America's culture wars. Poets who taught in the universities and wrote free verse and Confessional poetry were stereotyped as socially progressive, as New Left Marxists, and as adherents of the 1960s Counterculture. New Formalist poets, on the other hand, were stereotyped as rich White Anglo-Saxon Protestant Anglophiles filled with nostalgia for the British Empire, as Gordon Gekko- style yuppie capitalists, and as socially conservative supporters of U.S. President Ronald Reagan. American poetry in traditional verse forms was, according to poets and critics who believed in \\"The Free Verse Revolution\\", reactionary, Eurocentric, un-American, White Supremacist, and even Fascist. In response, New Formalist poets and critics pointed out the instrumental role played in the Free Verse Revolution by American poet Ezra Pound, an avowed anti-Semite who collaborated with Fascist Italy during World War II and who compared Adolf Hitler to Joan of Arc. Other New Formalists poets and critics accused those intolerant of Formal verse of seeking to impose \\"Cultural Fascism\\" upon American literature. In 1986, Michigan State University professor Diane Wakoski denounced New Formalism in print as socially conservative and therefore boring and evil. In the same article, Wakoski compared old Formalist poet John Hollander to Satan. In response, Dana Gioia compared Wakoski's denunciation of Formal poetry to the search for a purely Aryan culture by Nazi Party Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. Gioia further suggested \\"the radical notion\\" that American poetry consists of whatever poetry the American people are composing. Decades later, The Poetry Wars between poets and critics from both literary movements are still raging in literary journals, in colleges and universities, and on the internet to this day. However,the West Chester Poetry Conference, which was founded in 1995 by Dana Gioia, Michael Peich, and Richard Wilbur, has taught the traditional craft of poetry to multiple generations of younger New Formalists. Although the New Formalists have often been accused of opposing innovation, due to classes taught at the West Chester Conference by Dominican-American poet Rhina Espaillat, verse forms from Spanish and Latin American poetry, like the Décima and the ovillejo, have become very, very popular among younger New Formalists writing in English. Furthermore, despite the claim that New Formalism is Eurocentric and White Supremacist, A.E. Stallings wrote in a 2010 essay that African-American poet Erica Dawson has achieved \\"something like rock star status\\" among both writers and fans of New Formalist poetry. By 2006, Robert McPhillips felt able to write, \\"The New Formalists have become firmly established in the canon of contemporary American literature.Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction: Expanded Edition, Textos Books. Page xiii. McPhillips continued, \\"The New Formalism remains for me a generational movement concerned with purifying poetic diction without ridding it of its inherent lyricism and rendering it more prosaic. By championing a shift back to form, the New Formalists have returned poetry to that wide audience of readers that had abandoned free-verse poetry because it had failed to mirror and trigger their deepest human sympathies.\\"Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, Textos Books. Page xv. ==Background== According to Gerry Cambridge, \\"Free verse's dominance had been in part a reaction by poets such as Robert Bly, Adrienne Rich, Robert Lowell, John Berryman, and James Wright to the New Criticism favored in the universities in the 1940s and '50s, which promulgated 'difficult, labored' poems. After serving an apprenticeship in form, many such writers turned to free verse. In statements accompanying their poems in the influential anthology Naked Poetry: Recent American Poetry in Open Forms (1969), younger poets such as Denise Levertov, Allen Ginsberg, Robert Bly, and Gary Snyder for the most part studiously avoided questions of technique, instead focusing on an aesthetic of sensibility. When, in their turn, they entered the academy as professors, as critic Keith Maillard has pointed out, they brought these predilections with them. The cultural upheavals of the Vietnam War era, with its suspicion of government and centralized power, were ripe for the growth of an aesthetic which favored free verse and a subjective 'I' that rebelled against the New Critical orthodoxy still in vogue in the academy.\\"Jay Parini (2004), Oxford Encyclopedia of American Literature, Volume 3, page 251. According to William Baer, \\"Despite the fact that a number of distinguished poets - like Howard Nemerov, Richard Wilbur, Anthony Hecht, and James Merrill - continued to write and publish formal poetry, the dominant trend in the late 1950s, the 1960s, and the 1970s was for short, free verse lyrics, often autobiographical. The emergence of various groups like the Beats, the Black Mountain poets, the New York School, the Deep Imagists, and others encouraged this trend, as did the fact that free verse quickly became the lingua franca of the newly forming creative writing programs in the American universities.\\"William Baer (2006), Writing Metrical Poetry: Contemporary Lessons for Mastering Traditional Forms, Writer's Digest Books. Page 236. From the mid-1950s into the 1960s, there was also a surge of interest in confessional poetry, which has been described as poetry of the subjective I. The school also advocates focusing on extreme moments of personal experience and trauma, including graphic descriptions of previously taboo subjects such as mental illness, abusive relationships, sex acts, and suicide.Ousby 1998, pp 89 In response to this new literary movement, formal and non-autobiographical poetry became even more unfashionable. Meanwhile, attacks by free verse and confessional poets against Formalists like Nemerov, Wilbur, Turco, and Hecht grew ever lounder. According to Baer, \\"...both meter and rhyme were considered, at best, an outdated aspect of the literary past, or, much worse, a debilitated form of bourgeois or capitalist control. Occasionally, these attacks at their worst and most shrill, even descended into fantastic charges that formal poetry was actually fascist (as William Carlos Williams once delineated the sonnet)...\\"William Baer (2006), Writing Metrical Poetry: Contemporary Lessons for Mastering Traditional Forms, Writer's Digest Books. Pages 236-237. ==1960s and 1970s== According to William Baer, \\"Despite this environment, various younger poets of the baby boom generation, often in isolation, began writing in meter, forms, and rhymes.\\" Many of the most influential poets were, according to Baer, university students being taught and encouraged by Yvor Winters at Stanford University, by Donald Stanford at Louisiana State University, and by Robert Fitzgerald at Harvard University. There was, however, \\"no true center for the gradually reviving Formalism, as many poets in various parts of the country began experimenting with meter and rhyme.\\"William Baer (2006), Writing Metrical Poetry: Contemporary Lessons for Mastering Traditional Forms, Writer's Digest Books. Page 237. An early sign, however, of continued interest in traditional verse forms was the publication of Lewis Turco's The Book of Forms: A Handbook of Poetics in 1968.The Book of Forms: A Handbook of Poetics E. P. Dutton & Company, New York, 1968. A few years later Turco published a college textbook which presented poetry from the writer's perspective and emphasized the use of formal elements, this was Poetry: An Introduction through Writing, Reston Publishing Co, 1973. One of the first battles of The Poetry Wars came in 1971, when Argentine author, essayist, and poet Jorge Luis Borges, Norman Thomas di Giovanni, and Frank MacShane presided over a series of recorded seminars about Borges' writings at Columbia University.Norman Thomas di Giovanni and Frank MacShane (1973), Borges on Writing, The Echo Press. Pages 5-11. When the seminar turned into a discussion about poetry, Borges, whose own poems were both in fixed forms and in free verse, said, \\"I think young poets are apt to begin with that is really the most difficult - free verse. This is a very great mistake. I'll fall back on what the Argentine poet Leopoldo Lugones said way back in 1909 in a book that is still revolutionary - Lunario sentimental. In the forward, he wrote that he was attempting experiments in verse - that he was trying his hand at the invention of new meters and at new combinations of the 'old time' meters, such as eight-syllable verse, eleven-syllable verse, fourteen-syllable verse, and so on. He knew that what he was attempting was rash and very probably a failure, but he wanted to remind his readers that he had already demonstrated that he could handle the classical forms of verse. He added that one can't start by being a revolutionary, but in his case he felt that he had earned the right to experiment, since he had published several volumes of good poetry, or at least tolerable classic verse. I think this is an honest statement...\\"Norman Thomas di Giovanni and Frank MacShane (1973), Borges on Writing, The Echo Press. Pages 69-70. Borges' words triggered a debate between him and the students attending the seminar. One student asked, \\"As for writing in set forms, don't you think it depends on the kind of poetry you grew up on? For example, I can't imagine writing sonnets or rhyming couplets.\\"Norman Thomas di Giovanni and Frank MacShane (1973), Borges on Writing, The Echo Press. Page 74. Borges replied, \\"I am very sorry. But I think it is strange that you should be so little curious about the past. If you are writing in English, you are following a tradition. The language itself is a tradition. Why not follow that long and illustrious tradition of sonnet writers, for example? I find it very strange to ignore form. After all, there are not many poets who write good free verse, but there are many other writers who have mastered the other forms. Even Cummings wrote many fine sonnets - I know some of them by heart. I don't think you can possibly discard all of the past. If you do, you run the risk of discovering things that have already been discovered. Aren't you curious about the past? Aren't you curious about your fellow poets in this century? And in the last century? And in the eighteenth century? Doesn't John Donne mean anything to you? Or Milton? I can't really even begin to answer your question.\\"Norman Thomas di Giovanni and Frank MacShane (1973), Borges on Writing, The Echo Press. Pages 74-75. The student replied, \\"One can read the poets of the past and interpret what is learned into free verse.\\"Norman Thomas di Giovanni and Frank MacShane (1973), Borges on Writing, The Echo Press. Page 75. Borges responded, \\"What I fail to understand is why you should begin by attempting something which is so difficult, such as free verse.\\" The transcript was later published, along with that of all three seminars, in book form. In 1972 essay, Borges was echoed by American poet Richard Wilbur, who wrote, \\"A good poem is a good poem, whatever its technical means, and I cheerfully grant that much of the best work of recent years has been done in free forms. It does seem about time, however, to abandon the notion that free verse is daring and progressive, that it is peculiarly suited to conveying present-day experience, and that 'experiment' must consist of the abandonment of disciplines.\\"Robert Bagg and Mary Bagg (2017), Let Us Watch Richard Wilbur: A Biographical Study, University of Massachusetts Press. Page 198. According to William Baer, \\"So where does the revival begin? People can debate this endlessly. It's certainly significant that Rachel Hadas' first chapbook, Starting from Troy, was published by Godine in 1975; Charles Martin's first book, Room for Error, was published in 1978; and Timothy Steele's first collection, Uncertainties at Rest, appeared the following year.\\" In 1977 an issue of Mississippi Review was published, which was entitled Freedom and Form: American Poets Respond. Accord to Gerry Cambridge, \\"New Formalism began in the late 1970s and early 1980s as an informal grouping of younger writers dissatisfied with the prevailing poetry orthodoxy in the academy. No doubt they felt limited and constrained by an aesthetic there which focused on a subjective confessional 'I', usually in free verse,and as young poets of any curiosity at all are likely to, they began looking for other models. They found them particularly in the work of poets such as Robert Frost, Robinson Jeffers, and X.J. Kennedy, writers of wide import who had either kept faith with meter and rhyme or, in Jeffers' case, told stories. These young poets, who included Frederick Turner, Frederick Feirstein, Dana Gioia, Mark Jarman, and Robert McDowell also grew increasingly aware that poetry had lost its common audience.\\"Jay Parini (2004), The Oxford Encyclopedia of American Literature, Volume 3, page 251. ==The 1980s== The 1980s were, according to Baer, \\"the decade of formation for the Formalist revival\\". Between 1979 and 1983, Frederick Turner and Ronald Sharp served as editors of The Kenyon Review, where they published both the poems and the essays of the new generation of Formalist poets. In January 1983, Brad Leithauser published the essay Metrical Illiteracy in The New Criterion.\\"William Baer (2006), Writing Metrical Poetry: Contemporary Lessons for Mastering Traditional Forms, Writer's Digest Books. Page 238. In 1980 Mark Jarman and Robert McDowell started the small magazine The Reaper to promote narrative and formal poetry. In 1981 Jane Greer launched Plains Poetry Journal, which published new work in traditional forms. In 1984 McDowell started Story Line Press which has since published some New Formalist poets. The Reaper ran for ten years. Also during the early 1980s, Dana Gioia, a Sicilian- and Mexican-American poet who had grown up in a working class neighborhood in Hawthorne, California, first began to attract attention with appearances in The Hudson Review, Poetry, and The New Yorker. He also published essays and book reviews. Gioia's poetry and prose helped to establish him as one of the leading New Formalists. Meanwhile, the new literary movement in American poetry began to at last attract the attention of mainstream critics. By 1983, Neoformalism was noted in the annual poetry roundups in the yearbooks of The Dictionary of Literary Biography,The Year in Poetry was contributed by Lewis Turco from 1983 to 1986. and throughout the mid-1980s heated debates on the topic of free verse vs. formalism appeared in several literary journals.for example, see Salmagundi 65 (1984) with Mary Kinzie's piece \\"The Rhapsodic Fallacy,\\" (pages 63 - 79) and various responses; Alan Shapiro's piece \\"The New Formalism,\\" in Critical Inquiry 14.1 (1987) pages 200 - 13; and David Wojahn's \\"'Yes, But ...': Some Thoughts on the New Formalism,\\" in Crazyhorse 32 (1987) pages 64 - 81. The term New Formalism was first used in Ariel Dawson's article The Yuppie Poet in the May 1985 issue of the AWP Newsletter,Thompson, Nigel S., 'Form and Function,' P. N. Review, 154; the Associated Writing Programs article was written by Ariel Dawson which was an attack against the growing trend of returning to traditional verse forms.Lake, Paul, 'Expansive Poetry in the New Millennium', a talk delivered at the West Chester Poetry Conference on 10 June 1999. According to Gerry Cambridge, \\"Dawson's polemic conflated the increasing prevalence of Formalism with lifestyle, with 'the glorification of competitiveness and the compulsion to acquire,' possessed, she asserted, by 'the yuppie poet.' She also accused New Formalism simply of being old Formalism, as practiced by Anthony Hecht and Richard Wilbur, rehashed. Bizarrely, she opposed a concern with technique against 'artistic integrity.' Apparently, she judged them to be enemies of each other rather than complimentary.\\"Jay Parini (2004), The Oxford Encyclopedia of American Literature, Volume 3, page 252. Also in 1985, Anglo- African poet Frederick Turner and German psychologist and neuroscientist Ernst Pöppel published the award-winning essay The Neural Lyre: Poetic Meter, the Brain, and Time in the magazine Poetry. The essay discussed, according to William Baer, how, \\"modern science has discovered that regular rhythm actually induces the brain to release pleasure-creating endorphins.\\"William Baer (2016) Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 192. According to Turner, his interest in the subject began when he joined the International Society for the Study of Time. Turner recalled, \\"Why do we find things beautiful? Why do we have the capacity to experience beauty? And why is this phenomenon so pan-cultural? Once we had the facts at our disposal, it was impossible to entertain any of these post-structuralist notions that such human forms and conventions are simply closed systems and culturally unique. In fact, it was clear that human aesthetic rose from human biology. Anyway, this subgroup got a grant from the Werner-Reimers-Stiftung, and we were able to involve even more interesting people from other disciplines ranging from physics to anthropology to music. So we began meeting over a nine-year period, and that was where our ideas about the neural lyre initiated.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, pages 192-193. Of his work with Ernst Pöppel, who worked for the Max Planck Institute in Munich, West Germany, Turner said, \\"Now Ernst had already been a member of the time society, so we'd known each other for quite a while, and we used to hang out in the bar and talk about all sorts of things. At the same time, I'd already embarked on a serious study of world meter, and I'd noticed that all human societies had poetry, that it was always divided into lines, and that, even in pre-literate societies, all the lines were about three seconds long. Ernst had similarly noticed that humans have a three second cycle in which we hear and understand language... So there was clearly some kind of three-second phenomenon going on. Then we hooked up with a group of bio-genetic structuralists who'd been studying, for instance, the neurophysiology of ritual chants, and we'd examined the effects of ritual chanting and learned that ritual chanting produces significant changes in the brain waves, so we started to put a lot of things together, and we wrote that essay.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 193. In 1986, Diane Wakoski, a poet, literary critic, and professor at Michigan State University, published the essay The New Conservatism in American Poetry. The essay was provoked when Wakoski attended a Modern Language Association conference in which old Formalist John Hollander spoke critically, according to Robert McPhillips, of college and university, \\"creative writing programs and the general slackness of most free verse.\\" Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, pages 3-4. In what Gerry Cambridge has called, \\"a rambling and confused attack,\\" Wakoski said of Hollander's remarks, \\"I thought that I heard the Devil speaking to me.\\" Hollander was, Wakoski alleged, \\"a man full of spite, from lack of recognition and thinly disguised anger... who was frustrated and petty from that frustration,\\" as he was, \\"denouncing the free verse revolution, denouncing the poetry which is the fulfillment of the Whitman heritage, making defensive jokes about the ill- educated, slovenly writers of poetry who have been teaching college poetry classes for the past decade, allowing their students to write drivel and go out into the world, illiterate of poetry.\\"Diane Wakoski, The New Conservatism in American Poetry, The American Book Review, May–June 1986. Wakoski then turned her attack against the younger poets, whom she called, \\"really the spokesmen for the new conservatism,\\" which she called an unfortunate continuation of the legacies of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, T.S. Eliot, and Robert Frost. Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, pages 3-4. Wakoski further called these younger poets, \\"a new kind of 'il-literati' espousing tradition. They are the ones who don't have a classical education, who don't read Latin and Greek poetry, who don't really know much about traditional metrical verse and who undoubtedly don't have the celestial ears of an Auden or a Wilbur, and they are the ones who preach metrics in old-fashioned ways, often being interested in form, whatever that is, for the sake of form.\\" Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, page 4. Wakoski also called Robert Pinsky, a nice man, but, \\"not one of the searchers for a new American voice.\\" She also praised tenured free verse poets as, \\"guerrilla fighters in the universities.\\" Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, page 4. According to Robert McPhillips, \\"Wakoski's critique of these poets is less aesthetic than it is political. She actually believes that those who use traditional forms could only be supporters of Reagan's conservative agenda. But her overtly moral denunciation and generalized invective marked a turning point in contemporary poetics. Her excesses created a backlash from writers and critics who were more disinterested in their reading of the poets Wakoski so zealously condemned. As a result of the public controversy, some poets began to see themselves as part of the loose movement that would be identified as the New Formalism.\\" Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, pages 4-5. Accord to Gerry Cambridge, \\"This attack generated five responses, from Robert Mezey, Lewis Turco, David Radavich, Brian Richards, and Dana Gioia. Most of them denied any necessary link between aesthetic and politics, in particular between form and conservatism, citing Ezra Pound as an example of a Fascist who wrote free verse. They also criticized as a kind of cultural fascism Wakoski's intolerance of literary pluralism, paradoxically in the guise of a democratic Whitmanism that declared form to be un-American. Gioia compared her tone and content to 'the quest for pure Germanic culture led by the late Joseph Goebbels.' He entertainingly suggested 'the radical notion' that whatever poetry was written by Americans constituted American poetry. Wakoski's polemic and these responses were the first public controversy about the young movement.\\" In a 2007 essay, poet James Matthew Wilson commented on how Wakoski's accusations had continued to be repeated by her many, many successors, \\"Largely because of Diane Wakoski's unfounded imbecilities two decades ago in The New Conservatism in American Poetry, the New Formalism has been constantly harangued with being regressive, un-American, unpatriotic, etc., etc. While I am sure and pleased that, in a profound sense, New Formalism is Conservative, it certainly had nothing to do with any American political movement. While I grow almost misty eyed to hear a modern poet concerned with the love of country, I suspect Wakoski's piety is at best opportunistic. She, and those like Byers who followed in her wake, relies on crude television caricatures of the Eisenhower era in order to conclude that the New Formalism is Conservative, therefore boring, therefore something we need not read for ourselves. She goes further. Radicalism, by which she means simply non-metrical poems, gets strangely confused and celebrated along with the patriotic vision of Walt Whitman. It is astonishing to hear Leftists wield that supposed last refuge of villains, patriotism, as a weapon to attack rhymes and prop up an otherwise flaccid free verse - or rather, to undermine the reputation of a few poets who like the sound words make when their syllables resonate. I think Wakoski asked too much of us for the sake of our country, really. Why must we give up even the most humble or trivial sonnet for most free verse, when odds are that it will be a better work of art - will have better attained to 'the perfection of things made?' Does this advance Manifest Destiny? Is it meter that stands in the way of the mystic chords of democracy? Do villanelles threaten the Union, or sonnets restore us to Her Majesty's Empire?\\" James Matthew Wilson (2016), The Fortunes of Poetry in an Age of Unmaking, Wiseblood Books. Pages 95-96. Also in 1986, Daily Horoscope, Gioia's first poetry collection, was published. Its contents range widely in form, length and theme. Among its more notable—and widely reprinted—pieces are California Hills in August, In Cheever Country, and The Sunday News. That same year, Robert McPhillips witnessed a debate between Dana Gioia and John Hollander over, \\"whether poetry was initially an oral or a written art.\\" Gioia argued that poetry was originally oral, while Hollander argued that it was originally written.Robert McPhillips (2005), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction: Expanded Edition, Textos Books. Page xi. McPhillips later recalled, \\"In retrospect, I realize that I heard on that occasion part of what was to become a tenet of the New Formalism often articulated by Gioia: that poetry was first and foremost an oral form and rhyme and meter central elements of oral poetry; that these virtues were considered outmoded by a generation of free verse poets; and that these were poetic virtues that - along with narrative - Gioia and others of his generation saw as vital elements necessary to be restored to poetry if it hoped to reestablish something like the mainstream audience still enjoyed by serious writers of fiction like Oates, John Updike, Philip Roth, Toni Morrison, and Jane Smiley.\\" Intrigued both by the debate and by the sense of pleasure he had experienced reading the New Formalist poetry of Gioia and Vikram Seth, McPhillips began to research the growing controversy between Free Verse and New Formalist poets.Robert McPhillips (2005), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction: Expanded Edition, Textos Books. Page xi-xii. He later wrote, \\"When I first decided to write about the New Formalists, I discovered that there were essentially two schools of thought concerning them. One school consisted of the tenured free-verse poets of the nation's numerous writing programs who viewed the emergence of New Formalism as a politically conservative rejection of their 'democratic' mode, the other younger poets who were banding together with narrative poets to form a literary movement they described as 'Expansive Poetry'. What both groups had in common was that they were made up almost exclusively of poets; and they tended to talk in broad generalisations about what they perceived to be the strengths and weaknesses in each poetic aesthetic while seldom candidly assessing the relative virtues or flaws of the individual younger poets writing rhymed and metered poetry in the 1980s.\\"Robert McPhillips (2005), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction: Expanded Edition, Textos Books. Page xii. 1986 also saw the publication of outspoken Atheist and LGBT Anglo-Indian poet Vikram Seth's The Golden Gate, which is both a sonnet sequence and a novel in verse. Seth's main model for the novel was Eugene Onegin, by Afro-Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. Despite the accusation that New Formalism was Anglophile, Racist, and Neo- Coloniallist, The Golden Gate, had a major effect on the New Formalist Movement. The anthology Strong Measures: Contemporary American Poetry in Traditional Forms was published that same year.Strong Measures: Contemporary American Poetry in Traditional Forms edited by Philip Dacey and David Jauss In his influential 1987 essay Notes on the New Formalism, Gioia wrote: \\"Literature not only changes; it must change to keep its force and vitality. There will always be groups advocating new types of poetry, some of it genuine, just as there will always be conservative opposing forces trying to maintain the conventional methods. But the revival of rhyme and meter among some young poets creates an unprecedented situation in American poetry. The New Formalists put the free-verse poets in the ironic and unprepared position of being the status quo. Free verse, the creation of an older literary revolution, is now the long-established, ruling orthodoxy, formal poetry the unexpected challenge... Form, we are told authoritatively, is artificial, elitist, retrogressive, right-wing, and (my favorite) Un-American. None of these arguments can withstand critical scrutiny, but nevertheless, they continue to be made so regularly that one can only assume that they provide some emotional comfort to their advocates. Obviously, for many writers the discussion between formal and free-verse has become an encoded political debate.\\"Dana Gioia (2002), Can Poetry Matter? Essays on Poetry and American Culture, Graywolf Press, Saint Paul, Minnesota. Pages 29-30. Frederick Feirstein's Expansive Poetry (1989) gathered various essays on the New Formalism and the related movement New Narrative, under the umbrella term 'Expansive Poetry'. According to William Baer, \\"In 1989, I established a small poetry journal, The Formalist, as an outlet for younger Formalist poets who were still having difficulties getting published in most of the mainstream literary journals. I fully expected the journal to run for an issue or two, but things turned out quite differently, and The Formalist lasted fifteen years.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page x. ==The 1990s== In 1990, the first issue of The Formalist appeared, which contained poems by, among others, Howard Nemerov, Richard Wilbur, and Donald Justice.http://theformalist.evansville.edu/backissueorders.htmlhttp://theformalist.evansville.edu/current.htm Also in 1990, Ira Sadoff published the essay Neo-Formalism: A Dangerous Nostalgia in the American Poetry Review. In the essay, Sadoff alleged that the New Formalists' preference for Iambic poetry exposes, \\"their attempt to privilege White Anglo-Saxon rhythms and culture.\\" To bolster this, Sadoff commented that Afro-Saint Lucian poet Derek Walcott was the only non-White New Formalist included in a recent anthology. Sadoff further alleged that the New Formalists, \\"want to restore art to the nostalgic view of fixed ideals,\\" and that they, \\"uphold the values of a decaying imperial culture.\\"Ira Sadoff: Neo- Formalism: A Dangerous Nostalgia, The American Poetry Review, January/February 1990. In 1991, Dana Gioia published the influential essay, Can Poetry Matter? in the April issue of Atlantic Monthly. In the essay, Gioia argued that American poetry had become imprisoned in college and university creative writing programs and was no longer being read or studied by the vast majority of the American people. He alleged that, to say that a living poet was well- known, meant merely that he or she was well known to other poets, who were generally professors and graduate students. He further wrote that poetry was no longer a fruit of Literary Bohemia, but of academic bureaucracy.Dana Gioia (2002), Can Poetry Matter? Essays on Poetry and American Culture, Graywolf Press. Pages 1-20. Gioia concluded with the words, \\"The history of art tells the same story over and over. As art forms develop, they establish forms that guide creation, performance, instruction, and analysis. But, eventually, these conventions grow stale. They begin to stand between the art and its audience. Although much wonderful poetry is being written, the American poetry establishment is locked into a series of outmoded conventions - outmoded ways of presenting, dissecting, and teaching poetry. Educational institutions have codified them into a stifling bureaucratic etiquette that enervates the art. These conventions may once have made sense, but today they imprison poetry in an intellectual ghetto. It is time to experiment, time to leave the well- ordered but stuffy classroom, time to restore a vulgar vitality to poetry and unleash the energy now trapped in the subculture. There is nothing to lose. Society has already told us that poetry is dead. Let's build a funeral pyre out of the dessicated conventions piled around us and watch the unkillable Phoenix rise from the ashes.\\"Dana Gioia (2002), Can Poetry Matter? Essays on Poetry and American Culture, Graywolf Press. Pages 20-21. Writing in 2002, Gioia recalled, \\"When the original essay appeared in the April 1991 issue of Atlantic Monthly, the editors warned me to expect angry letters from interested parties. When the hate mail arrived typed on the letterheads of University writing programs, no one was surprised. What astonished the Atlantic editors, however, was the sheer size and intensity of the response. Can Poetry Matter? eventually generated more mail than any article the Atlantic had published in decades. The letters arrived in three familiar varieties - favorable, unfavorable, and incomprehensible. What was unusual was that they were overwhelmingly positive. Hundreds of people wrote - often at great length - to express their agreement, frequently adding that the article had not gone far enough in criticizing certain trends on contemporary poetry. The responses came from a great cross section of readers - teachers, soldiers, lawyers, librarians, nuns, diplomats, housewives, business executives, ranchers, and reporters - mostly people who were not then normally heard in the poetry world. As their testimonies demonstrated, they cared passionately for the art but felt isolated and disenfranchised from the official academic culture of poetry. An outsider myself, who worked in an office during the day and wrote at night, I felt a deep kinship with their situation. I probably learned more from those readers than they learned from me. Their comments provided clear and candid insight on the place poetry still occupied in the lives of many Americans. For me, the response to Can Poetry Matter? will always reside in those individual letters, which have never entirely stopped coming.\\"Dana Gioia (2002), Can Poetry Matter? Essays on Poetry and American Culture, Graywolf Press. Pages xi-xii. Of his work as editor of The Formalist, William Baer recalls, \\"In 1993, I began conducting interviews for the journal with the senior poets most admired by the younger formalist poets. The first poet interviewed was Richard Wilbur, and that interview was followed by conversations with Derek Walcott, Maxine Kumin, Anthony Hecht, and many others. In 2004, University Press of Mississippi collected these earlier interviews with the senior poets into a book entitled Fourteen on Form: Conversations with Poets.\\" In 1994, Feminist poet Annie Finch argued against the idea that New Formalism is not open to poets with other political viewpoints. In the Introduction to A Formal Feeling Comes: Poems in Form by Contemporary Women, Finch wrote, \\"Readers who have been following the discussion of the 'New Formalism' over the last decade may not expect to find such a diversity of writers and themes in a book of formal poems; the poems collected here contradict the popular assumption that formal poetics correspond to reactionary politics and elitist aesthetics ...R.S. Gwynn (1999), New Expansive Poetry, page 167. The passion for form unites these many and diverse poets. As Marilyn Hacker writes, 'When I see a young (or not so young) writer counting syllables on her fingers, or marking stresses for a poem she's writing, or one she's reading, I'm pretty sure we'll have something in common, whatever our other differences may be.'\\"R.S. Gwynn (1999), New Expansive Poetry, pages 169170. In the same collection, Dominican-American poet and fellow feminist Julia Alvarez wrote, \\"Sometimes I get in a mood. I tell myself I am taken over. I am writing under somebody else's thumb and tongue. See, English was not my first language. It was, in fact, a colonizing language to my Spanish Caribbean. But then, Spanish was also a colonizer's language; after all, Spain colonized Quisqueya. There's no getting free. We are always writing in a form imposed on us. But then, I'm Scheherazade in the Sultan's room. I use structures to survive and triumph! To say what is important to me as a Latina. I think of form as a territory that has been colonized but that you can free. See, I feel subversive in formal verse. A voice is going to inhabit that form that was barred from entering it before!\\"R.S. Gwynn (1999), New Expansive Poetry, pages 171. Lesbian poet Marilyn Hacker's contribution to the same book said, \\"The choice and use of a fixed or structured form whether I learned it or invented it - has always been, for me, one of the primary pleasures of writing poetry. I have no political or aesthetic rationale for it except that I like it.\\"R.S. Gwynn (1999), New Expansive Poetry, page 177. Also in 1994, poet Peter Russell wrote, \\"The naiveté of even graduate students is borne out by the report of a U.S. Creative Writing professor who States that none of his students had even hear of Neruda (Prof. Quincy Troupe, Poets and Writers, Feb. 1992, p. 3). The imputation of ignorance to the young is no mere reactionary or blimpish humbug of an ancient; it is a fact. Last month a more or less educated German political journalist of forty or so came to interview me for a Hamburg newspaper. It quickly transpired that he had never even heard the name of Ezra Pound. Unbelievable, but true.\\"Peter Russell (1994), Dana Gioia and the New Formalism, in The Edge City Review #2 (Reston, Virginia). Pages 13-14. Russell continued, \\"It seems to me that now, in the '90s, we are living in the degeneracy of the modernist movement. To call it the Post-Modernist period solves no problem - it merely poses new enigmas. Post-Modernism as a specific movement is interesting in its way, but unlike structuralist semiotics, it is no more than a mish-mash of many fashionable ideas loosely held in common by a closely knit group of operators. Modernism itself, starting with Whitman in the U.S.A. and Rimbaud and Mallarmé in Europe, seems in retrospect, to have got underway by its abolition of genre, or at least its merging of genres. Five or six generations later, in the fall of modernism we find ourselves in the rank proliferation of every imaginable kind of poetry but without any recognizable hierarchy of genres or styles. This makes it exceedingly difficult for today's poets - and there are plenty of 'interesting' poets even if there are no truly major ones - to orient themselves and to clarify for their all too confused readers, just where they are and where they stand.\\"Peter Russell (1994), Dana Gioia and the New Formalism, in The Edge City Review #2 (Reston, Virginia). Page 14. Since 1995, West Chester University has held an annual poetry conference with a special focus on formal poetry and New Formalism. In an interview with William Baer, Dana Gioia recalled how he and fellow poet Michael Peich came up with the idea for the conference. They were having dinner at the home of Gioia's parents in Sebastopol, California, when they both realized, \\"that although there were, at that time, over 2,000 writers' conferences in the United States - several of which I was involved in - there was not a single place where. a young writer could go to learn the traditional craft of poetry in any systematic way. Having just finished a bottle of Pinot Noir, it occurred to us that it would be a wonderful thing to start such a conference. So we did, even though we had no budget, no staff, and no other visible means of support. \\"We drew up what we thought would be a model curriculum - classes in meter, the sonnet, the French Forms, narrative poetry, etc. - and next to each subject, we put the name of the person we thought would be the best younger poet to teach that course. We felt that it was important that these techniques be taught as living traditions by younger writers who were actively using them. We also wanted to honor our elders, and so we decided to recognize, as keynote speaker, some writer who we felt confident had an enduring place in the canon of American letters. We invited Richard Wilbur to be our first keynote speaker. We had no money to pay our faculty, so I called each of them up to explain why it was important that we all do this, and everyone said, 'yes.' \\"Initially, we thought that the conference would probably be a one time only thing, but when it was over, nobody went home. People stuck around because they'd enjoyed themselves so much, and we realized that we should do it again.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, pages 57-58. Since 1995, the West Chester Conference has expanded its classes to included such subjects as blank verse and dramatic monologue.William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 58. Rhina Espaillat, a Dominican-American poet of mixed Afro-Dominican, Spanish, French, and Arawak descent, attended the first conference and later recalled, \\"I was the only Hispanic there, but I realized that these people were open to everything, that their one interest was the craft. If you could bring something from another culture, they were open to it.\\"Nancy Kang and Silvio Torres-Saillant (2018), The Once and Future Muse: The Poetry and Poetics of Rhina P. Espaillat University of Pittsburgh Press. Pages 83-84. Espaillat subsequently took charge of, \\"teaching the French Forms and the forms of repetition,\\" but also made sure to teach classes in, \\"the Spanish and Hispanic examples of the forms\\" such as the décima and the ovillejo.\\" Due to Espaillat's teaching and encouragement, the ovillejo, particularly, has become very popular among younger New Formalists writing in English. While being interviewed for a book about her life, Espaillat gleefully commented, \\"On the internet and in the stratosphere, everybody loves it.\\"Nancy Kang and Silvio Torres-Saillant (2018), The Once and Future Muse: The Poetry and Poetics of Rhina P. Espaillat University of Pittsburgh Press. Pages 84-85. Every year at the West Chester University Poetry Conference, the Robert Fitzgerald Prosody Award is awarded, \\"for a lifetime contribution to the study of versification and prosody.\\" In 1999, Story Line Press published the anthology, New Expansive Poetry: Theory, Criticism, History, which was edited by R.S. Gwynn. It included Dana Gioia's Notes on the New Formalism,R.S. Gwynn (1999), New Expansive Poetry, pages 15-27. Frederick Turner and Ernst Pöppel's The Neural Lyre: Poetic Meter, the Brain, and Time,R.S. Gwynn (1999), New Expansive Poetry, pages 86-119. Brad Leithauser's Metrical Illiteracy,R.S. Gwynn (1999), New Expansive Poetry, pages 148-156. as well as statements and essays from female New Formalists,R.S. Gwynn (1999), New Expansive Poetry, pages 167-187. and from adherents of the New Narrative.R.S. Gwynn (1999), New Expansive Poetry, pages 188-251. ==The 2000s== In a 2017 review of William Baer's Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets for the LA Review of Books, Patrick Kurp wrote, \\"Among the many reasons poets choose to write formal poetry in the 21st century is an intuitive distaste for the imitative fallacy. To write about chaos, one need not write chaotically. It's only a minor paradox to say that discipline and constraint unlock freedom.\\"A Negative Freedom: Thirteen Poets on Formal Verse by Patrick Kurp, LA Review of Books, October 26, 2017. In 2001, the American poet Leo Yankevich founded The New Formalist, which published among others the poets Jared CarterFive Poems at The New Formalist and Keith Holyoak.Four Poems at The New Formalist Even as the new millennium dawned, the movement continued to have its detractors. In the November/December 2003 issue of P. N. Review, N. S. Thompson wrote, in a throwback to the attacks by tenured professors during the 1980s, \\"While movements do need a certain amount of bombast to fuel interest, they have to be backed up by a certain artistic success. In hindsight, the movement seems to be less of a poetic revolution and more a marketing campaign.\\"N. S. Thompson, 'Form and Function,' P. N. Review, 154. After its last issue in 2004, The Formalist was succeeded by Measure: A Review of Formal Poetry, which is still published biannually by the University of Evansville. Writing in 2006, Robert McPhillips commented, \\"In the past quarter century, the literary landscape has changed much from when the New Formalists began to publish their earliest work. The New Formalists have become firmly established in the canon of contemporary American literature. There is an entry on the movement (by myself) in The Oxford Companion to Twentieth Century Poetry in English (1994), edited by Ian Hamilton, as well as individual entries on many of the movement's poets. An anthology of poetry, Rebel Angels: 25 Poets of the New Formalism (1996), edited by Mark Jarman and David Mason, established a Canon of some of the strongest poets in the movement. Further anthologies of poems and essays continued to give the New Formalism at once a broader and more cohesive identity than it could have had in 1989.\\"Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, Textos Books. Page xiii-xiv. Also in 2006, William Baer's Writing Metrical Poetry: Contemporary Lessons for Mastering Traditional Forms was published by Writer's Digest Books. The book is a guide for aspiring poets in how to master traditional poetic forms and rhythms.William Baer (2006), Writing Metrical Poetry: Contemporary Lessons for Mastering Traditional Forms, pages 18-206. In an appendix to the book entitled The Formalist Revival: A Brief Historical Note, William Baer defends poetic forms against William Carlos Williams' charge that they are reactionary and fascist by pointing out that Marxist and LBGT poets like Federico Garcia Lorca and even Communist poets like Pablo Neruda have regularly written in traditional verse forms.William Baer (2006), Writing Metrical Poetry: Contemporary Lessons for Mastering Traditional Forms, page 237. In another appendix titled Pound, Flint, Imagism, and Verse Libre, Baer argues further against Williams's claim by laying out the instrumental role played in the free verse revolution by American poet Ezra Pound, the mentor to T.S. Elliot and founder of Imagism. In addition to showing Pound's overwhelming influence over both American and world poetry, Baer also describes Pound's pathological narcissism and embrace of far-right politics, anti-Semitism, and Fascism.William Baer (2006), Writing Metrical Poetry: Contemporary Lessons for Mastering Traditional Forms, pages 226-232. Baer continues, \\"While living Italy, Pound not only supported the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini, but he actually broadcast over Radio Rome a series of rather incomprehensible attacks against the United States, encouraging the American GIs to throw down their weapons. Thus, the most influential poet in the world had become a kind of Fascist Tokyo Rose.\\"William Baer (2006), Writing Metrical Poetry: Contemporary Lessons for Mastering Traditional Forms, page 232. Baer continues, \\"When the war ended, Pound was arrested for treason and placed in a restraining cage in the city of Pisa, and the following year, after being brought back to America, he was committed of 'unsound mind' to St. Elizabeth's mental hospital in Washington, D.C.. Despite his behavior during the war and his blatant anti- Semitism, countless American poets visited Pound in the hospital, and his influence continued. In 1958, due to the intercession of a number of well- known poets (including Eliot, Archibald MacLeish, and even Frost), Pound was released from St. Elizabeth's, and he set sail for Italy. As soon as he arrived, he gave a Fascist salute, called America 'an insane asylum,' and continued to mistreat his wife and avoid his son.\\"William Baer (2006), Writing Metrical Poetry: Contemporary Lessons for Mastering Traditional Forms, pages 232-233. Baer also describes how, in 1962, Pound said that he had been, \\"wrong, wrong, wrong. I've always been wrong.\\" The following year, he claimed, \\"Everything I touch I spoil. I have blundered always.\\" In 1966, Pound said that The Cantos, the 803-page poem which he had begun writing down on toilet paper while imprisoned at Pisa, \\"doesn't make sense.\\" Pound called the whole poem, \\"stupidity and ignorance.\\" Pound also called his entire body of work, \\"a botch,\\" and added, \\"I picked out this and that thing that interested me, and then jumbled them into a bag. But that's not the way to make a work of art.\\"William Baer (2006), Writing Metrical Poetry: Contemporary Lessons for Mastering Traditional Forms, page 233. In response, Baer commented, \\"Like Picasso, the founders of Imagism came to disavow their methods. It's a true story that, unfortunately, is not often told to young aspiring writers. Certainly, serious poetic artists need to experiment, but not all experiments are necessarily useful or permanent... Oddly enough, even now, after nearly a hundred years of vers libre, the current Random House Webster's still defines poetry as 'literary work in metrical form' and prose as 'the ordinary form of spoken or written language, without metrical structure, as distinct from poetry or verse.'\\"William Baer (2006), Writing Metrical Poetry: Contemporary Lessons for Mastering Traditional Forms, page 234. In a reference to Robert Frost's famous comparison of free verse to tennis played without a net, Baer concluded with the words, \\"Tennis anyone?\\"William Baer (2006), Writing Metrical Poetry: Contemporary Lessons for Mastering Traditional Forms, page 235. In a 2007 essay titled Why No One Wants to be a New Formalist, A.E. Stallings wrote, \\"People debate over who gets to be in the church of the Avant Garde — who gets to be among the Elect, who gets to be in the Canon Outside the Canon. It is clearly a privilege, a badge of honor.\\" Stallings added, however, that no one, herself included, wants to be dubbed a New Formalist, which she likened to the kiss of death. Stallings continued, \\"People come up with other terms: Expansive poet, poet-who-happens-to-write-in-form (and 'I write free verse, too', they hastily exclaim), formalista... If I have to be labeled, I myself prefer the term Retro-Formalist, which at least sounds vaguely cool, like wearing vintage clothing and listening to vinyl, something so square it's hip.\\"Why No One Wants to be a New Formalist by A.E. Stallings. ==The 2010s== In the 2010 essay, Afro-Formalism, A.E. Stallings described her attendance at, \\"the best panel I attended at AWP, titled Afro-Formalism: Owning the Masters (after a famous essay by Marilyn Nelson).\\"Afro-Formalism by A.E. Stallings The panel was meant to celebrate the many contributions made to the New Formalist movement by African-American poets. Stallings further recalled, \\"Charles Fort spoke about Robert Hayden and how he had not been considered 'black enough' in his time — something that in retrospect seems a bit bizarre for the author of the great sonnet Frederick Douglas. In America, use of form has long been an oddly politicized choice. (Women are sometimes criticized in the same way for using it — that false dichotomy of free verse = democracy and empowerment and progress whereas formal verse = oppression and elitism and kowtowing to dead white males.) Tara Betts gave a fascinating discussion of forms invented by African-Americans (as the Bop, see below), and of how we can all use forms invented in other cultural contexts — that they are all open to everyone, and gain energy from cultural cross-fertilization. Erica Dawson, who has something like rock star status in the formal world, and who has the presence to go with it (this is a tall woman who has written an ode to high-heeled shoes...), spoke about her relationship to the tradition, tossing off some seriously dead white male influences like Anthony Hecht and James Merrill, and reminding us of just how raunchy the Metaphysical poets could be. A decade ago she was told at a recitation contest that 'form was dead', but now she has served as judge at that same contest. She exuded confidence and vindication, taking on the canon in her own terms.\\" In 2016, William Baer's Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets was published by Measure Press. In the Preface, Baer described the book as a follow up to the 2004 volume Fourteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, which had gathered his interviews with an older generation of Formalist poets. He added, \\"The present book, Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, contains the thirteen subsequent interviews with poets of the New Formalist generation: six of which were published in The Formalist and seven of which were published in Measure: A Review of Formal Poetry. Only three of the poets included in this collection are not members of the Baby Boom generation: Frederick Turner, who was born in 1943; the influential senior poet Rhina P. Espaillat, who'd delayed her own literary career until after she's raised her children; and A.E. Stallings, born in 1968, a recent MacArthur fellow who seems the perfect transition into subsequent generations.\\"William Baer (2016) Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Pages x-xi. In a 2017 book review for the LA Review of Books, Patrick Kurp wrote, in a sign that the conflict between free versers and New Formalist was ongoing, \\"Poets, critics, and readers on both sides of the form/free verse divide are frequently guilty of the Manichean heresy. Stated bluntly: Free verse, the more unfettered the better, is good; meter and rhyme, bad. Or vice versa. The schema turns political and nasty when form is associated with conservatism and free verse with progressivism, as though Ronald Reagan commanded poets to compose villanelles.\\" Kurp continued, \\"Baer collects interviews he conducted with first- and second-generation New Formalists, most of whom are squeezed into another convenient pigeonhole, baby boomers: Wyatt Prunty, Dana Gioia, Timothy Steele, Rachel Hadas, Brad Leithauser, Charles Martin, R. S. Gwynn, Frederick Turner, Mary Jo Salter, David Middleton, Dick Davis, Rhina P. Espaillat, and A. E. Stallings. The oldest is Espaillat, born in 1932; the youngest, Stallings, in 1968. The rest cluster between 1942 and 1954. Reading the interviews sequentially, the reader comes to appreciate that the New Formalists do not constitute a monolith. None is an ideologue. None believes a formal poem is automatically superior to its free verse cousin, and some write free verse themselves. But most agree that adherence to form enables them to express what they wish in the most efficient manner.\\" Kurp further wrote, \\"The poets interviewed by Baer are a notably un- bohemian, well-behaved, independent-minded bunch. None is out to be countercultural.\\" ==Subgenres== ===Comic verse=== ===Epic poetry=== ====Vikram Seth==== In 1986, Anglo-Indian poet Vikram Seth published The Golden Gate, which is both a sonnet sequence and a novel in verse inspired by Alexander Pushkin's Eugene Onegin. Like the latter, The Golden Gate is narrated using the Onegin stanza. ====Frederick Turner==== English-American poet Frederick Turner has published two epic poems which are also science fiction novels in verse. The first is his 1985 poem The New World, which celebrates world culture in the year 2376 A.D.. The second is the 1990 poem Genesis, which is heavily influenced by Greek Mythology and is about the human colonization of Mars.William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 195. Genesis has not only, according to Turner, done well in terms of sales, \\"it's even been adopted by NASA.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 196. When asked about his decision to write epic poetry, Turner replied, \\"People are willing to read novels, and they're willing to read the classic epics. I suspect that Robert Fitzgerald's wonderful translation of The Odyssey has been ready by as many people as most contemporary novels. So I don't think that there's anything wrong with the form itself; it's rather a problem of old-fashioned expectations, along with the general incompetence with which it's usually done in our times - when it's done at all. Also, the perceived difficulty of modern poetry is a problem. If readers struggle with a short modern poem, they'll often dread the idea of reading a 200-page poem, but if it's crafted correctly and really tells a story,then it isn't a problem. You can read Fitzgerald's Odyssey more easily than most novels, it's much more direct.\\" ====Derek Walcott==== In 1990, Afro- Saint Lucian poet Derek Walcott, published Omeros, an epic poem inspired by Homer's Iliad and set on Walcott's native Saint Lucia and in Brookline, Massachusetts. ===Literary translation=== Since the beginning of New Formalism, the Movement has advocated a return to more traditional practices of literary translation. In his 1987 essay, Notes on the New Formalism, Dana Gioia sharply criticized the then common practice of making free verse translations of Formalist poems. He commented, \\"...although the past quarter century has witnessed a explosion of poetic translation, this boom has almost exusively produced work that is formally vague and colorless. Compared to most earlier translation, these contemporary American versions make no effort whatsoever to reproduce the prosodic features of their originals. One can now read more of Dante or Villon, Rilke or Mandelstam, Lorca or even Petrarch in English versions without any sense of the poem's original form. Sometimes these versions brilliantly convey the theme or tone of the originals, but most often they sound stylistically impoverished and anonymous. All of the past blurs together into a familiar tune. Unrhymed, unmetered,and unshaped, Petrarch and Rilke sound alike.\\"Dana Gioia (2002), Can Poetry Matter? Essays on Poetry and American Culture, Graywolf Press, Saint Paul, Minnesota. Page 35. In a subsequent essay criticizing free verse poet Robert Bly, Gioia further wrote, \\"What can one say about translations so insensitive to both the sound and nuance of the originals? By propagating this minimal kind of translation Bly has done immense damage to American poetry. Translating quickly and superficially, he not only misrepresented the work of many great poets, he also distorted some of the basic standards of poetic excellence. His slapdash method not only ignored both the obvious formal qualities of the originals (like rhyme and meter) and, more crucially, those subtler organizing principles such as diction, tone, rhythm, and texture that frequently give poems their intensity. Concentrating almost entirely on syntax and imagery, Bly reduced the complex originals into abstract visual blueprints. In his hands, dramatically different poets like Lorca and Rilke, Montale and Machado, not only all sounded alike, they all sounded like Robert Bly, and even then not Robert Bly at his best. But as if that weren't bad enough, Bly consistently held up these diminished versions as models of poetic excellence worthy of emulation. I promoting his new poetics (based entirely on his specially chosen foreign models) he set standards so low that helped create a school of mediocrities largely ignorant of the pre-modern poetry in English and familiar with foreign poetry only through oversimplified translations. Bly's weaknesses as a translator underscore his central failings as a poet.\\"Dana Gioia (2002), Can Poetry Matter? Essays on Poetry and American Culture, Graywolf Press, Saint Paul, Minnesota. Page 153. In the years since, many New Formalist poets have taken up Gioia's challenge. ====Dick Davis==== One of the most acclaimed New Formalist verse translators is English American poet Dick Davis. Davis lived in Iran during the reign of the last Shah, taught English at the University of Tehran, and married an Iranian woman, Afkham Darbandi, in 1974. After the Islamic Revolution turned Dick and Afkham Davis into refugees, he decided to begin translating Persian poetry into English. According to Patrick Kurp, \\"Dick Davis has virtually invented Persian literature for contemporary English readers.\\" In 1984, Davis published a translation, made with his wife's assistance, of Attar of Nishapur's The Conference of Birds. Since then, Davis has published literary translations of a collection of medieval Persian epigrams in 1997, Ferdowsi's The Shahnameh in 2006, and Fakhruddin As'ad Gurgani's Vis and Ramin in 2009.William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, pages 231-275. In 2012, Davis also published Faces of Love: Hafez and the Poets of Shiraz. The book is a collection of verse by the poets of Medieval Shiraz, which was so secular compared to other cities in the Islamic World that Davis compares it with the Venetian Republic during the same period. The collection includes many poetic laments written after the Royal House of Inju was overthrown by Mubariz al-Din Muhammad, an Islamic Fundamentalist, who implemented Sharia Law in Shiraz, closed the wine shops, and forced the women of the city to wear the Chador and be confined indoors unless escorted by a male relative. According to Davis, Mubariz was sarcastically dubbed \\"The Morals Officer,\\" by the poets and people of Shiraz, who were overjoyed when Mubariz was ultimately overthrown and blinded by his son, Shah Shoja Mozaffari, who reversed his father's Fundamentalist policies. The three poets Davis translated for the collection are Hafez, \\"who's without question, the most famous lyric poet in Iranian history,\\" Princess Jahan Malek Khatun, who, \\"is the only Medieval woman poet whose complete works have come down to us - well over a thousand poems,\\" and Ubayd Zakani, \\"the most famous obscene poet from Medieval Iran.\\"William Baer (2016) Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Pages 273-274. Most recently, in 2015, Davis has published a book of translated poetry by Fatemeh Shams, an award-winning Iranian female poet and vocal critic of the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Shams, like the Davises, is currently living in exile in the United States.Fatemeh Shams translations by Dick Davis. While being interviewed by William Baer, Davis said, \\"There's a great 17th century poem by Wentworth Dillon about translation that has the line, 'Choose an author as you choose a friend', and that would be my best advice. Unless you feel a real sympathy for the poet, there's no point in trying to translate his work. You need a certain zeal and eagerness to proselyze - to bring the original work out into the open for other people to appreciate. The translator, also, needs to be a very good reader and truly understand the original. It's undeniable that the translator's voice will always be present in the translation, but you need to keep it as muted as possible.\\"William Baer (2016) Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 270. ====Rhina Espaillat==== Dominican-American bilingual poet Rhina Espaillat has translated the poetry of Robert Frost and Richard Wilbur into Spanish.Nancy Kang and Silvio Torres-Saillant (2018), The Once and Future Muse: The Poetry and Poetics of Rhina P. Espaillat, University of Pittsburgh Press. Pages 86-87. Of her translations of Frost, Espaillat once said, \\"...something like The Witch of Coos seems to be written in a kind of New Hampshirese that's very hard to translate into Spanish. It's too idiosyncratic. But I've been pleased with the shorter lyrics I've done. In the past, I've only seen a few translations of Frost into Spanish, and I don't care for any of them. One of them actually translated Frost into free verse, which I don't think is appropriate at all, and I'm sure that Frost was turning in his grave.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 296. According to biographers Nancy Kang and Silvio Torres-Saillant, Espaillat, \\"has also accrued a solid track record as English translator of Spanish and Latin American verse from across diverse historical periods.\\"Nancy Kang and Silvio Torres-Saillant (2018), The Once and Future Muse: The Poetry and Poetics of Rhina P. Espaillat, University of Pittsburgh Press. Page 87. Espaillat has produced and published English translations of the verse of Dominican poets Quiterio Berroa y Canelo, Manuel del Cabral, and Héctor Incháustegui Cabral. She has also translated poetry written in Spanish by fellow Dominican-Americans Juan Matos, César Sánchez Beras, Diógenes Abréu, and Dagoberto López.Nancy Kang and Silvio Torres-Saillant (2018), The Once and Future Muse: The Poetry and Poetics of Rhina P. Espaillat, University of Pittsburgh Press. Pages 88. From other Latin American countries, Espaillat has translated the poetry of Miguel de Guevara, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Manuel González Prada, Rafael Arévalo Martínez, Gabriela Mistral, Vicente Huidobro, and Alfonsina Storni.Rhina Espaillat's translations of Alfonsina Storni From Spain, Espaillat has translated the verse of Saint John of the Cross, Gabriel Bocángel, Gabriel García de Tassara, Miguel de Unamuno, and Miguel Hernández. Espaillat has also translated the poetry of Antero de Quental from Portuguese and the verse of Blas de Otero from Catalan. During an interview with William Baer, Espaillat said, \\"I can't imagine a world without translation because we'd have no Bible, no Homer, and no Virgil. All of our libraries would shrink down to a single room. So we desperately need translation, but it's crucial for the translator to face the fact that he's not going to get it all. There are going to be losses, which he should try to keep to a minimum, but he can never flatter himself that he's really bringing the poem into another language because it simply can't be done. I think the translator needs to begin with humility. As far as the actual process goes, I think a translator first needs to understand the poem as much as he can, try to get under the author's skin, and see if he can reconstruct the thought process of the original author. The primary job of the translator is to carry the poem from one language to the other with as little damage as possible. Personally, I enjoy the challenge very much, even though I'm never fully satisfied.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 295. Espaillat continued, \\"Whenever I speak to Hispanic groups, I tell the young people to make sure they hold onto their Spanish, and keep it clean, and constantly increase their vocabulary, just as they're doing with English. Then I encourage them and say, 'Now, since you know two languages, for heaven's sake, translate! We need you! Both languages need you to bridge the gap.'\\" ====Dana Gioia==== Dana Gioia has translated and published a version of Seneca the Younger's poetic drama The Rage of Hercules. During an interview with William Baer, Gioia revealed that his translation of Seneca's play had been performed in SoHo.William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 60. ====Rachel Hadas==== Rachel Hadas has published translations of writers including Tibullus, Charles Baudelaire, and the Greek poets Constantine Cavafy and Konstantinos Karyotakis to much acclaim.The Poetry Foundation > Poets > Rachel Hadas Biography ====Charles Martin==== Poet Charles Martin has published literary translations of the ancient Roman poet Catullus and of Ovid's Metamorphoses.William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, pages 155-156. Robert McPhillips has praised his translations of the complete poems of Catullus, for Martin's, \\"prosodic skill in rendering the Latin hendecasyllabic line to English, and for preserving his colloquial vulgarity in contemporary American idiom.\\"Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, page 105. Martin has also produced literary translations of the sonnets of Giuseppe Gioachino Belli, a 19th-century poet from the Papal States, who wrote, \\"over twenty-seven hundred sonnets, and all of them are about the people of Rome, all written in different voices... It's a kind of polyphonic symphony of sonnets about Rome and the people of Rome. But he's not easy to translate because he wrote in a Roman dialect.\\" ====David Middleton==== Poet David Middleton has translated several Latin language poems by Samuel Johnson. During an interview with William Baer, Middleton recalled, \\"I'd studied Latin in graduate school at L.S.U., and when R.S. Barth decided to do a small anthology of Johnson's Latin poetry in English translations, I was glad to translate a few of his poems. It's clear that Johnson put many of his deepest feelings in his Latin verses, and in one of those poems, On Recovering the Use of His Eyes, he relates his profound gratitude to God for curing him of an eye ailment, which was quite terrible, and which the poet believed might lead to blindness. It's also about using one's personal 'gifts', and I often close my poetry readings with that poem. Johnson is clearly saying to God, 'You've given me a gift to be a writer, and I want to be able to realize that gift, and I thank you for giving me my eyesight back.' It's like a happier version of Milton's famous sonnet about his blindness. He's saying that all such gifts come from heaven, and I end my poetry readings by reminding the audience, especially the young students, that they all have specially gifts that they should pursue, whether they're religious or not.\\"William Baer (2016) Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Pages 244-245. ====A.E. Stallings==== American poet A.E. Stallings, who is well known for her imaginative retellings of stories from Greek Mythology, has also translated poetry from both Greek and Latin. In 2007, she published a verse translation of Lucretius' De Rerum Natura (The Nature of Things) and in 2018, a verse translation of Hesiod's Works and Days, both through Penguin Classics. Stallings' translation of the The Battle of the Frogs and Mice, an ancient Greek mock epic and parody of Homer's Iliad, was published by Paul Dry Books in 2019. ====Frederick Turner==== In an interview, William Baer asked Anglo-African poet Frederick Turner about his 1992 collection of translated poems by Miklós Radnóti, a Hungarian Jewish poet, convert to Roman Catholicism, and critic of the Arrow Cross Party, who was murdered by the Royal Hungarian Army during the Holocaust.William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 200. Turner responded, \\"One day, one of Radnóti's friends saw him on the streets of Budapest, and the poet was mumbling something like, 'Du-duh-du-duh-du-duh,' and his friend said, 'Don't you understand?! Hitler is invading Poland!' And Radnóti supposedly answered, 'Yes, but this is the only thing I have to fight with.' As his poetry makes clear, Radnóti believed that Fascism was the destruction of order. It both destroyed and vulgarized civil society. It was as if you wanted to create an ideal cat, so you took your cat, killed it, removed its flesh, put it into some kind of mold, and then pressed it into the shape of a cat. That's what Fascism does, and that's what Communism does. They both destroy an intricate social order to set up a criminally simple-minded order.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, pages 200-201. About his work alongside his co-translator Zsuzsanna Ozsváth, Turner said, \\"Well, we made an agreement right from the start that we would maintain the Hungarian formats. We also wanted to capture the sound of the Hungarian, which is quite unusual. Fortunately, Hungarian poets use a lot of meters and forms that we also use. Iambs and sonnets, for example, but the language has many more trochees and dactyls, and the Hungarians often combine the two rhythms in fascinating ways, and ways that work extremely well in English. As George Steiner once said, Hungarian poems shouldn't sound like American poems. So we worked hard to create the Hungarian sounds.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 201. When asked about his translations of Chinese poetry, particularly poems dating from the Tang Dynasty, Turner commented, \\"That was quite a bit more difficult, but eventually I realized that the Chinese syllable is roughly equivalent to two syllables in English, and that made things much easier. Chinese poetry needs to be recited much slower than English poetry, and when a line of Chinese poetry has five syllables, it will probably take ten syllables to render it into English. Whenever I translate, whether from the Hungarian or the Chinese, I always listen to the poem recited first. Then I write a 'score' for the poem, marking stresses, and the rhyme scheme, and the cadence, and so forth.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 201-202. ===Love and erotic poetry=== ====Dick Davis==== During an interview, William Baer asked English-American poet Dick Davis about the many love poems addressed to Davis' wife, Afkham Darbandi. Davis replied, \\"It's often occurred to me that there are so few poems that celebrate love within a marriage. It's been suggested that Petrarch would never have written all this sonnets to Laura if he'd slept with her. But marriage exists all over the world, and it's very real for many people. It's not some fantasy or illusion, and it's something I've always wanted to write about. As for my children, they're immensely important to me. You certainly don't want to burden them with your emotions; but, on the other hand, the emotions are still there, and I've tried to write about it. I must admit that I find those poems very hard to write, much more difficult than writing poems about my wife.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 266. ===Narrative poetry=== ===Poetic Drama=== ====Dana Gioia==== In addition to translating an Ancient Roman poetic drama by Seneca the Younger, Dana Gioia has also published the opera libretto Nosferatu, which is based upon the 1922 silent movie of the same name. Gioia's script was intended to be, \\"a libretto that could work as a poetic tragedy on the page and as a musical drama on stage. I believe that the libretto is one of the great unrealized poetic genres in the English language.\\" Gioia has also written the libretto for the, \\"long, phantasmagoric, one-act opera\\", Tony Caruso's Final Broadcast, \\"which contains four levels of language - prose, doggerel, Latin, and Italian language.\\" ===Religious poetry=== ====Dick Davis==== While interviewing poet Dick Davis, William Baer mentioned the, \\"powerful spiritual resonance,\\" in many of Davis' poems, as well as several of his poems are, \\"about specifically religious subjects,\\" such as Maximilian Kolbe, Rembrandt's Return of the Prodigal Son, A Christmas Poem, and others.William Baer (2016) Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 263. Davis replied, \\"Spirituality has always been very difficult for me, and I think I'm an Atheist. On the other hand, I'm very sympathetic to religious emotion. If I'd lived in the Middle Ages, I probably would have been a monk. I would have been a very bad monk because I would have been tormented by lots of non-monkish desires. But I'm very drawn to spirituality, and I'm very drawn to those people who live a truly spiritual life. Having said that, I'm often very revolted by the way in which most religions are actually practiced in the world. I've lived in the Middle East, and I've seen the damage that religious sectarianism can do. I'm not picking on any particular religion, but I feel, overall, that they often do more harm than good. So I feel very conflicted about organized religion, but I must admit that there's some religious art, both visual and musical, but especially musical, that takes away my will to resist it. There are particular pieces of Christian music that are so moving that I find myself assenting to their spirituality while I'm listening to the music. I suppose I tend to think of my religious feelings as kind of an 'evening' thing. At the end of the day, you often allow it. But when you wake up in the morning and the sunlight comes in, you think, 'Oh, that can't be true.' But later, when the evening comes, you're ready for it once again. I also have the feeling that the same thing might happen in the 'evening' of life.\\"William Baer (2016) Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Pages 265-266. ====David Middleton==== According to William Baer, \\"...religion is a subject that many contemporary poets shy away from.\\" He added, however, that, \\"some of the best Christian verse of recent times,\\" has been written by poet David Middleton.William Baer (2016) Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 244. Middleton, a native of Shreveport, Louisiana,William Baer (2016) Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 227. was raised as a Southern Baptist. He recalls, \\"The best part about my Southern Baptist upbringing was learning the King James Bible and my many years of close Bible study. This is, of course, crucial for anyone interested in literature, whether he or she's a person of faith or not, since, if you don't know the Bible thoroughly, you won't understand much of the literature of the Western tradition.\\"William Baer (2016) Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Pages 237-238. Middleton added, however, that he, \\"went through a long period of not attending church and not necessarily being a person of faith.\\"William Baer (2016) Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 237. He explained that this was because he, \\"no longer appreciated other aspects of the Southern Baptist denomination - such as the great emphasis on guilt - and, as a result, I lapsed from the church and my faith.\\"William Baer (2016) Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, Measure Press. Page 238. Middleton added, however that before the birth of their daughter, Anna, \\"Francine and I felt that we had to raise her in a Christian church, whatever my doubts might have been. I didn't want her growing up in a community where everybody went to church and where she wouldn't even have the opportunity to decide for herself. Eventually, my wife and I decided to come back to the church as traditional, conservative, High- Church Anglicans. I did want to get all those adjectives in there because I feel less comfortable with many of the current teachings of the Episcopal Church than I do with Anglicanism as it was known and practiced by persons such as George Herbert, Samuel Johnson, C.S. Lewis, and T.S. Eliot, different as they are from one another in some ways (and not all of them Anglo- Catholics). So it was fatherhood that really brought me back to religion, and it also led me to shift from my previous Liberal/Moderate perspective on things to a more Conservative one.\\" Middleton, who lives in Thibodaux, Louisiana, has published three full length collections, The Burning Fields in 1991, Beyond the Chandeleurs in 1999, and the Habitual Peacefulness of Grouchy: Poems after Pictures by Jean-François Millet, in 2005. All were published by Louisiana University Press. As of 2016, Middleton was also the poetry editor at Modern Age and The Classical Outlook, and had previously served in the same position at The Louisiana English Journal and The Anglican Theological Review. ====Frederick Turner==== When asked about his own religious poetry, poet and scientist Frederick Turner said, \\"In the 20th century, it became more and more frowned on to advertise your religious views. Partly it was a reaction against the 'tolerant hypocrisy' of the Victorian's, but the primary reason, of course, was the intellectual fashion of the death of God. You really couldn't be a respectable thinker unless you made an act of faith that there is nothing but matter in the world. We now know,of course, from countless scientific discoveries, that matter itself has a relatively late appearance in the universe, and if the universe looks like anything,it looks like a gigantic thought, which Eddington claimed a long time ago. The best metaphor for the universe is not a gigantic machine, but rather a thought, which from a theological point of view is perfectly reasonable. But there's still a lot of pressure to conform in the arts and academia, and it also has professional ramifications. People could certainly lose their jobs for expressing themselves like Hopkins, Dickinson, or Milton - or they wouldn't get those jobs in the first place.\\"William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, page 197. ===Satirical verse=== According to Robert McPhillips, the New Formalist movement has led to a revival of satirical verse, which is a subject few literary scholars have ever studied.Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, page 89. ====Thomas M. Disch==== One of the most prominent satirists of the movement was outspoken Atheist, LGBT poet, and science fiction novelist Thomas M. Disch. Disch, a native of Iowa, grew up in St. Paul, Minnesota, and, beginning in the 1950s, spent his life in Manhattan. Writing in 2006, Robert McPhillips called Disch, \\"among the most literate and provocative of living science fiction writers.\\" Of Disch's science fiction and horror writing, McPhillips commented, \\"All three of these novels draw, to some extent, upon Disch's Catholic upbringing in the Midwest, one that he looks on with loathing as a lapsed gay Catholic living in a more cosmopolitan environment.\\" McPhillips added that even though Disch's poetry was, \\"for a long time known only to a small group British and American readers,\\" he added that it was enough by itself to, \\"establish Disch as a first rate literary talent.\\"Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, pages 89-90. McPhillips writes that Disch's poetry collections include satires of the tedium of reading Marcel Proust's Remembrance of Things Past and the, \\"decidedly politically incorrect The Rapist's Villanelle (reminding us how savage satire can be); as well as more personal lyric satires Entropic Villanelle and the self-deifying Ballade of the New God.\\"Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, page 91. The Rapist's Villanelle is, according to Robert McPhillips, a parody of the dramatic monologues of Robert Browning and of Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock.Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, pages 93-95. Also according to McPhillips, Disch lampooned Christian poetry with the poem, The Snake in the Manger: A Christmas Legend.Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, page 90-93. Furthermore, in his poem Ritin: A Manifesto, Disch satirizes the verse and poetic idiom of English-Canadian poet Robert W. Service, while also defending Service against the attacks of tenured professors who prefer, \\"more elitist poetry,\\" in the mold of T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound.Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, pages 97-98. Robert McPhillips writes, \\"Tom Disch's black and mordant voice comes closest to satire's scathing Roman models. He exposes without forgiving human vices and imperfections.\\"Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, Textos Books. Page 112. ====R. S. Gwynn==== R.S. Gwynn, who was born in North Carolina in 1948, is described by Robert McPhillips as, \\"a critic of integrity, conversant with the entire range of contemporary American poetry (as well as a thorough grounding in the history of English and American poetry and prosody), who deflates the reputations of overrated poets, but, more importantly, praises the virtues of poets whose mastery of their craft has often not been significantly recognized by the poetic establishment.\\"Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, Textos Books. Pages 98-99. Gwynn published The Narcissisiad, which Robert McPhillips has dubbed, \\"a Popean mock epic lambasting contemporary poets\\", in 1981.Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, Textos Books. Page 98. Dana Gioia has written of The Narcissiad, \\"Formal and satiric, this mock epic in heroic couplets pilloried the excesses of contemporary American poetry by recounting the adventures of Narcissicus, an ambitious but talentless poet. In Gwynn's mercilessly satiric tale American poets simultaneously realize that to achieve artistic fame in the overcrowded field of contemporary verse they must kill all competitors. After a series of outrageous comic battles fought by recognizable caricatures of fashionable American poets, Narcissus ineptly triumphs. Gwynn's irreverent poem cannot have pleased the irreverent targets of his humor, but it enjoyed a lively underground life and has been repeatedly reprinted.\\" Dana Gioia (2004), Twentieth Century American Poetry, page 962. Gwynn has also published The Drive-In, in 1986, one quarter of the anthology Four Texas Poets in Concert in 1990, two collections of satirical poetry, and No Word of Farewell in 2001.Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, Textos Books. Page 98. According to McPhillips, \\"In Gwynn's poems, lyric, narrative, and satiric impulses are often combined. Gwynn's greatest poetic strength is in pointing out the sublime absurdities of contemporary American life. His poetic eye focuses on the foibles of middle- brow often Southern blue-collar culture, with compassion underlying his satiric bite.\\"Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, Textos Books. Page 99. According to McPhillips, Gwynn's, \\"most representative poem,\\" is Among Philistines, \\"which updates the story of Samson and Delilah for our sex- and celebrity-obsessed age.\\" The story is told from the perspective of Samson after his hair has been cut off, his great strength destroyed, and after he has been enslaved by the Philistines. McPhillips comments, \\"The Biblical story is narrated in the low style of contemporary American public speech, a combination of obscenity, tabloid-speak, advertising jargon, Yiddish. This language satirically contrasts not only with its Biblical source in Judges 13-16, but to the heightened style of John Milton's tragic drama Samson Agonistes. The contrast among these styles at once hilights the vulgarity of contemporary American culture - calling explicit nature to its philistinism - as it presents a sympathetic view of Samson as a man who transcends as he laments the image that the media -- embodied by the gossip columnist 'Miss Sleaze' - presents of him.\\" According to Robert McPhillips, \\"R.S. Gwynn's satire, like much of traditional British wit, points out the foibles of contemporary society to make serious moral points. Although his poetry has darkened in recent years, as death has become a major theme of Gwynn's, his work retains an amiable humanity.\\" ====Charles Martin==== Charles Martin, who was born in 1942 into an Irish- and German-American family in The Bronx, attended Catholic school before continuing his education at Fordham University and the State University of New York at Buffalo. Martin became a satirical poet through the influence of Catullus, whose complete poems he has translated from Latin into English.Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, pages 104-105. Like Catullus, Martin's satires combine subjectivity, irony, and eroticism. Martin often contrasts the sexual free-for-all that existed in the Pagan Roman Empire with the alleged sexual repression of Victorian and early 20th century American culture.Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, pages 105-112. Robert McPhillips concludes, \\"Charles Martin's gentle and inclusive satire unravels the contradictions and duplicities of perception. Whether writing about high culture or family life, he tries to create a deeper understanding of moral existence.\\"Robert McPhillips (2006), The New Formalism: A Critical Introduction, page 112. ==Current activity== By the end of the 20th century, poems in traditional forms were once again being published more widely, and the new formalist movement per se was winding down. Since then, the effects of new formalism have been observed in the broader domain of general poetry; a survey of successive editions of various general anthologies showed an increase in the number of villanelles included in the post-mid-'80s editions.French, Amanda Lowry, Refrain, Again: The Return of the Villanelle, a doctoral dissertation, August 2004, page 13. The publication of books concerned with poetic form has also increased. Lewis Turco's Book of Forms from 1968 was revised and reissued in 1986 under the title 'New Book of Forms. Alfred Corn's The Poem's Heartbeat, Mary Oliver's Rules of the Dance, and Stephen Fry's The Ode Less Travelled are other examples of this trend. The widely used anthology An Exaltation of Forms: Contemporary Poets Celebrate the Diversity of Their Art (University of Michigan Press, 2002), edited by Annie Finch and Kathrine Varnes, defines formalist poetry as a form on a par with experimental, free verse, and even prose poetry. ==New Formalist canon== The 2004 West Chester Conference had a by-invitation-only critical seminar on 'Defining the Canon of New Formalism', in which the following anthologies were discussed:Schneider, Steven, 'Defining the Canon of New Formalist Poetry', Poetry Matters: The Poetry Center Newsletter, West Chester University.

Married to a daughter of the 1st Earl Mountbatten, Brabourne was a survivor of the bombing which killed his father-in-law, mother and son. ==Biography== Brabourne was born in 1924, the second son of Michael Knatchbull, 5th Baron Brabourne and his wife, Lady Doreen Knatchbull. He was educated at Eton College and Brasenose College, Oxford. He was barely 14 when his father died in February 1939 and his elder brother, Norton, inherited the Barony. ===War and inheritance=== The Second World War broke out just as Brabourne was finishing school, and he enlisted in the armed forces. He served in the Coldstream Guards, rising to the rank of Captain. He fought in France from 1944 onwards. In 1943, his elder brother, Norton, a Lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards, was wounded and captured in Italy. While being transported to Germany as a POW, he tried escape, but was captured and executed by the SS on 15 September 1943. Since he died childless, his barony passed to his younger brother, John Knatchbull, who became the 7th Lord Brabourne. ===Marriage=== At the end of the war, Brabourne returned to England and settled in the family seat, Mersham in Kent. On 26 October 1946, at Romsey Abbey in Hampshire, at the age of 21, he married Patricia Mountbatten, eldest daughter of Louis Mountbatten, 1st Viscount Mountbatten, later 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma. Brabourne's best man at the wedding was Squadron Leader Charles Harris-St. John. Lady Brabourne was to inherit her father's peerages in due course. This would make Lord and Lady Brabourne among the few married couples to each hold peerages in their own right. Also, Lady Brabourne was related to the British royal family, and her aunt Louise Mountbatten was at that time the Crown Princess (later Queen) of Sweden. In February 1947, only months after the wedding, Brabourne's father-in-law was appointed Viceroy of India. The newly-wed couple spent several months in India, residing with her parents in the viceregal palace. In November the same year, Lady Brabourne's first cousin Philip, Duke of Edinburgh wed Princess Elizabeth, future Queen of the United Kingdom. Lord and Lady Brabourne had eight children: * Norton Philip Louis Knatchbull, Lord Romsey – later the 8th Baron Brabourne (born 8 October 1947), married Penelope Eastwood and has issue. 3rd Earl Mountbatten of Burma from 13 June 2017. * The Hon. Michael- John Ulick Knatchbull (born 1950) * The Hon. Anthony Knatchbull (born/died 6 April 1952) * Lady Joanna Edwina Knatchbull (born 1955), married Baron Hubert Pernot du Breuil and later Azriel Zuckerman, and had issue by both. * Lady Amanda Patricia Victoria Knatchbull – later Lady Amanda Ellingworth (born 26 June 1957), married Charles Ellingworth and had three sons. * The Hon. Philip Wyndham Ashley Knatchbull (born 1961) * The Hon. Nicholas Timothy Charles Knatchbull (18 November 1964 – 27 August 1979), killed at the age of 14 by an IRA bomb. * The Hon. Timothy Knatchbull (born 18 November 1964), twin with his brother Nicholas ===Career and service=== In the late 1940s, shortly after leaving the army, Brabourne began working as an assistant production manager for certain television productions, mostly based on war-related themes. He graduated to the role of production manager by the early 1950s, and finally became a producer in his own right in 1958, with Harry Black a romantic story set in India, with war as the distant context. This was followed by Sink the Bismarck! (1960). War, Empire and India were recurrent themes in his work, and A Passage to India (1984) is among his films. His other motion pictures include Murder on the Orient Express (1974), Death on the Nile (1978), and Little Dorrit (1988).Death on the Nile producer dies, BBC News, 23 September 2005. In 1970, he founded Mersham Productions, a production house named after his family seat in Kent, which produced many of his works thereafter. He served as a director of Thames Television (later chairman) and Euston Films from 1978 to 1995, and a director of Thorn EMI from 1981 to 1986. John Brabourne received two Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, as producer of Romeo and Juliet (1968) and A Passage to India.Search of Academy Awards Database . Retrieved 23 March 2011. In 1979, Brabourne was invested as a Fellow of the British Film Institute. In 1993, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1990 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel. Despite an active career, Brabourne was also a country gentleman, and took his local responsibilities seriously. He served as a governor of various schools, including Norton Knatchbull School (founded by an ancestor c.1630 AD) from 1947 to 2000; Wye Agricultural College in Kent from 1955 to 2000, and Gordonstoun School from 1964 to 1994. He also served as Pro-Chancellor of the University of Kent from 1993 to 1999. ===The IRA bombing=== On 27 August 1979, while the family was on holiday in Mullaghmore, County Sligo, Lord Brabourne's father-in-law, Earl Mountbatten of Burma, took a number of family members out lobstering on his motorboat, Shadow V, in Donegal Bay. Having planned to murder Mountbatten, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) placed a bomb inside the boat on the night of the 26th. Mountbatten and several members of the party were killed the next morning when the bomb was triggered by an IRA observer onshore who was armed with a radio detonator. The dead included Brabourne's 83-year-old mother, the Dowager Baroness Brabourne, one of his twin 14-year-old sons, Nicholas Knatchbull, and a local boy, 15-year-old Paul Maxwell from County Fermanagh who had been hired for the summer as Mountbatten's boat boy. Brabourne, his wife Patricia, and their other twin son Timothy were severely injured, but survived the attack. Lord Brabourne died in 2005 at his home in Kent at the age of 80. He was survived by his wife and their six remaining children. Patricia Brabourne died in June 2017. ==Ancestry== ==References and notes* mountbattenofburma.com – Tribute & Memorial web-site to Louis, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma *Lord Brabourne's appearance on This Is Your Life * interview British Entertainment History Project Category:1924 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Alumni of Brasenose College, Oxford Brabourne, John Knatchbull, 7th Baron Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:British film producers Category:British television producers Category:Coldstream Guards officers Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Brabourne, John Knatchbull, 7th Baron Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Younger sons of barons ","title":"John Knatchbull, 7th Baron Brabourne"},{"id":"2583192","text":"Fourtet may refer to *Clos Fourtet, a Bordeaux Saint-Émilion wine producer *\\"Four Tet\\", the stage name of electronic musician Kieran Hebden ","title":"Fourtet"},{"id":"2583196","text":"Akhtar Abdur Rahman Khan (Urdu: اختر عبد الرحمن; 11 June 1924 – 17 August 1988), was a Pakistani four-star 30px general who served as Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee of the Pakistan Armed Forces from 1987–1988 and as Director-General of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) from 1979–1987. As DG ISI, General Akhtar collaborated with the Central Intelligence Agency and masterminded the resistance network of the Afghan Mujahideen against the Soviet Union, eventually managing to force the Soviets out of Afghanistan. Due to his close friendship with President of Pakistan General Zia-ul-Haq, General Akhtar was widely considered to be the second most powerful man in the country during General Zia's eleven-year military dictatorship. He died in the plane crash which also killed General Zia and the US Ambassador to Pakistan Arnold Lewis Raphel. After his death, his sons Humayun Akhtar Khan and Haroon Akhtar Khan joined politics and have been elected as Members of Parliament and headed key ministerial portfolios several times. ==Education== Akhtar Abdur Rahman Khan was born on 11 June 1924 in Rampur, State of Uttar Pradesh , British India https://tribune.com.pk/story/2035909/1-gen-akhtar-abdul-rahman-man- behind-soviet-defeat-afghanistan/?amp=1 into a Kakazai Pashtun family. Akhtar's father, Dr Abdul Rahman Khan was a doctor in a government hospital in Peshawar, North-West Frontier Province (present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa).https://tribune.com.pk/story/2035909/1-gen-akhtar-abdul-rahman- man-behind-soviet-defeat-afghanistan/?amp=1 He lost his father at the tender age of four and was raised by his mother, after the family moved to East Punjab in British India. He enrolled in Government College University (Faisalabad) in 1941, subsequently earning a Bachelor of Science in Statistics in 1945 followed by a Master of Science in Economics in 1947. ==Military career== ===Rising through the ranks=== General Akhtar Abdur Rahman joined the British Indian Army in 1946, before becoming Captain in Pakistan Army in 1949. After witnessing the traumatic events during the partition, Akhtar was appointed as an instructor at the Artillery School in Nowshera. Later, he was selected for an infantry training course with the British Army and was sent on deputation to complete a course in the United Kingdom. Upon returning to Pakistan, he was promoted to the rank of Major and posted as a military adviser to East-Pakistan Army from April 1954 to October 1954. He was later transferred back to General combatant headquarters (GHQ) as a staff officer, a position he held from April 1956 to February 1957. He actively participated in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and was appointed at IV Corps as an operational field officer. In the 1965 war he gallantly defended the Lahore sector and that led to his promotion to lieutenant-colonel and he remained second-in- command of the infantry regiment in Lahore. After the war, he was promoted to the rank of Colonel while being stationed with the IV Corps. Later, he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier and transferred to northern parts of the country where he commanded an infantry brigade in Azad Kashmir. In 1971, he was promoted to the Two-Star General rank of Major-General and served as General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 12th Infantry Division stationed in Murree. as GOC of the 12th Infantry Division, General Akhtar was considered very close to Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and personally received Bhutto whenever he visited the command office of the 12th Division. He did not take part in the 1977 military coup and privately opposed the martial law to remove Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Six months after the military coup of 1977 he was appointed as adjutant general at the General Headquarters for the next two years. During this time, General Akhtar became aware of a conspiracy in which Lieutenant-General Faiz Ali Chishti of X Corps, a close associate of General Zia-ul-Haq, secretly became rebellious and conspired to stage a military coup in the country. As early as of 1979, Akhtar received a call from General Chishti and met him at his office in Chaklala Military District (CMD). At this meeting, General Chishti informed him of the conspiracy that aimed to topple General Zia-ul-Haq and sought his assistance. According to the News International's intelligence unit, Chishti was under the impression that since Rahman had not been promoted, he would accept this invitation; especially when he was promised that after the coup worked out successfully, he would not only be promoted but would also become one of the pillars of the new regime. After returning to the GHQ, General Akhtar contacted General Zia-ul-Haq and foiled the plot against Zia. In June 1979 after the counter-coup had been foiled, President General Zia-ul-Haq awarded General Akhtar a promotion to Lieutenant General and appointed him Director General of the ISI. ===Soviet–Afghan War=== When the Soviet Union deployed its 40th Army in Afghanistan, Pakistan's top military brass led by General Akhtar believed that Pakistan would be the Soviet Union's next target. They felt that because of Pakistan's strategic location and given the fact that it has warm water ports in the Arabian Sea, it was a prime target for future invasion. Considering the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan threatened Pakistan's national security, Pakistan's premier intelligence agency the ISI headed by General Akhtar started providing financial, military, and strategic assistance to the Afghan mujahideen. The ISI received billions of dollars in military assistance from the CIA and Saudi Arabia to train and command the Afghan rebels in a bid to defeat the Soviets. This covert operation was known as Operation Cyclone, and was executed with the CIA providing the money and weapons, the ISI training and commanding the Afghan Mujahideen groups, and the Mujahideen conducting guerrilla warfare, ultimately leading to the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. During this time, General Akhtar developed a highly effective working relationship with key figures in the United States including CIA Director William Casey and Congressman Charlie Wilson. During his tenure as DG ISI, General Akhtar's influence on Pakistan's atomic weapons program grew and he worked tirelessly to collect around him colleagues who were equally dynamic and determined to make the ISI an organisation that would influence the domestic and external policies of the country and it was under him that the ISI became recognized one of the most powerful spy agencies in the world. In 1987, at the pinnacle of his career after having achieved remarkable success as in the Afghan war and protecting Pakistan's Nuclear Program, General Akhtar was promoted to the four-star rank and appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, the highest ranking four-star assignment in the Pakistan Armed Forces. ===Death=== On 17 August 1988, General Akhtar died in a plane crash along with several other high-profile casualties including President of Pakistan General Zia-ul-Haq and US Ambassador to Pakistan Arnold Lewis Raphel. General Akhtar had accompanied General Zia to Bahawalpur in his C-130B Hercules Presidential aircraft to witness a US M1 Abrams tank demonstration. After the Generals witnessed the demonstration, the aircraft departed from Bahawalpur Airport and was expected to reach Islamabad International Airport.[110] Shortly after a smooth takeoff, the control tower lost contact with the aircraft. Witnesses who saw the plane in the air claimed it was flying erratically and then nosedived and exploded on impact, killing all 31 passengers on board. Shortly after the plane crash, the Senate chairman Ghulam Ishaq Khan became President and announced Zia's death on radio and TV. [113] There is speculation that various state intelligence agencies including the Soviet KGB, Indian RAW, Israeli MOSSAD, and Afghan KHAD (in retaliation for Pakistani support of the mujahideen in Afghanistan) or an alliance of the four countries intelligence agencies along with dissident groups within the Pakistan Army were involved in the incident. Shortly after the crash, a board of inquiry was set up to investigate it. It concluded 'the most probable cause of the crash was a criminal act of sabotage perpetrated in the aircraft'. It also suggested that poisonous gases were released which incapacitated the passengers and crew, which would explain why no Mayday signal was given.[116] There was also speculation into other facts involving the details of the investigation. A flight recorder (black box) was not located after the crash and previous C-130 aircraft did have them installed. To this day, the cause of the plane crash remains a mystery and has given rise to many conspiracy theories. ==Books mentioning General Akhtar== * Fateh by Haroon-ur-Rasheed * Silent soldier by Mohammad Yousaf * The Bear Trap by Mohammad Yousaf and Mark Adkin * Charlie Wilson's War by George Crile * Ghost Wars by Steve Coll ==See also== * History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991) * Crossed Swords, Pakistan, Its Army, and the Wars Within * General Akhtar Abdul Rehman’s role in the destruction of the USSR ==References== Category:1924 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Pakistani generals Category:Recipients of Hilal-i-Jur'at Category:Directors General of Inter-Services Intelligence Category:Chairmen Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, Pakistan Category:Pashtun people Category:Pakistani anti-communists Category:Military government of Pakistan (1977–1988) Category:Pakistani financiers Category:People of the Soviet–Afghan War Category:Pakistani military personnel of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 Category:People from Rampur, Uttar Pradesh Category:Pakistan Army Artillery Corps officers Category:Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in 1988 Category:Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in Pakistan ","title":"Akhtar Abdur Rahman"},{"id":"2583208","text":"In game theory, a focal point (or Schelling point) is a solution that people tend to choose by default in the absence of communication. The concept was introduced by the American economist Thomas Schelling in his book The Strategy of Conflict (1960). Schelling states that \\"(p)eople can often concert their intentions or expectations with others if each knows that the other is trying to do the same\\" in a cooperative situation (at page 57), so their action would converge on a focal point which has some kind of prominence compared with the environment. However, the conspicuousness of the focal point depends on time, place and people themselves. It may not be a definite solution. == Existence == The existence of the focal point is first demonstrated by Schelling with a series of questions. The most famous one is the New York City question: if you are to meet a stranger in New York City, but you cannot communicate with the person, then when and where will you choose to meet? This is a coordination game, where any place and time in the city could be an equilibrium solution. Schelling asked a group of students this question, and found the most common answer was \\"noon at (the information booth at) Grand Central Terminal\\". There is nothing that makes Grand Central Terminal a location with a higher payoff (you could just as easily meet someone at a bar or the public library reading room), but its tradition as a meeting place raises its salience and therefore makes it a natural \\"focal point\\". Later, Schelling's informal experiments have been replicated under controlled conditions with monetary incentives by Mehta. == Theories == Although the concept of a focal point has been widely accepted in game theory, it is still unclear how a focal point forms. The researchers have proposed theories from two aspects. === The level-n theory === Stahl and Wilson argue that a focal point is formed because players would try to predict how other players act. They model the level of \\"rational expectation\\" players by their ability to # form priors (models) about the behavior of other players; # choose the best responses given these priors. A level-0 player will choose actions regardless of the actions of other players. A level-1 player believes that all other players are level-0 types. A level-n player estimates that all other players are level-0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 types. Based on experimental data, most of the players only use one model to predict the behavior of all the other players. Although the hierarchy of types could be indefinite, the benefits of higher levels would decrease substantially while incurring a much greater cost. Because of the limit of players' expectation level and players' priors, it is possible to reach an equilibrium in games without communication. ==== The cognitive hierarchy theory ==== The cognitive hierarchy (CH) theory is a derivation of level-n theory. A level-n player from CH model would assume that the numbers level-0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 players follow a normalized Poisson distribution. This model works well in multi-player games where the players need to estimate a number in a given range, such as the Keynesian beauty contest. === The team reasoning === Bacharach argued that people could find a focal point because they act as members of team instead of individuals in a cooperative game. With the identity changed, the player follows the prescription of an imaginary group leader to maximize the group interest. == Examples == === Schelling's questions === Here is a subset of the questions raised by Schelling to prove the existence of a focal point. # Head-tail game: Name \\"heads\\" or \\"tails\\". If the two players name the same, they win an award, otherwise, they get nothing # Letter order game: Give an order to letters A, B, and C. If the three players give the same order, they win an award, otherwise they get nothing. # Split money game: Two players share $100. They first write down their individual claims on a sheet of paper. If their claims add to $100 or less, both of them will get exactly what they claimed, but if the sum is higher than $100 they get nothing. The results of the informal experiments are # For the two players, A and B, in head-tail game. 16 out of 22 A and 15 out of 22 B chose \\"heads\\". # For the three players, A, B, and C, in letter order game. 9 out of 12 A, 10 out of 12 B, and 14 out of 16 C wrote \\"ABC\\". # For the players to claim part of the $100. 36 out of 40 chose $50. 2 of the remainder chose $49 and $49.99. These games suggest that focal points have some saliency. These characteristics make them preferable choices to people. Furthermore, people would assume each other has also noticed the saliency and make the same decision. === In coordination game === Coordination game example In a simple example, two people unable to communicate with each other are each shown a panel of four squares and asked to select one; if and only if they both select the same one, they will each receive a prize. Three of the squares are blue and one is red. Assuming they each know nothing about the other player, but that they each do want to win the prize, then they will, reasonably, both choose the red square. The red square is not in a sense a better square; they could win by both choosing any square and in this sense, all squares are technically a Nash equilibrium. The red square is the \\"right\\" square to select only if a player can be sure that the other player has selected it, but by hypothesis neither can. However, it is the most salient and notable square, so—lacking any other one—most people will choose it, and this will in fact (often) work. === Collision game === Collision game example Focal points can also have real-life applications. For example, imagine two bicycles headed towards each other and in danger of crashing. Avoiding collision becomes a coordination game where each player's winning choice depends on the other player's choice. Each player, in this case, has the choice to go straight, swerve to the left or swerve to the right. Both players want to avoid crashing, but neither knows what the other will do. In this case, the decision to swerve right can serve as a focal point which leads to the winning right-right outcome. It seems a natural focal point in places using right-hand traffic. This idea of anti-coordination game is also apparent in the game of chicken, which involves two cars racing toward each other on a collision course and in which the driver who first decides to swerve is seen as a coward, while no driver swerving results in a fatal collision for both. == See also == *Game theory *Coordination game *Simultaneous game *Surprisingly popular == References == == External links == * Rare Entries Contests (an example) and Common Entries Contests, games of respectively avoiding and seeking out focal points * TED community experiment on focal / Schelling points Category: Game theory ","title":"Focal point (game theory)"},{"id":"2583217","text":"Solid Steel Presents Hexstatic – \\"Listen & Learn\\" is a DJ mix album, mixed by Hexstatic, released as part of the Solid Steel mix series.All Music Guide to Hip Hop 2003 \\"In 2003 Hexstatic contributed a second volume to Coldcut's turntablist mix series Solid Steel: Listen and Learn\\" The album cover features a Speak & Spell – an educational toy, which was popular in the 1980s. ==Track listing== # \\"Telemetron\\" (Hexstatic Intro Dub) – Hexstatic # \\"Streetcrawler\\" – Monophone # \\"Mr. Scruff's Ninja Tune Megamix\\" (Hexstatic Edit) – DJ Food / \\"No, No, No\\" – Dawn Penn # \\"Solid Steel Scratch School\\" # \\"The Message\\" – DJ Grandmaster Flash # \\"Funky Mule\\" – Ike & Tina Turner # \\"Rip Rip\\" – David Holmes # \\"Funky Kingston\\" – Toots & the Maytals # \\"Jazzy John's Dub\\" – Stonebridge # \\"Solid Steel Rock School\\" # \\"Chrome Jam\\" – Trunk / \\"I'm Wild About That Thing\\" – Coldcut # \\"Aquarius\\" – Boards of Canada # \\"Easy Thing To Do\\" (Nightmares on Wax mix) – Shirley Bassey # \\"Daily Intake\\" – Unsung Heroes # \\"Wildstyle\\" – Timezone / \\"Hip Hop be Bop\\" – Man Parrish / \\"Boogie Down Dub\\" / \\"Walking On Sunshine\\" (A cappella) – Rockers Revenge # \\"Apache\\" – Michael Viners Incredible Bongo Band # \\"Know How\\" – Young MC # \\"Do Your Thing\\" – Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band # \\"Home Shopping\\" – Bobby Trafalgar ==References== Category:Hexstatic albums Category:DJ mix albums Category:2002 compilation albums Category:Ninja Tune compilation albums ","title":"Listen &amp; Learn (Hexstatic album)"},{"id":"2583228","text":"Marel Jóhann Baldvinsson (born 18 December 1980) is an Icelandic football forward who last played for Stjarnan. ==Club career== He started his career in Breiðablik, but moved to Norway early in his career. In October 1997, Marel went on trial with Manchester United. After a fruitless trial with Rosenborg BK, he signed with Stabæk with a deal worth 600,000 Euro. In January 2003 he was sold to the Belgian club Lokeren for just half of what Stabæk paid for him, 300,000 Euro, but with a clause giving 25% of the total transition in a later resale. In 2006, he was forced to cut short his career as a professional footballer due to injury. He rejoined Breiðablik in his native Iceland. After many impressive displays in the 2006 season, he was recalled into the Icelandic national team to face Spain in August 2006. A few days later he returned to professional football when he signed for Norwegian club Molde, in a deal worth 1,5 million Euro. In 2007, after two seasons at Molde, Marel had his contract terminated. On 30 December 2007 he signed a three-year contract with Breiðablik, starting his third stint at the club. He scored 6 goals in 19 games for the club and following a dispute with the club's management, reportedly revolving around wages, he left the club on 22 April 2009 and was signed by Valur.

He studied in Frankfurt with Julius Stockhausen, and in Milan with Francesco Lamperti. He had a fine dramatic voice and a handsome stage presence, and speedily made a reputation in Germany in the leading roles in Wagnerian opera. From 1885 onwards he also appeared in America and England. On November 9, 1887, Alvary appeared as the title character in the United States premiere of Wagner's Siegfried at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Vividly embodying Siegfried's youth and fiery individualism, the tenor created a sensation and became an idol of New York opera goers until his departure in 1889. In 1892, his performances as Tristan and Siegfried at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, aroused great enthusiasm. In October 1894, he was seriously injured in a fall while rehearsing Siegfried at Mannheim and never fully recovered; he retired from the stage in 1897.

It is based on OLE Automation (part of COM) and allows installation of additional scripting engines in the form of COM modules. ==Uses and history== The Active Scripting technologies were first released in 1996, with the release of the Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 (August 1996) and Internet Information Services 3.0 products (December 1996). Usual applications of Active Scripting include Active Server Pages (ASP) server scripts, Internet Explorer, and Windows Script Host (WSH) scripts automating routine tasks, including use for login scripts, Registry manipulation, and the like. Other administrative uses include Windows Management Instrumentation and Active Directory Service Interfaces. Active Scripting can also be used for general-purpose scripting, such as database programming, text-processing, rapid prototyping, and application macro/scripting programming; some applications use Active Scripting as the main automation method, others do not have a macro facility but the components are available for use via the API; or one may opt to add a language and/or tool not available by default, like programming Microsoft Excel in Perl or REXX rather than Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) or transferring data from a terminal emulator to word processor by way of a spreadsheet when they have dissimilar macro tools or none at all. For many of the above uses, Active Scripting is an addition to Windows that is similar to the functionality of Unix shell scripts, as well as an incremental improvement upon batch files (command.com), Windows NT style shell scripts (cmd.exe) and, by way of VBScript, the replacement for QBasic, which was last available on the supplementary disc for Windows 95. The majority of the languages used for Active Scripting mentioned below are glue languages, with Perl being the most commonly used third-party script engine. The interfaces to Active Scripting engines are public, so any developer can create applications that are programmable in Active Scripting languages as well as engines for additional languages. == Implementations == Active Scripting engines are available for several languages. Some of the most popular include: * VBScript and JScript engines are included with the default installation of Windows versions after Windows 95, and are an optional install with CE. * Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is a third default scripting engine. It is not part of the Windows installation and requires Microsoft Office, or other software packages that are VBA-programmable to be installed. In some cases multiple software packages may share the same VBA installation. * A Perl engine provided as part of the ActivePerl distribution. * A Python engine provided as part of the pywin32 extension. * The standard PHP installation for Windows includes an engine known as ActivePHP and PHPScript in various versions. * Haskell. * REXX (multiple versions). * Delphi. * XSLT. * Tcl. * Fortran. * Lua. * Ruby * The DCL-based scripting language XLNT comes with a scripting engine as well. In Windows, CScript.exe at the command line and WScript.exe running in the GUI are the main means of implementation of installed Active Script languages. Clicking on an icon or running from the command line, a script, the Run dialogue, etc. will by default run a plain text file containing the code. A Windows Script File (.wsf) is an XML file that can contain more than one script in more than one language in addition to other elements, and are executed by the Windows Script Host. The third-party shell Take Command can, as of version 10, be configured for direct interoperability with the script host and its installed engines; a WSH engine based on the Take Command language is reportedly now in development. Some software such as SecureCRT use the WSH functionality to allow automation by means of any installed scripting engine. The script host, related components, and engines are able to be integrated into and called from Windows applications just like any other component. == Current Status == Active scripting is regarded complete, and no longer under active development by Microsoft. However, the technology is still being supported by Microsoft's Sustaining Engineering Team, which is responsible for bug fixes and security enhancements. Furthermore, scripting engines will continue to be shipped with future releases of Microsoft Windows and IIS.Rumours of VBScript's Death Have Been Greatly Exaggerated, on Eric Lippert's Blog Fabulous Adventures In Coding on MSDN (April 09, 2004). Originally, the .NET Framework had a scripting technology of its own and a separate scripting IDE called Visual Studio for Applications (VSA),Script Happens .NET, article by Andrew Clinick of Microsoft Corporation, in Scripting Clinic on MSDN (July 25, 2001).Microsoft Takes Wraps Off VSA Development Technology , by Scott Bekker on Redmondmag.com (January 16, 2001). and the interfaces to the technology were also available via Active Scripting, allowing even .NET-unaware applications to be scripted using .NET languages.

At the time there was a demand for non-integral vehicles, because operators wished to have the chassis bodied by other manufacturers. Thus Leyland created the B45 project, which was named Olympian, in 1979. This was in many ways an update of the popular Bristol VRT (Bristol Commercial Vehicles merged with Leyland in 1965), with many VR customers choosing Olympians. Later the Olympian also replaced the Leyland Atlantean. The Olympian was unveiled at the 1980 Commercial Motor Show.Olympian launch at last Commercial Motor 4 October 1980 It was available in two lengths, 9.56m and 10.25m. The engine was either the Leyland TL11 unit (a development of the Leyland O.680: both were of 11.1 litre capacity) or the Gardner 6LXB or 6LXCT. Some later Olympians had Cummins L10 engines. One Olympian had a 5LXCT. For the export market a three-axle version was built with lengths of 10.4m, 11.32m and 11.95m. This was very popular with operators such as Kowloon Motor Bus. In 1988, Leyland developed an air- conditioned version of the Olympian, with the refrigerant compressor driven by the main engine instead of a separate engine. Between 1979 and 1981, nine demonstrators were built, before the first production Olympian entered service with Ribble Motor Services in August 1981.Leyland Olympian Bus Fleet lists on the Web2101 Leyland Olympian Ribble Vehicle Preservation Trust The Olympian was initially manufactured at the former Bristol factory in Brislington with the first thousand completed here. In 1983, production transferred to Leyland's Farington and Workington plants.

In 2003, 54 were repatriated to the United Kingdom to operate express services for Megabus. All Hong Kong franchised Olympians had been withdrawn by October 2011. The non- franchised, open-topped, air-conditioned double deckers and private hire buses were withdrawn by 2015 due to their non-compliance with Hong Kong's emission regulations.

It was displayed at the 1980 Commercial Motor Show in the UK and was described as a \\"Far Eastern\\" prototype. It had a 3+2 transverse seating arrangement unseen in Singapore but common in Hong Kong then with a seating capacity of 97, but was eventually refitted to the standard 2+2 transverse seating arrangement before export. When registered, it bore a unique demonstration livery with the company's 1978 corporate logo not unlike a Leyland Leopard demonstrator also with SBS then. It was deployed on route 162 until its withdrawal in late 1982. It was subsequently repatriated to the UK where it worked with the City of Oxford Motor Services afterwards.Land Transport Guru - Leyland Olympian Satisfied with the trial, SBS ordered 200 Leyland Olympian 2-Axles fitted with Alexander R bodywork of which they were SBS's last Leyland engined buses. Registered between 1986 and 1988, these buses were deployed to Toa Payoh, Ang Mo Kio and Jurong bus depots. In the late 1990s, they were massively redeployed to serve routes mainly in the industrial and suburban regions as most routes plying downtown were transitioning to a fully air-conditioned fleet. At the same time, some of these buses had 3 pairs of seats removed on the offside to create a standee area, while others were refitted with Allison gearboxes and new seat upholsterers. When SBS was renamed as SBS Transit in late 2001, none of these units received the SBS Transit livery as they were nearing the end of their statutory lifespan. All units were withdrawn between 2001 and 2003. 2 Leyland Olympian 2-Axle were preserved. One was converted into an \\"NYC The Red Bus\\" office and preserved as a static exhibit at Youth Park. The other was re- registered and converted to a playschool bus and was parked at various places, It has since been decommissioned and is now preserved at Jubilee Pat's Schoolhouse as a static exhibit since 2008.The fate of SBS7196Z In 1992, SBS ordered another 200 Leyland Olympians, all of which were fitted with the then all new Walter Alexander Royale bodywork. Registered between 1993 and 1994, they were Singapore's first air-conditioned and tri-axle double deck buses and hence nicknamed the \\"Superbus\\" owing to their massive specifications at that time. They were also the last Leylands to be built globally. Originally deployed to all SBS depots islandwide, they were consolidated into Ang Mo Kio, Braddell Bus Park, and Soon Lee bus depots in the mid 2000s. Unlike their 2-axle counterparts and Volvo Olympians, none of these units received a standee area as the air-conditioning filter was right above the seats. Withdrawal of these buses began in 2010, and the last buses were retired in April 2013. SBS9168S, the last Leyland Olympian built, was repatriated to England in 2013 and is currently preserved by Dave Rogers and re-registered as L888 SBS.Last Leyland Olympian Built The Leyland Society 11 November 2014 ==Leyland sale== In 1988, Leyland was purchased by Volvo, who only continued with the Olympian and Lynx due to the vast number of outstanding orders. More buses also went to Dublin Bus, London Transport, China Motor Bus and Hong Kong Citybus. The completion of the final orders from Strathclyde Buses, Dublin Bus, China Motor Bus, Citybus and Singapore Bus Services saw the discontinuation of the Leyland Olympian, with the last delivered to Singapore Bus Services, and the plant in Workington closed. The Leyland Olympian was superseded by the Volvo Olympian, with the existing chassis retained and a Volvo TD102KF engine replacing the Gardner engine option.Volvo power for Olympian Commercial Motor 27 February 1992Volvo opens bus lines in Irvine Commercial Motor 1 April 1993 It remained in production until 2000. ==References== * * ==External links== * * Olympian Category:Open-top buses Category:Tri-axle buses Category:Double-decker buses Olympian Category:Vehicles introduced in 1980 Category:Bus chassis ","title":"Leyland Olympian"},{"id":"2583286","text":"CT image showing extensive low attenuation in the right hemispheric white matter due to dilated Type 2 perivascular spaces Axial fat suppressed T2 weighted MRI image in the same patient as above demonstrating extensive dilated Type 2 perivascular spaces in the right hemisphere Perivascular space is depicted in the inset box. A perivascular space, also known as a Virchow–Robin space, is a fluid-filled space surrounding certain blood vessels in several organs, including the brain, potentially having an immunological function, but more broadly a dispersive role for neural and blood-derived messengers. The brain pia mater is reflected from the surface of the brain onto the surface of blood vessels in the subarachnoid space. In the brain, perivascular cuffs are regions of leukocyte aggregation in the perivascular spaces, usually found in patients with viral encephalitis. Perivascular spaces vary in dimension according to the type of blood vessel. In the brain where most capillaries have an imperceptible perivascular space, select structures of the brain, such as the circumventricular organs, are notable for having large perivascular spaces surrounding highly permeable capillaries, as observed by microscopy. The median eminence, a brain structure at the base of the hypothalamus, contains capillaries with wide perivascular spaces. In humans, perivascular spaces surround arteries and veins can usually be seen as areas of dilatation on MRI images. While many normal brains will show a few dilated spaces, an increase in these spaces may correlate with the incidence of several neurodegenerative diseases, making the spaces a topic of research. ==Structure== Perivascular spaces are gaps containing interstitial fluid that span between blood vessels and their host organ, such as the brain, which they penetrate and serve as extravascular channels through which solutes can pass. Like the blood vessels around which they form, perivascular spaces are found in both the brain subarachnoid space and the subpial space. Perivascular spaces surrounding arteries in the cerebral cortex and the basal ganglia are separated from the subpial space by one or two layers of leptomeninges, respectively, as well as the pia mater. By virtue of the leptomeningeal cell layer, the perivascular spaces belonging to the subarachnoid space are continuous with those of the subpial space. The direct communication between the perivascular spaces of the subarachnoid space and the subpial space is unique to the brain’s arteries, as no leptomeningeal layers surround the brain’s veins. Use of the scanning electron microscope has determined that the spaces surrounding blood vessels in the subarachnoid space are not continuous with the subarachnoid space because of the presence of pia mater cells joined by desmosomes. Perivascular spaces, especially around fenestrated capillaries, are found in many organs, such as the thymus, liver, kidneys, spleen, bones, and pineal gland. Particularly within the brain circumventricular organs - subfornical organ, area postrema, and median eminence - large perivascular spaces are present around fenestrated capillaries, indicating that the spaces serve a dispersive role for brain- or bloodborne messengers. Perivascular spaces may be enlarged to a diameter of five millimeters in healthy humans and do not imply disease. When enlarged, they can disrupt the function of the brain regions into which they project. Dilation can occur on one or both sides of the brain. Dilated perivascular spaces are categorized into three types: * Type 1 are located on the lenticulostriate arteries projecting into the basal ganglia * Type 2 are located in the cortex following the path of the medullary arteries * Type 3 are located in the midbrain Perivascular spaces are most commonly located in the basal ganglia, thalamus, midbrain, cerebellum, hippocampus, insular cortex, the white matter of the cerebrum, and along the optic tract. The ideal method used to visualize perivascular spaces is T2-weighted MRI. The MR images of other neurological disorders can be similar to those of the dilated spaces. These disorders are: *cystic neoplasms *lacunar infarctions *cystic periventricular leukomalacia *cryptococcosis *multiple sclerosis *mucopolysaccharidoses *neurocysticercosis *arachnoid cysts *neuroepithelial cysts Perivascular spaces are distinguished on an MRI by several key features. The spaces appear as distinct round or oval entities with a signal intensity visually equivalent to that of cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space. In addition, a perivascular space has no mass effect and is located along the blood vessel around which it forms. ==Function== One of the most basic roles of the perivascular space is the regulation of fluid movement in the central nervous system and its drainage. The spaces ultimately drain fluid from neuronal cell bodies to the cervical lymph nodes. In particular, the “tide hypothesis” suggests that the cardiac contraction creates and maintains pressure waves to modulate the flow to and from the subarachnoid space and the perivascular space. By acting as a sort of sponge, they are essential for signal transmission and the maintenance of extracellular fluid. Another function is as an integral part of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). While the BBB is often described as the tight junctions between the endothelial cells, this is an oversimplification that neglects the intricate role that perivascular spaces take in separating the venous blood from the parenchyma of the brain. Often, cell debris and foreign particles, which are impermeable to the BBB will get through the endothelial cells, only to be phagocytosed in the perivascular spaces. This holds true for many T and B cells, as well as monocytes, giving this small fluid filled space an important immunological role. Perivascular spaces also play an important role in immunoregulation; they not only contain interstitial and cerebrospinal fluid, but they also have a constant flux of macrophages, which is regulated by blood-borne mononuclear cells, but do not pass the basement membrane of the glia limitans. Similarly, as part of its role in signal transmission, perivascular spaces contain vasoactive neuropeptides (VNs), which, aside from regulating blood pressure and heart rate, have an integral role in controlling microglia. VNs serve to prevent inflammation by activating the enzyme adenylate cyclase which then produces cAMP. The production of cAMP aids in the modulation of auto-reactive T cells by regulatory T cells. . The perivascular space is susceptible space for VN compromise and when their function is reduced in the space, immune response is adversely affected and the potential for degradation increases. When inflammation by T cells begins, astrocytes begin to undergo apoptosis, due to their CD95 receptor, to open up the glia limitans and let T cells into the parenchyma of the brain. Because this process is aided by the perivascular macrophages, these tend to accumulate during neuroinflammation and cause dilation of the spaces. ==Clinical significance== The clinical significance of perivascular spaces comes primarily from their tendency to dilate. The importance of dilation is hypothesized to be based on changes in shape rather than size. Enlarged spaces have been observed most commonly in the basal ganglia, specifically on the lenticulostriate arteries. They have also been observed along the paramedial mesencephalothalamic artery and the substantia nigra in the mesencephalon, the brain region below the insula, the dentate nucleus in the cerebellum, and the corpus callosum, as well as the brain region directly above it, the cingulate gyrus. Upon the clinical application of MRI, it was shown in several studies that perivascular space dilation and lacunar strokes are the most commonly observed histological correlates of signaling abnormalities. ===Senescence=== Dilation is most commonly and closely associated with aging. Dilation of perivascular spaces has been shown to correlate best with age, even when accompanying factors including hypertension, dementia, and white matter lesions are considered. In the elderly, such dilation has been correlated with many symptoms and conditions which often affect the arterial walls, including vascular hypertension, arteriosclerosis, reduced cognitive capacity, dementia, and low post-mortem brain weight. In addition to dilation among the elderly, dilation in young, healthy individuals can also be observed. This occurrence is rare and there has been no observed association in such cases with reduced cognitive function or white matter abnormalities. When dilated VRS are observed in the corpus callosum, there is generally no neurological deficit associated. They are often observed in this region as cystic lesions with cerebrospinal-like fluid. ===Symptoms of dilation=== Extreme dilation has been associated with several specific clinical symptoms. In cases of severe dilation in only one hemisphere, symptoms reported include a non-specific fainting attack, hypertension, positional vertigo, headache, early recall disturbances, and hemifacial tics. Symptoms associated with severe bilateral dilation include ear pain (which was reported to have resolved on its own), dementia, and seizures. This data was compiled from case studies of individuals with severe VRS dilation. Considering the anatomical abnormality presented in such cases, these findings were considered surprising in that the symptoms were relatively mild. In most cases there is in fact no mass effect associated with some VRS dilation. An exception to the mildness of clinical symptoms associated with VRS dilation is when there is extreme dilation in the lower mesencephalon at the junction between the substantia nigra and cerebral peduncle. In such cases, mild to moderate obstructive hydrocephalus was reported in most patients. Associated symptoms ranged from headaches to symptoms more severe than those just discussed in the cases of dilation in the cerebral hemispheres. Other general symptoms associated with VRS dilation include headaches, dizziness, memory impairment, poor concentration, dementia, visual changes, oculomotor abnormality, tremors, seizures, limb weakness, and ataxia. ===Associated disorders=== Dilation is a typical characteristic of several diseases and disorders. These include diseases from metabolic and genetic disorders such as mannosidosis, myotonic dystrophy, Lowe syndrome, and Coffin–Lowry syndrome. Dilation is also a common characteristic of diseases or disorders of vascular pathologies, including CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy), hereditary infantile hemiparesis, retinal arteriolar tortuosity and leukoencephalopathy, migraines, and vascular dementia. A third group disorders typically associated with VRS dilation are neuroectodermal syndromes. This includes polycystic brains associated with ectodermal dysplasia, frontonasal dysplasia, and Joubert syndrome. There is a fourth miscellaneous group of disorders typically associated with dilation which include autism in children, Megalencephalopathy, Secondary Parkinson’s Disease, recent-onset multiple sclerosis and chronic alcoholism. Because dilation can be associated with several diseases but also observed in healthy patients, it is always important in the evaluation of VRS to study the tissue around the dilation via MRI and to consider the entire clinical context. ==Current research== ===Causes of dilated VRS=== Much of the current research concerning Virchow–Robin spaces relates to their known tendency to dilate. Research is presently being performed in order to determine the exact cause of dilation in these perivascular spaces. Current theories include mechanical trauma resulting from cerebrospinal fluid pulsation, elongation of ectactic penetrating blood vessels, and abnormal vascular permeability leading to increased fluid exudation. Further research has implicated shrinkage or atrophy of surrounding brain tissue, perivascular demyelination, coiling of the arteries as they age, altered permeability of the arterial wall and obstruction of lymphatic drainage pathways. In addition, insufficient fluid draining and injury to ischemic perivascular tissue resulting in an ex vacuo effect have been suggested as possible causes for dilated VRS. ===Association of dilated VRS and other diseases=== Recent and ongoing research has found associations between enlarged VRS and several disorders. ====Dementia==== At one point in time, dilated Virchow–Robin spaces were so commonly noted in autopsies of persons with dementia, they were believed to cause the disease. However, additional research is currently being performed in order to confirm or refute a direct connection between dilation of VRS and dementia. Analysis of VRS may distinguish dementia caused by arteriosclerotic microvascular disease from dementia caused by neurodegenerative disease. A 2005 study has evidenced that a substantial amount of VRS in the substantia innominata, lentiform nucleus, and the caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia may implicate dementia due to arteriosclerotic microvascular disease, in particular Ischemic Vascular Dementia, as opposed dementia due to neurodegenerative disease, specifically Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia. Thus, perhaps VRS dilation can be used to distinguish between diagnoses of vascular dementias and degenerative dementias. ====Alzheimer's disease==== Some studies have assessed the spatial distribution and prevalence of VRS in people with Alzheimer's disease versus those without the disease. Researchers have found that while VRS appear to be correlated with natural aging, MR imaging reveals a greater prevalence of VRS in those with Alzheimer's. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a blood vessel failure often associated with Alzheimer's disease, utilizes dilated VRS to spread inflammation to the parenchyma. Because the VRS often have an extra membrane in gray matter, the ischemic CAA response is often observed in white matter. It has been hypothesized that the structure of VRS in the cerebral cortex may contribute to the development of Alzheimer’s disease. In contrast to VRS of the basal ganglia, VRS in the cerebral cortex are surrounded by only one layer of leptomeninges. As such, VRS in the cerebral cortex may drain β-amyloid in interstitial fluid less effectively than VRS in the basal ganglia. The less-effective drainage may lead to the development of the β-amyloid plaques that characterize Alzheimer’s disease. In support of this hypothesis, studies have noted the greater frequency of β-amyloid plaques in the cerebral cortex than in the basal ganglia of Alzheimer’s disease patients. ====Stroke==== Because dilated perivascular spaces are so closely correlated with cerebrovascular disease, there is much current research on their use as a diagnostic tool. In a recent study of 31 subjects, abnormal dilation, along with irregular CSF pulsation, were correlated with those subjects having three or more risk factors for strokes. Therefore, perivascular spaces are a possible novel biomarker for hemorrhagic strokes. CADASIL syndrome (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy syndrome) is a hereditary stroke condition due to a Notch 3 gene mutation on Chromosome 19. Studies have noted that in comparison to family members lacking the affected haplotype that leads to the condition, an increased number of dilated spaces is observed in individuals with CADASIL. These perivascular spaces are localized primarily in the putamen and temporal subcortical white matter and they appear to correlate with age of the individual with the condition rather than severity of the disease itself. There has been a high risk of stroke associated with dilated perivascular spaces in the elderly according to the Framingham Stroke Risk Score. In contrast, other studies have concluded that the dilation of these spaces is a normal phenomenon in aging with no association with arterosclerosis. This remains, therefore, an important point of research in the field. ====Multiple sclerosis==== Similar to the research concerning a potential connection between perivascular spaces and Alzheimer's, MRI scans of people recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) have been studied. Larger, more prevalent spaces have been observed in those with MS. Additional studies with similar findings have suggested that the inflammatory cells which contribute to the demyelination that characterizes MS also attack the perivascular spaces. Studies using advanced MRI techniques will be necessary to determine if the perivascular spaces can be implicated as a potential marker of the disease. ====Autism==== Dilated perivascular spaces are common among the elderly and uncommon in children. Studies have noted the association between both developmental delay and non-syndromic autism and enlarged or dilated perivascular spaces. Non-syndromic autism categorizes autistic patients for which there is no known cause. ==History== The appearance of perivascular spaces was first noted in 1843 by Durant-Fardel. In 1851, Rudolph Virchow was the first to provide a detailed description of these microscopic spaces between the outer and inner/middle lamina of the brain vessels. Charles-Philippe Robin confirmed these findings in 1859 and was the first to describe the perivascular spaces as channels that existed in normal anatomy. The spaces were called Virchow-Robin spaces and are still also known as such. The immunological significance was discovered by Wilhelm His, Sr. in 1865 based on his observations of the flow of interstitial fluid over the spaces to the lymphatic system. For many years after Virchow-Robin spaces were first described, it was thought that they were in free communication with the cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space. It was later shown with the use of electron microscopy that the pia mater serves as separation between the two. Upon the application of MRI, measurements of the differences of signal intensity between the perivascular spaces and cerebrospinal fluid supported these findings. As research technologies continued to expand, so too did information regarding their function, anatomy and clinical significance. ==References== Category:Rudolf Virchow Category:Meninges Category:Neurohistology ","title":"Perivascular space"},{"id":"2583291","text":"Alf Tupper Alf Tupper is a British comic strip, created by Bill Blaine (probably a pseudonym for William Blaine, head of DC Thomson comics), written by Gilbert Lawford Dalton. It stars a working class, \\"hard as nails\\" runner, whose adventures appeared in The Rover from 1949 and then The Victor, British boys' comics from D. C. Thomson & Co. Ltd. His adventures appeared over almost a 40-year period, until 1992, under the title The Tough of the Track. Many artists have written and drawn his stories, including Pete Sutherland, during his run in The Victor. In April 2014 Alf Tupper returned in a monthly one-page comic-strip feature in the international athletics magazine Athletics Weekly. ==Alf Tupper's storyline and character== Whatever his job and wherever it was located, Alf was the eternal underdog. Regarded as a \\"guttersnipe\\" by the posh blokes from the Amateur Athletic Association, he was at his best the day after a night on late shift, lifting heavy objects and getting little sleep. His journey to the track (often White City) almost invariably involved falling asleep on the train and missing his stop. Sometimes his tardiness was caused by skullduggery of the worst kind by \\"stuck-up\\" rich boys from a university somewhere, but usually it was because he could not stop himself from rescuing people in distress or just generally being a selfless chap. Regardless of this, he always got there in the nick of time and, having just finished his fish and chips, went on to win the championships or even, in \\"end of series\\" stories, break the world record for the mile and utter his famous catchphrase \\"I ran 'em all!” Vic Whittle writes: > Alf Tupper was 18 years of age when he first appeared in Rover in 1949 and > he continued his adventures in Victor in the early 1960s.

Alf's staple diet was fish and chips wrapped in newspaper. ==Appearances== The 1950s (The Rover – No. 1303) version of Alf was variously, a millwright at Greystone Aviation Factory and (The Rover – No. 1338) a plumber in the employ of Charlie Chipping of Gas Street, Graystone. The 1968 version of Alf, (in The Victor Book for Boys) is a self-employed welder – \\"Welding done here\\" – and is still located under the railway arches in fictional Greystone, a drab town with cobbled streets where heavy industry employs thousands of manual workers. By the 1970s, some of the early 1950s storylines were being re-introduced to a new generation. There was even a 'prequel' series about Alf's \\"rough tough boyhood\\" and his struggle with the authorities as an orphan (began in The Victor 0626 dated 17 February 1973). Alf's last published appearance came in the Scottish newspaper, The Sunday Post in 1992 and featured Alf in training for the Barcelona Olympic games. ==In popular culture== UK punk rock band The Boys referred to their producer as \\"Alf Tupper\\", as a tribute to their hero.

He married Jannice Henry, a nurse from Marlow, Buckinghamshire, in 1961 and had two daughters (born in 1962 and 1965).https://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/porter-peter During this period he worked in advertising, and was beginning to find work in the literary presshttps://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/porter- peterhttps://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/feb/07/peter-porter-interview- poetry. Jannice committed suicide in 1974, greatly affecting Porter's work, in particular The Cost of Seriousness.https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/interview-peter-porter In 1991 Porter married Christine Berg, a child psychologist. In 2001, he was named Poet in Residence at the Royal Albert Hall. In 2004 he was a candidate for the position of Professor of Poetry at Oxford University. In 2007, he was made a Royal Society of Literature Companion of Literature, an honour bestowed on a maximum of ten living writers. Porter died on 23 April 2010, aged 81, after suffering from liver cancer for a year. After news of Porter's death in 2010, the Australian Book Review announced it would rename its ABR Poetry Prize the Peter Porter Poetry Prize in honour of Porter. ==Work== His poems first appeared in the Summer 1958 and October 1959 issues of Delta.Kaiser, p 99 The publication of his poem Metamorphosis in The Times Literary Supplement in January 1960 brought his work to a wider audience.TLS No. 3021. Kaiser, p. 99 His first collection Once Bitten Twice Bitten was published by Scorpion Press in 1961. Influences on his work include: W. H. Auden, John Ashbery, and Wallace Stevens. . He went through distinct poetic stages, from the epigrams and satires of his early works Once Bitten Twice Bitten, to the elegiac mode of his later ones; The Cost of Seriousness and English Subtitles. In a recorded conversation with his friend Clive James he stated that the \\"glory of present-day English writing in America, in Australia and in Britain, is what is left over of the old regular metrical pattern and how that can be adapted to the new sense that the main element, the main fixture of poetry is no longer the foot (you know, the iambus or the trochee) but the cadence. It seems that what is very important is to get the best of the old authority, the best of the old discipline along with the best of the new freedom of expression.\\" In 1983 Porter was a judge in the Booker–McConnell Prize. ==Awards== * 1983 Duff Cooper Memorial Prize for his first Collected Poems * 1988 Whitbread Poetry Award for Automatic Oracle * 1990 Australian Literature Society Gold Medal for Possible Worlds * 1997 Age Book of the Year Poetry Prize Co-winner for Dragons in their Pleasant Palaces * 1998 The First King's Lynn Award for Merit in Poetry * 2000 Philip Hodgins Memorial Medal at the Mildura Writer's Festival * 2002 Forward Poetry Prize for Max Is Missing * 2002 Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry * 2004 Medal of the Order of AustraliaIt's an Honour * 2004 Honorary Fellow of the English Association, UK * 2007 Royal Society of Literature Companion of Literature * 2009 Honorary Doctorate, Nottingham Trent University * 2009 Age Book of the Year Poetry Prize for Better Than God ==Books== ===Poetry collections=== * Once Bitten Twice Bitten, Scorpion Press, 1961 * Poems Ancient and Modern, Scorpion Press, 1964 * A Porter Folio, Scorpion Press, 1969 * The Last of England, Oxford University Press, 1970 * After Martial, Oxford University Press, 1972 * Preaching to the Converted, Oxford University Press, 1972 * Jonah, with Arthur Boyd Secker & Warburg, 1973 * Living in a Calm Country, Oxford University Press, 1975 * The Lady and the Unicorn, with Arthur Boyd Secker & Warburg, 1975 * The Cost of Seriousness, Oxford University Press, 1978 * English Subtitles, Oxford University Press, 1981 * Fast Forward, Oxford University Press, 1984 * Narcissus with Arthur Boyd, Seckers & Warburg, London, 1984 * The Automatic Oracle, Oxford University Press, 1987 * Mars, with Arthur Boyd Deutsch, 1987 * Possible Worlds, Oxford University Press, 1989 * The Chair of Babel, Oxford University Press, 1992 * Millennial Fables, Oxford University Press, 1994 * Dragons in Their Pleasant Palaces, Oxford University Press, 1997 * Both Ends Against the Middle, 1999 as a section in Collected Poems Volume 2 * Max Is Missing, Picador/Macmillan, 2001 * Afterburner, Picador/Macmillan, 2004 * Better Than God, Picador, 2009 * Chorale at the Crossing, Pan Macmillan 2016 (Posthumous) ===Selected and collected poetry=== * Collected Poems, Oxford University Press, 1983. * A Porter Selected: Poems 1959-1989\\\\.

The leaves are in opposite pairs, triangular and crenate, sessile or with short petioles. The flowers are deep blue with a zygomorphic (bilaterally-symmetrical) four-lobed corolla, wide. The capsules are wider than they are long. The blossoms of this plant wilt very quickly upon picking, which has given it the ironic name \\"Männertreu\\", or \\"men's faithfulness\\" in German.Friedhelm Sauerhoff, Pflanzennamen im Vergleich: Benennungstheorie und Etymologie [Plant names compared: theory of naming and etymology] (Stuttgart, Germany: Franz Steiner, 2001), page 206: Das bestätigt auch E. Mießner, wenn er zum Gamander-Ehrenpreis feststellt: \\"Da die Blüten leicht abfallen, auch deutscher Spottname 'Männertreu'...\\" (E. Mießner also confirms that, when he observes about Veronica chamaedrys: \\"Since the blossoms easily fall off, [it is] also [known by] the derisive German nickname, 'men's faithfulness'...\\") Veronica chamaedrys is a common, hardy turf weed when it invades turf and lawns. It creeps along the ground, spreading by sending down roots at the stem nodes. It is propagated both by seed and stem fragments. Leaves may defoliate in the summer and winter but the stems will grow again next season. Unlike at least five other common speedwell turf weeds, such as corn speedwell (Veronica arvensis),other Turf Weeds at Virginia Tech: corn speedwell, Veronica arvensis http://turfweeds.contentsrvr.net/category_detail.pg_24.vesh the leaves are opposite both on the upper and lower parts of the plant.Turf Weeds at Virginia Tech; germander speedwell, Veronica chamaedrys: http://turfweeds.contentsrvr.net/category_detail.pg_17.veshWeed ID & info; Department of Crop and Soil Sciences, Michigan State University and Ronald Calhoun: http://www.msuturfweeds.net/details/_/germander_speedwell_13/ See the Veronica for special weed control considerations. ==Distribution== This species is native to Europe and Asia west of the Ural Mountains.http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/di/scrophularia/veron/verochav.jpg It is found on other continents as an introduced species. ==Uses== Veronica chamaedrys has been used in traditional Austrian herbal medicine internally (as tea) for disorders of the nervous system, respiratory tract, cardiovascular system, and metabolism. In 18th century Britain, the plant had the reputation of being a cure for gout as well as being popular for making tea, the latter being so prevalent that the plant was nearly eradicated from London during the 18th century. ==References== ==External links== *Jepson Manual Treatment *Washington Burke Museum *Photo gallery Category:Veronica (plant) Category:Flora of Asia Category:Flora of Europe Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Veronica chamaedrys"},{"id":"2583307","text":"Peter John Debnam (born 21 April 1954), is a former Australian politician. He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly representing Vaucluse between 1994 and 2011. Debnam is a former Leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party, Leader of the Opposition and Shadow Minister for Western Sydney, Redfern/Waterloo and Citizenship. He also held the shadow portfolios of Infrastructure and Energy. ==Biography== Debnam's early years of schooling were at Frenchs Forest Public School and The Forest High School. Debnam was educated at the Royal Australian Naval College, where he graduated in 1974. He served in the Royal Australian Navy from 1972 to 1980. During his Naval career, Debnam served on many ships including the aircraft carrier , destroyer escort , destroyers and and patrol boats and . After leaving the Navy, Debnam studied at the Macquarie Graduate School of Management, where he gained an MBA. He held positions at Dalgety Farmers Limited, Hawker de Havilland and Australian Aircraft Consortium before entering politics. In 1994 Debnam was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, winning a by-election for the safe Liberal seat of Vaucluse. The following year the Liberal government was defeated by Labor under Bob Carr. Between 1997 and 2005 Debnam was successively Shadow Minister for Housing and for Planning and Urban Affairs, Shadow Treasurer, Shadow Minister for Transport, Shadow Minister for Police and Shadow Minister for Transport Services. Following John Brogden's sudden resignation as Liberal Leader in August 2005, the Deputy Leader, Barry O'Farrell, was initially the favourite to become leader, but Debnam steadily gained ground as he lobbied Liberal MPs, and on 31 August O'Farrell withdrew from the contest. ==Allegations against Attorney-General== On 16 November 2006, Debnam suggested under Parliamentary Privilege that NSW Attorney-General Bob Debus was under investigation by the Police Integrity Commission. In response, the Government released a police report stating that a minister had been the subject of complaints (not an investigation), and that they were dismissed in 2003 as spurious and groundless. The report did not name the minister concerned as it was, deemed to be 'not in the public interest'. When Mr Debnam declined to provide evidence to support his claims, he was censured by Parliament for misleading the House. It was subsequently reported that Debnam's source for the accusation was a convicted child sex offender and bank robber with a history of making unsubstantiated allegations. Opinion poll support for the Opposition leader declined markedly in the wake of the allegations, which also distracted attention from a campaign against the Government over the sacking of Ministers Milton Orkopoulos and Carl Scully. ==2007 election== Peter Debnam led the Liberal/National coalition to defeat in the 2007 state election. The Coalition gained a total of four seats from Labor and independents—too few to significantly reduce Labor's majority. Following the election, his deputy, O'Farrell, announced he would challenge Debnam for the Liberal leadership. When it was apparent that Debnam did not have enough support to keep his post, he withdrew from the contest on 2 April 2007, effectively handing the leadership to O'Farrell. On 11 April 2007 O'Farrell appointed Debnam as opposition infrastructure and energy spokesman. He resigned in May 2008 because of his party's decision to support the Labor Government's plan to privatise the electricity system. He retired from Parliament prior to the 2011 state election. ==References== ==Bibliography== * ==External links== *Speeches in Parliament by Peter Debnam *Peter Debnam's Web Page Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Liberal Party of Australia members of the Parliament of New South Wales Category:People from Sydney Category:Royal Australian Navy officers Category:Graduates of the Royal Australian Naval College Category:Australian businesspeople Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:Leaders of the Opposition in New South Wales Category:Macquarie University alumni Category:21st-century Australian politicians ","title":"Peter Debnam"},{"id":"2583314","text":"The Indigenous Team of the Century (Australian rules football) was selected to recognise the role of Indigenous Australians in the sport.

United States border preclearance facilities are prescreening border controls operated by the United States Department of Homeland Security at airports and other ports of departure located outside the United States under agreement between the host country and the federal government of the United States. Travelers are subject to immigration and customs inspections by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers before boarding their transportation onward to the United States. Preclearance applies to all passengers regardless of their nationality or purpose of travel. Upon arrival, pre-cleared passengers are treated as domestic passengers and do not need to be screened again. This process is intended to streamline border procedures, reduce congestion at American ports of entry, and facilitate travel into airports that otherwise lack customs processing facilities. Preclearance facilities were first introduced in Toronto under an informal arrangement with the Canadian government, and are now available at eight major Canadian airports with facilities under consideration at sea ports and rail stations. Arrangements also exist with some airports in Bermuda, The Bahamas, Aruba, Ireland, and the United Arab Emirates. Passengers traveling from a preclearance port arrive in the United States as domestic travelers, but are still subject to reinspection at the discretion of Customs and Border Protection. ==Reasons for implementation== The preclearance program was introduced as an informal arrangement between Canada and the United States in 1952 at the request of American Airlines. The program aims to streamline border procedures for flights entering the United States, reduce congestion at ports of entry, and to facilitate travel into U.S. airports that may not be equipped to otherwise handle international travelers. Although more U.S. airports have expanded or introduced customs facilities since the preclearance program began, LaGuardia Airport and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport remain the two largest U.S. airports without customs facilities for processing commercial flights. Preclearance programs have been accused of being motivated by a desire to prevent the arrival of asylum seekers, who are otherwise protected under the 1951 Refugee Convention's provisions on non-refoulement once they arrive at their destination. ==Benefits and drawbacks== Preclearance is particularly beneficial to those who have an ongoing connection (such as a connecting flight) upon arrival in the U.S., as there is no risk of border delays causing them to miss such a connection. A corresponding drawback, however, is that a delay in preclearance could cause the passenger to miss the outbound flight. Air travelers with further connections have their baggage checked through to their destination; without preclearance, the baggage would have to be collected prior to customs inspection and then rechecked onto the subsequent flight. Another advantage is that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers are able to ultimately exclude inadmissible passengers and prohibited goods before a flight, train journey, or voyage commences. This saves CBP the hassle of dealing with them on U.S. soil, thus helping minimise the risk of any untoward incident happening there. Therefore, when a person is denied entry into the United States, he or she is not allowed to board the US-bound flight and has merely to leave the airport by land transport instead of being put on a return flight (unless the passenger arrived at the preclearance airport from an earlier flight). Preclearance also provides considerable flexibility to the airlines operating in those routes where such a program is available. For example, major U.S. airlines and their subsidiaries routinely operate many daily flights from locations like Toronto or Nassau to New York City. Thanks to the presence of preclearance facilities in Toronto and Nassau, the airlines can choose to conveniently direct their flights from these locations to land at LaGuardia Airport (which has no border protection facilities) instead of John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) or Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), allowing them to save valuable space at JFK and EWR for their other international arrivals. Preclearance exists at most major Canadian airports, theoretically enabling more convenient travel from those cities to the United States. The waits at some busy preclearance facilities, notably Toronto Pearson Airport (the busiest U.S. preclearance facility),https://www.torontopearson.com/en/Preclearance/# can often exceed the waiting times of non-precleared flights at the destination and cause significant delays to departure schedules. With the notable exceptions of LaGuardia Airport and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, many U.S. airports now have more customs facilities compared to when the preclearance program first started in 1952. Reduced staffing levels by U.S. Customs and Border Protection have been blamed by airport authorities, whose pleas have been answered with deferrals due to domestic priorities. NEXUS and similar programs are now being explored and expanded as a means to try to restore some of the original convenience to the preclearance process. CBP also sets the hours of operation of its preclearance facilities which are often shorter than the operating hours of the airports, seaports, or railway stations they operate in. Transport providers who want their passengers to take advantage of such a facility will need to time their trips to coincide with the preclearance facilities' operating hours. Carriers may mount flights from preclearance airports to the U.S. outside operating hours, but passengers taking such flights will be processed in the same way as most other international passengers upon the flight's arrival on American soil. ==Legal restrictions== Preclearance facilities exist because of agreements made between the U.S. federal government and the governments of the host countries. Travelers who have passed through the U.S. government checks, but whose flight or ship has not departed, remain in the legal jurisdiction of the host country. U.S. officials may question and search travelers with the passenger's permission, but they do not have powers of arrest (for customs or immigration violations or for the execution of outstanding warrants), but they can deny boarding. Some countries have laws in place that specifically cover preclearance issues. Since CBP does not have legal powers on foreign soil, passengers can be arrested and detained for offences in the host country only by local authorities. Therefore, if a CBP officer has any security but non- immigration/customs-related concerns about a traveller, the attending CBP officer will need to refer the matter to local officials. Passengers can choose to abandon their flight and refuse search, and unlike in the United States, officers cannot search them without permission. Most preclearance facilities have a sign explaining so. CBP Officers in the Preclearance Division are not armed on foreign soil. However, it is likely that if the Canadian Parliament approves Bill C-23, CBP officers would be allowed to carry sidearms on duty in Canada if they are working in an environment in which Canada Border Services Agency officers are normally armed. ==Canada== Stamps in a United States passport, one from Canada Border Services Agency (right) and the other from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (left), both issued at Montréal–Trudeau International Airport The interior of the U.S. Departures wing at Montreal Trudeau Airport in 2009. Informal preclearance arrangements between the United States and Canada began at Malton Airport (now Toronto Pearson International Airport) in 1952, following a request from American Airlines. This was extended and formalized with Canada's passage of the Air Transport Preclearance Act in 1974, the 1999 Preclearance Act, and with the 2001 Canada–U.S. Agreement on Air Transport Preclearance. The preclearance agreement is fully reciprocal, meaning the government of Canada has the option of opening Canadian Preclearance facilities in the United States. On average, however, U.S. international airports offer far fewer flights to Canada compared to the reverse, making this an expensive and inefficient proposition that, , has not been exercised by the Canadian government. On March 16, 2015, U.S. and Canadian officials signed the ministerial-level Agreement on Land, Rail, Marine, and Air Transport Preclearance Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada, which foresees significant expansion of the scope of preclearance facilities. For instance, under the new agreement, U.S. CBP officers working at U.S. preclearance facilities in Canada will be able to carry firearms, and detain travelers who try to voluntarily withdraw their application. Although CBP does not have arrest powers in Canada the bill also includes increased cooperation with the Canada Border Services Agency to arrest travelers found to be breaking the law. On March 10, 2016, U.S. and Canadian officials announced that preclearance would become available at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, Québec City Jean Lesage International Airport, and Montreal Central Station. The necessary upgrades in Quebec City will take 18 months and $35 million CAD to complete. On December 8, 2016, U.S. President Barack Obama signed the bipartisan Promoting Travel, Commerce and National Security Act of 2016 into law, enabling an expansion of US-Canada preclearance. On December 12, 2017, Canadian Governor General Julie Payette gave royal assent to the Canadian counterpart legislation: the Preclearance Act, 2016. The only hurdles standing in the way of implementing an expanded preclearance regime are orders-in- council in Canada, a joint agreement between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and an official presidential proclamation from Trump. In Canada, the preclearance measures interface with the Quarantine Act in the case of a public health emergency. ===Air=== The following Canadian airports operate U.S. preclearance facilities: *Calgary International Airport *Edmonton International Airport *Halifax Stanfield International Airport *Montréal–Trudeau International Airport *Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport *Toronto Pearson International Airport *Vancouver International Airport *Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport At the request of Porter Airlines, a new terminal building at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport (Toronto island) officially opened in Fall 2010 and includes both Canada Border Services Agency customs facilities and provisions for U.S. Customs and Border Protection border preclearance facilities. The latter was, however, denied by Washington at the time. On March 10, 2016, American and Canadian officials announced that preclearance would become available at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport and Québec City Jean Lesage International Airport. The necessary upgrades in Quebec City will take 18 months and $35 million CAD to complete. The airport security inspection in the US Departure area is before the Preclearance process, it was processed by Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) and meet the standards of U.S. TSA regulations. ===Rail=== There are currently no full United States preclearance facilities for rail passengers in Canada. A partial customs inspection is conducted by CBP and Canada Border Services Agency officers at Pacific Central Station in Vancouver, British Columbia for passengers departing on the Amtrak Cascades rail service to Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon. Despite not making any other stops within Canada, U.S.-bound Cascades trains are still subject to a full inspection by CBP at the United States border in Blaine, Washington. In May 2012, U.S. Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) sent a letter to President Barack Obama urging him to fast track the approval of a preclearance facility at Montreal Central Station, which will allow U.S.-bound travelers on Amtrak's Adirondack to no longer stop at Rouses Point, New York for immigration and customs checks when entering the United States. On March 16, 2015, the United States and Canada signed an agreement that would allow for such a facility. Schumer has also promoted the opening of a Canadian preclearance facility in the United States for passengers of the Amtrak-Via Maple Leaf train service between Toronto and New York City; during a visit to the Niagara Falls Amtrak station in January 2020 he called on the Canadian government to accelerate a previously-announced 2019 plan to implement a Canadian preclearance facility at the station. ===Sea=== The United States operates several immigration-only pre-inspection posts (customs is still performed upon arrival in the United States) at the port of Victoria for both the Black Ball Line MV Coho car ferry service to Port Angeles, Washington and the Victoria Clipper passenger-only ferry to Seattle, Washington; and at the terminal in Sidney for Washington State Ferries' Anacortes–San Juan Islands ferry service to Anacortes, Washington. A U.S. preclearance post is also located at the Port of Vancouver. The latter is particularly valuable to travelers using cruise liners that visit Alaska or that depart from Vancouver and have a first stop at U.S. cities situated along the west coast of North America. ==Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean== Informal preclearance with Bermuda began in 1960. The Bahamas and the United States signed a treaty in June 1974 formalizing the process. *Aruba: Queen Beatrix International Airport *Bahamas: Grand Bahama International Airport in Freeport *Bahamas: Lynden Pindling International Airport in Nassau *Bermuda: L.F. Wade International Airport Plans were underway for a preclearance facility to be opened at Punta Cana International Airport, located in the popular tourist destination of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic by the end of summer 2009. Further plans were made in April 2016 to open a facility the next year but as of March 2018, however, the facility has not opened yet. In April 2011, a team from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security traveled to Jamaica for talks with Jamaican government and tourism officials on opening future preclearance facilities on the island. ==Republic of Ireland== U.S. Customs and Border Protection at Shannon The United States and Ireland entered into a preinspection arrangement in 1986.Dáil Éireann - Volume 367 - 06 June, 1986 - US Preinspection Facilities at Shannon Airport: Motion . Historical-debates.oireachtas.ie. Retrieved on July 26, 2013. Shannon Airport initially offered only immigration checks, with customs and agriculture inspections done on arrival in the United States—a procedure more properly known as preinspection. In August 2009, Shannon opened an addition to its preclearance facility that provided customs and agriculture inspections. The facilities at Dublin Airport, like those at Shannon, initially offered only immigration checks on select flights. In January 2011, a section of the recently opened Terminal 2 dedicated to preclearance opened with full CBP facilities. Both airports now allow U.S.-bound commercial flights that use the preclearance facilities to arrive at domestic terminals instead of international terminals, which in turn allows arriving passengers to leave airports upon landing without further inspection. Since March 2010, the Shannon preclearance facility is also available for use by private aircraft; the Dublin facility is only available for commercial flights. Following Executive Order 13769 in 2017, which introduced a ban on passport-holders of seven countries traveling to the United States, the Irish government announced that there would be a \\"complete review\\" of preclearance arrangements. ==United Arab Emirates== In December 2011, the government of Abu Dhabi signed a letter of intent to construct a terminal that, when opened, would house a U.S. border preclearance facility. On June 6, 2013, the House passed an amendment offered by Representatives Pat Meehan (R-PA), Candice Miller (R-MI) and Peter DeFazio (D-OR), which prohibits the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from using any taxpayer dollars to conduct customs and border protection (CBP) preclearance operations at Abu Dhabi International Airport (AUH). The amendment was unanimously adopted during floor consideration of the FY14 Homeland Security Appropriations bill. On November 14, 2013, Rep. Patrick Meehan (R, PA-7) introduced the Preclearance Authorization Act of 2014 (H.R. 3488; 113th Congress), which would authorize the United States Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish preclearance facilities, conduct preclearance operations, or provide customs services outside of the United States to prevent terrorists, terrorist instruments, and other national security threats from gaining access to the United States. Meehan indicated that the goal of the bill is to prevent the Customs Bureau from opening a pre- clearance facility at Abu Dhabi International Airport in the United Arab Emirates. Currently just one airline flies from Abu Dhabi to the United States: Etihad, a state-run airline. Supporters of the bill wished to avoid giving Etihad an unfair competitive advantage created by the fact that travelers flying through Abu Dhabi (on Etihad) would be able to use preclearance while passengers on other airlines would not. This bill did not pass into law. The U.S. customs pre-clearance facility at Abu Dhabi International Airport officially opened on January 26, 2014. Another U.S. customs preclearance facility is currently being planned for Dubai International Airport. ==Future plans== On March 16, 2015, the United States and Canada signed an agreement to construct a preclearance facility at Montreal Central Station. The facility will eliminate a border stop for Amtrak's Adirondack service and support a future extension of the Vermonter to Montreal. In May 2015, the United States Department of Homeland Security announced that the following airports will be considered for the expansion of border preclearance scheme: # Brussels Airport, Belgium # Punta Cana Airport, Dominican Republic # Narita International Airport, Japan # Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Netherlands # Oslo Airport, Norway # Madrid-Barajas Airport, Spain # Stockholm Arlanda Airport, Sweden # Istanbul Atatürk Airport, Turkey # London Heathrow Airport, United Kingdom # Manchester Airport, United Kingdom. On November 4, 2016, Sweden and the United States signed an agreement that would make Sweden the second European country, after Ireland, to offer preclearance, although no announcement has been made as to when the service will start. November 4, 2016 was also the date of a DHS announcement that eleven more airports in nine countries had been added to the list of possible preclearance airports: # El Dorado International Airport (BOG) in Bogota, Colombia # Ministro Pistarini International Airport (EZE) in Buenos Aires, Argentina # Edinburgh Airport (EDI) in Edinburgh, United Kingdom # Keflavik International Airport (KEF) in Iceland # Mexico City International Airport (MEX) in Mexico City, Mexico # Milan-Malpensa Airport (MXP) in Milan, Italy # Kansai International Airport (KIX) in Osaka, Japan # Rio de Janeiro-Galeão International Airport (GIG) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil # Leonardo da Vinci- Fiumicino Airport (FCO) in Rome, Italy # São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport (GRU) in São Paulo, Brazil # Princess Juliana International Airport (SXM) in St. Maarten. On 23 March 2018, the Taiwanese newspaper Liberty Times reported that the U.S. had conditionally agreed to the establishment of a border preclearance system in Taiwan. The Taiwanese government is assessing the possibility of establishing a United States border preclearance system at its main airport, and according to Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Andrew Lee, the relevant government ministries are examining the issue and discussing how such a system can be put in place at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport. On 18 August 2019, outgoing U.S. Ambassador to Colombia Kevin Whitaker stated that U.S. preclearance at El Dorado International Airport would be available within the next year, according to an interview with El Tiempo. ==Aborted plans== Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Korea stated that the government of South Korea plans to establish the U.S. preclearance system at Incheon International Airport. On January 15, 2015, however, Incheon International Airport announced that it would not introduce the U.S. preclearance after an in-depth analysis concluded that U.S. preclearance could lead to decreased sales at duty-free shops, despite the potential income from usage fees remitted for the use of preclearance space. On May 23, 2015, an unofficial member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong, Regina Ip, revealed in an interview that the United States and Hong Kong had explored the possibilities \\"some 20 or 30 years ago\\" to set up the preclearance arrangements at Kai Tak Airport. According to Ip, she was dispatched by the Secretary for Security, in her capacity as a career civil servant in the Security Branch, to study the arrangements in Canada, but the plan was subsequently shelved because of room constraints at Kai Tak. On February 1, 2017, the Netherlands pulled out of talks with the United States to set up a pre-clearance program at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol because of U.S. President Donald Trump's Executive Order 13769, which banned travel to the United States by citizens of certain Muslim-majority countries. On 22 June 2018, the Dutch Government made it known that they were resuming plans for a pre-clearance facility at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. ==See also== *Extraterritorial jurisdiction *Immigration to the United States *List of United States immigration legislation *United States Department of Homeland Security *United States Citizenship and Immigration Services *Juxtaposed controls (a similar arrangement between Belgium, France, the Netherlands and the UK to carry out pre-embarkation immigration checks) *Woodlands Train Checkpoint (a similar arrangement where Malaysian inbound immigration checks are carried out at the station in Singapore prior to boarding) ==References== ==External links== * Preclearance Locations, U.S. Customs and Border Protection * Preclearance at Toronto Pearson: A Vital Link Connecting the U.S. and Canada * Preclearance - map of airports that have it (eSpatial interactive map) Category:Canada–United States border Category:Foreign relations of the United States Category:United States immigration law Category:Juxtaposed border controls Category:Border crossings of the Republic of Ireland Category:Border crossings of the United Arab Emirates Category:Border crossings of the United States ","title":"United States border preclearance"},{"id":"2583326","text":"Michael Herbert Rudolf Knatchbull, 5th Baron Brabourne, (8 May 1895 – 23 February 1939) was a British peer and soldier, the son of the 4th Baron Brabourne. ==Early life== Born Michael Herbert Rudolf Knatchbull-Hugessen, he dropped the Hugessen part of his surname by deed poll in June 1919.

The species are known by a number of different common names. They typically inhabit major rivers where they prefer the main channels and tend to stay at maximum depth, but some species can also be seen in lakes, flooded forests, and other freshwater habitats. They have robust bodies, and are important food fish. Recently, their population size has been on the drastic decline due to a variety of factors including overfishing and habitat destruction due to the construction of hydroelectric dams. ==Common names== In their native waters, these fish may be called surubí in Guaraní. This name is also used in some Spanish-speaking countries and in Brazil (surubi or surubim). In Peruvian Spanish, they are called doncella or zúngaro. P. corruscans may be called moleque or pintado. They often are referred to in the vernacular as bagre rayado/rajado or pintadillo/pintado (tiger catfish or tiger–shovelnose). P. corruscans, P. fasciatum, and P. tigrinum are also known as spotted sorubim, barred sorubim, and tiger sorubim, respectively. This genus contains the fish commonly known as the tiger shovelnose catfish in the aquarium hobby, though the species in this genus are relatively easy to confuse. ==Taxonomy== Pseudoplatystoma is a monophyletic assemblage of catfishes. P. fasciatum was the first species to be described, under the name Siluris fasciatus. In 1829, P. corruscans was described under the name Platystoma corruscans, and over a decade later, P. tigrinum was described as Platystoma tigrinum. In 1862, Pseudoplatystoma was described and these species transferred to it, with P. fasciatum as type species. Unrecognized species of Pseudoplatystoma have been included under the names P. fasciatum and P. tigrinum for decades. This genus traditionally contained only three species until 2007; currently, eight species are in this genus. P. orinocoense, P. magdaleniatum, and P. reticulatum were formerly recognized as P. fasciatum, but are now recognized as distinct species. P. metaense is also now recognized as a distinct species from P. tigrinum. Two clades are recognized within the genus. One is the P. fasciatum clade which includes P. fasciatum, P. orinocoense, P. magdaleniatum, P. reticulatum, and P. corruscans. Within this clade, P. fasciatum and P. punctifer are sister species, and P. orinocoense is sister to the clade formed by these two species. The other, the P. tigrinum clade, includes only P. tigrinum and P. metaense. They are differentiated by anatomical characters. The intergeneric relationships of this genus are well established. It forms a monophyletic group with Sorubim, Sorubimichthys, Hemisorubim, and Zungaro. Of these genera, Hemisorubim is most closely related to Pseudoplatystoma. ==Species== The currently recognized species in this genus include: * Pseudoplatystoma corruscans (Spix & Agassiz, 1829) (spotted sorubim) * Pseudoplatystoma fasciatum (Linnaeus, 1766) (barred sorubim) * Pseudoplatystoma magdaleniatum Buitrago-Suárez & Burr, 2007 * Pseudoplatystoma metaense Buitrago-Suárez & Burr, 2007 * Pseudoplatystoma orinocoense Buitrago- Suárez & Burr, 2007 * Pseudoplatystoma punctifer (Castelnau, 1855) * Pseudoplatystoma reticulatum (Eigenmann & Eigenmann, 1889) (barred sorubim) * Pseudoplatystoma tigrinum (Valenciennes, 1840) (tiger sorubim) ==Distribution and habitat== The distribution of Pseudoplatystoma species includes the great river basins of South America: the Amazon, Orinoco, Paraná, São Francisco, Magdalena, Rupununi, Essequibo, and Suriname Rivers. They can also be found in the Cuiabá river, located in the Brazilian State of Mato Grosso.They have not been reported from river basins draining into the Pacific. P. fasciatum inhabits the Guyana region, including the Essequibo and Suriname Rivers and their tributaries, in Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. P. tigrinum is found in the Amazon River in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. P. corruscans originates from the Paraná and São Francisco Rivers in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. P. orinocoense is named for and endemic to the Orinoco River of Venezuela. P. metaense is distributed in the Orinoco River in Colombia and Venezuela; it is named for the Meta River, the type locality, a tributary of the Orinoco River. P. magdaleniatum is named for and endemic to the Magdalena River drainage, including the Cauca River of Colombia. P. reticulatum inhabits the central Amazon and Paraná Rivers in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Pseudoplatystoma species live in a diverse range of habitats, such as great rivers, lakes, side channels, floating meadows, and flooded forests. P. fasciatum is found in river beds and sometimes in flooded forests. Though it is biologically similar to P. tigrinum, this fish seems to favor shadier streams. P. tigrinum occurs in estuarine zones, mainly upstream of the first rapids up to the basin's headwaters. They live in the main bed of slow or fast zones, and the juveniles particularly live in flooded forests. ==Physical characteristics== Pseudoplatystoma species are all large, boldly striped or spotted catfishes. They are familiar due to their distinctively marked color patterns. They are also recognized due to a depressed head, an occipital process extending backward to contact the predorsal plate, and a very long fontanel. After gonadal maturation, females tend to grow faster than males. They have a large, depressed head with an expandable mouth. The eyes and teeth are small. They have dorsal and pectoral fin spines; P. fasciatum also has an additional, smaller, dorsal spinelet preceding the dorsal spine. They exhibit typical barbels of catfish, the maxillary barbels sometimes being quite long, especially in juveniles. P. fasciatum has 10-11 dark vertical bars that are relatively wider than other species of the Amazon, with fewer white vertical bars than dark ones; the pectoral fins and pelvic fins are darker with few or no spots; and the skull is at least one-sixth narrower than other species. It reaches a maximum of 90 cm (35 in) in total length (TL). P. tigrinum is distinguished by the presence of loop–like bands connecting to, or extending to, the dorsal region and continuing onto other side of body; loop–like bars form cells. The adipose fin also has some loop-like bands and spots, but no discrete dark spots occur on the sides of the body. It reaches a maximum size of 130 cm (51 in) TL. P. corruscans has a body covered by large spots in six to eight rows with four to 13 pale vertical bars. The adipose fin contains five to 10 or no spots, the caudal fin has few spots. It reaches a maximum size of 114 cm (45 in) TL. P. orinocoense has straight, vertical bars on its body, longer than those of P. faciatum and P. punctifer, that extend to or connect dorsally. The bars of the anterior region extend below the dusky dorsolateral area. Usually, no spots are seen below the lateral line, though some individuals may have two or three. It has a maximum recorded length of 49 cm (19 in) TL. P. metaense has dark spots randomly distributed over the dusky region of its body; also, no more than five straight dark vertical bars are found on the side of the body. The adipose fin has fewer spots (five to seven) than in P. tigrinum (eight to 10). The pectoral and pelvic fins are pale without any dusky pigmentation. It has a maximum recorded length of about 53 cm (21 in) TL. P. magdaleniatum has wide, straight, dark vertical bars on its sides. No loops occur on the nape and associated areas. The pectoral fin has no spots, the dorsal fin has few or no spots, and the adipose has six or seven large spots. It has a maximum recorded length of 100 cm (39 in) TL. P. reticulatum is named for its pattern; it has loop-like dark bars forming a reticulated pattern, never straight as in P. fasciatum and P. orinocoense. Its dark, loop–like bars join those in the dorsal region of the body forming distinct cells. It also has longer loop–like dark bars, extending far below the lateral line. The head shows either spots or loops. The anal fin is always with spots. The lower jaw is pointed. It has a maximum recorded length of about 60 cm (24 in) TL. Juvenile Pseudoplatystoma fish are quite different in appearance from adults. Their juvenile coloration differs from their adult coloration, and the patterning is different. In the juvenile, the fish is dark on its back with an obvious boundary between the white of its sides and belly; also, the fish lacks stripes of P. fasciatum and P. tigrinum, but has spots instead. The adult color is brown-olive, with about 13 or 14 dark transverse bands reaching up to the belly, which is white with a few dark spots. ==Reproduction== Pseudoplatystoma species are all migratory fish. P. orinocense and P. tigrinum make short migrations. At the end of the dry season, P. tigrinum can migrate at the same time as its prey, and then return at the end of the rainy season. The migration of P. corruscans is heavily tied to flooding. The greatest reproductive activity, the highest rate of development of gonads, and the most energy spent in migration happens when rainfall occurs. ==Diet== These fish are nocturnal hunters, primarily piscivorous, feeding on fish such as electric knifefishes, cichlids, loricariids, and characins. They may consume on other fish such as sábalos, and bogas. Opportunistic feeders, they may also feed on crustaceans such as crabs or shrimp. ==Relationship to humans== Pseudoplatystoma species are of considerable economic value; all are sold in fish markets throughout South America. They are important food fish for human consumption. P. fasciatum has a succulent, yellowish flesh without \\"stray\\" bones. P. tigrinum is the most important catfish in gill-net fisheries of Guaporé and Marmoré Rivers. These fish are being overexploited in their range, and uncontrolled fishing possibly has led to the disappearance of Pseudoplatystoma species in some local tributaries of the Amazon, Orinoco, and Magdalena. In the Argentine province of Entre Ríos alone, about 27,000 tonnes of Pseudoplatystoma species are harvested every year, comprising 70 to 80% of the total capture there, mostly concentrated on the fishing area near the city of Victoria, opposite Rosario, Santa Fe. The capture of P. corruscans has declined greatly due to changes in their environment. This fish has a high commercial value due to the excellent quality of its flesh, its high marketability, and its marked participation in commercial fishing. Spawning of this fish can be induced with hormones, with a high potential for commercial production. P. fasciatum and P. tigrinum are often found in public aquaria. ==In the aquarium== Juvenile Pseudoplatystoma fish are marked as ornamental fish in both North and South America; however, they are usually at a size too small for certain identification, but more than one species may be imported. These species appear in the aquarium hobby, where they are most often sold under the name \\"tiger shovelnose\\" or \\"tiger shovelnose catfish\\". These fish prove to be hardy. However, their large adult size is problematic for both matters of housing and finding suitable tankmates that will not be consumed. With the appetite these fish have, finding enough good food may present some difficulty. ==See also== *List of freshwater aquarium fish species ==References== Category:Pimelodidae Category:Fish of South America Category:Fish of Argentina Category:Fish of Peru Category:Fauna of Peru Category:Fauna of the Amazon Category:Paraná River Category:Catfish genera Category:Taxa named by Pieter Bleeker Category:Freshwater fish genera ","title":"Pseudoplatystoma"},{"id":"2583348","text":"Edgar Leslie Bainton (14 February 18808 December 1956) was a British-born, latterly Australian-resident composer. He is remembered today mainly for his liturgical anthem And I saw a new heaven, a popular work in the repertoire of Anglican church music, but during recent years Bainton's other musical works, neglected for decades, have been increasingly often heard on CD.Rhoderick McNeill, The Australian Symphony from Federation to 1960 (Surrey, UK, England; Burlington, VT, USA: Ashgate Publishing Limited, 2014), pp. 105-115. . ==Early life and career== Bainton was born in Hackney, London, the son of George Bainton, a Congregational minister, and his wife, Mary, née Cave. Bainton later moved with his family to Coventry and he showed early signs of musical ability playing the piano; he was nine years old when he made his first public appearance as solo pianist. He was awarded a music scholarship to King Henry VIII Grammar School in Coventry in 1891, and in 1896 he won an open scholarship to the Royal College of Music to study theory with Walford Davies. In 1899 he received a scholarship to study composition with Sir Charles Villiers Stanford. At college he became friends with George Dyson, William Harris and especially Rutland Boughton, whose friendship and support continued throughout Bainton's career. Bainton kept a notebook listing nearly all his compositions, the first entry being his first known surviving work, Prelude and Fugue in B minor for piano, written in 1898. In 1901 Bainton became piano professor at the Newcastle upon Tyne Conservatory of Music. He became involved in the local musical scene, composing, playing and conducting and in 1905, he married a former student, Ethel Eales, with whom he had two daughters. He became the Principal of the Conservatory in 1912, and acquired property for its expansion. The family lived at Stocksfield, near Hexham. Bainton would take long country walks, frequently accompanied by Wilfred Gibson, who introduced Bainton into the literary circle surrounding Gordon Bottomley. Bainton set many of Bottomley's poems and wrote an opera to one of his lyric dramas. He introduced his local area to previously unknown works by Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Arnold Bax, among others. He developed friendships with poet Elliott Dodds and cathedral organist William Ellis. ==Prisoner of war and freedom== In the summer of 1914 Bainton visited Germany to attend the Bayreuth Festival, but was arrested after war broke out. As a male enemy alien of military age he was sent to the civilian detention camp at Ruhleben, near Berlin, where he remained for the next four years. Bainton was put in charge of all the music at the camp and became acquainted with Ernest MacMillan, Edward Clark and Arthur Benjamin, among other later successful musicians. He maintained many of these friendships throughout his career. In March 1918 his health deteriorated and he was sent to The Hague to recuperate. Following the Armistice, he became the first Englishman to conduct the Concertgebouw Orchestra, in two concerts of British music before returning to England. Bainton's life returned to normal and he resumed work at the Conservatory. His choral works became features of the Three Choirs Festivals. Touring Australia and Canada from April 1930 to January 1931, he took a break from composing, and from August to December 1932 he visited India, giving a piano recital for the Indian Broadcasting Company. The poet and musician Rabindranath Tagore made him a guest in Calcutta and introduced him to Indian music. In 1933, Sir Edward Bairstow awarded him an honorary Doctor of Music at Durham University. ==Australia== The New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music was impressed by his display of skills in 1930, and offered him the directorship in the summer of 1933. Accordingly, in 1934 Bainton and his family started a new life in Australia. Bainton conducted the choral and orchestral classes at the Conservatorium, and founded the Opera School. At the Conservatorium he taught Australian composers including Miriam Hyde. Expatriate Australian composer Vincent Plush (b. 1950) writes that when Arnold Schoenberg applied for the position of teacher of harmony and theory at the Sydney Conservatorium in 1934, Bainton turned down the application on the grounds of \\"modernist ideas and dangerous tendencies.\\" An anonymous colleague of Bainton's allegedly remarked that Schoenberg was Jewish.Vincent Plush, \\"They Could Have Been Ours,\\" ABC Radio 24 Hours (January, 1996), quoted in Peter Biskup, \\"Popper in Australasia, 1937-1945,\\" Quadrant, Vol. 44, No. 6, June 2000: pp. 20-28. Coinciding with Bainton's arrival in Sydney were moves to form a permanent professional orchestra for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, which occasionally went under the name of the New South Wales Symphony Orchestra. It was later renamed the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Bainton conducted that ensemble's inaugural concert in 1934. He introduced music previously unheard in Australia, such as Elgar's Symphony No. 2 in 1934; Bax's Third Symphony; and works by Debussy, Sibelius, Delius, and Walton, among others. In 1944, the premiere production by the Conservatorium Opera School of Bainton's opera The Pearl Tree received acclaim from the press and public alike. An additional night's performance was given due to demand, and on this latter occasion a bust of Bainton was unveiled in the foyer. Australia then had a mandatory retirement age of 65, but Bainton continued to conduct (temporarily with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra), and gave lecture tours in Canada. In 1956, a heart attack severely affected his health, and on 8 December he died at Point Piper in Sydney. His wife had predeceased him by only a few months. ==Recordings== Some of Bainton's music, both chamber and orchestral, has been recorded in recent years on the Chandos record label and on Dutton Epoch. Previously his work was almost completely neglected in the record or broadcast medium. == Musical works == === Chamber music === * Quintet for Piano and Strings, Op. 9 (1904) (Lost) * String Quartet, Op. 26 (1911) (Lost) * String Quartet in A major (1919) * Sonata for Viola and Piano (1922) * Sonata for Cello and Piano (1924) === Chorus and orchestra === * The Blessed Damozel (lyrics by Dante Gabriel Rossetti), Op. 11 (with mezzo-soprano and baritone soloists). * Sunset at Sea, Op. 20 (lyrics by Reginald Buckley), for chorus and orchestra * The Vindictive Staircase, Op. 29 (lyrics by W.

The song has mento influences, but it is commonly classified as an example of the better known calypso music. It is a work song, from the point of view of dock workers working the night shift loading bananas onto ships. The lyrics describe how daylight has come, their shift is over, and they want their work to be counted up so that they can go home. The best-known version was released by American singer Harry Belafonte in 1956 (originally titled \\"Banana Boat (Day-O)\\") and later became one of his signature songs. That same year The Tarriers released an alternative version that incorporated the chorus of another Jamaican folk song, \\"Hill and Gully Rider\\". The Tarriers version was recorded by Shirley Bassey in 1957 for her 1959 album The Bewitching Miss Bassey. ==Origins== The song was first recorded by Trinidadian singer Edric Connor and his band \\"Edric Connor and the Caribbeans\\" on the 1952 album Songs From Jamaica; the song was called \\"Day Dah Light\\". Belafonte based his version on Connor's 1952 and Louise Bennett's 1954 recordings.The Louise Bennett version of Day O (The Banana Boat Song) is available and documented in both French and English on the Jamaica - Mento 1951-1958 album (2009) In 1955, American singer-songwriters Lord Burgess and William Attaway wrote a version of the lyrics for the Colgate Comedy Hour, in which the song was performed by Harry Belafonte. Belafonte recorded the song for RCA Victor and this is the version that is best known to listeners today, as it reached number five on the Billboard charts in 1957 and later became Belafonte's signature song. Side two of Belafonte's 1956 Calypso album opens with \\"Star O\\", a song referring to the day shift ending when the first star is seen in the sky. During recording, when asked for its title, Harry spells, \\"Day Done Light\\". Also in 1956, folk singer Bob Gibson, who had traveled to Jamaica and heard the song, taught his version to the folk band The Tarriers. They recorded a version of that song that incorporated the chorus of \\"Hill and Gully Rider\\", another Jamaican folk song. This release became their biggest hit, reaching number four on the pop charts, where it outperformed Belafonte's version. The Tarriers' version was recorded by Shirley Bassey in 1957 and it became a hit in the United Kingdom. The Tarriers, or some subset of the three members of the group (Erik Darling, Bob Carey and Alan Arkin, later better known as an actor) are sometimes credited as the writers of the song; their version combined elements of another song and was thus newly created. == Notable covers == * The Fontane Sisters mimicked The Tarriers version in a recording of the song for Dot Records in 1956. It charted to number 13 in the US in 1957. * Beetlejuice The Musical used it as a part of their recording ==Parodies and alternate lyrics== * \\"Banana Boat (Day-O)\\" a parody by Stan Freberg, released in 1957 by Capitol Records, features ongoing disagreement between an enthusiastic Jamaican lead singer and a bongo-playing beatnik (Peter Leeds) who \\"don't dig loud noises\\" and has the catchphrase \\"You're too loud, man\\". When he hears the lyric about the \\"deadly black taranch-la\\" (actually the highly venomous Brazilian wandering spider, commonly dubbed \\"banana spider\\"), the beatnik protests, \\"No, man! Don't sing about spiders, I mean, oooo! like I don't dig spiders\\". Freberg's version was popular and received much radio airplay; Harry Belafonte reportedly disliked the parody. Stan Freberg's version was the basis for the jingle for the TV advert for the UK chocolate bar Trio from the mid-1980s to the early to mid-1990s, the lyrics being, \\"Trio, Trio, I want a Trio and I want one now. Not one, not two, but three things in it; chocolatey biscuit and a toffee taste too.\\" * Dutch comedian André van Duin released his version in 1972 called Het bananenlied: the banana song. This song asks repetitively why bananas are bent. It reaches the conclusion that if the bananas weren't bent they wouldn't fit into their peels. * German band Trio performed a parody where \\"Bommerlunder\\" (a German schnapps) substituted the words \\"daylight come\\" in the 1980s. In one rare occurrence, Trio and Harry Belafonte appeared in the same TV show, \\"Bio's Bahnhof\\", in 1982, with the latter watching Trio's act in disbelief. * The Serbian comedy rock band the Kuguars, consisting of famous Serbian actors, covered the song in 1998, with lyrics in Serbian language dedicated to the, at the time, Yugoslav national soccer team player Dejan \\"Dejo\\" Savićević. The song became a nationwide hit, and a promotional video for the song had been recorded. * In their 1994 album, the comedy music group Grup Vitamin included a Turkish cover of the song parodying the macho culture in the country. *The Swedish humor show Rally, which aired between 1995 and 2002 in Sveriges Radio P3 made a version called \\"Hey Mr. Taliban\\", which speaks about Osama Bin Laden with the lyrics \\"Hey Mister Tallyman, tally me banana/Daylight come and me wan' go home\\" replaced by \\"Hey Mister Taliban, In Afghanistan/US Come and you wanna go home\\" or \\"Hey Mister Taliban! Turn over Bin Laden\\" and \\"Day-O! Daaaaay-O! Daylight come and me wan' go home\\" is replaced by \\"Day-O! Daaaay-O! Missile come and you wanna go home\\". * Since 1988 British radio DJ and presenter Simon Mayo has used several variations of the song as jingles. This originated during Mayo's time as presenter of the Radio 1 Breakfast Show where the jingle was sung by fellow presenter Steve Wright and has continued on many of his shows since, including Mayo's Drivetime show on BBC Radio 2 and since 2019 an orchestral version on Mayo's mid-morning show on Scala Radio. * In 1988–89, Belafonte's children, David and Gina, parodied the song in a commercial about the Oldsmobile Toronado Trofeo. (David was singing \\"Trofeo\\" in the same style as \\"Day-O\\" in the song). * A parody of this song was used in an E-Trade commercial that first aired on Super Bowl LII *Food manufacturer Kellogg's parodied the song in their 2001 television advertisement for their breakfast cereal Fruit 'n Fibre. * For an ad campaign that started in 1991, now-defunct Seattle-based department store chain Bon Marche used a version of the song with alternate lyrics in their commercials. *In November 2019, the Stephen Colbert show modified the lyrics to make fun of Mike Pompeo, saying \\"Pompe-O, Pompe-O. Hearing come and I wanna go home.\\" and continuing with \\"Clearly we all knew of quid pro quo\\", \\"We all knew of the Ukraine deal\\", \\"Soon Mr. Adam man will issue him subpoena\\", \\"Run Mr. Flabby Man, Run back to Kansas\\", with each line followed by \\"Hearing come and I wanna go home.\\" ==Samples and interpolations== * American rapper Lil Wayne samples the line \\"6 foot, 7 foot, 8 foot bunch\\" for the hook of the song \\"6 Foot 7 Foot\\", together with the line \\"Stack Banana\\" which is repeated throughout the song. * Chilean program 31 minutos used the song \\"Arwrarwrirwrarwro\\" by Bombi which was based on \\"Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)\\". *Jamaican singer Conkarah samples the chorus in his 2019 song \\"Banana\\" featuring Shaggy. ==In media and politics== * The original 1956 Belafonte recording is heard in the 1988 film Beetlejuice in a dinner scene in which the guests are supernaturally compelled to dance along to the song by the film's protagonists. ** It was also sung by Beetlejuice and Lydia in the first episode of the animated series. ** The scene from the film is recreated as the first act finale in the Broadway musical adaptation. ** The song appeared in Teen Titans Go! in the crossover episode with Beetlejuice himself \\"Ghost With The Most\\". In the episode the Titans and Betelgeuse need to get into The Lost Souls Room and to do that they needed to get past two giant guards.

It may also result from running, inline skating, roller skating, skateboarding, and longboarding accidents. The term may be applied to both a fresh injury and also to the scar tissue left by an old injury. Symptoms may include pain and heavy bleeding. Motorcyclists can reduce the risks of road rash by wearing appropriate motorcycle personal protective equipment such as a full face helmet, protective clothing, gloves, dusters and boots. Similarly, inline skaters can reduce their chance of such abrasion injuries by wearing protective knee and elbow pads. Road rash is often termed 'gravel rash' in the United Kingdom.Heap G.

He was the son of Joaquim Delgado and Maria do Ó Pereira and had three younger sisters, Deolinda, Aida and Lídia. He began his military career by joining the Colégio Militar, in Lisbon, which he attended from 1916 to 1922. He participated in the 28 May 1926 revolution that overthrew the First Republic and created the Ditadura Nacional, which would pave the way to the Estado Novo. He would be a loyal supporter of the regime, becoming the Director of the Secretariado Nacional de Aeronáutica Civil (National Secretariat of Civil Aeronautics), General-Commander of the Legião Portuguesa, Deputy National Commissar of the Mocidade Portuguesa and Procurator to the Corporative Chamber. He would be the youngest general in Portuguese history. Marcelo Caetano, who was his friend during this time, later would describe Delgado as an \\"exalted person\\" and a man who \\"wore his heart on his sleeve\\".Caetano, Marcello, Minhas Memórias de Salazar, Lisboa, Editorial Verbo, 1977 He published an anti-democratic book, Da Pulhice do 'Homo Sapiens' in 1933, which attacked both the \\"crooks monarchy\\" and the \\"bandits republic\\" in his subtitle. Delgado wrote in praise of Adolf Hitler, which he considered as a genius and an example of human possibilities in the fields of politics, diplomacy, social organization and military, in 1941.Revista AR, Nº 44, June 1941. Delgado wrote: “O ex-cabo, ex-pintor, o homem que não nasceu em leito de renda amolecedor que passará à História como uma revelação genial das possibilidades humanas no campo político, diplomático, social, civil e militar, quando a vontade de um ideal se junta a audácia, a valentia, a virilidade numa palavra.” However, with time his sympathies leaned towards the Allies. He came to the Azores islands during World War II, by the occasion of the Portuguese-British Agreement.Delgado, Frederico Rosa, Humberto Delgado – Biografia do General Sem Medo, Lisboa, Esfera dos Livros, 2008 === Founding TAP - Transporte Aéreos Portugueses === The Transporte Aéreos Portugueses was founded on March 14, 1945 by Delgado, then Director of the Civil Aeronautics Secretariat, with the purchase of the first aircraft that year, two DC-3 Dakota. On September 19, 1946, the first commercial line was opened, between Lisbon and Madrid, and on December 31 of that year, the Imperial Air Line was inaugurated, between Lisbon, Luanda (in the then colony of Angola) and Lourenço Marques, former designation of Maputo (in the then colony of Mozambique), with twelve stopovers and lasting 15 days (round trip), being the longest line in the world operated by twin-engine aircraft. Under his supervision the first domestic line, between Lisbon and Porto, opened in 1947, the year Douglas C-54 Skymaster was purchased. In 1948, TAP became a full member of IATA and flights open to Paris in France and Seville in Spain. The flight to London in the United Kingdom began in 1949. === Diplomatic Career === In 1952 he was appointed military attaché at the Portuguese Embassy in Washington and a member of the NATO Military Representatives Committee. At the age of 47 he was promoted to general and in 1956 the US Government granted him the rank of officer of the Legion of Merit. ==Presidential elections of 1958== His passage as a Military Attaché and Aeronautic Attaché to the Portuguese Embassy in Washington, D.C. in 1952 pushed his ideology in a liberal democratic direction, and inspired him to run as the democratic opposition's candidate for the Portuguese presidency in 1958. According to the testimony of Marshal Costa Gomes, Humberto Delgado decided to run for president because he failed to be appointed director of the NATO Defense College. Humberto Delgado missed the much-desired appointment due to his chronic lack of sense which made him gain the dislike of the British Admiral Sir Michael Maynard Denny, former Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet. According to Costa Gomes´testimonial, Humberto Delgado could not resist joking with the Admiral by constantly pulling the abundant hair the British Admiral had coming out of his ears. The British Admiral detested these jokes from Delgado and vetoed his appointment. Costa Gomes had warned Delgado several times that those bad taste jokes would cost him his much-desired appointment, but Delgado replied that he knew it but he just could not help doing it. Costa Gomes classifies Delgado as a very smart man but with \\"a screw loose\\". Episodes like this have earned Delgado the epithet of \\"General sem juizo\\" (The senseless general).* As incumbent president Craveiro Lopes had been coerced by Salazar into standing down after only one term, Delgado faced archconservative naval minister Américo Tomás, the regime's candidate, in the 1958 presidential election. Humberto Delgado decided to launch his candidacy as an independent, taking the traditional opposition by surprise. Among the supporters were figures such as the intellectual António Sérgio, the monarchists Vieira de Almeida and Almeida Braga and the Fascist Francisco Rolão Preto. The Portuguese Communist Party reacted fiercely and did not spare Delgado labeling him as \\"Fascist\\" and \\"General Coca-Cola\\", in an allusion to the General's pro-Americanism. Delgado campaigned vigorously, even though he seemingly faced impossible odds. Although opposition candidates had nominally been allowed to run since the 1940s, the electoral system was so heavily rigged in favour of Salazar's National Union that its candidates could not possibly be defeated. In a famous interview on 10 May 1958, in the Chave d'Ouro café, when asked what would be his attitude towards Salazar, Delgado made one of the most famous quotations in Portuguese politics: \\"Obviamente, demito-o!\\" (\\"Obviously, I'll sack him!\\"). He was well aware that the president's power to remove the prime minister from office was essentially the only check on Salazar's power. His outspoken attitude earned him the epithet of \\"General sem Medo\\" (\\"Fearless General\\" or literally \\"General without fear\\"). A rally held at Oporto drew a large crowd. However, when he tried to return to Lisbon, the police blocked him and his family from attending a planned rally, then broke up the gathering. Nevertheless, Delgado was ultimately credited with less than 25% of the votes, with 76.4% in favor of Tomás. Salazar refused to allow opposition representatives to observe the ballot count. Tomás' margin was inflated by massive ballot-box stuffing by the PIDE, leading to speculation that Delgado might have actually won had Salazar allowed an honest election. Nonetheless, Salazar was worried enough that he transferred election of the president to the legislature, which was firmly controlled by the regime. As a result, Delgado was the only opposition presidential candidate during the Estado Novo to stay in the race until election day. ==Exile and opposition (1958–1965)== Delgado was expelled from the Portuguese military, and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy before going into exile, spending much of it in Brazil and later in Algeria, as a guest of Ben Bella. During the period of his exile in Brazil was supported by Maria Pia de Saxe-Coburgo e Bragança, a claimant to the Portuguese Throne, who helped monetarily and even offered him one of their residences in Rome so that the General could return to Europe.SERTÓRIO, Manuel; Humberto Delgado: 70 Cartas Inéditas - A luta contra o Fascismo no exílio. Praça do Livro, Lisboa (1978). In 1964, he founded the Portuguese National Liberation Front in Rome, stating in public that the only solution to end the Estado Novo would be by a military coup, while many others advocated a national uprising approach. ==Assassination== After being lured into an ambush by the regime's secret police (PIDE) near the border town of Olivenza, Delgado and his Brazilian secretary, Arajaryr Moreira de Campos, were murdered on 13 February 1965 while trying to clandestinely enter Portugal. The official version claimed that Delgado was shot and killed in self-defence despite Delgado being unarmed and his secretary strangled. Their bodies were found some two months later, near the Spanish village of Villanueva del Fresno. Casimiro Monteiro, a PIDE agent, shot and killed General Delgado, and strangled his secretary de Campos (Monteiro was also involved in the killing of Eduardo Mondlane, founder of Frelimo, Mozambique's Liberation Movement). Salazar, who approved the assassination, when told of the killings, said simply, \\"Uma maçada\\" (\\"Such a bother\\"). Later appearing on national television Salazar claimed ignorance of the secret police's involvement and blamed quarreling opposition forces for the killings. PIDE subsequently claimed that the original plan was an extraordinary rendition in which Delgado was to be kidnapped and brought back to Portugal for trial. In 1981, a Portuguese court convicted Monteiro in absentia, effectively accepting the argument that Monteiro had acted contrary to orders by killing Delgado. Some historians claim that the Spanish authorities knew of the Portuguese secret police's involvement and staged the decomposing corpses' discovery by two local boys. ==Honours== ===National Honours=== *80px Officer of the Order of Aviz, Portugal (December 24, 1936) *80px Officer of the Order of Public Instruction, Portugal (July 17, 1941) *80px Commander of the Order of Aviz, Portugal (October 1, 1941) *80px Commander of the Order of Christ, Portugal (April 11, 1947) *80px Commander of the Order of Saint James of the Sword, Portugal (February 19, 1949) *80px Grand Officer of the Order of Aviz, Portugal (September 5, 1951) *80px Grand-Cross of the Order of Aviz, Portugal (November 11, 1957) *80px Grand-Cross of the Order of Liberty, Portugal (June 30, 1980) ===Foreign Honours=== *80px Cross of Military Merit, Spain (May 7, 1945) *80px Commander of the Order of the British Empire, United Kingdom (July 18, 1946) *80px Officer of the Legion of Merit, United States of America (September 17, 1955) ===Other recognitions=== Sculpture of Humberto Delgado (Porto) In 1990, Humberto Delgado was posthumously promoted to Marshal of the Portuguese Air Force, the only person to hold this rank posthumously. The square where the main entrance of Lisbon Zoo is located is named after him. Delgado's mortal remains were translated to the National Pantheon at 5 October 1990, following a decision of the Assembly of the Republic. In February 2015, on the 50th anniversary of his assassination, the Câmara Municipal de Lisboa proposed the Portela Lisboa airport should be renamed in his honor. The government accepted the proposal and on May 15, 2016, the airport was renamed for Delgado. ==Marriage and offspring== Delgado was married to Maria Iva Theriaga Leitão Tavares de Andrade (1908-2014), they had three children:Rodrigo de Magalhães e Menezes Ortigão de Oliveira – A Família Ramalho Ortigão, Author's Edition, 1st Edition, Porto, 2000 * Humberto Iva de Andrade da Silva Delgado, born at São Sebastião da Pedreira, Lisbon, on 24 November 1933, airline pilot for TAP Portugal (Portuguese Aerial Transportation). * Iva Humberta de Andrade da Silva Delgado, who always championed her father's cause. * Maria Humberta de Andrade da Silva Delgado. ==Popular culture references== ===Films=== In 1966, German film writer and director André Libik created a 45' documentary about Delgado's assassination in the series \\"Political Murders\\" produced by West Berlin's TV station SFB. The film was completed and aired shortly after the Portuguese revolution of April 25, 1974. * The 2012 Bruno de Almeida-directed film ' is a political thriller about the killing of General Delgado.

The initial screenplay drafts were written by James Ellroy in the late 1990s under the title The Night Watchman. The film was released in theaters on April 11, 2008 and was followed by a direct-to-video sequel Street Kings 2: Motor City in 2011. ==Plot== Tom Ludlow is a disillusioned, borderline alcoholic LAPD detective working for a unit known as Vice Special and Working undercover, he meets in a parking lot with Korean gangsters who are looking to buy a machine gun from him and who he also believes have kidnapped two Korean schoolgirls. After a vicious beatdown, the Koreans steal his car. This was planned, however, and he has the cops locate the vehicle via GPS. Upon arrival at their hideout, Ludlow storms in and kills the four gangsters inside, he then puts on gloves, takes a shot of vodka and alters the scene to make the shootings look justified. He then finds the 2 school girls locked in a closet. While the other officers in his unit congratulate him, he is confronted by his former partner, Detective Terrence Washington, who no longer approves of the corruption as well as the deception and has gone straight, reporting the problems to Captain James Biggs, of Internal Affairs, who apparently starts an investigation against Ludlow. Believing that Washington was snitching on him, Ludlow follows him to a convenience store to beat him up. However, Washington is executed in the store in an apparent gangland hit albeit with heavy fire by two gangbangers under the pretense of a robbery. Though Ludlow is innocent and the two were working together to fight back, the surveillance video of the shootout shows him to have accidentally shot Washington while trying to protect him with his .38 revolver, which can heavily implicate him in the murder. The DNA of two criminals known as Fremont and Coates is found at the scene, as well as a large amount of cash in Washington's possession. It is assumed that Washington himself was corrupt, despite his seemingly changed attitude, and that he had been stealing drugs from the department's evidence room and selling them to Fremont and Coates. Ludlow teams up with Detective Paul \\"Disco\\" Diskant, who has been assigned to the case to join him in his personal investigation. Their search for the two involves some tough interrogation of a Latino gang member named Quiks, a Crips gang member named Grill, and a drug addict/dealer named Winston \\"Scribble\\", which eventually leads them to a house in the hills where they discover the bodies of the real Fremont and Coates buried in a shallow grave. The condition of the bodies makes it apparent that they were killed well before Washington's murder. Ludlow and Disco, posing as dirty cops who are willing to take over Washington's supposed activity of stealing and selling drugs, are able to set up a meeting through Winston with two criminals masquerading as Fremont and Coates. Freemont and Coates then recognize Ludlow as the cop that was present at the convenience store robbery, prompting Ludlow to question who Freemont and Coates really are, and in turn Disco quickly states he recognizes the two, and he is shot and killed immediately, along with Winston. Ludlow manages to kill both men and escapes back to his girlfriend's house, where a news report reveals the killers were undercover LASD deputies (Wander later states that the two had been in deep cover for so long that they \\"lost their fucking minds\\" and had become corrupt cops). Ludlow retreats to where his girlfriend Grace Garcia is staying, and she confronts him. Shortly afterwards, Ludlow is subdued by Detective Cosmo Santosand Detective Dante Demille - two fellow officers from his unit. Talking Ludlow with them, the two admit that they planted Fremont and Coates' DNA and the drugs at the scene of Washington's murder. This causes Ludlow to learn that Washington was surrendering their captain, Jack Wander, up to Biggs, as they were the ones that were stealing drugs from the department's evidence room. The two cops take Ludlow out to the house where the two bodies of the real Fremont and Coates were found earlier, for execution. However, Ludlow manages to kill both of them. He then heads to Washington's house to take care of their supervisor, Sergeant Mike Clady, who was about to kill Washington's widow. He captures Clady and places him in the trunk of his car. Now aware of Wander's activities, Ludlow confronts him at his house and apprehends him after a brawl between them. He then discovers that Wander has incriminating evidence against almost all the officers in the department, along with the judges, councilmen and politicians; Wander had been concealing his unit's corruption to cover-up his crimes, and in the process has used the opportunity to become the department's captain. Wander, asserting that he is Ludlow's best-friend and mentor, attempts to buy off his silence by bribing him with a large amount of stolen money and incriminating documents - which Ludlow had uncovered from the wall moments ago. However, Ludlow refuses and executes Wander. Soon afterwards, Captain Biggs and Sergeant Green arrive at the scene. Biggs reveals to Ludlow that they used him to bring down Wander and get access to his files by opening his eyes to the real corruption going on within his unit. As he leaves, Biggs tells Ludlow that the department does need him. ==Cast== * Keanu Reeves as Detective 2nd Grade Tom Ludlow * Hugh Laurie as Captain James Biggs * Chris Evans as Detective Paul \\"Disco\\" Diskant * Forest Whitaker as Captain Jack Wander * Naomie Harris as Linda Washington * John Corbett as Detective Dante Demille * Cedric the Entertainer as Winston AKA \\"Scribble\\" * Jay Mohr as Sergeant Michael \\"Mike\\" Clady * Terry Crews as Detective 2nd Grade Terrence Washington * Common as corrupt psychotic LASD deputy masquerading as \\"Coates\\" * Cle Shaheed Sloan as LeShawn, a corrupt psychotic LASD deputy masquerading as \\"Fremont\\" * The Game as Grill * Martha Higareda as Grace Garcia * Amaury Nolasco as Detective Cosmo Santos * Clifton Powell as Sergeant Green * Noel G. as Quicks ==Production== In 2004, it was announced that Spike Lee would be directing the film for a 2005 release.

CNU is designated by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) as Center of Excellence (COE) in both Nursing Education and Teacher Education. right ==History== === Early history === CNU was established in 1902 by Act No. 74 of the Philippine Commission as a summer institute of the Philippine Normal University (PNS, then a normal school). It was then called \\"Cebu Normal School\\" and was located on Osmeña Boulevard. In 1906, the school became an adjunct to the then Cebu Provincial High School (now Abellana National School). In 1924, the school became independent of PNS, obtained the normal school status and moved to its current site in Osmeña Boulevard, Cebu City. In 1926, it produced its first batch of graduates as a new educational institution. === CNU during World War II === The CNU campus was used as headquarters of the Kempetai or Military Police of the Japanese Imperial Army during the second World War. On March 26, 1945, Allied forces landed on Cansojong Beach in Talisay, starting the liberation of Cebu. The United States Army made CNS their base. === Conversion into college === In 1952, the two-year general curriculum adopted in 1946 was changed to the four-year Elementary Education Curriculum, which was later changed to Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE – Elementary Education) in 1954. This led CNS to become a tertiary institution. In 1959, BSE was changed into Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education. The Graduate School was opened in 1960 and produced its first M.A. graduate in 1966 – Rosemary P. Gellor. The Liberal Arts department (now College of Arts and Sciences) was established in 1977 and the department of Nursing (now College of Nursing) was created in 1982. The school was then renamed as \\"Cebu Normal College\\" in 1966, then to \\"Cebu State College\\" in 1976 in accordance to P.D. 944. In the 1980s and 1990s the school's population increased rapidly and new buildings were constructed which now house the three colleges of the school: College of Teacher Education (CTE), College of Arts and Sciences (CAS), and the College of Nursing (CN), as well as the University Museum, the Integrated Laboratory School (ILS), the Graduate School (GS) and Balay Alumni. === University status === On June 27, 1998, Cebu State College attained university status and was named Cebu Normal University (CNU) under Republic Act No. 8688 signed by President Fidel V. Ramos. Under the Republic Act. 7104, CNU was designated as Panrehiyong Sentro ng Wikang Filipino for Region VII. In 2005 and 2008, CNU had two opened extension campuses in Balamban and Medellin in Cebu.

The Bassanese naturalist Antonio Gaidon, guided him towards his first scientific studies and was Brocchi's first master in the geological and mineralogical disciplines. Gaidon introduced Brocchi to the naturalists Giuseppe Olivi and Alberto Fortis, the latter accompanying Brocchi on geological excursions in the Bassano area. In 1802 he was appointed professor of botany in the new lyceum of Brescia; but he more especially devoted himself to geological researches in the adjacent districts. The fruits of these labors appeared in different publications, particularly in his Trattato mineralogico e chimico sulle miniere di ferro del dipartimento del Mella (1808) a treatise on the iron mines of the Mella traditional region. These researches procured him the office of inspector of mines in the recently established Kingdom of Italy, and enabled him to extend his investigations over a great part of the country. In 1811 Brocchi produced a valuable essay entitled Memoria mineralogica sulla Valle di Fassa in Tirolo; but his most important work is the Conchiologia fossile subapennina con osservazioni geologiche sugli Apennini, e sul suolo adiacente (2 vols., Milan, 1814), containing accurate details of the structure of the Apennine range, and an account of the fossils of the Italian Tertiary strata compared with existing species. These subjects were further illustrated by his geognostic map, and his Catalogo ragionato di una raccolta di rocce, disposto con ordine geografico, per servire alla geognosia dell' Italia (Milan, 1817). His work Dello stato fisico del suolo di Roma (1820), with its accompanying map, is likewise noteworthy. In it he corrected the erroneous views of Scipione Breislak, who conceived that Rome occupies the site of a volcano, to which he ascribed the volcanic materials that cover the seven hills. Brocchi pointed out that these materials were derived either from Monte Albano, an extinct volcano, twelve miles from the city, or from the Monti Cimini, still farther to the north. In 1814 Brocchi presented the thesis that species, like individuals, age and eventually die out — an idea that later influenced Charles Darwin. Several papers by him, on mineralogical subjects, appeared in the Biblioteca Italiana from 1816 to 1823. In the latter year, Brocchi sailed for Egypt, in order to explore the geology of that country and report on its mineral resources. Every facility was granted by Mehemet Ali, who in 1825 appointed him one of a commission to examine the territory of the recently conquered Kingdom of Sennar; but Brocchi fell a victim to the climate, and died at Khartoum on the 25th of September 1826, possibly of dysentery.\\"Brocchi, Giovanni Battista\\".

It was developed and owned by Geoff Da Deppo and at the time was the largest private tourism development in the ACT. The Aquarium consisted of approximately 30 different species, with its main feature being a large 1.5 million litre aquarium with an underwater walk through viewing tunnel which housed a huge range of marine life. This was reportedly the first of its type in the world and was manufactured by a local Canberra company. 11 large high-technology fish tanks built for World Expo 88 at Brisbane were also incorporated into the structure utilising a biological filter bank of a type never before used in Australia. It was at the time the largest closed synthetic salt water oceanarium in the Southern Hemisphere. The Aquarium also boasted a 300 seat restaurant and function area (The Barbary Coast Restaurant and Brasserie - later changed to Pirates Cove Restaurant) It was situated on around 18 acres of land which also incorporated a series of outdoor ponds and streams for trout farming. Sadly the venture was never fully completed as envisaged and did not attract the wildly optimistic \\"up to 8000 visitors per day\\". The construction company suffered severe cash flow problems and in August 1990 was forced to put the Aquarium on the market. No sale eventuated and the Aquarium was placed in receivership in March 1991.The Aquarium continued trading under the Price Waterhouse receiver-manager who struggled to keep the business viable, incurring heavy weekly losses, and a bank deadline to find a buyer threatening its closure and a sell-off the assets. Requiring 200,000 to 300,000 customers a year to break even, it had never exceeded 70,000. In March 1992, after reported losses of investors of more than $12 m a prominent district grazier and businessman, Rod Hanstein purchased the property. This phase of the facility lasted around five years. During this period, the new operator added several outdoor exhibits that consisted mainly of native wildlife. The large aquarium was converted from saltwater to freshwater to reduce costs. The overall theme of the facility changed in an attempt to meet the demands of a large Asian inbound tourist market into the ACT and offered an \\"Australian\\" experience that incorporated the wildlife park aspects as well as other activities such as fly fishing in the trout ponds, sheep shearing and boomerang throwing demonstrations. It also changed its name in 1993 to the National Aquarium - Australian Wildlife Sanctuary In 1998 the facility was again up for sale and purchased by the Tindale family. Over the next two years they repaired and replaced many parts of the existing facility and enclosures as it had been poorly maintained for several years. This included the discovery that the major exhibit of the facility (the 1.5 million litre walk-through aquarium) had to be closed down permanently due to concrete cancer in the walls of the aquarium. It was modified to house a variety of animals over the next few years, including Snow Leopards, Sun Bears and Tigers. (This has since been turned into a rain forest display) In 1999 the first significant enclosure was completed to house 3 Brown Bears that had to be re-homed after living for years in a private collection. In 2000, construction began on several big cat enclosures to house some retired circus lions, leopards, tiger and a pair of tigons (a cross between a lion a tiger). By 2001 the wildlife park was in full swing, at one stage having 14 new exhibits under construction that, when completed, would house more big cats, additional native animals, a variety of primate species as well as large ungulates such as zebra, antelope and giraffe. Upon completion the wildlife park changed its name to the \\"National Zoo & Aquarium\\". The upper levels of the Aquarium building (the restaurant & function area) were restructured to incorporate an onsite residence and a donut-shaped shark tank. Between 2001 and 2003, the zoo battled Canberra’s bush fires on two separate occasions, and the once established pine forest surrounding the zoo was turned to cinders. It was suggested that the zoo should potentially expand into adjoining land. Over the next 5 years, the zoo continued to develop as well as negotiate and design a potential future expansion. The zoo developed a number of hands-on animal experiences for visitors, one of the first Australian zoos to do so. In 2004 the NZA won the Canberra Region Adventure Tourism award for the ZooVenture Tour. In December 2014 the zoo opened its new development of onsite overnight accommodation, Jamala Wildlife Lodge. Jamala consists of a number of free- standing lodges within the zoo, including Jungle Bungalows, Giraffe Treehouses, and uShaka Lodge, which was formerly the onsite residence in the Aquarium building. By providing 5 star luxury accommodation and fine dining, the zoo placed itself in a niche compared to other available zoo overnight experiences, which only provide tented or cabin accommodation and buffet dining. Funds raised from Jamala are directed back into the zoo and towards a variety of local, Australian and world wide animal conservation charities and endangered species breeding programs. Since its opening, Jamala Wildlife Lodge has won variety of awards including Canberra Region Tourism Awards - Best Unique Accommodation 2017 and AHA National - Best Deluxe Accommodation 2017 In May 2017, the zoo officially opened their new open range section, effectively tripling the size of the zoo. The National Zoo & Aquarium is now one of the largest privately owned zoos in Australia and is an accredited member of the Zoo and Aquarium Association of Australasia (ZAA). It has the only inland aquarium exhibit in Australia. ==See also== * List of zoos * List of zoos in Australia ==Notes== ==ReferencesCategory:Zoos in Canberra Category:Aquaria in Australia Category:Buildings and structures in Canberra Category:Tourist attractions in Canberra Category:Parks in Canberra ","title":"National Zoo &amp; Aquarium"},{"id":"2583449","text":"Stuart Wagstaff (13 February 192510 March 2015) was an English-born Australian entertainer who was active in all genres of the industry including television, theatre, music and stage management. ==Background and early career== Wagstaff was born in Great Durnford, Wiltshire, England, and grew up on a farm with his parents and two older sisters. His father was very strict and emotionally abusive and he received little affection from his mother. His mother, however, frequently took him and his sisters to see plays and pantomime, generating an early interest in the theatre. At the age of 11 he was sexually abused by a farmhand. In September 1940, at the insistence of his father, Wagstaff joined the Royal Navy as an apprentice aircraft mechanic in the Fleet Air Arm. He served at naval air stations and on aircraft carriers until the end of the war, but considered himself to be a poor mechanic. He frequently volunteered for ships' concert parties to further his interest in acting. After the war Wagstaff joined the Windsor Repertory as an assistant stage manager, occasionally taking small roles in plays. He then joined the Whitley Repertory in which he took part in up to 48 plays and four weeks of pantomime each year as well as a few West End, film and television appearances. == Acting career in Australia == Wagstaff first came to Australia in 1958 to appear in the J. C. Williamson production Not in the Book. In 1959, Williamson put him into the original My Fair Lady production, with which he was associated for the next four and a half years, the last two and half playing Professor Henry Higgins, through all the Australian and New Zealand capital cities. Following this he took over the male lead in the stage musical The Sound of Music. Wagstaff's early Australia television appearances consisted of commercials, and a role in the 1960 Crawford Productions play Seagulls Over Sorrento. Other dramatic appearances included three episodes of the drama series Whiplash (1960), the ABC play Concord Of Sweet Sounds (1963), and episodes of the ABC's historical serial The Hungry Ones (1963). In 1964 he appeared as the host of the Channel 7 variety show Studio 'A' and in 1965 he replaced the ailing Eric Baume as the \\"Beast\\" on the Channel 7 daytime show, Beauty and the Beast. This production established him as one of Australia's firm television favourites. During this two-and-a-half year period with Beauty and the Beast, he also appeared in leading roles in several stage productions including There's a Girl in My Soup, Present Laughter, Private Lives, several theatre restaurant revues, presented ATN-7's news program The Wagstaff Report (1965), and a 1966 episode of the drama series Homicide. In 1968 he became host of a major Tonight show on the Seven Network. He later moved to the Nine Network to become one of the regular hosts of In Melbourne Tonight. During the following three years he hosted several shows on the Nine Network, including The Sound of Music and a regular late night interview show. ===Impact of smoking advertising on his career=== Wagstaff's suave style led to his advertising Benson & Hedges cigarettes, with the tagline \\"When only the best will do ... and isn't that all the time?\\" In a 2003 interview published in The Age, journalist Chris Beck commented: The Non Smokers' Movement of Australia website (issue 18, May–June 1997) wrote in \\"Smoking Frontman Expresses Late Regrets\\": === Later career and death=== After a three-year stint in Hollywood, working in film and television, Wagstaff returned to Australia in 1975 and was immediately kept busy with TV appearances all over the country, including being a regular panellist on Channel 9's Celebrity Squares, then two years as permanent panellist on Channel 0/10's Blankety Blanks, plus seven seasons as the host/presenter on the ABC's Stuart Wagstaff's World Playhouse. Apart from television, Wagstaff remained active in his first love, the theatre. In late 1979 he appeared again as Professor Higgins in My Fair Lady and a successful national tour followed in which he was also a co-producer. About this time he also produced Sydney and Melbourne seasons of the American stage comedy Father's Day. In 1981 he toured as the narrator in the successful Rocky Horror Show starring Daniel Abineri and repeated this with a second tour a few years later which featured Russell Crowe. In 1982 Wagstaff appeared in a leading role in the play Noises Off which had a successful national tour. In 1983 he played the lead in Blithe Spirit at Marian Street Theatre in Sydney and then went on to host the Midday Movie and Friday Night Movies on the Seven Network for two years. Wagstaff's television guest roles in the 1990s included appearances in G.P., Rafferty's Rules, A Country Practice and All Saints. He often appeared on The Midday Show and Good Morning Australia. He appeared on most of Channel 7 Perth's telethon and live broadcasts as well. The late 1980s and the 1990s saw Wagstaff on stage with Sydney seasons and subsequent tours of Noises Off, Black Comedy, The Winslow Boy, Lend Me A Tenor and Gershwin's musical Crazy For You. He also appeared in the role of Old Cookson in the theatrical production of Pan at the Capitol Theatre, Sydney. Cameron Mackintosh’s production of Oliver!, had Wagstaff returning to the stage in the role of Mr. Brownlow. Wagstaff died from complications associated with pulmonary fibrosis on 10 March 2015. == Honours== On 26 January 1998 Wagstaff was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for service to the community, particularly through the Channel 7 Perth Telethon Trust by raising funds for charities that support children's medical research. == Filmography == === In character === * A Night to Remember (1958) - Titanic Steward (uncredited) * Seagulls Over Sorrento (1960, TV) * Sunstruck (1972) - Announcer * For Pete's Sake (1974) - Man in Chandelier Store - aka July Pork Bellies * Is There Anybody There?

On the arrival of the Norsemen the fort became the residence of a powerful Viking leader who gave it the name David’s Fort. Trotternish often changed hands. It was not until the 16th century that the Lords of the Isles finally seized the territory and Donhall Gorm (Blue Donald) the chief (great-grandson of Hugh of Sleat), took up residence there and carried out considerable improvements to the fort. In 1730 the MacDonalds moved away from Duntulm and stayed for a time at Monkstadt before building their new castle at Armadale. Duntulm is home to a clach-ultaich, a lifting stone. It is said to weigh a ton. ==Geography== The village is most notable for the coastal scenery coupled with the ruins of Duntulm Castle, which affords stunning views of the Outer Hebrides.

It succeeded the First Geneva Convention of 1864. It was a predecessor of the well-known Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. It was signed by the members of the International Military Commission convened for this purpose in the presence of the Imperial Cabinet of Russia. ==History== Alexander Gorchakov In 1863, the Russian Army had perfected a fulminating musketball that could explode when it hit a hard target and was designed to blow up powder magazines or ammunition wagons. In 1867, they perfected an improved explosive musketball that would detonate on any impact after being fired, even soft targets like people or animals. Predicting the disastrous effect of such a discovery on diplomatic relations with their neighbors, Russia decided to negotiate a ban on the development, creation, and use of such weapons before a grisly arms race commenced. Upon the invitation of the Russian diplomat and statesman Prince Alexander Gorchakov, for the purpose of considering the existing rules of war, a conference of delegates met at Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, in December 1868. The nations represented were Austria-Hungary, Bavaria, Belgium, Denmark, France, United Kingdom (representing the British Empire), Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Prussia, the North German Confederation (i.e., Greater Prussia), Russia, Sweden-Norway, Switzerland, the Ottoman Empire, and Württemberg.Stuart Maslen, Anti-Personnel Mines under Humanitarian Law: a view from the vanishing point, p12, Intersentia nv, 2001 The United States, not considered a major power at the time, was not invited and took no part in the convention. Brazil ratified the agreement in 1869, as did Estonia in 1991.Ratifications. The delegates affirmed that the only legitimate object of war should be to weaken the military force of the enemy, which could be sufficiently accomplished by the employment of highly destructive weapons. With that fact established, the delegates agreed to prohibit the use of less deadly explosives that might merely injure the combatants and thereby create prolonged suffering of such combatants. The Great Powers agreed to renounce, in case of war among themselves, the use \\"by their military or naval troops of any projectile of a weight below 400 grams (14 ounces avoirdupois), which is either explosive or charged with fulminating or inflammable substances.\\" While the declaration bans the use of fragmenting, explosive, or incendiary small arms ammunition, it does not prohibit such ammunition for use in autocannon or artillery rounds. The influence of this declaration on international humanitarian law were elucidated in the Japanese case Ryuichi Shimoda et al. v. The State (1963): ==Notes== *Ammunition for anti-materiel rifles and heavy machine-guns with a bore of about 12.7 mm to 14.5 mm in diameter straddle the definition between small arms and heavy weapons. Large-bore rifles using high-explosive or incendiary rounds run the risk of violating the Declaration despite the legal use (as specified in the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907) of such special munitions in heavy machineguns and autocannons. The discussion of their legality often revolves around the weight limitation and whether it applies to the weight of the bullet itself or to the entire fixed cartridge. *The distinction between \\"explosive\\" and \\"fulminating\\" bullets is academic but important. **An \\"explosive\\" bullet contains an explosive filler that detonates on impact. **A \\"fulminating\\" bullet contains a small unstable high explosive charge and is designed to shatter into fragments after impact or inside the wound. They also have the added potential of detonating when jarred or while being removed, complicating first aid or surgery. *The Declaration bans such munitions during wars only among the co-signatory European and Eurasian nations. It notably leaves out instances of war with non-signatory nations, conflicts with undeveloped nations, or military operations in their own colonies and possessions. ==References== ==External links== * Saint Petersburg Declaration of 1868 at International Committee of the Red Cross website. *WWI Document Archive: Conventions and Treaties ** WWI Document Archive > Saint Petersburg Declaration Renouncing the Use, in Time of War, of Certain Explosive Projectiles Category:International humanitarian law treaties Category:1868 in military history Category:1868 treaties Category:1868 in the Russian Empire Category:Treaties of Austria-Hungary Category:Treaties of the Grand Duchy of Baden Category:Treaties of the Kingdom of Bavaria Category:Treaties of Belgium Category:Treaties of the Empire of Brazil Category:Treaties of Denmark Category:Treaties of Estonia Category:Treaties of the Second French Empire Category:Treaties of the Kingdom of Greece Category:Treaties of the Netherlands Category:Treaties of the Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946) Category:Treaties of the Qajar dynasty Category:Treaties of the Kingdom of Portugal Category:Treaties of the Kingdom of Prussia Category:Treaties of the North German Confederation Category:Treaties of the Russian Empire Category:Treaties of the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway Category:Treaties of Switzerland Category:Treaties of the Ottoman Empire Category:Treaties of the United Kingdom (1801–1922) Category:Treaties of the Kingdom of Württemberg ","title":"Saint Petersburg Declaration of 1868"},{"id":"2583452","text":"Bateman may refer to: ==Places== ;Australia *Bateman, Western Australia, a southern suburb of Perth **Electoral district of Bateman, an electorate of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, centred on the suburb *Batemans Bay, a town and bay in New South Wales ;Canada *Bateman, Saskatchewan, a southern farming community ;United Kingdom *Bateman's, the home of Rudyard Kipling ;United States *Bateman, Wisconsin, an unincorporated community ==People== *Ahmad Bateman (born 1961), professional golfer *Angus John Bateman (1919–1996), English geneticist *Brian Bateman (born 1973), professional golfer *C.

It originated as a Java client able to configure and manage databases. ===Oracle Enterprise Manager Application Server Control=== Oracle Application Server also has a web-interface to manage the application server. ===Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control=== To manage many databases and application servers (according to Oracle Corporation, preferably in a grid solution), the Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control can be used. It can manage multiple instances of Oracle deployment platforms; the most recent edition also allows for management and monitoring of other platforms such as Microsoft .NET, Microsoft SQL Server, NetApp filers, BEA Weblogic and others. Partners and IT organizations can build extensions to Oracle Enterprise Manager, and make them available to other Enterprise Manager users via on Oracle hosted web site called Oracle Enterprise Manager Extensibility Exchange. System monitoring features include monitoring functionality that supports detection and notification of impending IT problems. It monitors Oracle Database instances, Oracle Real Application Clusters, and Oracle Application Server Farms and Clusters. OEM Grid Control comes with a set of performance and health metrics that allow monitoring of technology components such as applications, application servers, databases, as well as the back-end components on which they rely, such as hosts, operating systems and storage. The architecture of the OEM for Grid Control has three distinct components: # the collection agent (Oracle Management Agent or OMA) # the aggregation agent (Oracle Management Server or OMS) # the repository agent (Oracle Management Repository or OMR) The OMA runs on the target host and collects information on the hardware, operating system, and applications that run on the target. The OMS runs on one or two servers and collects the data generated by the OMAs. The OMS pulls the information from the OMAs and aggregates the collections into the repository. The OMS also acts as the user- interface — by generating web-pages for database administrators to view the status of systems and services. The OMR comprises an instance of the Oracle database that stores the data collected by the OMS. Installers can make the OMR highly available or fault-tolerant by running it on an Oracle RAC instance across multiple nodes. Plug-ins on each of the OMAs can customise or manipulate the data presented by the OEM by extending the data that the OMAs collect. Administrators can customize the analysis of the data with \\"management packs\\" to look at specific collections of data to display a system's performance. The release of OEM allows for the design and configuration of custom Plug-ins to monitor any application desired. OMAs collect the data using the custom-built plug-in and transmit the results in XML format back to the OMS, which then stores and analyzes the data as desired. Oracle Enterprise Manager continues to expand its monitoring scope by offering management plug-ins for non-Oracle components, that are both Oracle- developed and developed in partnership by third-party vendors. For example, Plug-ins for Veritas Storage Foundation, VMWare vSphere, and EMC Clariion are available. Key features of OEM Grid Control: * System Monitoring * Managing Groups * Job System * Information Publisher * Compliance Management * Extending Enterprise Manager * Managing Targets ===Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control=== This is Oracle's release since 13c ==Functionality== Oracle Enterprise Manager performs much of its activity through intelligent agents which Oracle Corporation refers to as Oracle Management Agents. These run as autonomous proxy processes on a managed node, and perform execution and monitoring tasks for Oracle Enterprise Manager, communicating using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP or HTTPS). By default, upon installation, the OMA enables several packs (Change Management, Performance & Tuning, Diagnostics and Configuration Management) without any regard to what a customer has licensed. Users need to de-select unlicensed packs after installing the agent on a target database. ==Implementation== OEM uses by default the \`SYSMAN\` schema in an Oracle database as a super-administrator account/repository. Utility programs such as \`emctl\` or \`emdctl\` carry out actual functions. OEM also provides a command-line alternative, EMCLI (EM command line interface) with verbs to provide the same functionality as the UI-based EM. ==Version history== * Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 13c Release 4 (13.4) - January 2020https://blogs.oracle.com/oem/oracle-enterprise- manager-134-is-now-available-for-download * Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 13c Release 3 (13.3) - July 2018 * Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 13c Release 2 (13.2) - October 2016 * Enterprise Manager 13c Release 1 (13.1) - December 2015 - ... support for Oracle applications, databases, middleware, hardware and engineered systems * Enterprise Manager 12c (12.1.0.2) - November 2011 - In this edition, Oracle stressed hybrid environments, labeling the release 'Total Cloud Control', included the cloud- oriented Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control. * Enterprise Manager 11g - June 2010 - In this edition, Oracle used the term 'grid' that they had been using to describe the concept that eventually became more popularly known as 'cloud'.

Hammond, 81,.. == Biography and broadcasting career == Happy Hammond was born in Summer Hill, Sydney. Happy was the youngest of 3 children. His parents were both deaf and mute. He was famous for his bright personality and wearing a tartan suit and hat, sometimes referred to as his \\"test pattern\\" outfit, that clashed awfully in real life but worked well on black-and-white TV. His catchphrase was \\"Is everybody happy?\\" along with the theme song for the show \\"Happy days are here again\\". The nickname 'Happy' came from his time in the Army during World War II. He served in the Australian Army in the South West Pacific Area and was transferred following a few concerts to the Australian Army Entertainment Unit the \\"Boomerangs\\" , entertaining Australian troops in combat areas. He performed in concerts entertaining the troops with Keith Glover, who later went on to join the ABC. After the war, the pair took the act to the Tivoli circuit.3RPP interview 1997.05.07 Happy's broadcasting career began in his home town of Geelong when he became the breakfast announcer at 3GL. While there, he made his first TV appearance in 1948, as part of an exhibition using closed-circuit TV equipment for trial purposes.King, by Graeme Blundell, p.79, He then moved to Adelaide's 5KA, before returning to Victoria to work first at 3AW and then 3UZ, both in Melbourne. At 3UZ he hosted The Happy Show, a children's program, as well as partnering Graham Kennedy, following the death of Nicky Whitta in September 1956. Hammond joined television station GTV-9, and shortly after, he invited the young Kennedy to appear on a telethon, where he was noticed by Norman Spencer, leading eventually to Kennedy joining the channel as well.King, by Graeme Blundell, p.82 On TV, the Tarax Happy Show (later the Tarax Show) started on Melbourne's GTV-9 in January 1957, debuting from the Myer Emporium Lonsdale Street store window. During Hammond's time at GTV-9, the program was only seen in Victoria, where it competed with Young Seven on HSV-7. Hammond switched to HSV-7 in 1960, where The Happy Show, no longer sponsored by Tarax, featured Princess Panda (Panda Lisner), Lovely Anne (Anne Watt), Parer the Magician (Tommy Parer), Funny Face (Vic Gordon), Big John (John D'Arcy), Robbie Rob (Bob Horsfall), Cousin Roy (Roy Lyons) and Sylvester the Talking Sock (Ian Wiliams). The program was also relayed to ATN-7 in Sydney. During Watt's absence for her honeymoon in early 1965, her place was taken by a young Olivia Newton-John. Hammond was a keen supporter of the Geelong Football Club in the Victorian Football League (subsequently the Australian Football League). He was accorded the honour of running through the banner with the Geelong players on Grand Final day in 1963. It must have been a good omen – Geelong won the game. == Logie Award == Hammond's program won a Logie Award in 1959 (inaugural year) for Most Popular Children's Show, and Hammond himself won a Logie in 1962 for Outstanding Contributions to Children's Entertainment. After the Happy Show's cancellation in 1968, Hammond moved to produce daytime television morning shows and afternoon children's shows and in his later years to an off-camera role in HSV-7's videotape department, although he continued to appear every year until the 1990s for the station's Royal Children's Hospital Good Friday Appeal. He was occasionally seen on Shirl's Neighbourhood. Limited footage remains from Happy Hammond's career. The most commonly seen clip is a musical finger-clicking routine. A very small number of kinescopes of The Happy Show are held by the National Film and Sound Archive, despite the heavy Wiping of that era. ==References== ==External links== *Monash edu.Australia *Logie Awards *Denzil Howson Archive *Happy Hammond at the National Film and Sound Archive Category:1917 births Category:1998 deaths Category:Australian male comedians Category:Australian television presenters Category:Logie Award winners Category:20th-century Australian comedians ","title":"Happy Hammond"},{"id":"2583466","text":"Kardinya is a suburb of Perth, Western Australia, located within the City of Melville. The suburb is home to under 10,000 people, including many international students due to its proximity to Murdoch University. ==History== The word \\"Kardinya\\" is believed to be of Aboriginal origin, meaning \\"the place of the Karda\\" (racehorse goanna), although it is also recognised as an Aboriginal word for \\"sunrise\\". Much of the area was originally farmland, dating back to the early 1900s. Welby Vineyard, established in 1922 by George Welby, which was the City of Melville's solitary winery, was built on what is now Kardinya. The winery was closed in 1964 and subdivided into housing lots. Part of the suburb was originally a Forest Departments and University of Western Australia pine plantation and reservation. Many streets in the suburb are now named after University of Western Australia personnel, as well as different varieties of pine as a result of the pine plantation. Kardinya is one of Perth's top 10 tightly-held suburbs (July 2013).http://www.perthnow.com.au/realestate/news/perths-most-tighly-held- suburbs/story-fnhlgriw-1226742561605 Source RP Data ==Local business== Kardinya has its own local shopping Centre called Kardinya Park.

Berger, who often portrayed narcissistic and sexually ambiguous characters, was one of the stars of the European cinema in the late 1960s and 1970s. Berger is most famous for his work with Luchino Visconti, particularly in his performance as King Ludwig II of Bavaria in Ludwig, for which he received a special David di Donatello award, and his performance in The Damned for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award. He appears primarily in European cinema, but has also acted in American productions such as The Godfather Part III as well as a guest appearance on the soap opera, Dynasty. ==Early life and education== Berger was born in Bad Ischl, Austria, into a family of hoteliers. After receiving his Matura, Berger initially trained and worked in this field, even though he had no interest in gastronomy or the hospitality industry. At age eighteen, he moved to London, England, where he did odd jobs while taking acting classes. After studying languages at University of Perugia in Italy, Berger moved to Rome, Italy. ==Career== === Until 1976 === Helmut Berger in 1973 Helmut Berger at his home in Rome in 1974 He first met the film director Luchino Visconti in 1964. Visconti gave him his first acting role in the film Le streghe (The Witches, 1967) (in the episode \\"La Strega Bruciata Viva\\"), but he gained international prominence as the amoral Martin von Essenbeck in Visconti's The Damned (1969). In that film, in what is perhaps his best-known scene, he pretends to be Marlene Dietrich in the film The Blue Angel (1930). It was followed by the title role in the Oscar Wilde adaption Dorian Gray (1970) and a leading role in the Oscar-winning Italian drama film The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (1970). In Visconti's Ludwig (1972), Berger portrays Ludwig II of Bavaria from his blooming youth to his dissolute final years. Romy Schneider starred alongside him in the film. This performance got him a David di Donatello award and is perhaps his most famous role. In 1974, Berger starred with Burt Lancaster in Visconti's Conversation Piece. The story of Conversation Piece is often considered as an allegory of the personal relationship between Berger and Visconti. On several occasions Berger mentioned this film as his favorite. In the following he played leading roles in international productions such as Ash Wednesday (1973) alongside Elizabeth Taylor and Henry Fonda. Another film was The Romantic Englishwoman (1975) alongside Michael Caine and Glenda Jackson. He also appeared in Tinto Brass's controversial film, Salon Kitty (film) with Ingrid Thulin in 1976. Well-known photographers including Helmut Newton, Mary Ellen Mark and David Bailey published series of pictures of him. Andy Warhol made polaroids of him and produced serigraphs. Berger was also, in 1970, alongside his then-girlfriend Marisa Berenson, the first man on the cover of Vogue. === After 1976 === The death of his partner Luchino Visconti in 1976 plunged him into a personal crisis. Exactly one year after Visconti died, Berger tried to commit suicide but was found in time to be saved. In the following time the abuse of drugs and alcohol shadowed his acting career. In 1980 Berger was cast by Claude Chabrol as Fantômas before he went to America to work in television in the role of Peter De Vilbis in nine episodes (1983–1984) of the American prime time soap opera Dynasty, which he said he did only for money. He would later say he was \\"crying on the way to the set but laughing on the way to the bank\\". This was his last appearance in a television series. He continued working in the US on various projects, most notably starring in Code Name: Emerald in 1985. In Europe, he acted the TV-miniseries The Betrothed in 1989. In 1990, Berger appeared in The Godfather Part III. He later appeared in the music video to Madonna's song \\"Erotica\\" in 1992, and also appeared in Madonna's book Sex. In 1993, Berger reprised his role as King Ludwig II. in the critically acclaimed film Ludwig 1881. Throughout the second half of the 1990s, he concentrated mainly on European productions, acting in films directed by Christoph Schlingensief, Yves Boisset and many others. In 1997, Quentin Tarantino included some archive footage of the film Beast with a Gun in his film Jackie Brown and thanked Berger in the closing credits for his powerful performance. === 21st century === Helmut Berger (right) and Alexander Tuschinski on the set of Timeless (2015) From the early 2000s to 2009, Berger largely withdrew from the acting world, moving to Salzburg to his mother who was in need of care. She died in 2009. Since then, he has acted in bigger film productions again. 2012, Schwarzkopf & Schwarzkopf Verlag published Helmut Berger – A Life in Pictures, a coffee table book about his life, featuring many previously unreleased photographs of his life and films plus essays in German, English, Italian and French. The book was well received by the press.Der Liebling der Götter. Zeit.de, 23 August 2015 In the thriller film Iron Cross (2009) Berger played Shrager, an aging character believed to be an old SS commander responsible for murdering Jews during World War II. In recent years, Berger has starred in two films directed by Peter Kern – Blutsfreundschaft (shown at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival (2010)), and Mörderschwestern (2011). In 2014, Berger appeared in Saint Laurent as old Yves Saint Laurent for which he was \\"celebrated\\" at Cannes Film Festival. The short film Art!, in which Berger had a starring role, had its world premiere at Paris Independent Film Festival 2015. Most recently, he stars in the role of \\"Professor Martin\\" in the film Timeless by Alexander Tuschinski, due to be released in 2016. In 2015 Austrian filmmaker Andreas Horvath released a feature-length documentary about Helmut Berger called Helmut Berger, Actor. The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival. In the magazine Artforum American film director John Waters chose Helmut Berger, Actor as the Best Motion Picture of the year 2015.John Waters: Best of 2015: Film https://artforum.com/inprint/issue=201510&id;=56221 Berger later filled a lawsuit against Horvath. On February 22, 2018, the premiere of Albert Serra's play, Liberté, starring Helmut Berger and Ingrid Caven was performed at the Volksbühne theater in Berlin. It was the first stage role in Berger's career. In 2019, another documentary film Helmut Berger, meine Mutter und ich was released, dealing with his personality and an attempted comeback. After suffering several lung infections during the last months, Berger announced his retirement from acting in November 2019 and that he wanted to live his eventide away from the public. ==Honours== In 1969, Berger was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for his role in The Damned, and in 1973, he won a David di Donatello – the Italian equivalent of an Academy Award – for his performance in Ludwig. In 2007, he received a special Teddy Award at the 57th Berlin International Film Festival (2007) for his overall professional achievements. In 2010 Berger received two Prix Lumières at the Lumière Film Festival in Lyon and also the \\"golden key\\" of the city. In 2011, he received a Kristián Award, awarded at the Czech film festival Febiofest \\"for Contributions to World Cinema\\".Staff writer (30 March 2011). \\"Festival Diary: Wednesday 30th\\" . Febiofest. Retrieved 10 April 2011. ==Personal life== Berger is openly bisexual. He was in relationships with his director and mentor Luchino Visconti and actress Marisa Berenson. Berger married Italian writer and model Francesca Guidato on 19 November 1994. They live separately today. Berger lived for many years in Rome, but returned to Salzburg in the 2000s to take care of his elderly mother. In the late 1960s and 1970s, Berger was seen as the \\"It Boy of the European Jet set\\". According to his 1998 autobiography Ich. Die Autobiographie, affairs reportedly included Rudolf Nureyev, Britt Ekland, Ursula Andress, Nathalie Delon, Tab Hunter, Florinda Bolkan, Linda Blair, Marisa Mell, Anita Pallenberg, Marilù Tolo, Jerry Hall, Bianca and Mick Jagger. Since the 1980s, Berger's private life was also in the news for his struggles with alcohol and drugs, sometimes resulting in eccentric and controversial television appearances. In 2013, Berger appeared on Ich bin ein Star – Holt mich hier raus!, the German version of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!. He had to leave for health reasons after only two days. ==Reception== ==Filmography== (director in parentheses; all films except as noted) * 1967: Le streghe (The Witches) (Luchino Visconti) as Young man at Hotel (segment \\"La Strega Bruciata Viva\\") * 1968: ' (Antonio Leonviola) as Dario * 1969: ' (Maurizio Liverani) as Aldo * 1969: The Damned (Luchino Visconti) as Martin Von Essenbeck * 1970: Dorian Gray (Massimo Dallamano) as Dorian Gray * 1970: The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (Vittorio De Sica) as Alberto * 1971: Un beau monstre (Sergio Gobbi) as Alain Revent * 1971: The Bloodstained Butterfly (Duccio Tessari) as Giorgio * 1972: La colonna infame (Nelo Risi) as Arconati * 1973: ' (Otto Schenk) as Der Junge Herr / The Youngman / Alfred * 1973: ' (Sergio Gobbi) as Kosta * 1973: Ludwig (Luchino Visconti) as Ludwig * 1973: Ash Wednesday (Larry Peerce) as Erich * 1974: Conversation Piece (Luchino Visconti) as Konrad Huebel * 1975: Order to Kill (José G.

It forms the foundation of the logical volume manager (LVM), software RAIDs and dm-crypt disk encryption, and offers additional features such as file system snapshots. Device mapper works by passing data from a virtual block device, which is provided by the device mapper itself, to another block device. Data can be also modified in transition, which is performed, for example, in the case of device mapper providing disk encryption or simulation of unreliable hardware behavior. This article focuses on the device mapper implementation in the Linux kernel, but the device mapper functionality is also available in both NetBSD and DragonFly BSD. == Usage == Applications (like LVM2 and Enterprise Volume Management System (EVMS)) that need to create new mapped devices talk to the device mapper via the \`libdevmapper.so\` shared library, which in turn issues ioctls to the \`/dev/mapper/control\` device node. Configuration of the device mapper can be also examined and configured interactivelyor from shell scriptsby using the utility. Both of these two userspace components have their source code maintained alongside the LVM2 source. == Features == The position of the device mapper targets within various layers of the Linux kernel's storage stack. Functions provided by the device mapper include linear, striped and error mappings, as well as crypt and multipath targets. For example, two disks may be concatenated into one logical volume with a pair of linear mappings, one for each disk. As another example, crypt target encrypts the data passing through the specified device, by using the Linux kernel's Crypto API. The following mapping targets are available: * cache allows creation of hybrid volumes, by using solid-state drives (SSDs) as caches for hard disk drives (HDDs) * clone will permit usage before a transfer is complete. * crypt provides data encryption, by using the Linux kernel's Crypto API * delay delays reads and/or writes to different devices (used for testing) * era behaves in a way similar to the linear target, while it keeps track of blocks that were written to within a user-defined period of time * error simulates I/O errors for all mapped blocks (used for testing) * flakey simulates periodic unreliable behaviour (used for testing) * linear maps a continuous range of blocks onto another block device * mirror maps a mirrored logical device, while providing data redundancy * multipath supports the mapping of multipathed devices, through usage of their path groups * raid offers an interface to the Linux kernel's software RAID driver (md) * snapshot and snapshot-origin used for creation of LVM snapshots, as part of the underlying copy-on-write scheme * striped stripes the data across physical devices, with the number of stripes and the striping chunk size as parameters * thin allows creation of devices larger than the underlying physical device, physical space is allocated only when written to * zero an equivalent of \`/dev/zero\`, all reads return blocks of zeros, and writes are discarded == Applications == The following Linux kernel features and projects are built on top of the device mapper: * cryptsetup utility used to conveniently setup disk encryption based on dm-crypt * dm-crypt/LUKS mapping target that provides volume encryption * dm-cache mapping target that allows creation of hybrid volumes * dm-integrity mapping target that provides data integrity, either using checksumming or cryptographic verification, also used with LUKS * dm-log-writes mapping target that uses two devices, passing through the first device and logging the write operations performed to it on the second device * dm-verity validates the data blocks contained in a file system against a list of cryptographic hash values, developed as part of the Chromium OS project * provides access to \\"fake\\" RAID configurations via the device mapper * DM Multipath provides I/O failover and load-balancing of block devices within the Linux kernel * Docker uses device mapper to create copy-on-write storage for software containers * DRBD (Distributed Replicated Block Device) * EVMS (deprecated) * utility called from hotplug upon device maps creation and deletion * LVM2 logical volume manager for the Linux kernel * Linux version of TrueCrypt *VDO - Virtual Data Optimizer == References == == External links == * Device mapper home at Red Hat * an article illustrating the use of various device mapper targets * userspace tool to set up software RAID using various RAID metadata formats * Multipath support in the device mapper, LWN.net, February 23, 2005, by Jonathan Corbet Category:Red Hat software ","title":"Device mapper"},{"id":"2583506","text":"Palmyra is a suburb of Perth, Western Australia, located within the City of Melville.

The first blocks were sold in the early 1980s. After the first residents moved in, more blocks were sold off in a number of phases. Shortly after the first residents, a convenience store opened for business, which now includes a post office, IGA store and a florist. Soon the Winthrop Primary school and Winthrop village shopping centre were opened. Blocks were so sought after that many people resorted to sleeping near the sales office for up to a week just to secure a position. The name is derived from that of the first Chancellor of the University of Western Australia, Sir John Winthrop Hackett. There are very few reminders of Winthrop's past as a pine plantation, with scattered remnants of pine trees being the only indication. ==Transport== Winthrop Village Shopping Centre A covered bus stop in Winthrop.

An all-rounder, Wainwright helped to establish the county at the top under Lord Hawke's captaincy, during the early years of County Championship cricket. He also appeared in five Test matches for England, although without any real international success. ==Life and career== Edward Wainwright was born in Tinsley, Sheffield, Yorkshire, England. Wainwright will be remembered for gaining the lowest bowling average in the history of the County Championship – 10.17 for 97 wickets in 1894, a summer of many sticky wickets. On these wickets, he would bowl a perfect length and his spin was such that the ball, \\"popping\\" from the crust of the turf, would gain pace so that not even the most technically correct batsman could hope to survive. However, Wainwright never had any sting on hard pitches. He did not take a single wicket in his five Test matches against Australia. Wainwright featured in four of the five Tests on Stoddart's 1897/98 tour of Australia, but found, not long into the visit, that his off spin was declining to turn. By the conclusion of the tour, Wainwright became convinced of his having lost the facility. When he arrived back in Yorkshire, Wainwright went straight to the nets and noted that the ball immediately started to spin in the manner to which he had been accustomed. A better batsman than bowler, Wainwright suffered from inconsistency, but on his day could play brilliant innings characterised by powerful hitting. Among the best was his 116 which won the match against Kent in 1900. In fielding, Wainwright excelled as a close catcher; along with John Tunnicliffe he gave vital support to Yorkshire's powerful bowling attacks, holding forty two catches in 1895. Wainwright first played for Yorkshire in 1888, and immediately established his place in the side, chiefly through an innings of 105 against the Australians. He developed slowly over the next couple of years, but his performance on a sticky wicket at Sheffield in 1891 was the performance that established Wainwright as a deadly soft-wicket bowler. Wainwright showed no advancement as a batsman until 1893, when he got close to doing the double and played his first Test at Lord's without success. Wainwright was Yorkshire's leading wicket-taker in 1892, though they fared only modestly, and in 1893, aided by some bad wickets due to a dry spring, he took 90 wickets for 12.55 each, to help Yorkshire win its first Championship. By this time, he and Bobby Peel were the finest slow bowling partnership in county cricket, and they were often unplayable when the wicket helped them. In 1894, against Sussex, Wainwright took five wickets in seven deliveries and finished with figures of seven for twenty (thirteen for 38 for the match). Against Middlesex, he took ten for 63, and against Surrey twelve for 108. However, his harmlessness on the best pitch of the season at The Oval made sure that he was not chosen for The Ashes tour that winter. 1895 was disappointing as a batsman and bowler, but his fielding made him a vital member of Yorkshire's eleven. In the dry summer of 1896, he recaptured his ability to exploit the few sticky wickets, and got closer to a thousand runs than ever before. In 1897, though expensive as a bowler, Wainwright hit five centuries and was named for the 1897/1898 Ashes tour in that capacity. However, he again did not perform well in the Tests. 1899 saw Wainwright again of little use as a bowler once the harder pitches came in June, but he played a career-best 228 at the Oval and scored almost as many runs as in 1897. With Rhodes and Haigh now Yorkshire's destroyers on sticky wickets, Wainwright did little bowing in 1900 and 1901 – his last two seasons – but his batting, though inconsistent, remained of use as a last resort. ==Shrewsbury and Cardus== Following his retirement, he went to work as a professional at Shrewsbury School, where he was to replace William Attewell as a young Neville Cardus' colleague. As Cardus recalled in his Autobiography (although he had the date wrong: Wainwright became coach at Shrewsbury in 1914, not 1913) O'Brien, Christopher (2020) Cardus Uncovered. Nottingham: Whitethorn Range Publishing, p. 66, ., > \\"When I went back to Shrewsbury in 1913, I suffered a loss.

It was for many years the most popular apple in New England, New York, and for export from the United States of America. It has also been known as 'Calville Butter', 'Felch', 'Late Baldwin', 'Pecker', 'Red Baldwin's Pippin', 'Steele's Red Winter', and 'Woodpecker'. The Baldwin was one of four apples honored by the United States Postal Service in a 2013 set of four 33¢ stamps commemorating historic strains, joined by Northern Spy, Golden Delicious, and Granny Smith. ==History== Monument to Baldwin Apple at site of discovery (Wilmington, Massachusetts) According to local tradition, the apple was found near Wood Hill by William Butters (1711-1784), grandson of Will Butter, first white settler in what is now Wilmington, Massachusetts. William Butters raised the tree in his yard, near the present Baldwin Apple Monument (pictured). According to S. A. Beach's Apples of New York, the Baldwin originated soon after 1740 as a chance seedling on the farm of Mr. John Ball of Wilmington, Massachusetts, and for about 40 years thereafter its cultivation was confined to that immediate neighborhood. The farm later came into the possession of a Mr. Butters, who gave the name Woodpecker to the apple because the tree was frequented by woodpeckers. Deacon Samuel Thompson, a surveyor of Woburn, Massachusetts, brought it to the attention of Col. Loammi Baldwin, who propagated it and more widely introduced it in eastern Massachusetts. From Col. Baldwin's interest in the variety it came to be called the Baldwin. A monument to the Baldwin apple now stands on today's Chestnut street in Wilmington. The monument's inscription reads: This monument marks the site of the first Baldwin Apple Tree found growing wild near here. It fell in the gale of 1815. The apple first known as the Butters, Woodpecker or Pecker apple was named after Col. Loammi Baldwin of Woburn. Erected in 1895 by the Rumford Historical Association. A harsh winter in 1934 wiped out many of the Baldwin apple orchards in New England.http://www.fedcoseeds.com/trees/search.php?item=10120 Its popularity as an eating apple waned, but some orchards were preserved for many years because of its desirability as a mixing apple for cider. However, the orchards have not been replaced when they played out. Baldwin Apples, unlike many apples, have long been prized for the making of hard cider. \\"West County Cider\\" makes Baldwin Cider from trees planted in the early 1900s. It is their most popular cider. The apple is noted for its particularly small to medium size (ca. 6–8 cm), when compared to other apples like the Macintosh. It is an exceptionally hard apple and would remain remarkably free from blemishes and other blights with few pesticides being needed. Because of its hardness it shipped well without bruising and for a time was prized for this quality. Aside from cider making it was also known as an exceptionally good pie apple and due to its inherent hardness would maintain more crispness through the baking process than other apples would. Essex County, New Jersey, in the time of the Dutch, was also well known for its apple groves and cider, connected with the Bauldwin family. (John Sr. & Jr., signers of the Newark Agreement,~1667, per Arny in Red Lion Rampant) == Today == Baldwin apples Baldwins were once the most popular apples in the United States but have largely fallen out of existence with the introduction of the Red Delicious. While not extinct, they are very difficult to find in stores. Some trees can still be found wild in abandoned orchards in New England, notably in Vermont. == References == ==External links== * Category:American apples Baldwin Category:Wilmington, Massachusetts ","title":"Baldwin (apple)"},{"id":"2583522","text":"UNAPROA (Unión de Amigos para la Protección del Ambiente) was founded by deputies of six village communities in the Brunca Region in the year 1995.

The water source was popular during the Gold Rush.Myer, Chuck, report: Pacheco Past: A History of the Gateway to Santa Clara County, (San Jose, California: Pioneers of Santa Clara County, 1992), page 3. This information is repeated in other sources. Casa de Fruta was founded as an orchard by the Bisceglia brothers, who were Italian immigrants, in 1908.Myer (1992), page 13. Name of first owner is from this source. Three teenaged grand-nephews of the first owner of the orchard opened a roadside cherry stand in 1943, and eventually sold other fruits. In 1967 the remaining two grand- nephews opened a restaurant, Casa de Coffee, gas station, Casa de Diesel, children's playground (including Casa de Choo-Choo, a scale model miniature train with a full size man for the engineer, for children to ride), and gift shop, now known as Casa de Gifts. Other attractions include Casa de Sluice, Casa de Wine and Deli, Casa de Sweets, and roaming peacocks. California State Route 152 passed in front of Case de Fruta as a two-lane highway for many years, but was widened to four lanes in 1992.. The old alignment of the highway still exists as the Casa de Fruta Parkway, which is accessed via an exit from SR 152. ==Facilities and activities== Casa de Fruta today includes a recreational vehicle resort, hotel, candy store, wine shop, cafe, gas station, and a park with a carousel, playground, and miniature train.

LC Subject Headings are an integral part of bibliographic control, which is the function by which libraries collect, organize, and disseminate documents. It first appeared in 1898, a year after the publication of Library of Congress Classification (1897). The last print edition was published in 2016 and access to the continuously revised vocabulary is now available via subscription and free services. Subject headings are normally applied to every item within a library's collection and facilitate a user's access to items in the catalog that pertain to similar subject matter. If users could only locate items by 'title' or other descriptive fields, such as 'author' or 'publisher', they would have to expend significant time searching for items of related subject matter, and undoubtedly miss locating many items because of the ineffective and inefficient search capability. == An art and a science == Subject heading is a human and intellectual endeavor, where trained professionals apply topic descriptions to items in their collections. Without a uniform standard, each library might choose to categorize the subject matter of their items differently. The widespread use and acceptance of the Library of Congress Subject Headings facilitates the uniform access and retrieval of items in libraries across the world using the same search strategy and LCSH thesaurus, if the correct headings have been applied to the item by the library. Some LCSH decisions involve a great amount of debate and even controversy in the library community. LCSH is the world's most widely used subject vocabulary. Despite LCSH's wide-ranging and comprehensive scope, libraries that deal with more specific types of collections or user communities may use other vocabularies; for example, many medical libraries in the United States use the National Library of Medicine's Medical Subject Headings. In Canada, the National Library of Canada worked with LCSH representatives to create a complementary set of Canadian Subject Headings (CSH) to express the topic content of documents on Canada and Canadian topics. == LCSH policy issues == Historically, issues have revolved around the terms employed to describe racial or ethnic groups. Notable has been the terms used to describe African-Americans. Until the 1990s, the LCSH administrators had a strict policy of not changing terms for a subject category. This was enforced to tighten and eliminate the duplication or confusion that might arise if subject headings were changed. Therefore, one term to describe African- American topics in LCSH was 'Afro-American' long after that term lost currency and acceptance in the population. LCSH decided to allow some alteration of terms in 1996 to better reflect the needs and access of library users. Nevertheless, many common terms, or 'natural language' terms are not used in LCSH, and may in effect limit the ability for users to locate items. There is a growing tradition of research in Library and Information Science faculties about the cultural and gender biases that affect the terms used in LCSH, which in turn may limit or deprive library users access to information stored and disseminated in collections. LCSH became the topic of news coverage across the U.S. in 2016 when The Library of Congress decided to revise the heading 'Illegal aliens' and was the subject of opposition from congressional Republicans. Sanford Berman, a notable American science scholar on this subject, has also pointed out the difficulty in finding material on certain topics, such as various denialisms, because the natural language terms for them, climate change denialism, for example, have not been incorporated into LCSH. Criticism has also arisen regarding the biased organization and description of materials on sexuality. Works about heterosexuality are scarcely labeled as such in LCSH, giving users the impression that only queer sexuality deserves examination because heterosexuality is the norm. === Data access === The Subject Headings were formerly published in large red volumes (currently ten), which are typically displayed in the reference sections of research libraries. They are also accessed online in the Library of Congress Classification Web, a subscription service, or free of charge (as individual records) at Library of Congress Authorities. The Library of Congress adds new headings and revisions to LCSH each month. A web service, lcsh.info, was set up by Ed Summers, a Library of Congress employee, circa April 2008, using SKOS to allow for simple browsing of the subject headings. lcsh.info was shut down by the Library of Congress's order on December 18, 2008. This announcement was met with great dismay from the library science and semantic web communities, e.g. Tim Berners-Lee and Tim Spalding of LibraryThing. After some delay, the Library did set up its own web service for LCSH browsing at id.loc.gov in April 2009. == Using LCSH == Timothy Binga, Director of Libraries at the Center for Inquiry, notes issues that make it more difficult to use the standardized language of LCSH to find material. These include systems that allow patrons to informally tag materials in the catalog, book creators and publishers who do their own cataloging, and the incorrect application of LCSH to controversial material. Increasingly, the use of hyperlinked, web-based Online Public Access Catalogues, or OPACs, allow users to hyperlink to a list of similar items displayed by LCSH once one item of interest is located. However, because LCSH are not necessarily expressed in natural language, many users may choose to search OPACs by keywords. Moreover, users unfamiliar with OPAC searching and LCSH, may incorrectly assume their library has no items on their desired topic, if they chose to search by 'subject' field, and the terms they entered do not strictly conform to a LCSH. For example, 'body temperature regulation' is used in place of 'thermoregulation'. Thus the easiest way to find and use LCSH is to start with a 'keyword' search and then look at the Subject Headings of a relevant item to locate other related material. ==See also== * Library of Congress Linked Data Service * Library of Congress Control Number (LCCN) * Faceted Application of Subject Terminology (FAST), a simplified syntax of LCSH * Library of Congress Classification * Minnie Earl Sears: formulated the Sears Subject Headings, a simplification for use by small libraries. * AGROVOC * Books in the United States ==References== ==External links== * Browse LCSH online * Library of Congress Cataloging home page * Cataloging Distribution Service – primary source of Library of Congress Subject Headings * Library of Congress Authorities – allows users to look through the subject headings at no charge Category:Library cataloging and classification Category:Library of Congress Category:Thesauri Category:Controlled vocabularies ","title":"Library of Congress Subject Headings"},{"id":"2583550","text":"Dalaca is a genus of moths of the family Hepialidae.

It was founded in 1923 through the merger of the School of Medicine (established 1903) and the Institute of Law (established 1913). Until 1958 it was named the Syrian University, but the name changed after the founding of the University of Aleppo. There are nine public universities and more than ten private ones in Syria. Damascus University was one of the most reputable universities in the Middle East before the war in Syria started in 2011. The University of Damascus consists of several faculties, higher Institutes, intermediate institutes and a school of nursing. One of the institutions specializes in teaching the Arabic language to foreigners, which is the largest institution of its kind in the Arab world. ==History== La Caserne Hamidieh - previous headquarter of the Syrian University, is the Faculty of Law building In 1901, the establishment of the Office of the School of Medicine in Damascus was approved and in 1903 this school, which is the nucleus of the University, opened. The school included branches in medicine and pharmacy, and the language of instruction was Turkish. In 1913, a Law School opened in Beirut, in which most of the teachers were Arabs and the language of instruction was Arabic. Then this school was transferred to Damascus in 1914 just as the School of Medicine moved to Beirut. Then in the last years of the First World War the Law School returned to Beirut. Following that the Institute of Medicine and the School of Law opened in Damascus, the former at the beginning of January in 1919 and the latter in September of the same year. In 1923, the School of Law was named the Institute of Law and this institute was linked together with the Institute of Medicine, the Arab Society, and the Center of Arabic Heritage in organization under the name of the Syrian University. Then the Arab Society and the Center of Arabic Heritage separated from the organization in 1926. In 1928, the School of Higher Literary Studies was established and it immediately connected its administration with the University. In 1929 it became the School of Letters, which closed in 1935/1936. Then starting in 1946, the University was no longer limited to the Institutes of Medicine and Law, but rather faculties and higher institutions were created in other subjects. In 1958, a new law was created to regulate the universities in the northern and southern regions of the United Arab Republic. This led to changing the name of “the Syrian University” to “Damascus University” and to the creation of a second northern university called “the University of Aleppo.” In 1959, The College of Fine Arts was established in Damascus and became part of Damascus University in 1972. ==Structure== ===Degrees Offered=== Damascus University headquarter in Baramkeh Damascus University awards graduate (Master, Ph.D. Professional Training and Qualification) and undergraduate (Bachelor) degree programs. The period of study for the bachelor's degree ranges from 4 to 6 years, based on the need for each discipline of study. The Master programs combine course work and research, and require a minimum of two years and a maximum of a three. Under certain circumstances, an additional fourth year may be approved by a decision of the university council based on the recommendation of the faculty council. The Ph.D degree is a fully research program. The period of research is not less than two years and not more than five years by the decision of the university council based on the recommendation of the faculty council. although some faculties -Like Faculty of Arts, English Literature Department- does not award Ph.D. degree. ===Faculties=== Damascus University Map * Medicine: Founded in 1903. * Pharmacy: Founded in 1903. * Dentistry: Founded in 1921. * Information Technology: Founded in 1994. * Civil Engineering: Founded in 1961. * Mechanical Engineering & Electrical Engineering: Founded in 1963. * Economics: Founded in 1956. * Arts and Humanities: Founded in 1928. * Education: Founded in 1946. * Agriculture: Founded in 1963. * Islamic Jurisprudence: Founded in 1954. * Architecture: Founded in 1960. * Sciences * Fine Arts: Founded in 1960. * Political Science: Founded in 1979. * Law: Founded in 1913. * Tourism ===Higher institutes=== * Higher Institute of Laser Research and Applications * Higher Institute of Administrative Development * Higher Institute of Seismologic Studies and Research * Higher Institute of Languages * Higher Institute of Translation and Interpretation The Arabic Language Institute at the University of Damascus is recognized as the best center to study Arabic for non-native speakers in the world. The Center for Arabic Study abroad, the premier U.S. organization for Arabic study, is now opening a second branch at the University. The Arabic Language Institute at the University of Damascus is known for immersion instruction in Arabic, allowing more rapid, natural and comprehensive language acquisition. The Arabic Language Institute’s faculty is committed to classical Arabic instruction, offering an advantage to either Egypt or Jordan where much instruction is conducted in the local dialect. ===Technical institutes=== The duration of the study is two years, when the graduate students receive a diploma from the institute itself according to the jurisdiction of their choice. * Technical Institute of Business Administration and Marketing: with the following disciplines: Business Administration – Marketing – Public Relations. * Technical Institute of Finance and Banking Sciences: (formerly known as the \\"Commercial Institute\\", offers associate degrees in the following disciplines: Accounting – financial markets – banking studies.

The is a record of the military exploits of the Takeda family, compiled largely by the Takeda vassal Kōsaka Danjō Masanobu, and completed in 1616 by Obata Kagenori. It provides some of the most detailed descriptions and statistics of warfare in the Sengoku period available today. The term Bushidō was first used in Kōyō Gunkan. The chronicle describes each of the Takeda's major battles, chronicling not only strategy and tactics but the outcomes as well. It describes the Chinese matchlock arquebuses used at Uedahara in 1548, making that the first field battle in Japan to see the use of firearms. And the chronicle tells of the famous one- on-one skirmish fought by Takeda Shingen against Uesugi Kenshin at the fourth battle of Kawanakajima in 1561. Having broken through Takeda's forces, Uesugi Kenshin found his way to Shingen's command tent, where he engaged Shingen directly, slashing at him with his sword. Shingen deflected the attack with his iron war fan, and reached for his own sword. A Takeda retainer then speared Kenshin's horse, forcing him to retreat. In one section, the chronicle gives a detailed breakdown of the entire Takeda army in 1573, counting everything from pages and banner bearers to kitchen staff, horse doctors, and finance commissioners. According to the document, the 33,736 members of the Takeda army included 9,121 horsemen, 18,242 followers for the horsemen, 884 ashigaru (foot-soldiers) within the hatamoto shoyakunin (personal attendants to the lord), and 5,489 other ashigaru. The detailed breakdown of the army also provides an interesting look into the hierarchy of retainers or allies within such a force. The Heihō Okigusho, contained within the chronicle, and attributed to general Yamamoto Kansuke, is one of Japan's earliest treatises on martial arts, along with tactics and strategy. It provides practical advice towards the wielding of sword, spear, gun and bow for the individual warrior rather than for the strategy of an entire troop. Sections by Kosaka Masanobu express his views on the warrior code in relation to the connection between lord and vassal. He compares Shingen to the ideal lord, and contrasts him to his son Takeda Katsuyori, whose poor leadership quickly led to the downfall of the clan. ==References== *Turnbull, Stephen (1998).

He was married to Margaret Agnes (née Somerville) Bunn, a minor actress, in 1819. ==Biography== Bunn was appointed stage manager of Drury Lane Theatre, London, in the year 1823. In 1826, he was managing the Theatre Royal in Birmingham, and in 1833 he undertook the joint management of Drury Lane and Covent Garden, London. In this undertaking he met with vigorous opposition. A bill for the abolition of the patent theatres was passed in the House of Commons, but on Bunn's petition was thrown out by the House of Lords. He had difficulties first with his company, then with the lord chamberlain, and had to face the keen rivalry of the other theatres. A longstanding quarrel with William Charles Macready resulted in the tragedian assaulting the manager. In Macready's own words, he walked past Bunn's door and “going up to him as he sat on the other side of the table, I struck him as he rose a backhanded slap across the face. I did not hear what he said, but I dug my fist into him as effectively as I could; he caught hold of me, and got at one time the little finger of my left hand in his mouth, and bit it.” Bunn also quarreled with the opera singer Jenny Lind, the \\"Swedish Nightingale\\", over her contract. According to Lind's biographers, Henry Scott Holland and W. S. Rockstro, the singer “was so terrified at the penalties, the law-suits, and the disgrace with which Mrs. Bunn had threatened her, that her dearest and most trusted friends could not persuade her to entertain the idea of appearing at an English theatre, under any circumstances, or upon any terms whatever.\\" The controversy was recorded by Bunn in his The Case of Bunn Versus Lind. In 1840, Bunn was declared a bankrupt, but he continued to manage Drury Lane and the Surrey Theatre until 1848 at the age of fifty-two. Artistically, his control of his English theatres was highly successful. Nearly every leading English actor of the time played under his management, and he made an attempt to establish English opera, producing the principal works of Michael William Balfe. He had some gift for writing, and most of the libretti of these operas were translated by him. In The Stage Before and Behind the Curtain (3 vols., 1840), he gave a full account of his managerial experiences. In James Joyce's Ulysses, the main character Leopold Bloom thinks briefly (and incompletely) of a lyric Bunn wrote: \\"Whose smile upon each feature plays with such and such replete”.

He was the nephew of British character actor Verne Morgan. He played many \\"villain\\" roles in British film but is probably best remembered for his starring role in the TV historical adventure series Sir Francis Drake. Terence Morgan was born in Lewisham, London, the only child of parents Frederick Rowland Morgan (a Manipulative Surgeon) and Muriel M Grant. He married actress Georgina Victoria Symondson (known professionally as Georgina Jumel, daughter of actress and entertainer Betty Jumel) on 23 March 1947 in Westminster Register Office and they had one daughter, Lyvia Lee Morgan. His first job was as a shipping clerk at Lloyd's of London before winning a scholarship to RADA. After training at RADA, Morgan began as a repertory theatre actor. His career was interrupted by two years in the army in World War II before he was invalided out. In 1948 he joined the Old Vic Company alongside Laurence Olivier, and played the role of Laertes in the 1948 film of Hamlet. He was the first actor in such a role to get fan mail from teenage girls. In his third role he played a support to Gregory Peck and Virginia Mayo in Captain Horatio Hornblower in 1951. In Mandy (1952) he played the insensitive father of a deaf girl and in Encore in 1951 he played a cad risking the life of his wife. In 1953 he again played a villain in Turn the Key Softly as a crook who gets his girlfriend a prison sentence for helping him in a burglary. More nasty roles quickly followed with Always a Bride (1953) where he played a Treasury Investigator who turns bad as well as Forbidden Cargo in 1954 as a smuggler and Tread Softly Stranger (1958) where he is an embezzler. Two films he made in 1955 saw him cast in more positive roles—in March Hare he played an impoverished aristocrat riding a horse for the Derby, and in the espionage melodrama They Can't Hang Me, (which used Sidney Torch's theme music from The Black Museum for its own Title and Incidental music), he starred as a dapper Special Branch officer charged with discovering the identity of an enemy agent. One of his nastiest roles was in 1959, The Shakedown, when he played a pornographer and blackmailer. 1960 saw him as a petty thief in Piccadilly Third Stop. Morgan's biggest screen success came when he landed the title role in the ITV series Sir Francis Drake, but parts dried up after that as he was no longer seen as \\"the bad guy\\". He appeared in 30 films; other notable roles included the villainous brother of the mummy (Rameses VIII) in Curse of the Mummy's Tomb (1964) and the 1967 shocker The Penthouse where he is an estate agent who is forced to watch as his girlfriend is abused by thugs. The Lifetaker in 1976 had him back as the bad guy again where as a wealthy business man he plans ritualistic revenge on his wife and her lover. In 1986 he appeared in a series, King and Castle and in 1993, The Mystery of Edwin Drood. As roles dried up, Morgan bought a small hotel in Hove, Sussex, and ran it for some years before becoming a property developer. ==Selected filmography== * Hamlet (1948) - Laertes - His Son * Shadow of the Past (1950) - John Harding * Captain Horatio Hornblower (1951) - 2nd Lt.

His stay in Berlin inspired his second novel The Junkers (1968, which won the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize) and confirmed the general sympathy towards the Germans that he felt on account of his mother's part-German ancestry. On returning to England, he took a job as sub-editor on The Times Literary Supplement and shared a flat in Pimlico with Stoppard and Marlowe.Cullen, Miguel (2009). \\"Interview – Piers Paul Read\\" Notes from the Underground In 1967–68, he spent a year in New York – an experience he used in his fourth novel The Professor's Daughter (1971). Read is a practising Catholic and has served on the board of Catholic charities such as Aid to the Church in Need (UK) and the National Catholic Library. He was Master and remains Vice- President of the Catholic Writers' Guild of England and Wales. He has served on the governing bodies of the Institute of Contemporary Arts (1971-1975), the Society of Authors (1973-1976) and the Royal Society of Literature (2001-2007). He is married to Emily Boothby (of the Boothby baronets). They have two sons, including Albert Read (executive), and two daughters. Read lives in London. In 2005, he correctly predicted the election of Joseph Ratzinger as Pope Benedict XVI.Read, Piers Paul (2005). \\"The Man who should be Pope\\" The Spectator, 5 March 2005. In Read's 1988 WWII novel The Free Frenchman, the protagonist's Catholic faith plays an important part in political decisions and dilemmas during the German occupation of France, as well as in the protagonist's tangled relations with the women in his life. ==Work== Early in his career, Read wrote a number of scripts for film and television – Verbrechen mit Vorbedacht (1967) for the German director Peter Lilienthal whom he met in Berlin; Coincidence (1968), The House on Highbury Hill (1971) and The Childhood Friend (1974) /as Wednesday Plays for BBC television – the latter starring Anthony Hopkins who would also play the title role in the television adaptation of Read’s A Married Man (1984). A short play The Class War was staged by the Questors Theatre Company in 1964, and his Margaret Clitherow was broadcast by Granada Television in 1977. The greater part of Read’s work has been in prose form. After his plotless first novel, Game in Heaven with Tussy Marx (1967), Read’s fiction adopted a more traditional narrative structure with both contemporary and historical settings. Three of his historical novels – The Junkers (1968), Polonaise (1976), The Free Frenchman (1986), are set in Continental Europe around World War II; and Alice in Exile (2001) in Russia at the time of the Bolshevik Revolution . Read’s contemporaneous novels – A Married Man (1979), A Season in the West (1988), and The Misogynist (2010) - are ironic critiques of the manners and morals of the English upper-middle classes. There are elements of the thriller in The Villa Golitsyn (1981), On the Third Day (1990), A Patriot in Berlin (1995), Knights of the Cross (1997) and The Death of a Pope (2009), though these too show Read’s historical, political and religious concerns. With Alive. The Story of the Andes Survivors (1974), The Train Robbers (1978), and Ablaze. The Story of Chernobyl (1993) Read extended his range to reportage; to history with The Templars (1999) and The Dreyfus Affair (2012); and to biography with Alec Guinness. The Authorised Biography (2003). He has also contributed to moral and religious controversies with a pamphlet Quo Vadis. The Subversion of the Catholic Church (1991), and essays and articles collected in Hell and Other Destinations (2006). Read was awarded the Sir Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize for The Junkers; the Hawthornden Prize and Somerset Maugham Award for Monk Dawson; the Thomas More Medal for Alive; the Enid McLeod Award for The Free Frenchman; and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for A Season in the West. Read’s novels A Married Man (1984) and The Free Frenchman (1988) were adapted for television; Alive was made into a feature film by the director Frank Marshal in 1993; and Monk Dawson by Tom Waller in 1998. ===Alive=== Read is best known for his non-fiction book Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors which documented the story of the 1972 crash of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 in the Andes mountains. Alive won the Thomas More Medal for the most distinguished contribution to Catholic literature in 1974 and has sold more than five million copies worldwide. The book was adapted into the 1993 film Alive: The Miracle of the Andes. ===Other work=== Read's first notable success was his novel Monk Dawson (1969), which won him a Hawthornden Prize and a Somerset Maugham Award, and was later made into the 1998 film of the same name by Tom Waller. In 1978 he wrote the book The Train Robbers about the Great Train Robbery in England in 1963. In 1988 he was awarded a James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his book, A Season in the West. In 2003 his authorised biography of the actor Alec Guinness was published. In 2009 he wrote The Death of a Pope () set with the 2005 Papal conclave as a backdrop. In 2015 he wrote Scarpia (), a fictional retelling of the story in the Puccini opera Tosca. ===Archive=== Read's archive of literary papers and correspondence is held by Special Collections in the Brotherton Library at the University of Leeds. The collection consists of 139 boxes and contains manuscripts and typescripts of his novels and plays. It also contains articles and short stories; extensive correspondence, interview tapes and research notes; press-cuttings and other papers. ===Themes=== Read's novels are strongly influenced by his Catholic faith.Read, Piers Paul (2009). Interview in The World Over with Raymond Arroyo EWTN, 19 June 2009. His stories focus on the religious themes of sin and redemption. Read writes in a fairly traditional, linear style and he often uses plot elements from popular fiction, especially the thriller, like espionage, murder and conspiracy theories. Most of his main characters are fairly unsympathetic and some of them commit horrific deeds before they finally convert to God. Almost all of Read's novels are set in Europe. Many of his books show a great interest and sympathy especially for Germany – quite unusual in British literature – and for Eastern European countries like Russia and Poland. In The Knights of the Cross, he explicitly satirises the expectations and prejudices of the British readership towards the Germans. ==List of works== === Fiction === *Game in Heaven with Tussy Marx (1966) *The Junkers (1968) *Monk Dawson (1969) *The Professor's Daughter (1971) *The Upstart (1973) *Polonaise (1976) *A Married Man (1979) *The Villa Golitsyn (1981) *The Free Frenchman (1986) *A Season in the West (1988) *On the Third Day (1990) *A Patriot in Berlin (1995) *Knights of the Cross (1997) *Alice in Exile (2001) *The Death of a Pope (2009) *The Misogynist (2010) *Scarpia (2015) ===Non-fiction=== *Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors (1974) *The Train Robbers (1978) *Quo Vadis?

The game featured improved gameplay and grappling techniques compared to its predecessors. This game was the Game Boy Advance successor to WWF Road to WrestleMania from 2001. The game was succeeded by WWE Survivor Series released in 2004. WWE also released WWE WrestleMania X8 for the GameCube in June 2002, making the GBA game in a way the \\"prequel\\", despite WrestleMania X8 being published five months prior. The controls for the game are very limited, as the hand-held Game Boy Advance platform has space for few buttons and devices. Also, very limited external devices can be used to add on to the already existing game features, although it does allow for four player options through direct link cables. WWE Survivor Series (video game)WWE Survivor Series] and WWF Road to WrestleMania were the only other versions of the WWE games developed by Natsume for the GBA, and earned only average reviews from the gaming world. WWE Road to WrestleMania X8 was the most successful out of the three games in regard to both sales and reviews. ==Gameplay== With the limited number of buttons on the Game Boy Advance, just \\"A\\" and \\"B\\", WWE Road to WrestleMania X8 employed a simple approach to simulating wrestling moves. It has been likened to how Fire Pro Wrestling based the actions on timed button pressing and strategy. The combination of a button push and a direction choice when the two wrestlers lock up would result in different wrestling moves and also allowed for moves to be reversed if the timing was right. In addition, characters could climb ropes, perform running moves and pick up weapons. The gameplay was seen as an improvement over the \\"button mashing\\" approach of its predecessor WWF Road to WrestleMania. Reviewers did point out that the game lacked a \\"Create-a-Wrestler\\" feature, most likely due to the limited memory of the Game Boy Advance. While the gameplay itself was improved, several reviewers noted that the Artificial Intelligence that controlled the computer opponents was easy and predictable. The AI also had problems during multi-man matches, on occasion attacking their own partner during a game. ==Match types== WWE Road to WresteMania X8 features four different game modes, Exhibition, Championship Mode, pay-per-view mode and Gauntlet mode. The Championship allowed a player to play through a WWE \\"Season\\" from the day after WrestleMania X-Seven until WrestleMania X8 to challenge for various WWE championship. The pay-per-view mode allowed the player to create a number of matches for a specific WWE PPV to play through. In the Gauntlet mode the player must survive against a set number of opponents, one match at a time. The game allows players to choose standard match options like one versus one, tag team matches as well as options such as lumberjack matches, with other wrestlers around the ring, Hardcore matches where weapons are allowed and even play a fifteen-man version of the Royal Rumble match as well as playing an eight-man King of the Ring tournament. Multiple players could play together, as many a four players if they all have the game cartridge and connect by using the GameLink cable. Since the Game Boy Advance platform has limited memory the roster for the game included only 15 wrestlers, a reduced number from the previous game's 24: Kurt Angle, Booker T, Edge, Christian, Bubba Ray Dudley, D-Von Dudley, Hulk Hogan, Chris Jericho, Kane, Kevin Nash. Rob Van Dam, The Rock, Triple H, Test and the Undertaker. Of the 15 wrestlers selected for the game only Kevin Nash had not actually wrestled at WrestleMania X8, but did appear on the show as he accompanied Scott Hall (who was released from the company during the game's development) for his match against Stone Cold Steve Austin (which also did not appear in the game, likely due to creative issues that year). Test was not part of the pay-per-view broadcast but did wrestle on the pre-show. ==Visual and audio== The gameplay takes place in a \\"side-to-side\\" view of the ring from a single, fixed point of view providing a view of the wrestlers themselves and the audience in the background. The digitized sprite character were described as \\"As a result, the characters look just like their onscreen counterparts.\\" it was also stated that \\"They also move rather smoothly as well, thanks to an overall increase in animation. \\" From an audio standpoint the game featured versions of each wrestler's entrance music and the occasional catch phrase, but no ring commentary during the match. The sound was described as \\"high- quality as well, with punches, kicks, and slams having a crisp meaty sound that really captures the high-impact world of the WWE. \\" ==Reception== The game received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic, based on a total of ten reviews, four of which were positive and six were mixed. Metacritic's user score was slightly better, listed as \\"generally favorable\\" with a score of 7.5. The GameZone review noted that \\"This game fits the platform very nicely. The game may not do a great job in vertical movement, and you may have a time finding the right line that your opponent is on, but the game does a solid job of emulating WWE wrestling while challenging and entertaining game players.\\" and rated it as \\"great\\". ==See also== * List of licensed wrestling video games * List of fighting games ==References== ==External links== * Category:2002 video games Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:Game Boy Advance-only games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Natsume (company) games Category:THQ games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Iku Mizutani Category:Video games scored by Hiroyuki Iwatsuki Category:WrestleMania video games Category:Professional wrestling games ","title":"WWE Road to WrestleMania X8"},{"id":"2583658","text":"The 2005 Al-Aaimmah bridge stampede occurred on August 31, 2005 when 953 people died following a stampede on Al-Aaimmah bridge, which crosses the Tigris river in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. ==Incident== At the time of the stampede, around one million pilgrims had gathered around or were marching toward Al Kadhimiya Mosque, which is the shrine of the Shi'ite Imam Musa al- Kazim. Tensions had been high within the crowd. Earlier in the day, seven people had been killed and dozens more wounded in a mortar attack upon the assembled crowd for which an Al-Qaeda linked insurgent group claimed responsibility.https://www.forbes.com/work/feeds/afx/2005/08/31/afx2199216.html Al-Qaeda linked group claims mortar attack in Iraq that led to stampede - Forbes.com Near the shrine, rumors of an imminent suicide bomb attack broke out, panicking many pilgrims. Interior Minister Bayan Baqir Solagh said that one person \\"pointed a finger at another person saying that he was carrying explosives...and that led to the panic\\". The man was presumed to be wearing a suicide explosive belt on the bridge.Explosive belt The panicked crowd flocked to the bridge, which had been closed. Somehow, the gate at their end of the bridge opened, and the pilgrims rushed through. Some people fell onto the concrete base and died instantly. The ensuing crush of people caused many to suffocate. The pressure of the crowd caused the bridge's iron railings to give way, dropping hundreds of people into the Tigris river. There was nowhere on the bridge for the people to go, as the other end of the bridge remained closed, and was impossible to open anyway, as it opened inward. Owing to the nature of the incident many of those who died were those who could be considered physically weakest, such as the elderly, women and children. ===Attempts to rescue people=== People dived in from both ends of the bridge trying to help those drowning in the river. On the Sunni side, calls went out from the loudspeakers of local Mosques to help those in trouble. A Sunni Arab teenager, Othman Ali Abdul-Hafez (, ‘Uthmān ‘Alī ‘Abdul-Ḥāfiẓ) succumbed to exhaustion as he rescued people in the water. Thus he had drowned, and was later praised as a \\"martyr\\" by Iraqi politicians. ==Aftermath== A three-day mourning period was announced by Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari. Iraqi President Jalal Talabani said the catastrophe \\"will leave a scar in our souls and will be remembered with those who died in the result of terror acts.\\" Many of the dead were buried in the holy Shia Islamic town of Najaf. There was some political fallout also from the event, with Mutalib Mohammad Ali, The Minister for Health, blaming the Defence Ministers for not doing enough to secure the area. However, the Prime Minister dismissed any calls for resignation for any ministry. After the stampede, a few commentators in the Western media speculated that given the scale of the incident it might tip the country into a civil war by antagonizing the Shi'a community. However, there was no immediate surge in sectarian violence. Opposition groups blamed the government and security forces for failing to prevent the incident. However, these groups themselves often encourage high turn-outs at religious events to prove the relative strength of their sect. Another factor leading to a high turn-out at Shia religious events is the fact such events were banned under Saddam Hussein, and so many attend to express faith in a way they were banned from doing for decades. ==World reaction== Governments and world leaders offered their condolences after the deadly stampede: *Syrian Foreign ministry official quoted by state news agency Sana: :\\"The Syrian government and people express their sympathy to Iraqis and to the families of the victims, and they wait for the day when security, stability and progress reign in the country.\\" *Iran Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi: :\\"[Iran offers its] condolences and sympathy with the Iraqi people and government. Suspicious hands are involved in conspiracies to incite violence and bloodshed among the different Iraqi groups and tribes so that they disturb the security and calm of the Iraqi people\\" *UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, speaking on behalf of the EU and the UK - current holder of the EU presidency: :\\"It is still not clear exactly what started the stampede which led to these hundreds of deaths and injuries. However, it is clear that the same crowd of Shia pilgrims, celebrating an important Shia religious festival, had earlier suffered a mortar attack... I condemn utterly this despicable act of terrorism against innocent civilians just as I condemn, too, those that continue to use violence and terror more widely in order to further their aims in Iraq. The depravity of these individuals who commit these acts of terrorism against their fellow Muslims sadly knows no bounds.\\" *United States Department of State spokesman Sean McCormack: :\\"The United States deeply regrets the tragic loss of life of worshipers in Kadhimiya, Baghdad today... Our sincere condolences and thoughts and prayers go out to the many Iraqi families who lost loved ones in this tragedy.\\" The stampede received relatively little attention in the U.S. media because it occurred just two days after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, the aftermath of which continued to dominate headlines. *Amr Mussa, Arab League Secretary General :\\"[We need a] redoubling of Arab efforts to support the Iraqi people in their sad hour.\\" *Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf :\\"It is with most profound sadness and grief that I had learnt about the death of hundreds of pilgrims in Baghdad.\\" *UN spokeswoman Marie Okabe: :\\"The secretary general has learned with great sadness of the human tragedy that took place today in Baghdad.\\" ==See also== * List of human stampedes * Karbala stampede ==References== == External links == * BBC News Iraq stampede deaths near 1,000 **Iraq head defiant after stampede * CNN : Iraq mourns 965 stampede victims *Reuters: Iraq mourns as stampede loss overshadows war * The Times: Panicked pilgrims were crushed or leapt for their lives into Tigris * The Guardian: A cry of suicide bomber, and 700 perish in Iraq stampede **'They were crying to be rescued.

On one end a cylinder shape is spring-loaded; when the edge finder touches an edge, a kickoff of this cylinder is noticed. On the other end a cone shape is also spring-loaded and is used to locate the center of a previously drilled hole. This style of edge finder is considered to be the most accurate, and its accuracy can be further improved through the use of a collet. In proper setups, a repeatability of or better can be obtained. ==Electronic edge finder== Electronic edge finder Sometimes also (erroneously) referred as a digital edge finder, this instrument can locate edges of work pieces and also height offsets. It works in a non-rotating spindle, which is a great advantage over its mechanical counterparts. It is battery-operated and works by lighting up its internal LED (usually red) when the electrical circuit formed by the instrument, the workpiece and the machine is closed. The light is thus illuminated when the edge finder is touching the workpiece and is visible through openings in the case. A repeatability of can be obtained. ==Center finder== Center finder A tool used to align the machining center to specific locations on stock or work pieces. Often these locations might be marked using layout method (bluing the surface and scribing a precise location with the intersection of the two lines identifying the position to be machined, etc. Sometimes a magnifying glass is used to assist in marking the location. One drawback of this method is that it is only as accurate as the lines that are drawn on the part.). In contrast to the edge finder, in the mechanical versions, the tip is not spring-loaded, and it works with the spindle stopped. In laser versions, an 'X' of light is often projected from the machining center onto the work piece and the work piece location is adjusted to align with the intersection of these lines. In contrast to centering devices, the center finder cannot directly find the center of a work piece, thus requires additional calculation, measurement and/or layout method to align to. ==Centering device == A tool used to accurately adjust and align the center plane or axis of a work piece or work piece feature to the machining center. In contrast to the edge finder, it most often requires no calculation, measurements or layout method markings to allow this alignment. Mechanical versions may work with the spindle stopped. Laser centering devices can be used to cast patterns of light which, depending on angle of the laser, can achieve a high degree of precision.

Head inherited a strong love of literature from his mother's side of the family through which he was related to E.V Lucas, the author. Through his mother Head also had surgical blood, related as she was to Marcus Beck. Several of Head's siblings were also to be successful in their own fields: Francis Head joined Lloyd's alongside his father and became the director of Henry Head and Co. until his death, aged 37, in 1905. Christopher Head, a Conservative Party councillor and mayor of Chelsea from 1909 to 1911, took over from his brother until his own death aboard the RMS Titanic in 1912.Notice of Christopher Head's death. Aberdeen Daily Journal Early in his childhood, Head's family moved from Stoke Newington to Stamford Hill where they inhabited a house decorated for them by William Morris. Henry had, by this time, attended two-day schools and he now enrolled as a weekly boarder at Friends' School, Grove House, Tottenham. It was here that he met his first mentor, Mr. Ashford, a master at the school. Head described Ashford as \\"one of the best teachers of natural science I have ever encountered.\\" This was the man, he said, to whom he \\"[owed] the fact that [he] was firmly grounded in the elements of natural science at an age when boys at an ordinary school in my day were ignorant of its existence.\\" Perhaps it is to Ashford that we owe the direction Head’s later studies took, though it is clear that Head had a natural propensity for scientific learning, even at this early age. From preparatory school he went on to Charterhouse, which had recently moved from London to Godalming. Here he came under the influence of a second science master, W.H.W. Poole, who recognised his pupil's innate talents. Under Poole's guidance he was given a grounding not only in the prescribed Biology, but also elements of Physiology. He was also given private home tuition in dissection and cutting microscopic sections. Having gained a place at Trinity College, Cambridge, the budding scientist decided to forgo his final term at Charterhouse in favour of foreign study. Studying physiology and histology at Halle University in Germany and Head was soon proficient in the German language. Later in his life, Head would be repeatedly mistaken for a German at frontier posts due both to his aptitude for the language and his markedly Germanic physical appearance.Sir Henry Head.

Through his mother he had gained a love of literature and this would do much to direct his choice of acquaintances in later life when he was to become firm friends with authors (most notably to Thomas Hardy) and a mentor to the poet Siegfried Sassoon. This passion was also to initiate another, as in literature he and his future wife Ruth (a writer in her own right) were to find common ground. Returning to England in time to go up to Cambridge where he made friends and acquaintances who would become distinguished in their own rights: D'Arcy Thompson, W.R Sorley, A.N Whitehead and William Bateson were among them. ===Medical career=== Head once stated that he could not recall a time in his life when he had not wished to pursue a career in medicine. He often thought that the dream of becoming a doctor could have first been formed at the age of eight when his family was involved in an epidemic of scarlet fever. He remembered being taken to spend a few days with the family doctor, Mr. Brett, and one morning at breakfast he startled his family by repeating a procedure that the doctor had used during his illness. Pouring a little tea onto a teaspoon, he had heated it over an oil lamp and carefully inspected the result, checking the tea for albumin as Mr. Brett had done with his urine. Head left Cambridge with a first class degree in both parts of the Natural Science Tripos, and decided to travel abroad once more, this time to inspect laboratories in Germany. Dissatisfied with some that he visited, he decided to travel to Prague to visit Ewald Hering. He was immediately impressed, both by the facilities and the man and indeed the feeling seems to have been mutual as Hering invited Head to stay with him at once. In Prague, Head carried out work on the physiology of respiration and was given an account of his own researches in colour vision. Head would later pass on what he had learned about vision to his friend and colleague W. H. R. Rivers who came to be eminent in this field amongst others. Head remained in Prague for two years, expanding his knowledge and his interests before returning to Cambridge to complete courses in anatomy and physiology and joining University College Hospital, London, where he was to qualify as a doctor in 1890. There he was house physician whilst also working under Dr. Thomas Buzzard at the National Hospital, Queen Square. His earlier experiences in Prague had created an interest in the physiology of respiration and he was later attracted to the Victoria Hospital for Diseases of the Chest, where he became a house physician. While respiratory disease intrigued him, it is clear even from his earliest writings that his developing fervour was for neurology. His Cambridge M.D thesis 'On disturbances of sensation with especial reference to the pain of visceral disease,' was based upon patients Head had seen and was later published in Brain (Head, 1893). Which begins: \\"Several years ago I was led to examine the positions occupied by pain in disorders of the stomach and I soon came to the conclusion that the usual description was incomplete in several respects.... I then began to investigate the distribution of herpes zoster in the hope that a skin lesion which was notoriously of nervous origin might throw some light on the meaning and significance of the tender areas in visceral disease.... I next attempted to determine to what level of the nervous system these areas belonged, with the help of cases in which gross organic lesions were present.... This opened up the whole question of sensation in its various forms, but in this paper I shall not do more than touch upon the relations between the distribution of the sensations of pain, of heat, of cold and of touch.\\" This early work on sensation was later to form the basis for one of his most ground-breaking studies 'A Human Experiment in Nerve Division.' While Head's main interests are clear, he never limited himself solely to one particular area of study. In his second paper on the subject of pain produced by visceral disease (Head, 1894), again based upon evidence from the hospitals he had worked in, we find him covering a wide field of medicine; considerable attention is paid to diseases of the heart and lungs. He was a general physician with a speciality in physiology, driven by experience into an interest in pain which later led him to find a neurological basis for sensation in general. While his academic interests varied and evolved, professionally he was a general physician from first to last. ===\\"Some men find teaching difficult: others are born teachers\\"=== Russell Brain comments that while Head was a physician by profession, he was a born teacher. Appointed medical registrar to the London Hospital in 1896 and elected assistant physician four years later, there is a verbatim report of one of his rounds in 1900. On this day he showed the young men a patient with mitral stenosis, adherent pericardium and heart failure. Almost twenty years later, one of these young men (a Dr. Donald Hunter) recorded him as teaching on the difference between bronchial and cardiac asthma. Head first showed his talent for teaching at the age of 21 when he addressed the Stoke Newington Mutual Instruction Society at the Friends Meeting House, Park Street, on the fertilization of plants. Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching: > I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the > mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He told me > to buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our > journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow > travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as > we walked to the hospital from St. Mary's station people on the other side > of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly > interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and > anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his > sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on > clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his > rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had > written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to > nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I > clerked to teach us physical signs and – how to examine patients of all > kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when > demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia > or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the > 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct > boundary was approached. Head's unwillingness to be wrong was not always of benefit to him. One day a fellow of his, William Bullock, decided to test the extent of Head's 'omnipotence'. Asking the doctor at lunch whether he had read Hagenheimer's new book on locomotor ataxia. Head replied he had only had time to glance at it. Bullock commented, \\"Well, you have done better than the rest of us. There is no such book.\\" While this experience would appear more 'uncomfortable' than harmful, Head's need to be certain did prove a hindrance when his sensations were being tested by Rivers in their 'Human Experiment in Nerve Division'. As is written in the report, if Head concentrated too closely on the task, his anxieties about being right tended to make him give the wrong answer. It was only when he forgot completely about the experiment that he managed to be precise about his sensations. Despite his 'need to know', Sherrington states that \\"as a teacher he had himself a wide and devoted following\\". His ward rounds were often crowded with students, attracted, as Brain puts it, by his \\"gift of exposition, enthusiasm, and sense of the dramatic.\\" He endeared people to him with mannerisms which Sherrington states to have been \\"very symbols of him.\\" One example of Head's confidence and unflappability occurred when he was listening to a female patient's heart. Without warning the patient threw her arms around the doctor and kissed him. Without hesitation, Head turned to his students, telling them calmly that this was \\"typical, gentlemen, typical\\". After the First World War, suggestions were made that Head should become the first professor of medicine at London. This proposal got far but it was not to be. Brain states that it \\"would have been an exciting experiment for Head\\" as he had such strong views on medical education. Almost twenty years previously he had written in his diary: \\"Medical education in England suffers from the fact that the great hospitals are manned by practitioners of medicine who sometimes teach, instead of by professors of that science who occasionally practise.\\" ===Henry and Ruth=== Henry Head and Mary Ruth Mayhew (1866–1939), daughter of Mr. A.L Mayhew of Wadham College, Oxford, were married in 1904, seven years after having met. A young Ruth Mayhew They were an eminently well-matched pair. Both were unquestionably keen minded. Henry made every effort to be on equal terms with his wife; one prime example of this occurred in 1911 when, frustrated by his inability to speak French as well as his wife, he went to France for several weeks to remedy this. She too took an interest in everything that he did; as Gordon Holmes writes \\"she shared his interests, stimulated his enthusiasms, criticized his writings and relieved him of many of the petty worries of life.\\" Henry was a keen writer and on this too he and his wife shared common ground. Ruth was also the author of several books, including two novels ('Compensation' and 'A History of Departed Things'), a collection of the works of Thomas Hardy (with a foreword by her husband) and a translation of 'Der kleine Tod' ('The Little Death') by the German author Irene Forbes-Mosse. Often she published books as 'Mrs. Henry Head' and most of Head's poems are dedicated to his wife; 'Destroyers and other verses', for example, is inscribed 'To Her without whose touch the strings would have been mute'. As close as they were, often their jobs kept them apart for long periods. Particularly at the start of their relationship they were able to see very little of each other. She had been an assistant mistress at Oxford High School and later became a headmistress in Brighton and his medical career had kept him in London. Even after their marriage they found it hard to spend time together as Head spent most weekends from 1903 to 1907 in Cambridge experimenting with Rivers. To cope with the long periods of separation, they started writing a joint diary and commonplace book. Each had a volume and they would exchange them from time to time so that they could comment on each other's experiences, thoughts and reading. The one failing of their marriage was that it remained childless. Head adored children, as can be seen in his poemsSee especially 'I Am Loved By Little Children' and his poetry also gives considerable insight into Head's great desire for a child of his own. In his poem Long Ago I used to Pray, for example, he takes on the perspective of a woman yearning for 'the fierce joy of motherhood' and presents a sympathetic view of her plight. Head's deeply personal poems also could be said to suggest that Ruth had at some point been pregnantSee To Her There Came At Dawn, As She Lay Still (maybe more than onceNo Longer, When the Cold and Sterile Moon contains many euphemistic references to pregnancy and miscarriage which could be attributed to personal experience) and perhaps even to term.Poems such as The First Fruits of A Pregnant Soul’s Increase and A Wood-fire Bright and Candle-light imply intimate knowledge of the pain of losing a child Whatever the case, it is clear that nature was unkind to them but Ruth remained optimistic, stating that this had been more than compensated for by the part he had played in her life. She was his constant companion through the disease that slowly and cruelly destroyed him. As Holmes writes, \\"in his later years her philosophical outlook, her joy in life and her encouragement helped him to bear an illness which otherwise would have been an intolerable fate to one of his active mind and body.\\" Ruth died almost exactly a year before her husband. ===Regeneration=== Henry and Ruth Head appear alongside Rivers in the novel Regeneration by Pat Barker, a name derived partially on the 'regenerating' of the minds of soldiers and the opinions of civilians in the First World War which takes place during the book and partially from Head's experiments with Rivers on nerve regeneration. From the earliest stages of his career, Head had had a keen interest in sensation, especially in relation to the symptoms of clinical disease. He first looked at sensation through physiological eyes, using his training from Prague and Cambridge, but he soon became aware that psychological factors also had a major part to play. The first piece he ever published was on the subject of pain and areas of abnormal sensibility and his observations were so accurate that these became universally known as 'Head's areas'. Head thought it probable that sensation related to innervation of the skin, but there was no accurate knowledge of cutaneous distribution of afferent fibres which enter the spinal cord by each dorsal root and terminate in one spinal segment. To remedy this lack of understanding, Head chose to investigate the anatomic distribution of cutaneous disturbances caused by herpes zoster. A careful study with A.W. Campbell enabled him to demonstrate the zones of skin affected by disease and from this he could chart the cutaneous distribution of different fibres originating from cells of each ganglion and reaching the corresponding segment of the spinal cord. From these investigations, Head and Campbell made two important discoveries. Firstly, they demonstrated the cutaneous distribution in man of each afferent root, a valuable aid to the localisation of diseases of the spinal cord and its roots. Secondly, they revealed the mechanism of 'referred pain' so often associated with visceral disease. What they found was that many herpetic areas representing the peripheral distribution of single roots or individual sections of the cord, corresponded closely with areas of referred pain from diseases of different internal organs. This led Head to conclude that irradiation of abnormal afferent impulses produces a state of excessive irritability in the grey matter of the dorsal horn at the level which they enter it. As a result of this, impulses from the skin that pass through it are exaggerated or disordered so that a stimulus that would not usually provoke a painful reaction does so. Head also became increasingly interested in the mental changes brought on by visceral disease and he based his Goulstonian Lectures before the Royal College of Physicians on this topic. For the next twelve years, Head devoted himself to the study of the physiological basis for sensation. To do this he studied the manner in which afferent impulses subserving sensation are integrated and conducted to the forebrain. He also paid close attention to the function of the brain in integrating impulses of a different nature and from the various sense organs. Throughout the many arduous and time-consuming experiments of this period, Head is described as maintaining his energy and enthusiasm with his vivid imagination suggesting new lines of thought for every problem. Head also recognised that his enthusiasm could sometimes limit his judgement so he always consulted a multitude of peers when conducting a new experiment. Beginning by examining patients in whom nerves had been divided, Head and his co-worker J. Sherren soon realised the folly in using patient subjects. Being unacquainted with medicine, the patients were unable to provide accurate accounts of their sensations and thus they were inappropriate subjects for psycho-physical testing. With this in mind, Head offered himself up as the test subject. In April 1903 an operation was performed by Sherren to divide two cutaneous nerves in Head's left forearm: the radial and the external. The regeneration of these nerves was charted over the next four years. Every Friday, Head would travel to Rivers' rooms in St John's College, Cambridge to conduct the experiments. It had soon become obvious that external distractions had an adverse effect on results and so Head sat every weekend with his eyes closed as Rivers charted the areas of sensitivity. Head described the data they collected as being 'completely out of accord with any view of the mechanism of sensation as yet put forward'. Head and Rivers had discovered two constituents of cutaneous sensibility: the protopathic system, through which pain and degrees of heat and cold beyond normal thresholds can be recognised but not accurately localised, and an epicritic system which is concerned with the perception of light touches, degrees of temperature natural to the skin, accurate localisation of stimulus and discrimination of two simultaneous contacts. They also discovered that the 'all or nothing' protopathic system was the first to recover after the operation so that painful stimulus was the first to register. Head spent the next few years following up on his findings. With Theodore Thompson he grouped afferent impulses within the spinal cord whilst studying the brain for its pain centres. During the First World War his studies continued as he worked with G. Riddoch to test reflex activities of isolated portions of spines subjected to gunshot wounds. Head's final study was one of degeneration, a project made all the more poignant and fascinating by the fact it was, in part, his own degeneration that he was to be studying. As Parkinson's disease worked away at his own faculties of speech he combined his knowledge of neurology with his intensive war studies on defects of speech produced by brain injuries to produce two large volumes under the title Aphasia and Kindred Disorders of Speech (1926). These volumes were devoted not only to the clinical or symptomatic aspects of disturbances of speech, but were also an attempt to investigate the psychical processes concerned therein, and the physiological integrations necessary for the comprehension and expression of ideas as language. ==='To Courage, Seated'=== During the First World War, Head treated patients with brain injuries in London. The war prompted Head to write poetry which was later published in 1919 in the volume Destroyers and Other Verses, it also brought him together with fellow poet Siegfried Sassoon, who was under Rivers's care. After Rivers's premature death in 1922, Head adopted the mentoring role that he had once occupied, comforting a distraught Sassoon with remembrances of their friend and reassurances that nothing mattered except life. Shortly after the war as Head preceded his guest, Grantly Dick-Read, into the hospital dining room Read heard Head's shuffling footsteps. Head turned and said, \\"Ah I see I have taught you too well!\\" This marked the onset of Parkinson's symptoms which would lead him to retire from the hospital in 1919. It was Sassoon who suggested that the Heads go to live in Dorset as a neighbour of their mutual friend Thomas Hardy. Throughout his illness, Head remained as mentally alert as ever. In 1921 he delivered a Croonian Lecture to the Royal Society on 'Release of function of the nervous system' and he continued to edit the medical journal Brain (which he had been doing since 1910) until 1925. Head's 'complex personality', the vibrant mix between scientist and artist and his enthusiasm for all that he loved is something that never left him. He talked \\"equally readily on literature, art, music, the latest scientific achievements and the affairs of everyday life.\\" Gordon Holmes recalled one occasion when he spent a few days in the country with Head. On one evening when they were playing bowls he began developing a theory on how greater accuracy could be obtained; the next day he heard him demonstrate to a chance acquaintance, who unknown to him was an authority on the subject, the architecture of an ancient cathedral, and that evening discuss an abstruse musical problem with an expert musician. As Robert Nichols stated in The Times: > Sir Henry possessed the fullest as well as the wisest mind I have ever > known. It was no unusual thing to hear him in the course of one evening > discourse on topics so various as: the influence of reasoning upon Goethe > and Mozart, types of apprehension in listeners to symphonic music, > sensations while looping the loop (he was over 60 when he did so), the > painting of Guardi, 'co-ordination' in a star golfer, Ninon de Lenclos, > Conrad as a narrator (Sir Henry was far the ablest literary critic I have > ever known), religious ecstasy, the relation of art and science, the social > customs of Melanesia. On each of such topics he not only appeared to have > more information than anybody in the room, but spoke after a more > illuminating fashion, for, like Leonardo (on whom he was an authority) he > had a supreme eye for the significant. Nor did he resemble Leonardo in mind > only. He had Leonardo's lofty human compassion, humility, patience, and > profound serenity of spirit.\\" (10 October 1940) Head faced his debilitating illness with a great degree of heroism. As Dr.George Riddoch wrote: > When his final work on aphasia was finished we discussed the situation > together. With his practical philosophy he accepted it at once, and his > amazing power of adaptation enabled him to plan the rearrangement of his > life. With his excellent general health he well knew what he had to face – > long years of steadily increasing physical disablement, with his mind > unimpaired except in its capacity for continuous effort; in the grip of a > relentless foe which medical science could not restrain.

To Head, ever the scientist, the illness was his \\"second personal experiment\\" and he described its progress as thoroughly as the first. His final wish was to aid 'the purpose of the advancement in England of the science of medicine in the widest sense' with the Royal Society as residuary legatee. He had led a productive life and he had been rewarded with many honours for his art of science. Granted membership and, in 1900, fellowship to the Royal College of Physicians, he was also elected as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1899 and was to be given a role on the council, a silver Royal Medal and a vice- presidency in turn. Knighted in 1927 he was also to be granted an Honorary Fellowship at his alma mater, Trinity College, in 1929. All of this well- deserved recognition for a man who, had his headmaster had his way, would never have completed his education. Eleven months after his wife's death, Henry Head died at Hartley Court. The Death Certificate states cause of death as being bronchopneumonia and paralysis agitans. He was cremated at Reading Crematorium on 11 October 1940 and his ashes scattered in the Gardens of Remembrance. In his Will he left a legacy to science but through the force of his personality and the lasting remembrance of his courage, he left a legacy to humanity: (Died of His Wounds, Henry Head, 1918) ==Bibliography== ===Science=== ====1890s==== * On disturbances of sensation with especial reference to the pain of visceral disease.

He was apprehended in 1974 by British police and extradited back to Hong Kong and subsequently convicted for police corruption and bribery. Godber was sentenced to four years in prison with HK$25,000 in restitution. == Biography == Born in London, Godber served as a police officer in Hastings before heading to Hong Kong in 1952. Before his downfall on corruption charges, Godber had been regarded as a brave and effective senior police officer who played a leading role in restoring order during the major disturbances of 1966–1967 and who was decorated for his efforts. At this time, the Red Guard unrest in mainland China, coupled with the Macau debacle in December 1966, stimulated the Communists in Hong Kong to try to bring down the colonial administration. Hong Kong was subject initially to industrial action, spreading to riots and a bombing campaign against those regarded by the Communists as opposing re- unification. Ten Hong Kong policemen were killed by bombs and attacks in the streets. Before his retirement in 1973, Godber had the equivalent of nearly HK$4.4 million (approximately US$865,000 in 1973, ) in bank accounts located in Canada, Australia, Singapore, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong. The police anti-corruption branch investigated his mysterious wealth and ordered him to explain his source of income. In response, on 7 June 1973, Godber immediately arranged for his wife to leave the colony. On 8 June, he used his Civil Aviation Department permit to bypass immigration and passport checks and walked onto a plane at Kai Tak Airport for London. Godber's escape led to public outrage surrounding the integrity of the police's self-investigations and calls for reforms in the government's anti- corruption efforts. It also debunked a common conception among the governing elites that European office holders were immune to bribery and corruption. He was arrested on 29 April 1974 in England and extradited to Hong Kong on 7 January 1975. Trial began on 17 February and ended on 25 February, lasting six and a half days. He was convicted of corruption and sentenced to four years in prison plus confiscation of $25,000 HKD. His conviction and other corruption activities in Hong Kong in the 1970s led to the creation of the Independent Commission Against Corruption in 1974. In later years Godber and his family were alleged to have resided in Alicante in Spain. == Notes == ==References== *Hong Kong Independent Commission Against Corruption Case Book * * * Category:1922 births Category:Possibly living people Category:Hong Kong criminals Category:People extradited from the United Kingdom Category:People extradited to Hong Kong Category:Criminals from London Category:Hong Kong police officers ","title":"Peter Godber"},{"id":"2583699","text":"Tomar-Tu is a fictional character, a Green Lantern featured in comic books published by DC Comics. He is a member of an extraterrestrial race called Xudarians. Tomar-Tu is the son and successor of another Green Lantern Corps officer Tomar-Re. He first appeared in Green Lantern (vol. 3) #4 story titled \\"Among My Souvenirs\\". He became a Green Lantern in Green Lantern (vol. 3) #24 (May 1992) in a story titled \\"The Decision\\". He was created by Gerard Jones. ==Fictional character biography== ===Early years=== The story of the Xudarian who would one day become the second Green Lantern of Xudar with the name \\"Tomar\\" began years before his birth when one of the guardians of the universe went mad. This renegade Guardian \\"Appa Ali Apsa\\" had made it his point of duty to capture entire cities from other planets. These captured cities were then incorporated into the planet Oa. The collection of these separate pieces of other worlds flung together became known as the Mosaic world. Tomar Tu originally came from one of the cities from Xudar, which was home world of his hero, the late Green Lantern Tomar-Re from Space Sector 2813. Tomar-Tu later discovered that his idol was also his father.Green Lantern (vol. 3) #4 Despite the strangeness of their new surroundings the Xudarians persevered. Tomar was one of three Xudarians who ventured to a neighboring Earth town to seek out allies on this new world. Earthlings true to form attacked them on sight out of fear. When it seemed that the mob would have killed the three brave souls the mob was dispersed by Hal Jordan who was on his way to confront the mad guardian.Green Lantern (vol. 3) #5 Tomar was instrumental in the fall of the mad guardian as he was contacted by Hal Jordan to monitor for the arrival of Guy Gardner who was to arrive from Earth to help Jordan deal with the mad guardian. When Gardner finally arrived Tomar gave Jordan the signal necessary for him to create a diversion and tap into the central power battery.Green Lantern (vol 3) #6 When Jordan's plan did not end with Appa Ali Apsa's defeat he punished the Xudarian’s for their betrayal. His people suffered many losses and would have been totally eradicated if not for the timely arrival of the Guardians of the universe who had just returned from another dimension. Temporarily safe, the Xudarian's continued to defy their would-be master and mounted a defense for the Green Lanterns. During this climatic battle Hal Jordan was downed and would have been killed if Tomar Tu had not risked life and limb to save him. Hal Jordan, thankful for the assistance went on to defeat the mad guardian with the help of John Stewart, Guy Gardner and the Guardians of the Universe. Green Lantern (vol. 3) #7-#8 Realizing that return to Xudar was not forthcoming, Tomar and fellow Xudarians tried to promote unity between the races of the mosaic world. To this end Tomar lead a group of his kinsmen to the neighboring town from Earth. Once there they put forward the idea of an interspecies union. While there another human settlement was attacked by a neighboring race known as the horde. In their zeal to protect themselves some humans used this as a reason for anti-alien dogma. This led to further separation of the distinct species found on Oa. To prevent further violence John Stewart separated the Horde from the rest of the Mosaic world with stone walls.Green Lantern (vol. 3) #14-#15 Concerned about their neighbors Tomar and fellow Xudarians visited the human settlement only to be attacked by overzealous dogmatic humans. When the Xudarians heard of what had taken place they responded in kind. This led to their city being invaded by humans. Seeing no alternate way to deal with the problem John Stewart erected walls to separate all the settlements on the mosaic world to prevent further violence. This was only temporary however as the walls were soon torn down and the different factions of the mosaic world went to war with each other. Luckily Hal Jordan and some other lanterns arrived in time to help Stewart separate the warring factions. Stewart then imprisoned the leaders and instigators of the war. As an attempt to promote peace again, Tomar Tu and representatives from the other cities were brought together to help build the mosaic world in a way that all could benefit.Green Lantern (vol. 3) #16-17 While the group discussed ways to ensure interdependence between the races their meeting was interrupted when John Stewart was contacted by Hal Jordan. Star Sapphire was again on the loose and an enraged John flew off to confront her despite Tomar’s best efforts to stop him. During the battle Tomar and Kreon proved their worth and impressed Hal Jordan. When the conflict was over and Star Sapphire returned to her Carol Ferris state, Tomar Tu and Kreon where both invited to become Green Lanterns.Green Lantern (vol. 3) #23-24 ===Green Lantern of Sector 2813=== As a rookie Lantern he was trained by the strong but gentle Kilowog, who often regailed them with tales of great Green Lanterns from the past. His first recorded mission was to face the villain Eclipso who had taken control of Hal Jordan.Green Lantern Annual (vol. 3) #1 While he and his fellow Lanterns fought bravely they were not able to free Jordan. They were soon called back to Oa as the planet was under attack from the Qwardians led by Guy Gardner. They were no match for their opponents as Hal Jordan and Kilowog were still on Earth and the unity required for them to hold the line was jeopardized by the bickering of Kreon and Boodikka. Luckily Gardner returned to their side once he had acquired the yellow power ring which once belonged to Sinestro.Green Lantern Corps Quarterly #1-3 His later missions as Green Lantern included a fight against Entropy. Despite the fact that he did not believe in the cause he was fighting for, he still stood by and protected his fellow Green Lanterns.Green Lantern (vol. 3) #34-#35 Yet in another mission, he was called to the planet Maltus to aid Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps against the Triarch.Green Lantern (vol. 3) #45 On the Guardians' homeworld, the Green Lanterns fought alternately against and alongside the L.E.G.I.O.N.,L.E.G.I.O.N. #58 and the Darkstars DC Universe: Trinity #2 ===Emerald Twilight and beyond=== Tomar Tu's finale mission was the interception of Hal Jordan as he made his way to Oa. Tomar received transmissions as Hal Jordan paved a way to Oa by defeating Ke'Haan of Varva, General Kreon, Boodikka, Graf Toren, honor bound Laira and even rebellious Jack T. Chance. With each passing minute Tomar knew that the worst had happened; the greatest Green Lantern had turned renegade and was destroying the very corps he helped create. Tomar was no match for the more skilled Jordan and fell to his rage and might. He was then stripped of his ring and left for dead. As he drifted into what seemed to be oblivion all he could think was \\"kill Hal Jordan\\".Green Lantern (vol. 3) #49 After his apparent death he, along with Tomar-Re and John Stewart, were honored by the remaining inhabitants of the Mosaic world. Statues were erected in their visage Darkstars #36 and the story of the Xudarian seemed to come to an end. After Hal Jordan had been resurrected and relieved from Parallax he returned to duty as Green Lantern of Earth. The corps also began to be rebuilt. Mysteriously he crash-landed in the middle of a ceremony involving Jordan and two other Air force pilots, Colonel Shane Sellers, and Captain Jillian Peralman. Jordan was visibly shaken when he realized that their unwelcome guest was Tomar Tu who he had \\"killed\\" years before.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #3 (August 2005)Green Lantern (vol. 4) #10 (March 2006) Jordan returned the injured Lantern to Oa where he was checked on by the Green Lantern medical specialist, Soranik Natu. He remained in critical condition, all the while uttering \\"Kill. I will kill Hal Jordan\\". His return prompted Jordan and Gardner to check the Manhunter planet Biot for other missing lanterns. When the other Lost Lanterns were freed they revealed to Jordan and Gardner that Tomar had been held captive by the Manhunters, but had escaped to kill Jordan in revenge.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #11 (May 2006) He was returned to active duty soon however and was seen with the other Lost Lanterns as they dined in the mess hall right before the Sinestro Corps attacked. Apparently he had not recovered fully from his injuries as he was the only Lost Lantern member to be seriously injured in the ensuing battle.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #21 (July 2007)Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special #1 He is then seen again aiding the Lost Lanterns sent to Qward to rescue Ion.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #22 (August 2007) He then joins Hal Jordan and Graf to rescue John Stewart and Guy Gardner.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #23 (September 2007) When the Lanterns of Sector 2814 are shown the \\"Blackest Night\\", a Xudarian can be seen as part of the Sinestro Corps.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #25 (December 2007) This is not Tomar Tu but Romat-Ru who is considered one of the vilest creatures in the galaxy. Following the war, Tomar-Tu was forced to testify against Laira, who had killed the Sinestro Corpsman Amon Sur in cold bloodGreen Lantern (Vol. 4) #27 ===Blackest Night=== During the Blackest Night event, Tomar and the rest of the \\"Lost Lanterns\\" journeyed to Ysmault to recover the body of Laira, who had been inducted into the Red Lantern Corps and killed shortly after. While the group fended off the Red Lanterns' attack, black power rings descend on Ryut, reviving Laira as a Black Lantern. Laira then attacks her former friends, slashing Tomar across the chest.Green Lantern (Vol. 4) #47 ===DC Rebirth=== Tomar-Tu is later imprisoned for intentionally and purposefully killing the Xudarian child murderer Romat-Ru. Tomar-Tu explains he felt he could not risk the murderer escaping to kill again. Tomar-Tu expresses regret for his actions but wonders why the Lanterns let any of their prisoners live. Despite his feelings, Tomar- Tu willing converses with yet another young Xudarian Green Lantern, Somar-Le. This Xudarian wonders why Tomar-Tu did what he did, as it conflicts with the heroic reputation the older Lantern has at home.Tomar-Tu's attitude gains the attention of the Controllers and the Darkstars. Tomar-Tu willingly accepts the mantle of the Darkstars and escapes, desiring to murder more killers like Romat-Ru.

Its name is derived from Lusitania, which was the Roman name for the Iberian region that covers present day central and southern Portugal and part of Spain. Although it was originally intended for military use, it was well-suited for law enforcement and ended up being marketed to bodyguards, VIP protection and special operations units. ==Development== INDEP was a defense industry company owned by the Portuguese Government. In the early 1980s, INDEP manufactured the HK G3 and HK 21 in Portugal under license from Heckler & Koch. This allowed for the importation of German weapons manufacturing machinery and technical know-how, which stimulated development of new firearms designs in Portugal. The Lusa marries some concepts from the HK MP5 and Uzi submachine gun without being too similar to either. The complete trigger housing is nearly identical to that of the MP5, however the other internals are greatly simplified. The bolt and carrier are one welded unit, and the action is a simple blowback, unlike the roller-delay system of the MP5. The Lusa fires from the closed bolt position in both semi- and fully automatic modes. However, the Lusa's barrel can be quickly changed without tools, like the Uzi. The Lusa uses a non reciprocating ambidextrous charging handle with no provision to lock the bolt to the rear, nor does the bolt lock to the rear upon an empty magazine. The rear sight is a simple diopter with screw adjustment. The body is formed from a sheet of stamped and welded steel. The weapon never enjoyed widespread production, and the project was halted in 1992, at a cost of 2.5 million dollars. The MP5 soon replaced this weapon's intended usage in the Portuguese police forces. In 2004, INDEP sold all the dies, tooling, fixtures and manufacturing rights to Stan Andrewski, owner of Stan's Gunsmithing in New Hampshire, Jerry Prasser, owner of Recon Ordnance in Wisconsin, and Ralph Dimicco, co-owner of Riley's Gun Shop. The company was named LUSA USA. The LUSA was approved for sale as a semi-automatic by the BATFE (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives) for the US civilian market. A select-fire model was available to law enforcement and government agencies, both foreign and domestic. Class III dealers could obtain one with the required LE demonstration letter. As of 2006, LUSA USA planned to offer conversion kits in .22 Long Rifle, .40 S&W; and .45 GAP but distribution of these never materialized. Choate side-folding stocks, sight rails and suppressors were available on a limited basis. Most models shipped with either a fixed stock or a collapsible stock. ==Models== There were several available configurations for the semi-auto (SA) civilian version. * Lusa 94 - carbine, 16\\" barrel with faux suppressor (barrel shroud), collapsible stock. 30-round magazine. * Lusa 94 AWM - carbine, 16\\" barrel with faux suppressor (barrel shroud), fixed stock. Available with 30- or 10-round magazine. * Lusa SP89 - pistol, 6\\" unshrouded barrel, no stock. 30-round magazine. * Lusa A3 SBR - short barreled rifle, 6\\" unshrouded barrel, collapsible stock. 30-round magazine. ==Magazines== A drawback of the Lusa is that it uses a proprietary magazine that is not widely available and is somewhat expensive. The magazines are all marked 30 rounds, but much of the company literature refers to them as having a 28-round capacity. This is probably because it is difficult to load a full 30 rounds and still insert the magazine against the closed bolt, since the Lusa has no provision to lock the bolt to the rear. The additional spring pressure makes it more difficult to fully seat the magazine. The 28-round recommendation is to ensure reliable magazine insertion. The magazines are of a double-stack double-feed type, feeding alternately from each side of the magazine. ==End of Production== In 2011, LUSA USA ceased production of Lusa pistols and carbines citing production costs. Recon Ordnance is currently producing parts for the NiteScout 9mm pistol and carbine, a design which is produced in Waterbury, CT by NiteScout LLC. The NiteScout bears a significant resemblance to the Lusa with some changes. Chiefly, it uses common 32-round Uzi magazines, an HK Navy style composite trigger group, an AR-style front sight and an HK-style rear drum sight. Further it eschews the early Lusa symmetrical charging handle for a left side cocking handle which can lock the bolt to the rear and be \\"slapped\\" forward to release, similar to the MP5 and HK91. ==External links== * Manufacturer: Lusa USA.

She was built by Aaron Manby (1776–1850) at the Horseley Ironworks. She made the voyage to Paris in June 1822 under Captain (later Admiral) Charles Napier, with Aaron's son Charles on board as engineer. Aaron Manby was then used by the Compagnie des bateaux a vapeur en fer to operate its service between Paris and Le Havre. == Vessel history == Launched in 1821, Aaron Manby was the first steamship to be built of iron. She was the brainchild of the eccentric but far-seeing naval officer Captain (later Admiral) Charles Napier, who had conceived the idea of a fleet of steamships for service on the River Seine. The ship was named after the master of the Horseley Ironworks, Tipton, Staffordshire, where she was pre-fabricated to a design jointly formulated by Captain Napier, Aaron Manby and his son Charles. She was then shipped in pieces to Rotherhithe on the Thames and assembled there. Of 116 tons burthen, the ship was 120 feet (36.6 m) long. Her flat-bottomed hull was made of iron plate fastened to angle-iron ribs. There was one deck, of wood, and a bowsprit. The ship's distinctive profile boasted a single funnel. The engine was of the oscillating type, designed and patented (British Patent No 4558 of 1821) by Aaron Manby. The paddlewheels: were 12 feet (3.7 m) in diameter but only 2.5 feet (76 cm) wide, because the vessel's maximum beam was limited to 23 feet (7.0 m) for service on the Seine. Defying the prevailing wisdom of the day, the iron-hulled vessel not only floated but made 9 knots (10 mph, 17 km/h) and drew one foot (30 cm) less water than any other steamboat then operating.Dumpleton 2002:18fKemp 1979:1 After trials in May 1822, Aaron Manby crossed the English Channel to Le Havre under Napier’s command on 10 June, at an average speed of 8 knots (9 mph, 14 km/h), carrying passengers and freighted with a cargo of linseed and iron castings. The ship proceeded up the Seine to Paris, where she caused a great stir and where she was based for the next decade. This has been claimed (incorrectly) as the first passage from Britain to France by steam ship. There had been shorter crossings by wooden steamers, but Napier's was the first direct steam crossing from London to Paris and the first seagoing voyage by an iron ship anywhere. After some further channel voyages the ship was used for pleasure trips up and down the Seine. On the failure of Napier’s enterprise through bankruptcy in 1827 (after he had financed the building of five similar iron steamships) she was sold to a French consortium (\\"Compagnie des bateaux a vapeur en fer\\") who operated her on the River Loire until she was broken up in 1855. The use of iron plates for the hull, in place of wood, was widely copied in shipbuilding during the following decades. Napier had conceived the ship as a first step towards an iron warship, and in this sense Aaron Manby could be considered a direct ancestor of the Royal Navy's first iron frigate, , built the year of Napier's death. ==See also== * Vulcan, first iron vessel, a horse-drawn barge, maiden voyage May 1819. * Charlotte Dundas, first commercial steam propelled vessel, maiden voyage 1802. ==Notes== ==References== * Peter Kemp (ed), The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea (Oxford University Press, 1976, corr. edition 1979) * Bernard Dumpleton, The Story of the Paddle Steamer (Antony Rowe Ltd, Eastbourne, 1973, 2002) * Aaron Manby, Builder of the First Iron Steamship, Newcomen Transactions, Vol.29, 1953-5, page 77.

Rather than counting the total number of strokes taken, as in stroke play, it involves scoring points based on the number of strokes taken at each hole. Unlike traditional scoring methods, where the aim is to have the lowest score, under Stableford rules, the objective is to have the highest score. The Stableford system was developed by Dr. Frank Barney Gorton Stableford (1870–1959), to deter golfers from giving up on their round after just one or two bad holes. It was first used informally at the Glamorganshire Golf Club, Penarth, Wales, in 1898, and first used in competition at Wallasey Golf Club in Wallasey, England, in 1932. Between his membership of the Glamorganshire and Wallasey Golf Clubs, Stableford was a member at Anglesey Golf Club North Wales, for most of the 1920s. Stableford can have the added benefit of speeding up the pace of play, as once it is no longer possible to score a point, players do not have to complete the hole but can simply pick up their ball and proceed to the next hole. It is a popular form of the game, especially at club level and particularly in the United Kingdom, as it is still possible to record a competitive score despite having the occasional bad hole. == Scoring == The number of points awarded on each hole is determined based on comparison of the number of strokes taken to a fixed score, usually par. This fixed score is then adjusted in relation to the player's handicap. Once players have taken two strokes more than the adjusted fixed score, they may abandon the hole and move on to the next, as it is then not possible to score any points on that hole. Because of this, it is still possible to be competitive even allowing for a few bad holes. At the end of the round, the number of points scored on each hole is totaled to give a final score. The winner of a Stableford competition is the player with the highest point total. Final scores may be modified for all players using the Competition Stableford Adjustment system. In the United Kingdom, the fixed score would be adjusted as per the stroke indexes (SI) of the holes, starting at the lowest stroke index 1 hole, through to the highest, stroke index 18. For example, a 12 handicap golfer would increase the fixed score on holes indexed 1 through 12, a 24 handicap player would increase the score by two on holes indexed 1 through 6 and by one for the rest, and a plus handicap player would reduce the fixed scores starting at the stroke index 18 hole. The number of points awarded per hole as specified by the R&A; and the United States Golf Association are as follows: {class= - !Points!!Strokes taken in relation to adjusted fixed score -  align=center0  2 strokes or more over, or no score recorded -  align=center1  1 stroke over -  align=center2  Same number of strokes -  align=center3  1 stroke under -  align=center4  2 strokes under -  align=center5  3 strokes under -  align=center6  4 strokes under } This linear scoring version of Stableford is essentially the same as traditional stroke play where the maximum score for each hole is limited to a double bogey. ===Modified Stableford=== The standard Stableford system can be altered to use different point levels, commonly referred to as a Modified Stableford system. It is a Maximum Score system. For example, in professional golf, the following scoring table has been used, and was used at the Barracuda Championship on the PGA Tour in July 2019. {class= !Points!!Strokes taken in relation to par -  align=center+8  Albatross (3 strokes under par) -  align=center+5  Eagle (2 strokes under par) -  align=center+2  Birdie (1 stroke under par) -  align=center0  Par -  align=center−1  Bogey (1 stroke over par) -  align=center−3  Double bogey or worse (2 strokes or more over par) } This points scale encourages aggressive play, since the reward for scoring under par is higher than the penalty for scoring over par. The Maximum Score is two strokes over par; once a player has made his shot and is one stroke over par, he may concede, pick up the ball, take a double bogey, and proceed to the next hole without penalty. ==Professional tournaments== Very few professional tournaments have used a Stableford scoring system. The first PGA Tour event that used a Stableford system of scoring was The International in Colorado, although it used a modified version of the scoring system adapted for the skill levels of the professionals and to encourage attacking play. The event was cancelled in February 2007, after 21 years as part of the tour. The modified Stableford system returned to the PGA Tour at the Reno-Tahoe Open in 2012. Both events were held at high elevation. On the European Tour, the ANZ Championship, which ran for three years from 2002, used the same modified Stableford scoring system as The International. The Investec Royal Swazi Open on the Sunshine Tour has used the same system since 2003. Two Champions Tour events also used the modified Stableford system briefly. They were the Royal Caribbean Classic in 2000 and 2001, and the Uniting Fore Care Classic in 2002. In the latter case, it was seen as a final attempt to save the failing tournament. The American Century Championship, a celebrity tournament played at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course in Stateline, Nevada, has used a modified Stableford scoring format since 2004. It is also at high elevation. The Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions Celebrity Division, part of the LPGA season opening event, has its celebrities participating in a modified Stableford system. The maximum score is double bogey. {class= !Points!!Strokes taken in relation to fixed score -  align=center0  Fixed score (double bogey) -  align=center1  One stroke under (bogey) -  align=center2  Two strokes under (par) -  align=center3  Three strokes under (birdie) -  align=center5  Four strokes under, Par 4 or 5 (eagle) -  align=center8  Hole in one on Par 3 -  align=center10  Five strokes under fixed score (albatross) } ==See also== *Competition Stableford Adjustment *Variations of golf ==References== ==External links== *Origins of Stableford scoring ByDandD, February 21, 2006 (Archived) *Guide to Scoring Stableford Golf Sandwedged Category:Golf terminology ","title":"Stableford"},{"id":"2583709","text":"The Ascian Language is a fictional language invented by Gene Wolfe for his science fiction series The Book of the New Sun.Gene Wolfe: The Book of the New Sun, Volume 4 (The Citadel of the Autarch), The language is spoken by the inhabitants of the “northern continents” of the future earth, the Ascians, who are enslaved by their masters (the Group of Seventeen) in a way much like the people of Oceania in George Orwell's book 1984. ==The language== The Ascian language consists of two levels: On the low level it is just an ordinary language, of whose syntax, grammar and vocabulary virtually nothing is known. What makes the language unique is the second level. Although Ascian is their mother tongue, adult Ascians don't understand plain Ascian sentences, unless they are direct quotations from governmental propaganda materials (called Correct Thought). So, in order to communicate, an Ascian has to know by heart thousands of these quotations (sentences) on many different topics. As the northern continents are at war with the southern Commonwealth (where most protagonists of the books live), there are interpreters in the Ascian army to interrogate prisoners. These speak the language of the Commonwealth, but as they are unable to think outside the approved texts, what they say is just literal translations of the Ascian approved sentences. A very similar concept of a language is presented in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Darmok\\" from 1991. ===Psychology=== The reason for the Group of Seventeen to impose on their people this complicated concept of a language is much like Orwell’s concept of Newspeak. In order to prevent the Ascians from ever developing critical thought (and subsequently inciting revolts), the language is limited as to make it impossible to express it. This corresponds to the Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis. Nevertheless, Gene Wolfe suggests that this concept doesn't work out like that. It is shown that intelligent Ascians are very well able to express, by means of approved sentences only, meanings that exceed those of the quoted sources. They simply quote sentences which have certain connotations, regardless of the actual meaning of the approved text. ===Examples=== In \\"The Citadel of the Autarch\\", the fourth volume of The Book of the New Sun series, there is a story told by an Ascian prisoner (who identifies himself only as \\"Loyal to the Group of Seventeen\\"), which is translated by people of the Commonwealth into our way of speaking. Some examples from this story: * “In times past, loyalty to the cause of the populace was to be found everywhere. The will of the Group of Seventeen was the will of everyone.” “Once upon a time…” * “The people meeting in counsel may judge, but no one is to receive more than a hundred blows.” “He complained, and they beat him.” * “How are the hands nourished? By the blood. How does the blood reach the hands? By the veins. If the veins are closed, the hands will rot away.” “He left that farm and took to the roads.” * “Where the Group of Seventeen sit, there final justice is done.” “He went to the capital and complained of the way he had been treated.” ===The word \\"Ascian\\"=== Although unfamiliar to most readers, this is not a word invented by Wolfe, nor is it a form of \\"Asians\\". It means 'Tropic-dweller', and it came into English by way of medieval Latin as an adaptation of ancient Greek ἄσκιος, literally 'without a shadow'. In the Tropics, the sun is exactly overhead at noon twice a year, and at that time a person standing straight up will cast no shadow. ==References== Category:Fictional languages Category:Constructed languages introduced in the 1980s Category:Solar Cycle ","title":"Ascian language"},{"id":"2583714","text":"\\"Belonging to Someone\\" is a popular song, written by Al Hoffman and Dick Manning and published in 1958.

Though never holding any elected office, Alterman was highly influential in Socialist Zionist politics, both before and after the establishment of the State of Israel. ==Biography== Nathan Alterman was born in Warsaw, Poland (then part of the Russian Empire). He moved to Tel Aviv with his family in 1925, when he was 15 years old, and continued his studies at the Herzliya Hebrew High School. When he was 19 years old, he travelled to Paris to study at the University of Paris (a.k.a. La Sorbonne), but a year later he decided to go to Nancy to study agronomy. Though maintaining close contacts with his family and friends in Tel Aviv and visiting them on vacations, Alterman spent three years in France and was highly influenced by his occasional meetings with French artists and writers. When he returned to Tel Aviv in 1932, he started working at the Mikveh Yisrael agricultural school, but soon left it in favour of working as a journalist and poet. Alterman is credited with bringing the seeds of the marmande tomato to Israel, where it was the main species cultivated in the country until the 1960s.Salad Days, Haaretz ==Literary and political career== Alterman's first published book of poetry was Kokhavim Bakhuts (\\"Stars Outside\\"), published in 1938. This volume, with its \\"neo-romantic themes, highly charged texture, and metrical virtuosity,\\" as Israeli critic Benjamin Harshav puts it, established him as a major force in modern Hebrew literature. His next major book was \\"The Joy of the Poor\\" ( ṡimḥàt aniyím, 1941), which many regard as his magnum opus. This is a kaleidoscopic phantasmagoria consisting of 31 interconnected poems, all from the viewpoint of the ghost of a dead man obsessed with the living woman he loves – a reversal of the Orpheus and Eurydice story. The dead man wants to protect his living love from war and poverty, but more than anything he wants to drag her into his world. His plans are continually frustrated. The light from a humble candle is enough to drive him back. The story reads like a supernatural thriller, but the rhyme and the meters are regular and elegant. In 1942, when the first news about the Holocaust reached the Zionist Jewish community in British Mandate Palestine, Alterman wrote a poem, which can be described as a sarcastic paraphrase on the Jewish prayer, \\"Praised are You ... who has chosen us out of all the nations\\". In this poem Alterman says, \\"At our children's cry, shadowed by scaffolds, we heard not the world's furor. For you have chosen us out of all nations, you loved and favoured us. For you have chosen us of all nations, of Norwegians, Czechs and Britons. As they march toward scaffolds, Jewish children of reason, they know their blood shan't be reckoned among the rest, they just call to the mother 'turn away your face'.\\" In 1943, Alterman wrote the maqama \\"The Swedish Tongue\\", in which he praised Sweden's willingness to welcome Jewish refugees from Denmark.Nathan Alterman's 1943 maqama \\"The Swedish Tongue\\", translated by Ghil'ad Zuckermann. In 1943, he also wrote a poem that was critical of Pope Pius XII, a poem that is featured at the Yad Vashem museum.Yad Vashem: Our Info on Pius XII Based on 'Best Research' During the 1945–1947 years of the Zionist movement's struggle against British rule, Alterman's weekly column in the Labour Movement \\"Davar\\" newspaper was highly influential, strongly denouncing the British army's oppressive measures and praising the illegal immigrant boats landing Jewish holocaust survivors on the country's shores, in defiance of British policy. The most well-known of these is the 1945 \\"In Praise of an Italian Captain\\" ().Song of the \\"Illegals\\". The Canadian Jewish Chronicle, August 23, 1946, page 12. Includes an English translation. In the early stages of the Israeli War of Independence he wrote numerous patriotic poems, the most well-known of which is \\"The Silver Platter\\" ( magásh ha-késef). Having become a canonical text read on Israel's Remembrance Day, this poem was written in response to Chaim Weizmann's words in December 1947, after the adoption of the UN Partition Plan for Palestine, \\"No state is ever handed on a silver platter... The partition plan does not give the Jews but an opportunity\\". In his poem, Alterman describes a scene similar to the Biblical Revelation on Mount Sinai, where the Jewish People are waiting to receive the Jewish state, as the Israelite were waiting to receive the Torah. And yet, instead of Moses descending with the Tablets of Stone, the people see two unfamiliar youths, a boy and a girl, wounded and near dead with exhaustion. When asked, \\"Who are you?\\" they reply, \\"We are the silver platter on which the state of the Jews was handed to you\\". During the 1950s, Alterman was opposed to the martial law imposed at the time on Israel's Arab citizens (until 1966), and was also strongly supportive of workers' struggle such as the 1952 sailors' strike which was suppressed by the Ben Gurion Government. After the Six-Day War, Alterman was one of the founders of the Movement for Greater Israel finding himself in alliance with right-wing activists whom he greatly opposed in earlier times of his career. He criticized David Ben-Gurion (who only held at the time the position of a Knesset member, but was still influential) for being too willing to give up the territories captured during the war in return for a peace agreement. Alterman translated Shakespeare, Molière, Racine and Russian classics into Hebrew and Yiddish. He wrote the lyrics of the famous Moshe Vilenski song Kalaniyot, sung by Shoshana Damari. Some of Alterman's poems have been turned into popular songs, e.g., \\"A meeting with no end\\" (פגישה לאין קץ). == Awards == * In 1946, Alterman received the Tchernichovsky Prize for exemplary translation, for his translations of plays Phèdre by Jean Racine and Merry Wives of Windsor by Shakespeare. * In 1947, he received the Ruppin Prize for his book \\"Joy of the Poor\\". * In 1957, Alterman was awarded the Bialik Prize for literature. * In 1967, he again received the Tchernichovsky Prize, for translations of the plays of Moliere. * In 1968, he was awarded the Israel Prize, for literature. * In 2011, his portrait was chosen to be on Israel's currency.Nadav Shemer, Jerusalem Post, 3/10/2011 ==Honors== NIS 200 banknote, showing Alterman.

It is situated between the districts of Indre By and Vesterbro with entrances from Bernstorffsgade (at Tivoli Gardens), Banegårdspladsen, Reventlowsgade and access to platforms from Tietgensgade. Copenhagen Central Station is the hub of the DSB railway network serving Denmark and international destinations. It offers InterCity and Express trains services across Denmark, as well as services to several international destinations, regular and frequent regional train services to and from Zealand and southern Sweden (also referred to as Øresund trains). The station also services the Copenhagen S-train network, but the S-train system in Copenhagen doesn't use any kind of hub at all. It is an urban transit which differs from most Metro systems mainly by being a type of railway. At the station are two platforms with four tracks that are used by the S-trains only. All other trains usually use the other four platforms and eight tracks. In addition to the original 6 island-platforms and their 12 tracks, has one additional track constructed much later. The single spare track, called track 26, was initially built for trains to southern Sweden, while Malmö C still was a terminus. It has later occasionally been used for express trains to or from Sweden or to or from Norway. After the introduction of border controls and mandatory identity checks for travel to Sweden this track was fenced and used for X2000 and intercity trains to Sweden. The extra track 26 is located south of the main building and is reachable only by walking along the platform for track 4 and 5 or from a staircase from the Tietgensgade street. The platforms begin under the main passenger hall (and at least the S-train section, two platforms with a total of four S-train tracks, of the station can be said to begin as an underground station). A hotel (Astoria) is built above the S-train tracks in the Northern end, but the remaining tracks are uncovered below street level. (Open areas between tunnel sections were necessary to have during the era of steam trains, while the S-trains always have been electrical). In the opposite (platform) end, all platforms are covered with the typical railway arched roof. This roof is shorter than the platforms, but all tracks remain below street level and can also be accessed from the street Tietgensgade. The main hall isn't just a waiting hall, but also a market place where most things can be bought. From fresh fruit sellers to super market, postal office, banks, currency exchanges, hamburgers, coffee shops, restaurants and pubs etc. There are also travel center for information and manual sale of tickets and two large toilet sections which are under manual supervision and clean. Shower rooms are also available for a smaller fee. The current station building opened in 1911 and is the work of architect Heinrich Wenck. The station has 7 platforms and 13 tracks. On the station concourse there are many small shops, cafeterias, and fast food outlets. All public transport within Greater Copenhagen are divided into close to 100 ticket fare zones. The Central station is located in fare zone 1, which together with zones 2 and 3 constitute Copenhagen municipality and the \\"enclave\\" of Frederiksberg municipality. As the cheapest single ticket always is valid in two zones, a single ticket bought at the station is valid within the entire city centre and its inner boroughs. A ticket to Copenhagen Airport Kastrup, however, demands the payment for three zones since it is located in zone 4. From 29 September 2019 the Central station is also served by the Copenhagen Metro line M3 (in service 24/7), which is a circular line with 17 stations. The station is also served by the M4 line, linking the Nordhavn and Sydhavn districts and serve as an interchange between the Sydhavn extension and the M3. ==History== Copenhagen's first railway station, photographed in 1864 The first railway station in Copenhagen was built in 1847, approximately at the present station location. It served Roskildebanen, and it was made of wood because it was built outside the fortifications where buildings with foundations were not allowed. An expansion was soon necessary due to plans to extend the railway network in Denmark. A new larger station, designed by H. J. Herholdt, opened in 1864. Aerial view At night The second station also proved too small, especially because there was only one track leading out of the city. It was decided to build a new station, including a tunnel to Østerport station, and with tracks out of the city to the south. Designed by Heinrich Wenck, the present station was finished on 1 December 1911. The tunnel (the Boulevard Line) was opened in 1917. The station was overhauled in 1980. Escalators and lifts were established to the platforms, and the station concourse, which was originally split into arrival, departure, and freight sections, was redone completely. The station was overhauled again from 2004 to 2008. This overhaul replaced the roof, lowered platforms 3 to 6 to international standards and lengthened them. The towers and the bridge over the platforms, upon which the main station building is placed, were reconditioned. ==Services== Platforms Copenhagen Central Station provides Copenhagen with Intercity and Express trains across Denmark, as well as services to several international destinations. Direct international trains connect to Stockholm and Hamburg several times a day. Intercity trains run half-hourly from Copenhagen during daytime and serve as a link between the major cities and towns in Denmark, including Odense, Aarhus, Aalborg, Esbjerg, Thisted and Sønderborg. Regional trains (stops at major stations within the Greater Copenhagen area) connect the main parts of Zealand to the capital. Veolia Transport trains on the Øresundståg regional rail network depart to southern and western Sweden every 20 minutes. A special ticket fare system exists between the Copenhagen local traffic area and the most southern part of Sweden, Skåne county. All S-train services except the F-line stop at the station. København H is served by the Copenhagen Metro network by the City Circle Line which opened on 29 September 2019, servicing lines M3 and M4. ==Future== The station needs more capacity followed the opened of the Copenhagen–Ringsted Line on 31 May 2019. The Danish Ministry of Transport has started planning of an extension: proposals include a four-track terminal station on a bridge over the present tracks, or in a tunnel under them. ==Cultural references== Copenhagen Central Station is used as a location at 1:12:36 in the 1975 Olsen-banden film The Olsen Gang on the Track. Egon (Ove Sprogøe) hides a suitcase in the luggage storage at Copenhagen Central Station in The Olsen Gang Outta Sight (1977) and the lost luggage department is also used as a location later in the same film. ==See also== * Danish State Railways * Transportation in Denmark * Rail transport in Denmark * Øresund Railway ==References== ==External links== * Official Site: Information and tickets (EN) Category:Railway stations in Copenhagen Category:Listed railway stations in Copenhagen Category:Copenhagen S-train stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1847 Category:Railway stations opened in 1864 Category:Railway stations opened in 1911 Category:Tourist attractions in Copenhagen Category:Heinrich Wenck buildings Category:Vesterbro, Copenhagen Category:Art Nouveau architecture in Copenhagen Category:National Romantic architecture in Copenhagen Category:Art Nouveau railway stations ","title":"Copenhagen Central Station"},{"id":"2583733","text":"The Bridgman effect (named after P.

Its inner core is roughly delineated by the A594, Leicester's inner ring road, although the various central campuses of the University of Leicester, De Monfort University and Leicester College are adjacent to the inner ring road and could be considered to be a continuation of the City centre. In a similar way, the Leicester Royal Infirmary precinct, the New Walk business district (Southfields), the Welford Road Stadium of Leicester Tigers' RUFC and the King Power Stadium of Premier League Leicester City to the south, and the Golden Mile to the north could also be deemed to be extensions to the central core. The city centre incorporates most of Leicester's shopping, with the Highcross and the Haymarket Shopping Centre as well as the 'Old Town' around Leicester Cathedral, Leicester Market and the Magazine Gateway. Politically, the city centre is split between the Leicester City Council wards of Abbey and Castle. A£19 million regeneration project transformed Leicester's city centre. The work won three awards: The Urbis Urban Regeneration Award in 2007 for Gallowtree Gate, The BCSC Town Centre \\"Gold\\" Best in Britain award in June 2009 and the Transport Times Walking & Public Realm award in July 2009. ==History== ===The old city=== Map of Leicester in 1722 The historic city of Leicester was founded by the Romans as Ratae Corieltauvorum - after the Corieltauvi, the local tribe of Britons whose tribal lands these were - at the crossing of the River Soar by the Fosse Way, between the current path of the river and the modern Gallowtree Gate. It is thought that the later medieval walls and gates were in approximately the same positions as the Roman ones, with the forum being where the modern inner ring road meets St Nicholas Circle. The Roman baths are nearby and are preserved at Jewry Wall. The east gate was at the eastern end of High Street (preserved in the street name Eastgates), the north gate was at the northern end of Highcross Street, the west gate was on the town side of West Bridge, and the south gate was in the modern Friar Lane area – the city walls ran along the current Millstone Lane, Horsefair Street, Gallowtree Gate, Church Gate, Sanvey Gate and Soar Lane, with the western wall possibly running along the river Soar (there is some doubt as to whether the western wall existed). The city centre was the High Cross, at the junction of the current High Street and Highcross Street (in mediaeval times, High Street ran between the north and south gates along the line of the current Highcross Street, while the current High Street was called Swinesmarket). Leicester Cathedral and the Guildhall occupy this old area of town. Leicester Castle lay on the south-western corner of the walls, and the Newarke was a separate walled area nearby. The Newarke Gateway (now known as the Magazine) is the only medieval gateway remaining. A small section of the town wall can be seen in the churchyard of St Mary de Castro. The town's main gates were sold and demolished in the late 18th century, being an impediment to the flow of traffic (the city's hay market was outside the walls for this reason, the main market being situated within the south-east corner of the walls). ===Modern developments=== The pedestrianised section of Humberstone Gate. The Haymarket Shopping Centre is to the left. With increasing development, particularly in the 19th century, the focal point moved eastwards, with the Haymarket Memorial Clock Tower roundabout seeing the five- way junction of the London to Manchester, Birmingham to Yarmouth and Fosse Way roads. This was influenced by the replacement of the Welford Road (now the A5199) by the Market Harborough road (the Harborough Turnpike, now the A6), as the main route to London, because the Welford Road terminated in the tiny streets of the old town, and was therefore a hindrance for vehicles, while the London Road went past the East Gates of the city. Meanwhile, the civic centre moved southwards, with the Corporation of Leicester moving to a new town hall building in 1876 in the Market Street area, facing onto a new Town Hall Square, and just outside the walled town. Between these areas is the modern market, based to the south-west of the Haymarket Memorial Clock Tower area, which features the permanent outdoor covered Leicester Market (the largest in Europe), alongside an indoor market building selling fish, dairy produce, meat, etc., and the old Cornmarket building. Much of this old area of town is now in various conservation areas. Outside of the ringroad, but close by, are the main campus of De Montfort University, Leicester Royal Infirmary, the Leicester City Football Club's King Power Stadium, the Leicester Tigers' Welford Road stadium and the prison. Leicester railway station is just on the outer side of the ringroad, on the A6. The University of Leicester is further away to the south-east, linked by the pedestrian-only path New Walk. When this was laid out in 1785, on the route of an ancient footpath, it passed through open land, becoming the route to the then Leicester Racecourse which later became Victoria Park but it soon saw development of large private houses on both sides of it. It is now largely offices, although the Leicester Museum & Art Gallery makes a strong impact. The area inside the ringroad has two large shopping malls – Highcross Leicester (first opened as The Shires on the northern side of High Street and opening in 1991 with a large extension opened on 4 September 2008), and the Haymarket Shopping Centre (opened in 1974, on the site of the old hay market), both facing onto the Haymarket Memorial Clock Tower area. On the opposite side of Humberstone Gate to the Haymarket is a new building, with no communal space, occupied by a variety of retailers, that incorporates the famous Lewis's tower from the previous department store on the site. Granby Street. Major chain stores can also be found on the pedestrianised Gallowtree Gate, running south-east from the clock tower, and which continues to the railway station as Granby Street. To the south of the Shires and west of Gallowtree Gate is an area known as The Lanes consisting mostly of small independent shops. This area's centrepiece is the St Martin's Square development (dating from the 1980s), and also features various smaller arcades, the Odeon Arcade, the Royal Arcade and the Malcolm Arcade. Of particular interest is the recently renovated Silver Arcade, dating from 1899. Further south than this is the market, and then the civic centre (as mentioned above), which also features the main lending and reference libraries, and a number of shops, both chain and independent. High Street, Eastgates, Cheapside, Gallowtree Gate and Humberstone Gate west of Charles Street are fully pedestrianised but bicycling is permitted. Private cars (but not buses and taxis) are forbidden at certain times from a larger area. Plans exist to fully pedestrianise the Haymarket and Churchgate also which will involve routing buses via Mansfield Street. The area around the junction of Humberstone Gate and the ring-road is the site of two strip malls – the larger of which is on the south-east side of the roundabout and called 'St George's Retail Park', the smaller being on the south-west side. ==Transport== The main bus companies serving the city centre are Arriva Midlands, Centrebus, First Leicester, Stagecoach Midlands and Roberts Coaches. There are two main bus stations; St Margaret's Bus Station, is on Gravel Street to the north of the centre and the Haymarket Bus Station is on Charles Street. A number of bus services terminate at on-street stops within the city. Regional and national coaches depart from St Margaret's Bus Station which was opened on 3 May 1985 and had a major refurbishment completed in March 2007.. Haymarket bus station which lies next to and serves as a transport hub for Haymarket Shopping Centre was developed at a proposed cost of £2m in mid-1994, coinciding with a major refurbishment of the adjacent Haymarket Shopping Centre complex. It underwent a major upgrade and expansion starting September 2014. The upgraded station openend in May 2016 In late 2019, work started on a link road that would improve access between the two bus stations and allow for more pedestrianisation around the clock tower area. Leicester London Road is now the only railway station in the city centre, after the closure of Leicester Belgrave Road and Leicester Central in the 1960s. There are more than 8,500 off-street car parking spaces available in four distinct parking zones around the city centre. These are complemented by some 1,500 park and ride spaces at hubs around the city. Leicester City used to have a tram network: firstly horse-drawn under Leicester Tramways Company from 1874 then it was taken over by Leicester Corporation Tramways in 1901 who ran electric trams from 1904 until they ceased operation on 9 November 1949 to be replaced with bus services; a modern light rail network or tram system still a reserved option for the council's planning team. ==Modern Day== ===Facilities=== Leicester is home to a variety of theatres, such as the Curve, the (currently mothballed) Haymarket Theatre, Little Theatre and Sue Townsend Theatre (formerly Phoenix Arts) and there is a small pub theatre called \\"The Theatre Upstairs\\" at The Western pub, 70 Western Road, Leicester. In the City centre there is the Phoenix Square Digital Arts Centre, Midland Street, Leicester (which has a regular programme of art-house and world cinema), a Cinema De Lux, part of Highcross Leicester, and an Odeon at Freemen's Common, some way to the south. The old Odeon building in Rutland Street was refurbished and opened in 2005 as the Leicester Athena, a conferencing and banqueting venue. The former ABC Cinema on Belgrave Gate has now been demolished and is currently being used as a car park, the site will be turned into a new shopping area with shops, casino, theatre and a new link road which will provide access to the new Highcross Leicester and St. Margaret's bus station. Since the closure of St Margaret's baths, there is no municipal swimming pool in the city centre. Its replacement, the Braunstone Leisure Centre, is some miles away in Braunstone. The area in the inside of the ring-road is nearly entirely built up, with only Nelson Mandela Park (at the extreme south, in Southfields), Museum Square (off New Walk) and Town Hall Square being considerable open spaces. Outside the ring road are Castle Gardens (by Leicester Castle), De Montfort Square (off New Walk), Victoria Park, Aylestone Meadows, Western Park and Abbey Park. Musical venues in the city are somewhat limited since the closure in 1998 then the demolition of the Granby Halls in 2001– the largest two venues, De Montfort Hall (mentioned above) and University of Leicester's students union (now an O2 academy), are both in Southfields, some way from the city centre, whose main venues include the pub-sized The Musician, Firebug, and The Shed. Several old Anglican churches are based in or around the city centre. St Martin's is now Leicester Cathedral. The other four historic parishes were St Margaret's, St Mary de Castro, All Saints', and St Nicholas'. The first Anglican Church to be built in the city after the medieval period was St George's – contrary to popular belief, this is not empty and disused but is in fact a Serbian Orthodox Church, used by the Serbian Orthodox people as a place of worship, regularly. There is a large Roman Catholic church and Priory named Holy Cross on New Walk/Wellington Street. The city centre is covered by an extensive system of CCTV cameras, supplemented by CCTV vans. Now that the main police station on Charles Street has closed, City Centre policing is based in a building off Belgrave Gate called Mansfield House. ===Regeneration=== Highcross Leicester opened on 4 September 2008 and has several flagship stores, including a John Lewis, a multiplex cinema, apartments, 2 public squares and al fresco dining and is the start of many regeneration projects in Leicester that have started to come to fruition. To the east of Charles Street the city centre is dominated by disused factories and warehouses (which also have some presence in the other outer areas of the city centre). Conversion of these to residential accommodation is ongoing, particularly in the area east of Charles Street and around Humberstone Gate, which has been dubbed 'St George's' by the council, and was made a conservation area in 1989. St George's South has been designated Leicester's new cultural quarter, and is already the site of the Leicester Creative Business Depot (built on the old Leicester City Bus depot and keeping the initials) and the Athena. The LCB Depot opened in July 2004, and by the time of its first birthday had let 37 of 55 units, with talk starting of finding an additional site. Opposite the Athena, a new flagship £60 million Curve Theatre, Leicester, designed by Rafael Vinoly Architects, started construction in 2005, on a site that has been long-disused. It is planned to be ready for handover 2007 to the Haymarket company, who will then vacate their existing building (Haymarket Theatre). The first productions would be in 2008. The centre is being funded by the various sources including the City Council, the Arts Council, the European Regional Development Fund and the East Midlands Development Agency. Further to the south of St George's are plans to create a new business area, near the railway station, including re-use of the old police station, and renovation of the Leicester Mercury building. St George's North has been proposed for a residential community by the Leicester Regeneration Company. Development has also started on waterfront properties, with a plan to re-use the Great Central station site. Since the pedestrianisation of the High Street in Leicester city centre many of the independent retail shops have moved into this regenerated area. Some of Leicester's longest running independent shops can now be found in this area. However, the recent economic downturn and the opening of the Highcross Centre have led to a higher than expected number of closures and an increase in Charity outlets. There are current plans to develop a pedestrianised square, 'over-writing' a spend of almost £2m on parking in the square a few years ago. ==Architecture== ===Listed buildings=== The town hall. There are a few Grade I listed buildings. * Abbey Park ruins and wall, remains of Cavendish House * Jewry Wall * Castle, Turret Gateway, Castle Hall, and St Mary de Castro * The Guildhall * The City Rooms on Hotel Street * The Newarke Magazine Gateway * St Margaret's Church * St Nicholas' Church * The Victoria Park war memorial A few of these are also scheduled monuments. There are many Grade II listed buildings, including * The Turkey Cafe, Granby Street * the Charles Street police building * the Haymarket Memorial Clock Tower * St Martin's Cathedral (II star) * 31 Granby Street (HSBC bank) * All Saints Church, Leicester is Grade B. ===Skyscrapers=== Leicester International Hotel, with the Cardinal Telephone Exchange tower on the left. During the 1960s and 1970s, many large concrete tower blocks were built in and around the city centre for residential and office purposes, like many other cities across the UK. Cardinal Telephone Exchange and St Georges Tower, at 84 metres and 82 metres high respectively, are the two tallest skyscrapers in the whole East Midlands region. Many housing association blocks, averaging 55 metres tall with 20 storeys, were also erected in various Council estates – four in Highfields, two in St Matthews and a further two in Rowlatts Hill. However, in later years, most of Leicester's office towers became disused and abandoned, with the 58 metres tall Thames Tower never achieving more than 50% occupancy since it was completed. Simultaneously, the residential towers became negatively associated with crime and social deprivation. The four residential blocks in St Matthews and Rowlatts Hill were vacated and demolished by Leicester City Council in 2001. Thames Tower and St Georges Tower were both refurbished and reclad in 2009 by private developers, for use as residential apartments and hotels. St Georges Tower was painted royal blue, turning it into a very distinctive local landmark, albeit one that attracted mass controversy due to its perceived ugliness and difference from the original architect's renders for the building's renovation. The 55-metre- tall New Walk Centre has been occupied by the City Council since the 1970s, while the Cardinal Telephone Exchange is occupied by British Telecom. The International Hotel has been an un-maintained eyesore for many years, and requires demolition or serious maintenance work as it is having a real impact on the image and success of the adjacent 'Cultural Quarter'. ==Geography== ===LE1 Postal district=== The postal district LE1 is close to the area covered inside ring-road, but is somewhat larger. The only area inside the ring-road but not part of LE1 is the section of Humberstone Road inside the ring-road. LE1 includes the St Matthew's estate, and extends as far north as the River Soar, thus including Abbey Park. Where the A50 crosses the Soar, the boundary runs south, including Great Central Street in LE1, but not the waterfront. It then broadly follows the path of the ring-road until it reaches Waterloo Way, where the border diverges substantially, to include the swathe of land between London Road, Victoria Park Road and Waterloo Way in the LE1 postcode, including the University of Leicester, the De Montfort Hall, Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College, Regent College, the Welford Road cemetery, and Victoria Park. However, London Road station remains outside LE1. The boundary then includes several streets west of the railway line but east of the ring- road as part of LE1, before meeting up with the roundabout again and then going inwards to exclude Humberstone Road from LE1 (as above). ===Nearby places=== To the west, the city centre borders the river, on the other side of this is the West End of Leicester. To the south-east it borders Highfields, to the east, St Matthew's, and to the north-east, Belgrave. ==References== ==External links== * Map of Medieval Leicester * The Big Build at Leicester City Council * Pictures of Leicester * Leicester photo gallery * Online Videos of the Highcross Quarter Category:Areas of Leicester Category:Central business districts in the United Kingdom ","title":"Leicester City Centre"},{"id":"2583747","text":"A work of art, artwork,Mostly in American English art piece, piece of art or art object is an artistic creation of aesthetic value. Except for \\"work of art\\", which may be used of any work regarded as art in its widest sense, including works from literature and music, these terms apply principally to tangible, physical forms of visual art: *An example of fine art, such as a painting or sculpture. *An object that has been designed specifically for its aesthetic appeal, such as a piece of jewellery. *An object that has been designed for aesthetic appeal as well as functional purpose, as in interior design and much folk art. *An object created for principally or entirely functional, religious or other non-aesthetic reasons which has come to be appreciated as art (often later, or by cultural outsiders). *A non-ephemeral photograph, film or visual computer program, such as a video game or computer animation *A work of installation art or conceptual art. Used more broadly, the term is less commonly applied to: *A fine work of architecture or landscape design *A production of live performance, such as theater, ballet, opera, performance art, musical concert and other performing arts, and other ephemeral, non-tangible creations. This article is concerned with the terms and concept as used in and applied to the visual arts, although other fields such as aural-music and written word-literature have similar issues and philosophies. The term objet d'art is reserved to describe works of art that are not paintings, prints, drawings or large or medium-sized sculptures, or architecture (e.g. household goods, figurines, etc., some purely aesthetic, some also practical). The term oeuvre is used to describe the complete body of work completed by an artist throughout a career.Oeuvre Merriam Webster Dictionary, Accessed April 2011 ==Definition== A work of art in the visual arts is a physical two- or three- dimensional object that is professionally determined or otherwise considered to fulfill a primarily independent aesthetic function. A singular art object is often seen in the context of a larger art movement or artistic era, such as: a genre, aesthetic convention, culture, or regional-national distinction. It can also be seen as an item within an artist's \\"body of work\\" or oeuvre. The term is commonly used by: museum and cultural heritage curators, the interested public, the art patron- private art collector community, and art galleries. Physical objects that document immaterial or conceptual art works, but do not conform to artistic conventions can be redefined and reclassified as art objects. Some Dada and Neo-Dada conceptual and readymade works have received later inclusion. Also, some architectural renderings and models of unbuilt projects, such as by Vitruvius, Leonardo da Vinci, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Frank Gehry, are other examples. The products of environmental design, depending on intention and execution, can be \\"works of art\\" and include: land art, site-specific art, architecture, gardens, landscape architecture, installation art, rock art, and megalithic monuments. Legal definitions of \\"work of art\\" are used in copyright law; see . ==Theories== Marcel Duchamp criticized the idea that the work of art should be a unique product of an artist's labour, representational of their technical skill or artistic caprice. Theorists have argued that objects and people do not have a constant meaning, but their meanings are fashioned by humans in the context of their culture, as they have the ability to make things mean or signify something.Hall, S (ed.) 1997, Cultural Representations and Signifying Practice, Open University Press, London, 1997. Artist Michael Craig-Martin, creator of An Oak Tree, said of his work – \\"It's not a symbol. I have changed the physical substance of the glass of water into that of an oak tree. I didn't change its appearance. The actual oak tree is physically present, but in the form of a glass of water.\\"\\"There's No Need to be Afraid of the Present\\", The Independent, 25 Jun 2001 ==Distinctions== Some art theorists and writers have long made a distinction between the physical qualities of an art object and its identity-status as an artwork. For example, a painting by Rembrandt has a physical existence as an \\"oil painting on canvas\\" that is separate from its identity as a masterpiece \\"work of art\\" or the artist's magnum opus. Many works of art are initially denied \\"museum quality\\" or artistic merit, and later become accepted and valued in museum and private collections. Works by the Impressionists and non-representational abstract artists are examples. Some, such as the \\"Readymades\\" of Marcel Duchamp including his infamous urinal Fountain, are later reproduced as museum quality replicas. Research suggests that presenting an artwork in a museum context can affect the perception of it. There is an indefinite distinction, for current or historical aesthetic items: between \\"fine art\\" objects made by \\"artists\\"; and folk art, craft-work, or \\"applied art\\" objects made by \\"first, second, or third-world\\" designers, artisans and craftspeople. Contemporary and archeological indigenous art, industrial design items in limited or mass production, and places created by environmental designers and cultural landscapes, are some examples. The term has been consistently available for debate, reconsideration, and redefinition. == See also == * Anti-art * Artistic media * Cultural artifact * Opus number (used in music) * Outline of aesthetics * \\"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\\" * Western canon == References == ==Further reading== *Richard Wollheim, Art and Its Objects, 2nd ed., 1980, Cambridge University Press, .

Sykes worked as an assistant at an investment firm and paralegal for a large law firm before her career in the entertainment business. Sykes graduated from the Dana Hall School in Wellesley, Massachusetts. She graduated from Pine Manor College in Brookline, Massachusetts in 1979.http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2012/12/03/busty-heart-boston- super- fan/http://www.oleantimesherald.com/sports/article_21baad95-6f5b-5c2e-a48b-49832a826c88.html ==Career== Busty Heart earned her nickname in high school, by which point her oversized breasts were evident. Her first claim to fame was as a spectator at a Boston Celtics game in 1986. She had been given free tickets to a Celtics game, which happened to be seated next to NBA prospect John Salley. As CBS's cameras spotted Salley in the crowd, Sykes shook her breasts at the camera, breaking Brent Musburger's attention and prompting him to break into laughter. Sykes, who had previously been self-conscious about her large breasts and had otherwise avoided public appearances because of them, soon “parlayed 15 seconds of fame into a 30-year-career” and became a regular at Celtics games. The Celtics won the 1986 NBA Finals and appeared in (but lost) the 1987 NBA Finals while Busty Heart was in the stands. She mostly ceased appearing at sporting events in 1990, when the St. Louis Cardinals management accused her of public lewdness after attending a Cardinals game. She appeared on the season finale of America's Got Talent (NBC) on October 1, 2008. She also appeared on Rude Tube on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom in November 2008. Among her most famous television appearances, she was on Comedy Central's The Man Show, where she demonstrated her talent for crushing beer cans by slamming her breasts on top of them.http://blogs.app.com/saywhat/2010/09/30/busty- heart-shows-how-46h-breasts-are-deadly-weapons/ Busty Heart has done numerous TV shows, including Fox-TV's That's Just Wrong, The WB's Steve Harvey-hosted Steve Harvey's Big Time Challenge season finale, Endemol TV's Private Parts on Channel 5 in England, truTV's World's Dumbest, Bravo TV's Outrageous and Contagious Viral Videos, Fuji TV Tokyo Japan \\"2006 Bakademy Awards\\", E!'s Talk Soup, and 2007 Spike TV MANswers.

However, during 2010's German talent show Das Supertalent, she received all \\"yes\\" votes from the judges and even reached the semi-final round,(Top 40 out of 41.000 auditioners) where she missed the final because of the audience's voting. Busty Heart appeared in the film The Dictator; she plays the role of Etra, one of the titular dictator's bodyguards who uses her breasts as weapons. She appeared in the 2017 movie Deported as Paul's wife. She has also appeared in the E! television series Botched.

J. Pierzynski of the Chicago White Sox checks his swing on a low pitch. A checked swing is a type of motion in baseball made by a batter. A checked swing occurs when a batter starts to swing the bat at the ball, but stops the swing in order to allow the ball to pass without hitting it. If the swing was indeed checked, so that there was no swing, and if the bat did not touch the ball and it did not go through the strike zone, the pitch counts as a ball; but in that circumstance if the swing was not checked, so that a swing occurred, then the pitch counts as a strike. Initially, the home plate umpire must determine if a swing was checked or not checked. If the umpire indicates that it was checked, an appeal can be made by the catcher or their manager, and the home plate umpire can then make a request to either the 1st or 3rd base umpire to make the call as to whether the swing was indeed checked. To maximize visibility, the 1st base umpire makes the call for right-handed batters, and the 3rd base umpire for left-handed batters. To indicate a checked swing, the umpire will make a \\"safe\\" gesture with their hands; to indicate a full swing, they will clench their fist. If a ball that passes the batter goes through the strike zone, it is a strike even if a swing is checked. A checked swing sometimes results in an unintentional swinging bunt, where the ball hits the bat and rolls a short distance, even though the batter apparently stopped their swing. If a ball is hit during a checked swing, it is in play as long as it is not ruled a foul ball. The Major League Baseball rulebook does not contain an official definition for a checked swing, but defines a swing as \\"an attempt to strike at the ball\\". It is the decision of the umpire as to whether an attempt was made or not. Generally, factors such as whether the bat passes the front of the plate or the batter pulls their wrists back are considered in the ruling. Some umpires prefer to use the \\"breaking the wrists\\" criterion as the method to decide a checked swing: if the wrists \\"rolled over\\", a swing occurred. Checked swinging can also be used in some warm-up exercises, such as the game pepper. ==References== * MLB Category:Baseball terminology ","title":"Checked swing"},{"id":"2583768","text":"\\"Come What May\\" (aka \\"The Gipsy Song\\") is a popular song, with lyrics by Allen Schiller and music by Al Sanchez.

Like most other Norwegian railway lines, the entire 124 km long line is electrified at . It serves some of the northern neighborhoods of Oslo, and has a few stations in the woods of Nordmarka. Further north the line serves the municipality of Nittedal. At Roa, the Roa–Hønefoss Line branches off to Hønefoss, where it continues as the Bergen Line. Formerly, most trains between Oslo and Bergen used this route, but nowadays most passenger trains run on the route through Drammen, which is slightly longer but which runs through more densely populated areas. Freight trains use the line over Roa, and sometimes passenger trains also use this line as a reserve line if the route from Hønefoss to Oslo via Drammen is temporarily closed. Further north, the Gjøvik Line runs through the district of Toten before ending at Gjøvik. The Gjøvik Line formerly had three branch lines, the Røykenvik Line, the Valdres Line and the Skreia Line.

For some years he taught successively in its colleges at Paris, Brig in the Swiss canton of Valais, at Turin, and at Brugalette in Belgium. The greater part of his life, however, was devoted to the collection, classification, and interpretation of the countless treasures of medieval art surviving in France, Belgium, Germany, and elsewhere in Europe. They interested him not only as relics of its artistic skill, but chiefly as evidences of its Catholic faith. As early as 1840 he began his collaboration with his Jesuit confrére, Father Arthur Martin, an excellent draughtsman, and chief collector of the mass of artistic material that Father Cahier classified and interpreted. Their first important work was a folio on the 13th century stained glass of the cathedral of Bourges, Monographie de la cathédrale de Bourges, première partie.

Their most characteristic work is found in the valuable Mélanges d'archéologie, d'histoire, et de littérature etc. (Paris, 1848–59), four quarto volumes of illustrated dissertations on gold and silver church-plate, enamelled ware, carved ivories, tapestries, bas-reliefs, and paintings belonging to the Carolingian and Romanesque periods (9th to 12th century). This contribution to the history of medieval art was followed later by four more volumes: Nouveaux mélanges d'archéologie, d'histoire, et de littérature sur le moyen-âge etc. (Paris, 1874–77), in the first volume of which is to be found a memoir of Father Martin by his collaborator. In the meantime Father Cahier had published a monograph in two folio volumes on the saints as grasped by the popular imagination, Caractéristiques des saints dans l'art populaire (Paris, 1867). In spite of his numerous digressions and parentheses, says Father Brucker,Vacant, II, 1304. and a somewhat neglected style, Father Cahier is never wearisome; a vein of kindly but caustic humor runs through his pages, in which about pungent words and phrases, dictated, however, by candour and the love of truth. He was deeply versed in all kinds of curious medieval lore, and particularly in the \\"people's calendar\\" or every-day usages and customs connected with the liturgical life of the Church. He also wrote studies on Christmas and on Epiphany in Amide la religion (Paris, 1848–1849), and in his Calendrier populaire du temps passé in Revue de l'art chrétien (Paris, 1878). He died at Paris on February 26, 1882. ==Notes== Category:19th-century French Jesuits Category:French historians Category:French scholars Category:1807 births Category:1882 deaths Category:French antiquarians Category:French male non-fiction writers Category:19th-century French historians Category:19th- century French male writers ","title":"Charles Cahier"},{"id":"2583792","text":"Grady Avenell (born December 25, 1972) is a US musician.

Barney in 1852. In 1862, the first Postmaster-General for the state of Queensland Thomas Lodge Murray Prior was appointed. A small convict era building was used as for postal services but was too far from the telegraph office. The Postmaster-General choose a half hectare site which was centrally located. The GPO in 1931 The building already located at the Queen Street site which once hosted women convicts was demolished in 1871. Freestone and bricks were sourced from local materials. The GPO was opened on 28 September 1872. In 1873, the Queensland Museum was housed in the General Post Office building, but moved in 1879 to the William Street building. In the same year a second wing, which was constructed by John Petrie was completed which allowed the telegraph office to move to the building, pleasing business customers. The building features deep verandahs and high ceilings. A clock mounted in the pediment positioned above the main entrance was once illuminated by a gas powered light. It was replaced by a smaller, electric clock. The first typewriter to be used in any post office in any Australian city was used at the GPO in 1892. Stamps and money orders were once available to customers outside the building via windows are now closed.

Bulk powder is dark purple. Texas Red or sulforhodamine 101 acid chloride is a red fluorescent dye, used in histology for staining cell specimens, for sorting cells with fluorescent-activated cell sorting machines, in fluorescence microscopy applications, and in immunohistochemistry.Sulforhodamine 101 acid chloride Sigma-Aldrich product information Texas Red fluoresces at about 615 nm, and the peak of its absorption spectrum is at 589 nm. The powder is dark purple. Solutions can be excited by a dye laser tuned to 595-605 nm, or less efficiently a krypton laser at 567 nm. The absorption extinction coefficient at 596 nm is about 85,000 M−1cm−1. The compound is usually a mixture of two monosulfonyl chlorides, i.e., as pictured, or with the SO3 and SO2Cl groups exchanged. It can be used as a marker of proteins, with which it easily forms conjugates via the sulfonyl chloride (SO2Cl) group. In water, the sulfonyl chloride group of unreacted Texas Red molecules hydrolyses to sulfonate and the molecule becomes the very water-soluble sulforhodamine 101 which is easy to wash out selectively. This is one of the advantages of conjugating with Texas Red vs. using a rhodamine-isothiocyanate for conjugation. A protein with the Texas Red chromophore attached can then itself act as a fluorescent labeling agent; an antibody with a fluorescent marker attached will bind to a specific antigen and then show the location of the antigens as shining spots when irradiated. It is relatively bright, and therefore can be used to detect even weakly expressed antigens. Other molecules can be labeled by Texas Red as well, e.g., various toxins. The dye dissolves very well in water as well as other polar solvents, e.g., Dimethylformamide, acetonitrile. Texas Red, attached to a strand of DNA or RNA, can be used as a molecular beacon for highlighting specific sequences of DNA. Texas Red can be linked with another fluorophore. A tandem conjugate of Texas Red with R-phycoerythrin (PE-Texas Red) is often used. Fluorophores, like Texas Red, are commonly used in molecular biology techniques like quantitative RT-PCR and cellular assays. Newer rhodamine derivatives, such as Alexa 594 and DyLight 594, have been tailored to match the excitation and emission spectra of Texas Red and are used in various chemical and biological applications where greater photostability or higher fluorescence intensity are needed. ==References== Category:Staining dyes Category:Rhodamine dyes Category:Triarylmethane dyes Category:Nitrogen heterocycles Category:Oxygen heterocycles ","title":"Texas Red"},{"id":"2583849","text":"Bilin may refer to: *Bilin, Mon State, a town in Mon State in Myanmar *Bilin Township, whose seat is Bilin, Mon State *Bilin (biochemistry), a type of biological pigment with a tetrapyrrole structure, for example found in bile *Bil'in, a Palestinian village in the West Bank *Bilin or Belin (river), a river in Tuva, Russia *The Bilen people, an ethnic group which mainly inhabits Eritrea and speaks the Blin language *The German name for the Czech town of Bílina ","title":"Bilin"},{"id":"2583855","text":"Haw Par Villa () is a theme park located along Pasir Panjang Road in Singapore. The park contains over 1,000 statues and 150 giant dioramas depicting scenes from Chinese mythology, folklore, legends, history, and illustrations of various aspects of Confucianism. During the 1970s and 1980s, the park was a major local attraction; it is estimated that the park then welcomed at least 1 million annual visitors, and is considered as part of Singapore's cultural heritage. As of 2018, under the park operator Journeys, efforts to revitalise the park are ongoing with the holding of themed events and the planning and construction of ancillary museums. ==History== Memorial dedicated to the Aw brothers' parents.Burmese-Chinese brothers Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par, the developers of Tiger Balm, moved their business from Burma to Singapore in 1926. The site, which is in front of a small hill and faces the Singapore Strait, was deemed suitable based on considerations of feng shui, and was purchased in 1935. Between 1937 and his death in 1954 (when the park was declared public property), Boon Haw commissioned statues and dioramas in the park that served to teach traditional Chinese values. In the 1950s and 1960s, before the advent of television and shopping malls, the park was a popular recreational destination for Singaporean families. Many Singaporean adults, in a 1995 survey, reported memories of visiting the park as a child and learning about Chinese folk history and morality. In the 1980s, in a bid to restore Singapore's \\"oriental mystique\\", Singapore Tourism Board saw to the redevelopment of the park (along with Chinatown and Little India). In 1986, the International Theme Parks Pte Ltd, announced an investment of $30 million to modernise the themed park. This company was a joint venture formed by Fraser & Neave and Times Publishing, and had invested on the latest animatronics and technology to enhance the attractions in hope to create an 'oriental Disneyland', a theme park meeting Western technology with Eastern mythology. In 1988, Singapore Tourism Board took charge of the Tiger Balm Gardens and renamed it \\"Haw Par Villa Dragon World\\". The Haw Par in the park's name is based on the Aw brothers' personal names—Haw and Par, which mean \\"tiger\\" and \\"leopard\\" respectively. The dioramas and statues were restored, while plays, acrobatic displays and puppet shows were organised and held there. The management imposed entrance fees but the high fees discouraged visitors, so the management incurred a loss of S$31.5 million over 10 years. The park management made a profit during its first year of operations after renovations in 1994, broke even in 1995, but started incurring losses over the next three years and was forced to provide free entry in 1998. In March 2001, the Singapore Tourism Board renamed it \\"Tiger Balm Gardens\\". The park is now open every day from 9 am to 7 pm (with last entry at 6 pm) and admission is free. Between March 2006 and March 2012, the S$7.8 million Hua Song Museum, which focused on the Chinese diaspora, operated within the park. In 2014, artists Chun Kai Qun, Chun Kaifeng and Elizabeth Gan, under the curatorial platform Latent Spaces, staged four exhibitions in the theme park's unused spaces. Their first exhibition, Nameless Forms, featured the works by the Chun twins, Darren Tesar, Sai Hua Kuan and collective Yunrubin, which respond to the place's defunct exhibition halls, idle pavilions and the materials that were left behind. ==Attractions== Chinese-style Paifang after main entrance. Ox-Headed (right) and Horse-Faced (left) Hell Guards stand guard at the entrance . Interior of the Ten Courts of HellThe best-known attraction in Haw Par Villa is the Ten Courts of Hell, which features gruesome depictions of Hell in Chinese mythology and Buddhism. This attraction used to be set inside a 60-metre long trail of a Chinese dragon but the dragon has been demolished, so the attraction is now covered by grey stone walls. Other major attractions include dioramas of scenes from Journey to the West, Fengshen Bang, The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars, Legend of the White Snake, Romance of the Three Kingdoms; statues of mythological figures such as the Laughing Buddha and Guanyin, and historical personages such as Jiang Ziya, Su Wu and Lin Zexu; the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac, and others. There are also monuments dedicated to the Aw brothers and their parents. ==Contemporary reception and outlook== In a 2014 study which reviewed 25 tourist guidebooks on Singapore, it was found that only the authors of one book chose to cover the park in detail. The study noted low tourist interest on the Internet, and low tourist foot traffic at the park. The study's authors also corroborated online travel reviews that some of the statues were in disrepair, and the park is ill-posed to compete with Singapore's newer tourist attractions. Haw Par Villa is, the authors note, \\"a treasured past, although one in danger of fading away with newer generations of tourists\\". ==Public transportation== The Circle line station, Haw Par Villa MRT station, located next to it, opened on 8 October 2011 along with the rest of Stage 5 of the Circle line. ==See also== * Tiger Balm Garden (Hong Kong) * Hwa Par Children Playground, in Thailand ==References== ==External links== * Haw Par Villa official website * Haw Par Villa at Passion Made Possible Category:1937 establishments in Singapore Category:Amusement parks in Singapore Category:Queenstown, Singapore Category:Visionary environments Category:Aw family ","title":"Haw Par Villa"},{"id":"2583869","text":"Formal Aspects of Computing (FAOC) is a peer-reviewed scientific journal published by Springer Science+Business Media, covering the area of formal methods and associated topics in computer science.

Schuster's integral is named after him. He contributed to making the University of Manchester a centre for the study of physics.Charlton, H. B. (1951) Portrait of a University. Manchester: University Press; chap. V: the Schuster-Tout epoch ==Early years== Arthur Schuster was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany the son of Francis Joseph Schuster, a cotton merchant and banker, and his wife Marie Pfeiffer. Schuster's parents were married in 1849, converted from Judaism to Christianity, and brought up their children in that faith. In 1869, his father moved to Manchester where the family textile business was based. Arthur, who had been to school in Frankfurt and was studying in Geneva, joined his parents in 1870 and he and the other children became British citizens in 1875. Edgar Schuster (1897–1969) was his nephew. From his childhood, Schuster had been interested in science and after working for a year (1870/71) for the family firm of Schuster Brothers in Manchester, he persuaded his father to let him study at Owens College. He studied mathematics under Thomas Barker and physics under Balfour Stewart, and began research with Henry Roscoe on the spectra of hydrogen and nitrogen. He spent a year with Gustav Kirchhoff at the University of Heidelberg, and having gained his PhD, returned to Owens as an unpaid demonstrator in physics. Schuster later used his family's wealth to buy material and equipment and to endow readerships in mathematical physics at Manchester and meteorology at the University of Cambridge. He also contributed to the Royal Society and the International Union for Co-operation in Solar Research. After a further period of study in Germany with Wilhelm Eduard Weber and Hermann von Helmholtz, he returned to England, where his knowledge of spectrum analysis led to him being appointed to lead an expedition to Siam, to photograph the coronal spectrum during the total solar eclipse of 6 April 1875. This was an important appointment for such a junior scientist. On the way, he wrote a letter dated 21 February 1875, to Nature describing his observation of the \\"green flash\\" phenomenon. ==Career and Later Life== Arthur Schuster by William Orpen, 1912 On his return to Manchester in 1875, he began research on electricity and then went on to spend five years at the Cavendish Laboratory of the University of Cambridge. His status there was quite unofficial; he was neither a student nor a fellow. He worked with James Clerk Maxwell and with Rayleigh. In 1881, he was appointed to the Beyer Chair of Applied Mathematics at Owens, by now one of the colleges of the new Victoria University. He succeeded his teacher Balfour Stewart as professor of physics in 1888. This appointment gave him the opportunity to establish a large, active teaching and research department. In 1900 a new laboratory, for which he had fought and which he had designed, was officially opened. It was the fourth largest in the world. The laboratory quickly became a serious rival to the Cavendish; see Manchester Science Hall of Fame. Much of this later fame was associated with Ernest Rutherford who succeeded Schuster as Langworthy Professor in 1907. Schuster resigned from the chair, partly for health reasons and partly to promote the cause of international science. He ensured that Rutherford would succeed him. Schuster is credited with coining the concept of antimatter in two letters to Nature in 1898. He hypothesized antiatoms, and whole antimatter solar systems, which would yield energy if the atoms combined with atoms of normal matter. His hypothesis was given a mathematical foundation by the work of Paul Dirac in 1928, which predicted antiparticles and later led to their discovery.Harrison, Edward (2000) Cosmology: the science of the universe, 2nd ed., Cambridge University Press, pp. 266, 433, . Schuster is perhaps most widely remembered for his periodogram analysis, a technique which was long the main practical tool for identifying statistically important frequencies present in a time series of observations. He first used this form of harmonic analysis in 1897 to disprove C. G. Knott's claim of periodicity in earthquake occurrences. He went on to apply the technique to analysing sunspot activity. This was an old interest. In 1875 Stewart's friend and Roscoe's cousin, the economist Jevons, reported, \\"Mr. A Schuster of Owens College has ingeniously pointed out that the periods of good vintage in Western Europe have occurred at intervals somewhat approximating to eleven years, the average length of the principal sun-spot cycle.\\" Schuster is credited by Chandrasekhar to have given a fresh start to the radiative transfer problem. Schuster formulated in 1905 a problem in radiative transfer in an attempt to explain the appearance of absorption and emission lines in stellar spectra. This was the first use of the two-stream approximation that underpins the treatment of radiative transfer in virtually all weather and climate models. In 1912 he bought Yeldall House near Twyford, Berkshire.http://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/news/13387358.Retro__Yielding_to_modern_needs/ Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the Schuster family was subjected to anti-German prejudice in the press and, in Arthur's case, in some quarters of the Royal Society. His brother Sir Felix Schuster had to issue a statement pointing out the family's loyalty to Britain and that they all had sons serving in the British army. On the day Arthur gave his presidential address to the 1915 British Association meeting, he learned that his son had been wounded. Schuster was regarded by his contemporaries as a mathematical physicist of exceptional ability but also as a capable administrator and teacher, and an advocate for the role of science in education and industry. He died in Twyford on 14 October 1934. He is buried in Brookwood Cemetery in outer London. ==Family== In 1887 he married Caroline Loveday. ==Honours and awards== Schuster was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1879, and knighted in the 1920 New Year Honours. Other honours include doctorates from the universities of Calcutta (1908), Geneva (1909), St Andrews (1911), and Oxford (1917) and the award of the Royal, Rumford and Copley medals of the Royal Society (1893, 1926 and 1931). ; LLD, Calcutta, 1876; Schuster served as secretary of the Royal Society and was elected vice-president (1919–20) and foreign secretary (1920–24). He also served as secretary of the International Research Council (1919–28) and on the management committees for the Meteorological Office (1905–32) and National Physical Laboratory (1899–1902, 1920–25). He was knighted by King George V in 1920. The University of Manchester's Schuster Laboratory, home to the School of Physics and Astronomy is named after him. ==Publications== * Radiation Through a Foggy Atmosphere (1905) * The Progress of Physics (1910) Four lectures delivered to the University of Calcutta during March 1908, which give cautious provisional approval of Albert Einstein's Special Relativity and Max Planck's initial ideas about Quanta. * An introduction to the theory of optics (1904) There are two subsequent editions to this book, and Schuster is the author.

He is a very tall, well-muscled humanoid alien with reddish-orange skin, a partially bald head and three brown locks down the center of his head. Other distinguishing features include a pair of bull-like horns. He first appeared in Green Lantern (vol. 3) #49 (February 1994): \\"Emerald Twilight Part Two: The Present\\" ==Fictional character biography== ===History=== Ke'Haan of Varva past was formerly the second in command to Green Lantern trainer Kilowog. He was also the designated protector of sector 786. Together, he and Kilowog were the top trainers for newly appointed Green Lantern Corps recruits. Over the course of his life, he was regarded as the toughest teacher on Oa. However this tough training was noted for producing some of the toughest Lanterns found in the corps.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #12 (July 2006) When Sector 112 was without a Lantern, he took Kentor Omoto's daughter Laira under his wing. Within her, he found a kindred spirit and she became his prized pupil. Within the Corps, it became heavily implied and whispered that he and Laira were more than teacher and pupil despite the fact that he had a family on his native planet Indeed, they could often be found together on most of their missions. ===Emerald Twilght=== When the entity known as Parallax corrupted fellow Green Lantern Hal Jordan, the Guardians dispatched Ke'Haan and Laira to stop him from reaching Oa. The pair found themselves outmatched as Jordan, powered by rage and psychosis, tore through them. Surprisingly, despite his imposing figure, years of experience, and overwhelming strength, Ke'Haan was the first to fall to Jordan, while his pupil Laira, while still losing, fared much better in her attempts at stopping Jordan.Green Lantern (vol. 3) #49 (February 1994) ===Return and death=== Believed dead after his battle with Hal Jordan, Ke'Haan, along with fellow GLs Graf Toren, Laira, Kreon, Boodikka, and Tomar-Tu, was captured by the Manhunters and taken to the forbidden Sector 3601 to be used as energy cells for the planet Biot. During this time, he was succeeded as Green Lantern of his sector by Turytt who was tasked to tell his wife and children of his demise. Turytt also swore to kill the one responsible for Ke'Haan's apparent death.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #3 (August 2005)Green Lantern (vol. 4) #11 (May 2006) It is unknown how long they remained captive until Guy Gardner and Hal Jordan, now free of the Parallax influence, discovered him and his fellow Lanterns. He was freed from captivity by Jordan and waged all out war on the Manhunters. After defeating the Manhunters, the Lost Lanterns turned their rage on Jordan, who they still believed to be their enemy. They paused however when Jordan refused to fight back. Upon examining their surroundings, they discovered Lanterns long thought dead. Apparently the Manhunters had been abducting Lanterns for a long time. The newly resurrected Lanterns would have been slain if not for quick teamwork which led to the destruction of Biot. When they returned to Oa, they were given heroes' welcomes, and Ke'Haan resumed his duties as Instructor to new Lanterns. He was also the one to warn Hal Jordan to stay clear of the Lost Lanterns, even though Jordan was the one that rescued them. It is unknown how his successor and family have reacted to his return.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #13 (September 2006) When Parallax (Kyle Rayner) brought Hal Jordan to Qward, the entire Sinestro Corps attacked him.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #21 (July 2007) Amon Sur told Hal it was ironic that he was going to die despised and abandoned by the Corps. Ke'Haan then arrived on the scene with his fellow Lost Lanterns, saving Hal and stating \\"Despised? Yes. But never abandoned.

He first joined the youth group of the Social Democratic Party, the Sozialistische Arbeiter-Jugend, at the age of 14; later, he joined the SPD. As the conflicts with the National Socialists intensified in Munich during the 1920s, he joined the Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold. During this time, Maislinger helped defend the offices of the Münchener Post from attack by \\"brown shirts\\".Dietrich Mittler. Biography of Adolf Maisingler Retrieved March 31, 2010 In 1931, he joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD).Hartmut Mehringer. Die KPD in Bayern 1919-1945 (The Communist party of Germany in Bavaria 1919-1945) At the end of 1932, just before the Nazis rose to power, the KPD warned its functionaries to identify as many homes as possible where they could go into hiding, should the need present itself. Two months later, in February 1933, Maislinger sought refuge by friends. He became a courier using the pseudonym “Bertl” and maintained contact with KPD members in Prague and Zurich. He also gave refuge to friends who needed to go into hiding. He met friends at night, riding on a bicycle, pistol under his jacket. After one of his friends was arrested and severely beaten, he betrayed the entire group. ==Betrayal and imprisonment== Registration form of Adolf Maislinger as a prisoner at Dachau Nazi Concentration Camp Maisingler was able to escape to Switzerland, but in 1934, the KPD ordered him to back to Germany to carry out party work in the Ruhr area. He was arrested on the border and sent to Munich to the police prison on Ettstraße. In 1935, using a 72-page document detailing the evidence, he and his friends were tried at the Volksgerichtshof. After three days, Maislinger was sentenced to eight years' hard labor in a Zuchthaus for \\"preparation for high treason\\". Rather than being released when this time was up, however, the Gestapo issued an order on September 8, 1942, to send him to Dachau in preventive detention. His old friends from Munich were already there. There, Communist comrades from Munich helped him get a job with the disinfection unit. The resulting freedom of action allowed him to become active in the Resistance again. Speaking of the liberation of Dachau, Maislinger said, > It was a miracle and at the same time, a shock. The other prisoners, my > friends, came over to me. Some came running, others could only crawl. At > some point, I began to walk, but didn't really walk anymore, I was floating. > [...]I climbed up on a window ledge and watched everything from up there and > cried. ==After 1945== After his liberation, Adi Maislinger returned to Munich, where he was put on the city government established by the American occupying force. This didn't last long, however. On July 22, 1946, the Americans arrested all the prominent KPD members, including Maislinger and he was again imprisoned, this time in Landsberg. On August 20, 1946, the Süddeutsche Zeitung reported the release of the Communists in Landsberg, saying \\"It is still unclear why they were arrested.\\" Maisingler devoted himself to share his experiences as a prisoner in a concentration camp with young people, speaking at schools and other places. He was active with the Dachau Memorial and the Action Reconciliation Service for Peace (ARSP), reaching some 7,000 young people a year. He was also active with the Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime. ==See also== * List of Germans who resisted Nazism ==Sources== * Martin Boszat and Hartmut Mehringer (Editors).

He gives the example Whom did you see? which is grammatically correct but is generally replaced by Who did you see? Structural symmetry seems to have brought about the change: all other wh- words are monomorphic (consisting of only one morpheme). The drift of speech changes dialects and, in long terms, it generates new languages. Although it may appear these changes have no direction, in general they do. For example, in the English language, there was the Great Vowel Shift, a chain shift of long vowels first described and accounted for in terms of drift by Jespersen (1860–1943). Another example of drift is the tendency in English to eliminate the -er comparative formative and to replace it with the more analytic more. Thus, in some dialects one now regularly hears more kind and more happy instead of the prescriptive kinder, happier. In English, it may be the competition of the -er agentive suffix which has brought about this drift, i.e. the eventual loss of the Germanic comparative system in favor of the newer system. Moreover, the structural asymmetry of the comparative formation may be a cause of this change. The underlying cause of drift may be entropy: the amount of disorder (differences in probabilities) inherent in all linguistic systems.See early work of Bar-Hillel and Mandelbrot, as well as Zipf and Martinet. Another underlying cause of drift may be crosslinguistic influence (CLI) in situations of language contact. For example, in Shanghai Chinese (Shanghainese) it has been reported that vowel sounds have gradually changed over time due to the influence of Mandarin Chinese (Yao & Chang, 2016). At a shorter timescale (weeks of intensive exposure to a second language) as well, phonetic changes have been observed in an individual's native language; these changes, termed 'phonetic drift', generally approximate properties of the second language.See the work of Chang (Chang, 2012, 2013, 2019a, 2019b). ==Long-term cyclic drift== Cyclic drift is the mechanism of long-term evolution that changes the functional characteristics of a language over time, such as the reversible drifts from SOV word order to SVO and from synthetic inflection to analytic observable as typological parameters in the syntax of language families and of areal groupings of languages open to investigation over long periods of time. Drift in this sense is not language- specific but universal, a consensus achieved over two decades by universalists of the typological school as well as the generativist, notably by Greenberg (1960, 1963), Cowgill (1963), Wittmann (1969), Hodge (1970), Givón (1971), Lakoff (1972), Vennemann (1975) and Reighard (1978). To the extent that a language is vocabulary cast into the mould of a particular syntax and that the basic structure of the sentence is held together by functional items, with the lexical items filling in the blanks, syntactic change is no doubt what modifies most deeply the physiognomy of a particular language. Syntactic change affects grammar in its morphological and syntactic aspects and is seen as gradual, the product of chain reactions and subject to cyclic drift.See Henri Wittmann's 1983 state-of-the-art article. ==See also== *Phonological change *Phonemic differentiation *Sound change *Syntactic change ==Notes== ==References== *Chang, Charles B.

King's career in baseball spanned over 65 years, including 35 full years with the New York Yankees, whether in uniform as a manager or coach or in the front office in multiple roles, including general manager (1985–86) and special advisor to longtime owner George Steinbrenner.Weber, Bruce (3 November 2010), \\"Clyde King, Who Found Niche as Steinbrenner's Troubleshooter, Dies at 86.\\" The New York Times He managed the San Francisco Giants (1969–70) and Atlanta Braves (1974–75), as well as the Yankees (part of 1982), finishing with a career record of 234 wins and 229 defeats (.505). ==Career== ===As player=== Born in Goldsboro, North Carolina, King attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A , right-handed pitcher, he made his debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers at age 20 in 1944, his first professional season, during the manpower shortage caused by World War II. Although King would be sent to the minor leagues for seasoning after the war, he proved to be a solid member of the Brooklyn pitching staff (1944–45, 1947–48, 1951–52), winning 14 games for the 1951 Dodgers. When he finished his Major League career with the Cincinnati Redlegs in 1953, King had appeared in an even 200 games, winning 32 and losing 25 with an earned run average of 4.14. He allowed 524 hits and 189 bases on balls in 496 innings pitched. He registered 150 strikeouts and four complete games (in 21 career games started) with 11 saves. ===As coach, manager and executive=== Before becoming a Major League manager, he led several higher-level minor league clubs, including the Atlanta Crackers, Hollywood Stars, Phoenix Giants, Columbus Jets and Rochester Red Wings. He also served as the MLB pitching coach for the Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates, and roving minor league pitching instructor for the St. Louis Cardinals. King succeeded Herman Franks as San Francisco's manager in after Franks' Giants had finished in second place in the ten-team National League for four successive seasons. In King's first year as their skipper, the Giants won 90 games, a two-game improvement over 1968. But again they were runners-up, this time in the new, six-team National League West Division, three games behind the Braves. King clashed with Giants star Willie Mays during the year, over a misunderstanding on whether Mays was supposed to play or not in a game against the Astros. According to Mays, King threatened a fine—Horace Stoneham would not permit it, but Chub Feeney, the general manager, made Mays apologize to King, not wanting to create a rift on the ballclub. \\"I lost any respect I ever had for King,\\" Mays wrote in his autobiography. \\"I thought of him as a back stabber, and we didn't talk for the rest of the year (1969).\\" When the 1970 Giants got off to only a 19–23 start, King was fired on May 23; San Francisco was trailing Cincinnati's \\"Big Red Machine\\" in the NL West by 12 games at the time. King then returned to the high minors to manage the Richmond Braves of the Triple-A International League for two seasons, followed by a stint as a special assistant to Braves' general manager Eddie Robinson from 1973 through July 23, 1974. That day, with Atlanta one game above .500, Robinson fired skipper Eddie Mathews and named King interim manager. King's Braves responded by posting a 38–25 record and won 88 games—their best performance since 1969. But King's 1975 team collapsed; it was 58–76 and 31 games behind the Reds on August 29, 1975, when King was replaced as manager by Connie Ryan. He then joined the Yankees' front office in 1976 and played a number of key roles—super scout, pitching coach, general manager and special advisor, in addition to managing them for the final 62 games of 1982. Replacing Gene Michael, he won 29 games and lost 33 as the defending American League champions fell to fifth place in the AL East Division.sportsillustrated He remained with the Yankees for the rest of his life. ==Personal== King died in his native Goldsboro at the age of 86, survived by his wife Norma, their three daughters and sons-in-law, eight grandchildren and one great- grandchild.http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20101103&content;_id=15970542&vkey;=news_mlb&c;_id=mlb He was inducted in the Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999. ==References== ==External links== *Branch Rickey's Last Protege: Clyde King, by Jerry Green, Baseball Digest, June 1969 * *News article *Photo Category:1924 births Category:2010 deaths Category:Atlanta Braves managers Category:Atlanta Crackers managers Category:Atlanta Crackers players Category:Baseball players from North Carolina Category:Brooklyn Dodgers players Category:Cincinnati Redlegs players Category:Cincinnati Reds coaches Category:Hollywood Stars managers Category:Indianapolis Indians players Category:Major League Baseball coaches Category:Major League Baseball executives Category:Major League Baseball general managers Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball pitching coaches Category:Mobile Bears players Category:Montreal Royals players Category:New York Yankees coaches Category:New York Yankees executives Category:New York Yankees managers Category:New York Yankees scouts Category:People from Goldsboro, North Carolina Category:Pittsburgh Pirates coaches Category:Richmond Colts players Category:Rochester Red Wings managers Category:San Francisco Giants managers Category:Tulsa Oilers (baseball) players ","title":"Clyde King"},{"id":"2583946","text":"Major William Mayo (c. 1685 – 20 October 1744) was an English civil engineer who emigrated to the British colony of Virginia in 1723. ==Biography== Mayo, born in England, emigrated to the British colony of Virginia in 1723. In 1736, a commission of six men sent a surveying party under Mayo's leadership to explore Lord Fairfax's territory, one of three such parties outfitted at that time (see John Savage). This first survey of Fairfax's domains provided the first useful map of the region, and Mayo's journal provided most of the knowledge available to the first settlers who were then breaking through the Blue Ridge gaps into western Virginia territory. The New Creek, Mineral County area received its name from this Mayo expedition. By traveling up the north side of the Potomac River, which was easier because of the mountainous terrain on the south side, the party missed the stream which gives the town its name. On the return trip, however, the explorers discovered the stream and subsequently placed it on the map as a \\"new creek.\\" Together with Professor Alexander Irvin, Mayo was also responsible for setting the boundary between Virginia and North Carolina. One of the rivers intersecting the line was named the Mayo River in his honor. In 1737, Mayo laid out the city of Richmond, Virginia.

They have one daughter, Janina who works as a stuntwoman in Canada. Karl Dall has two sisters and a brother. He lives in Hamburg-Eppendorf. == Career == Karl Dall left school after the 10th grade and accomplished an apprenticeship as a typesetter in a print shop in the town of Leer, East Frisia. Together with Ingo Insterburg, Jürgen Barz and Peter Ehlebracht he founded in 1967 the comedy group ' of which he was a member until it ceased to exist in the 1970s. Moreover, he created the TV show Musikladen for Radio Bremen and has since then been working for television broadcasters. From 1983 until 1990 he used to appear in the hidden camera comedy show Verstehen Sie Spaß?, playing for example a chaotic film presenter or a telephone prankster. In the German radio broadcast of Radio Luxemburg (RTL) he presented his own comedy show and was also among the first TV-presenters of television channel RTLplus. There he had his own talkshow named Dall-As which was aired from 19 January 1985 until the end of 1991. The concept was to irritate and provoke the guests. On 4 January 1992 he continued this show at the rivalling television channel Sat.1 as Jux und Dallerei. From 1991 until 1993 he presented the game show Koffer Hoffer on television channel Tele 5. In this show lost luggage, of which the owner could not be identified anymore, was auctioned to the candidates. Later he was member of the initial ensemble of the comedy show 7 Tage, 7 Köpfe.

Otherwise, the Romans produced a series of persecutions of offending and nonconforming religions. In the 3rd century, Cassius Dio outlined the Roman imperial policy towards religious tolerance: > You should not only worship the divine everywhere and in every way in > accordance with our ancestral traditions, but also force all others to > honour it. Those who attempt to distort our religion with strange rites you > should hate and punish, not only for the sake of the gods … but also because > such people, by bringing in new divinities, persuade many folks to adopt > foreign practices, which lead to conspiracies, revolts, and factions, which > are entirely unsuitable for monarch\\".

Oxford University Press, 2011, 165. ===The Bacchanals=== By 186 BC, the Roman senate issued a decree that severely restricted the Bacchanals, ecstatic rites celebrated in honor of Dionysus. Livy records that this persecution was due to the fact that \\"there was nothing wicked, nothing flagitious, that had not been practiced among them\\".Livy, http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/livy39.html Livy records that more people were put to death than imprisoned: \\"A greater number were executed than thrown into prison; indeed, the multitude of men and women who suffered in both ways, was very considerable.\\" On a bronze tablet found in Tiriolo, Italy in 1640, a Roman decree reads: \\"Let none of them be minded to have a shrine of Bacchus ... Let no man, whether Roman citizen or Latin ally or other ally, be minded to go to a meeting of Bacchantes ... Let no man be a priest. Let no- one, man or woman, be a master. Let none of them be minded to keep a common fund. Let no-one be minded to make any man or woman an official or a temporary official. Henceforth let no-one be minded to conspire, collude, plot or make vows in common among themselves or to pledge loyalty to each other. If there are any who transgress against the decrees set out above, a capital charge is to be brought against them.\\"Decree of the Senate Concerning the Rites of Bacchus, http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/sc/sc_bacch_e.html ===Druids=== Druids were seen as essentially non-Roman: a prescript of Augustus forbade Roman citizens to practice \\"druidical\\" rites. Pliny reportsPliny's Natural History xxx.4. that under Tiberius the druids were suppressed—along with diviners and physicians—by a decree of the Senate, and Claudius forbade their rites completely in AD 54.Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Life of Claudius paragraph 25 Druids were alleged to practice human sacrifice, a practice abhorrent to the Romans.\\"The Britons\\", Christopher Allen Snyder, p. 52, Blackwell Publishing, 2003, Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD) wrote \\"It is beyond calculation how great is the debt owed to the Romans, who swept away the monstrous rites, in which to kill a man was the highest religious duty and for him to be eaten a passport to health.\\" ===Judaism=== TiberiusSuetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Life of Tiberius paragraph 36 forbade Judaism in Rome, and Claudius expelled them from the city. However, the passage of Suetonius is ambiguous: \\"Because the Jews at Rome caused continuous disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus he [Claudius] expelled them from the city\\". Chrestus has been identified as another form of Christus; the disturbances may have been related to the arrival of the first Christians in Rome, and that the Roman authorities, failing to distinguish between the Jews and the Early Christians, simply decided to expel them all. The Crisis under Caligula (37–41) has been proposed as the \\"first open break between Rome and the Jews\\", because the problems were already evident during the Census of Quirinius in 6 and under Sejanus (before 31).H.H. Ben-Sasson, A History of the Jewish People, Harvard University Press, 1976, , The Crisis Under Gaius Caligula, pp. 254–256: \\"The reign of Gaius Caligula (37–41) witnessed the first open break between the Jews and the Julio-Claudian empire. Until then – if one accepts Sejanus' heyday and the trouble caused by the census after Archelaus' banishment—there was usually an atmosphere of understanding between the Jews and the empire ... These relations deteriorated seriously during Caligula's reign, and, though after his death the peace was outwardly re- established, considerable bitterness remained on both sides. ... Caligula ordered that a golden statue of himself be set up in the Temple in Jerusalem. ... Only Caligula's death, at the hands of Roman conspirators (41), prevented the outbreak of a Jewish-Roman war that might well have spread to the entire East.\\" After the Jewish–Roman wars (66–135), Hadrian changed the name of Iudaea province to Syria Palaestina and Jerusalem to Aelia Capitolina in an attempt to erase the historical ties of the Jewish people to the region.H.H. Ben-Sasson, A History of the Jewish People, Harvard University Press, 1976, , p. 334: \\"In an effort to wipe out all memory of the bond between the Jews and the land, Hadrian changed the name of the province from Iudaea to Syria- Palestina, a name that became common in non-Jewish literature.\\" In addition, after 70, Jews and Jewish proselytes were only allowed to practice their religion if they paid the Jewish Tax, and after 135 were barred from Aelia Capitolina except for the day of Tisha B'Av. ===Manichaeism=== The first official reaction and legislation against Manichaeism from the Roman state to Manichaeism took place under Diocletian. In an official edict called the De Maleficiis et Manichaeis (302) compiled in the Collatio Legum Mosaicarum et Romanarum and addressed to the proconsul of Africa, Diocletian wrote > We have heard that the Manichaens [...] have set up new and hitherto > unheard-of sects in opposition to the older creeds so tha they might cast > out the doctrines vouschafed to us in the past by the divine favour for the > benefit of their own depraved doctrine. They have sprung forth very recently > like new and unexpected monstrosities among the race of the Persians - a > nation still hostile to us - and have made their way into our empire, where > they are committing many outrages, disturbing the tranquility of our people > and even inflicting grave damage to the civic communities. We have cause to > fear that with the passage of time they will endeavour, as usually happens, > to infect the modest and tranquil of an innocent nature with the damnable > customs and perverse laws of the Persians as with the poison of a malignant > (serpent) ... We order that the authors and leaders of these sects be > subjected to severe punishment, and, together with their abominable > writings, burnt in the flames. We direct their followers, if they continue > recalcitrant, shall suffer capital punishment, and their goods be forfeited > to the imperial treasury. And if those who have gone over to that hitherto > unheard-of, scandalous and wholly infamous creed, or to that of the > Persians, are persons who hold public office, or are of any rank or of > superior social status, you will see to it that their estates are > confiscated and the offenders sent to the (quarry) at Phaeno or the mines at > Proconnesus. And in order that this plague of iniquity shall be completely > extirpated from this our most happy age, let your devotion hasten to carry > out our orders and commands.Iain Gardner and Samuel N. C. Lieu, eds., > Manichaean Texts from the Roman Empire (Cambridge: Cambridge University > Press, 2004), 117–18. ===Christianity=== According to Jacob Neusner, the only religion in antiquity that was persistently outlawed and subject of systematic persecution was not Judaism, but Christianity.Jacob Neusner, A Life of Rabban Yohanan Ben Zakkai: Ca. I-80 C. E., Brill 1970 p.171 Christian martyrs were a significant part of Early Christianity, until the Peace of the Church in 313. Suetonius mentions passingly that: \\"[during Nero's reign] Punishments were also inflicted on the Christians, a sect professing a new and mischievous religious belief\\"Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero paragraph 16 but he doesn't explain for what they were punished. Tacitus reports that after the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64 some in the population held Nero responsibleTacitus, Annals XV.44 and that to diffuse blame, he targeted and blamed the Christians (or ChrestiansIn the earliest extant manuscript containing Annales 15:44, the second Medicean, the e in \\"Chrestianos\\", Chrestians, has been changed into an i; cf. Gerd Theißen, Annette Merz, Der historische Jesus: ein Lehrbuch, 2001, p. 89. The reading Christianos, Christians, is therefore doubtful.). The religion of the Christians and Jews was monotheistic in contrast to the polytheism of the Romans.\\"the word 'Hellenism' was used by the Christian elites in the Greek East alongside the universal derogatory terms 'polytheism' and 'idolatry' to describe Graeco-Roman religion\\" see \\"Pagan Monotheism in Late Antiquity, Polymnia Athanassiadi, Michael Frede, Contributor Polymnia Athanassiadi, p. 7, Oxford University Press, 2002, The Romans tended towards syncretism, seeing the same gods under different names in different places of the Empire. This being so, they were generally tolerant and accommodating towards new deities and the religious experiences of other peoples who formed part of their wider Empire.\\"A History of the Church\\", Philip Hughes, Sheed & Ward, rev ed 1949, vol I chapter 6. This general tolerance was not extended to religions that were hostile to the state nor any that claimed exclusive rights to religious beliefs and practice. By its very nature the exclusive faith of the Jews and Christians set them apart from other people, but whereas the former group was in the main contained within a single national, ethnic grouping, in the Holy Land and Jewish diaspora—the non-Jewish adherents of the sect such as Proselytes and God-fearers being considered negligible—the latter was active and successful in seeking converts for the new religion and made universal claims not limited to a single geographical area. Whereas the Masoretic Text, of which the earliest surviving copy dates from the 9th century AD, teaches that \\"the Gods of the gentiles are nothing\\", the corresponding passage in the Greek Septuagint, used by the early Christian Church, asserted that \\"all the gods of the heathens are devils.\\"\\"The Greek Septuagint translated into English\\", Psalm 95:5 (96:5 in Hebrew-based translations - see Psalms#Numbering), translated by Sir Lancelot Charles Lee Brenton, 1851. Jerome would follow the Greek text rather than the Hebrew when he translated the Latin Vulgate edition of the bible. The \\"devils\\" epithet would still appear in bibles until the end of the 20th century when the consensus reverted to the original Hebrew text for modern translations The same gods whom the Romans believed had protected and blessed their city and its wider empire during the many centuries they had been worshipped were now demonizedA modern Christian writes that the gods of the pagans are \\"in fact fallen angels (otherwise known as devils) ... And that is what the pagans, then as now, serve as \\"gods\\" \\", Roy H. Schoeman, \\"Salvation is from the Jews\\", Ignatius Press, 2003, by the early Christian Church.The modern Church takes a much less antagonistic stance to non-Abrahamic faiths. see Dignitatis humanae and Nostra aetate The Romans protected the integrity of cults practiced by communities under their rule, seeing it as inherently correct to honor one's ancestral traditions; for this reason the Romans for a long time tolerated the highly exclusive Jewish sect, even though some Romans despised it. It was not so with the early Christian community which was perceived at times to be a new and intrinsically destabilising influence\\"Julian the Apostate and His Plan to Rebuild the Jerusalem Temple\\", Jeffrey Brodd, Biblical Archaeology Society, Bible Review, October 1995. and a threat to the peace of Rome, a religio illicita. The pagans who attributed the misfortunes of Rome and its wider Empire to the rise of Christianity, and who could only see a restoration by a return to the old ways, were faced by the Christian Church that had set itself apart from that faith and was unwilling to dilute what it held to be the religion of the \\"One True God\\".\\"Letter of Ambrose to the Emperor Valentinian\\", The Letters of Ambrose Bishop of Milan, 384 AD, retrieved 5 May 2007. After the initial conflicts between the state and the new emerging religion during which early Christians were periodically subject to intense persecution, Gallienus issued an edict of toleration for all religious creeds including Christianity, a re-affirmation of the policy of Alexander Severus. ==From Constantine onwards== The first episodes started late in the reign of Constantine the Great, when he ordered the pillaging and the tearing down of some pagan temples.R.

For other uses, see Tanya (disambiguation). Title page of an 1800 edition of Tanya Rabbati. Tanya Rabbati is an anonymous work on Jewish law first published in Italy, in 1514 CE. Tanya Rabbati discusses Shabbat and the Jewish Holidays. The work is named for its first word, \\"Tanya\\", which is Aramaic for \\"it is stated in a baraita.\\" It is believed to have been authored by Jehiel ben Jekutheil Anav (full name: Jehiel ben Jekutheil ben Benjamin Ha- Rofe Anav), a 13th-century Rabbinic author, manuscript copyist, and liturgical poet. The work was first published in Mantua, and was re-printed in Cremona, 1565, and later in two other editions. ==Relationship to Shibbolei ha-Leket== Shibbolei ha-Leket (Hebrew, \\"The Gleaned Ears\\"), the first Italian Jewish codification of Jewish law, is an earlier work that is similar in scope and content, but more detailed and further elaborated. Shibbolei ha-Leket is concerned with the liturgy, the Passover Haggadah, and laws pertaining to Shabbat and the Jewish Holidays. It was authored by Zedekiah ben Abraham Anav, a 13th-century Italian Talmudist. The work was culled from many Rishonim. Anav \\"systematized his material skilfully, gave it a concise as well as popular form, and judiciously discriminated between conflicting opinions and decisions, giving preference to those that seemed to him true.\\" It is divided into 372 paragraphs, plus appendices and responsa on topics such as circumcision, mourning, tzitzit, slaughtering, inheritance, and interest. An abridged version was published in Venice (Daniel Bomberg) in 1545, and a complete version in Vilna in 1886. ===Viewpoints re authorship of the Shibolei HaLeKet / Tanya Rabbati== * Many scholars believe that the Tanya Rabbati is, in fact, an abbreviated version of Shibbolei ha-Leket. In addition to the similarity in content, Zedekiah ben Abraham Anav and Jehiel ben Jekutheil Anav were in fact related. However, other views exist. *S. H. Kook believes that Tanya Rabbati is the first edition of Shibbolei ha-Leket. In this view, Jehiel copied Shibbolei ha-Leket and added his own notes and ideas. * In contrast, S. K. Mirsky believes that Jehiel is the original author of Tanya Rabbati. In Mirsky's view, the many similarities of the Tanya Rabbati to Shibbolei ha- Leket come from the fact that both Jehiel and Zedekiah wrote their works based on the teachings of Judah ben Benjamin Anav, Jehiel's uncle. * Rabbi Yechiel, brother of the Baal HaTurim, on the inside cover of a printed edition, wrote (loose translation, from File(onw the right)Tanua_rabati.jpg): :::The man, a most modest author who didn't want to accept a crown of greatness, but it would become him, would not want it known that he authored this work. However, it has come by generation-after-generation from the mouth of man known as Master of the Pillars (Baal HaTurim). Within this work it is said more than once \\"I am the Sofer Yechiel.\\" There is a hand-written notation below this, on the Wikimedia-uploaded copy, of: Rav Yechiel ben HaRav Yekusiel ben HaRav Binyomin, who authored (\\"ChiBayr\\" - composed, not copied) the work Maalos HaMiddos.

Assessment of sábalo (Prochilodus lineatus) fisheries in the lower Paraná River basin (Argentina) based on hydrological, biological, and fishery indicators. Neotrop. Ichthyol. 11(1). ==Local names== In Spanish its common name is sábalo; in Brazil it receives the names curimbatá, curimba, corimbatá or grumatã. In the United States it is also known by the technical synonym Tarpon prochilodus. There are many other species of fish with the common name sábalo; P. lineatus is therefore distinguished sometimes as sábalo jetón (colloquial Spanish for \\"big-mouth\\") or chupabarro (\\"mud-sucker\\"). ==Appearance== A school of P. lineatus (also a single Brycon hilarii, upper left) in the Pantanal of Brazil P. lineatus reaches up to in length and in weight.Fishing World-records: Prochilodus lineatus. Retrieved 23 February 2017. A common length is about . Its body is tall and compressed, greenish-gray (lighter in the belly), with yellowish green fins. Its mouth is circular and projects towards the front; it has two series of small teeth. ==Behavior== This fish prefers deep waters and it is illiophagous, i.e. it sucks and eats organic mud, for which its mouth is especially adapted. This incidentally makes it difficult to fish with a bait. It migrates in large banks, looking for warm waters during the spring in order to lay its eggs. ==In the Paraná River== P. lineatus is considered the key species of the Paraná River, since it forms the base of the food chain that ends with larger fish like the surubí catfish (Pseudoplatystoma) and golden dorado (Salminus brasiliensis). Regulations in place in Santa Fe and Entre Ríos, Argentina, have proven ineffective to preserve the species, which is being severely exploited, both for internal consumption and for export. Experts estimate that capturing 20,000 tonnes of sábalo per year is the upper limit of sustainability. Exports, however, of about 13,000 tonnes in 1998, grew to 34,000 tonnes in 2004, after the depreciation of the Argentine peso caused by the economic crisis tripled its local value. As the fish population dwindles, fishermen who depend on their captures for their livelihood are keeping smaller specimens, often not mature and which therefore have had no time to reproduce. Widespread disregard of prescribed net sizes and the presence of illegal processing plants, which the local governments do not control, have compelled environmental groups to protest. The issue turned into a jurisdiction conflict when Santa Fe tightened the regulations in 2005, forbidding the capture of sábalos under 42 cm long, while Entre Ríos kept the limit looser at 40 cm. On July 13, about 400 fishermen blocked the Rosario access to the Rosario-Victoria Bridge that joins the two provinces. On August 1, after Entre Ríos matched its regulations with those of Santa Fe, 300 fishermen and freezing plant workers from Victoria did the same. They were pressured, according to certain claims, by the threat of unemployment if their plants cannot fill their export quotas. In October 2006, largely to facilitate the reproduction of sábalo, the legislative branch of Santa Fe attempted to pass a temporary ban on commercial fishing in the Paraná. This ban was vetoed by the executive, as it had no counterpart in the neighbouring Entre Ríos. On 21 December 2006, the national government banned exports of fish of the Paraná River for eight months starting on 1 January 2007. ==References == * Los Peces Que Tenemos (in Spanish) * Pesca & náutica: Nuestros peces (in Spanish) * Pesca en Argentina (in Spanish) * Fundación PROTEGER, Amigos de la Tierra, Argentina (in Spanish, some documents in English) * Category:Fish of South America Category:Freshwater fish of Argentina Category:Prochilodontidae Category:Fish described in 1837 ","title":"Prochilodus lineatus"},{"id":"2584003","text":"The Meisner technique is an approach to acting which was developed by the American theatre practitioner Sanford Meisner. The focus of the Meisner approach is for the actor to \\"get out of their head\\", such that the actor is behaving instinctively to the surrounding environment. To this end, some exercises for the Meisner technique are rooted in repetition so that the words are deemed insignificant compared to the underlying emotion. In the Meisner technique, there is a greater focus on the other actor as opposed to one's internal thoughts or feelings associated to the character. The Meisner technique is often confused with \\"method\\" acting taught by Lee Strasberg, since both developed from the early teachings of Konstantin Stanislavski. ==Components== Meisner training is an interdependent series of training exercises that build on one another. The more complex work supports a command of dramatic text. Students work on a series of progressively complex exercises to develop an ability to first improvise, then to access an emotional life, and finally to bring the spontaneity of improvisation and the richness of personal response to textual work. The techniques developed the behavioral strand of Stanislavski's. The technique is used to develop improvisation skills as well as \\"interpreting a script, and creating the specific physical characteristics of each character the actor played\\". An example of a technique Meisner invented to train actors' responses is called the Repetition Exercise: > \\"In this exercise, two actors sit across from each other and respond to each > other through a repeated phrase. The phrase is about each other's behavior, > and reflects what is going on between them in the moment, such as \\"You look > unhappy with me right now.\\" The way this phrase is said as it is repeated > changes in meaning, tone and intensity to correspond with the behavior that > each actor produces towards the other. Through this device, the actor stops > thinking of what to say and do, and responds more freely and spontaneously, > both physically and vocally.The exercise also eliminates line readings, > since the way the actor speaks becomes coordinated with his behavioral > response.\\" ==About Meisner== > \\"To be an interesting actor – hell, to be an interesting human being – you > must be authentic and for you to be authentic you must embrace who you > really are, warts and all. Do you have any idea how liberating it is to not > care what people think about you? Well, that's what we're here to do.\\" — > Sanford Meisner Meisner developed this technique after working with Lee Strasberg and Stella Adler at the Group Theatre and while working as head of the acting program at New York City's Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre. He continued its refinement for fifty years. > \\"In 1935, Sanford Meisner, one of the founding members of The Group Theatre > (along with Stella Adler, Bobby Lewis, Harold Clurman, and Lee Strasberg), > joined the faculty of The Neighborhood Playhouse. Over the years, he > developed and refined what is now known as the Meisner Technique, a step-by- > step procedure of self-investigation for the actor now globally recognized > and among the foremost of modern acting techniques.\\" > \\"Meisner believed that the study of the actor's craft was rooted in > acquiring a solid organic acting technique.

Sydney Pollack directed a master class taught by Sanford Meisner. It was transferred to digital film in 2006. ==Practitioners== The Neighborhood Playhouse had originally been founded as an off-Broadway theatre by philanthropists Alice Lewisohn and Irene Lewisohn in 1915, but closed in 1927. The following year, it re-opened as The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre with the addition of Rita Wallach Morgenthau. In 1935, Sanford Meisner, one of the founding members of The Group Theatre (along with Stella Adler, Bobby Lewis, Harold Clurman, and Lee Strasberg), joined the faculty of The Neighborhood Playhouse. Over the years, he developed and refined what is now known as the Meisner Technique. On October 18, 2018, the New York City Council officially recognized The Playhouse's 90th anniversary and Meisner's contributions to the school with an official Proclamation. The William Esper Studio was founded in 1965 as a school for the performing arts in Manhattan, New York. Its founder, William \\"Bill\\" Esper (1932—2019), is often referred to as the best-known of Meisner's first generation teachers, and his most \\"authentic protege\\". ==List of Meisner-trained actors== Actors who have trained in the Meisner technique include: ==See also== * List of acting techniques ==References== ===Sources=== * Banham, Martin, ed. 1998.

A drift pin is not used as a punch in the traditional sense of the term. A drift is constructed as a tapered rod, with the hammer acting on the large end of the taper. The tapered end of a drift punch is placed into the semi-aligned bolt holes of two separate components, and then driven into the hole. As it is driven in, the taper forces the two components into alignment, allowing for easy insertion of the fastener. Unlike most punches, force should never be applied to the tip of drift pin.

Any milling process can be powered in this way, but the most frequent use of animal power in horse mills was for grinding grain and pumping water. Other animal engines for powering mills are powered by dogs, donkeys, oxen or camels. Treadwheels are engines powered by humans. ==History== Horse or donkey-powered stone mills at Pompeii. The donkey or horse-driven rotary mill was a 4th-century BC Carthaginian invention, with possible origins in Carthaginian Sardinia. Two Carthaginian animal-powered millstones built using red lava from Carthaginian-controlled Mulargia in Sardinia were found in a 375–350 BC shipwreck near Mallorca. The mill spread to Sicily, arriving in Italy in the 3rd century BC. The Carthaginians used hand-powered rotary mills as early as the 6th century BC, and the use of the rotary mill in Spanish lead and silver mines may have contributed to the rise of the larger, animal-powered mill. It freed the miller from most of the heavy burden of his task and greatly increased output through the superior stamina of horses and donkeys over humans. ==Gallery== Image:Horsegin.jpgThe Horse Mill at Wester Kittochside Farm near Glasgow Image:Coconut oil making Seychelles.jpgA bullock-powered mill, Seychelles Image:High Atlas-The olive grinding mill (js).jpgThe olive grinding mill, High Atlas (Morocco) Image:Batteuse 1881.jpgA horse-powered threshing machine.

It was rescued from Berwick Hills Low Farm in Northumberland by the museum, repaired and set up in their own gin gang at Home Farm as a non- functioning exhibit. The top of the mill's main vertical axle and the end of the main drive shaft are pivoted at the centre of their own separate tie beam which is below and parallel with the main roof tie beam, and set in the gin gang's side walls at either end. The mill's tie beam has to be stabilised with two massive oak beams which run, either side of the drive shaft, from tie beam to threshing barn wall. A large and basic engine like this can create great stresses from the torque engendered.See images in Commons category:Gin gang and Commons category:Horse mill, or for further information contact the agricultural department of Beamish Museum . There is no printed or online citation for this horse mill or building. Image:Gin gang 024.jpgMain axle of mill. Roof truss above is separate; mill's own tie beam visible between.

Its top end pivots under the mill's own tie beam (if it didn't, it would fall over) but the tie beam cannot rest on the pivot, or the mill would not turn. The main axle supports around its top end the main, -diameter, horizontal gear wheel, with the teeth on the top surface. The main drive shaft, a massive oak pole, is girthed at one end by a secondary gear wheel which lies on the main gear wheel, thus turning the main drive shaft on its long axis. The main drive shaft runs from the main gear wheel through a hole in the threshing barn wall and in the barn it powers the threshing machine and other machines via further cogwheels and belts. Such a machine would create great torque stresses, and if it were ever to work again it would require re-engineering to ensure smooth and safe running, and beams which are seasoned and not cracked.

Image:Gin gang 023.jpgOne of four long beams, each with horse shaft hanging from it. Image:Gin gang 021.jpgA four-horse mill requires a large working space ===Horse power=== This is a powerful horse mill for four horses; probably English ponies, as modern heavy horses were not yet fully bred in the 1830s. Each of the four heavy oak beams connecting the central axle to the four horse shafts runs from beside the axle to the under-surface of the main gear wheel, and crosses the other three in a grid pattern between the axle and gear wheel, thus supporting the gear wheel and creating a rigid structure at the same time. They project for many feet beyond the main gear wheel, and require wooden stretchers to stabilise them. From the ends of these beams hang the horse shafts. The bottom ends of these shafts are quite low, which may indicate the use of ponies rather than early heavy horses. ==Horse gin at Nottingham Industrial Museum== A horse gin is on display at the Nottingham Industrial Museum. It was constructed in 1841 to sink the Langton Colliery shaft and moved in 1844 to Pinxton Green Colliery. It was still working in 1950 and it was erected in the museum in 1967. It was used at a pit head to raise coal to the surface. The Nottingham mines were shallow, coal was moved to the shaft on a sled, which was raised in a cage by a rope attached to a rope drum that was turned by the horses in the gin.

The gin was a wooden wheel device on a spindle that was pulled round by a horse. This then operated a simple pulley system that raised or lowered loads up and down the shaft.http://blackcountryhistory.org/collections/getrecord/GB149_P_3848/ They were most prolific in the Ruiton farm area of the Black Country, which extended to Cotwallend Road. Horse 'gins' were also an extension of the one time illegal mining activities carried out particularly during the Miners' Strike of 1926. Miners dug out the coal from the shallow seam through a series of shallow \\"Bob Holes\\", hauling up the coal often in ordinary buckets to be transported away to be sold in the nearby village of Gornal. These activities were believed to have been the beginnings of Ellowes Colliery. The Earl of Dudley halted these activities and legalised them by giving permission for the coal to be mined on a royalty tonnage basis. The shallower coal was mined via the slope or \\"walking down\\" method (an extension of the \\"Bob Hole\\" method) using horse actuated 'gins'. Eventually, two shafts and steam-driven pit gear were installed to mine the thicker coal further down. The pit closed in July 1951 when the seam was exhausted. The 'gin' used at Ellowes Colliery was believed to be the last working example in the Black Country.http://blackcountryhistory.org/collections/getrecord/GB145_p_1867/ ==Brewers' House museum== In Antwerp, Belgium, the Brewers' House museumBrouwershuis Antwerp, Inventory Historical real estate Flanders is a good example of horse-powered pumping machinery.

After touring with Insane Clown Posse and contributing to the band Dark Lotus, he set up his own record label, Billion Dollar Ballers. Marz has since found Jesus and has released a full length Christian Rap LP in 2012 available on iTunes called Revelation, also going by the name John Brown. ==Early history== Marz was born in Croatia, but grew up in Chicago. He began as a tech in a Chicago recording studio (Chicago Trax), where he worked for various acts, including Peter Gabriel and Ministry. Hukic met Ministry's Al Jourgensen in 1994 at the Chicago Trax recording studio where Hukic was interning while working on solo material, and Jourgensen recruited him to work on Ministry's record, Filth Pig, playing guitar and also acting as engineer. He went on to become a full-time member, touring the world with the band. He stayed until Ministry's 1999 album, Dark Side of the Spoon, but left the band soon after it was recorded. He was later persuaded back to play on one last tour with the band. Hukic and Jourgensen remained on good terms, with Jourgensen even joining Marz on stage at a few performances. Hukic produced a demo which won him a contract with E-Magine Records, with whom he released the album Lung Fu Mo She.Mark Marsh (2001) \\"Marz back in Studio\\", Drowned in Sound, April 8, 2001. The album was described by Drowned in Sound as a \\"toxic blend of industrial drumming and guitars mixed with his own bullet proof rhyming flow\\".Mark Marsh (2002) \\"Marz: Lung Fo Mo She\\", Drowned in Sound, March 20, 2002. According to Hukic, \\"The majority of the record is about self- empowerment.\\"Bill Whiting-Mahoney \\"THE IMAGE AND MUSIC ON MARZ’ DEBUT DISC, LUNG FU MO SHE, IS A FAMILIAR BLEND OF ATTITUDINAL HEAVY METAL AND HIP-HOP EGOTISM \\" (interview), Extreme music Online Tracks from this album were featured in a TV ad for the movie Catwoman, in MTV's The Real World, and included on MTV & WWE's Tough Enough 2 Soundtrack. In 2000-2001, Hukic, with his band, also called Marz, comprising Hukic, Rey Washam (drums, programming, formerly of Ministry), Troy Gourley (bass guitar), Louis Svitek (guitar, also formerly of Ministry) and Pat De La Garza (guitar)Geoff Harkness (2001) \\"_attacks/ Marz attacks!: Ex-Ministry member forms new hip-hop-fueled band performed two nationwide tours with Insane Clown Posse on the \\"Bizaar Bizzar Tour\\".Joe D'Angelo (2001) \\"Insane Clown Posse Hitting The Road, Juggalo-Style: Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope kick off 25-date outing May 2 with opener Marz\\", MTV, April 26, 2001. Hukic was impressed by Insane Clown Posse's performance style, and the Juggalo fanbase embraced Marz. Plans were made for Hukic to join the supergroup Dark Lotus and sign with Psychopathic Records. However, Marz was still signed with E Magion Records, but Hukic told Psychopathic that he could get out of his contract with his current label. Hukic recorded vocals for the Dark Lotus album Tales from the Lotus Pod, however most of the group were not as impressed with Hukic as Joseph Bruce had been. Although Marz was featured on Psychopathic's 2001 sampler, he was ultimately never signed with the label, as he could not get out of his contract with E Magion Records. This ultimately lead to a dispute between Insane Clown Posse and Marz. Marz recorded a diss track towards ICP, saying that he \\"was the Sixth Joker's Card\\". Tales from the Lotus Pod was reissued with Hukic's vocals removed as a result of this dispute.Event Calendar Marz toured with Korn in 2002 after joining their record label, Elementree, to begin work on his second album, and performed on Korn's \\"Pop Sux\\" Tour. During this time, Marz recorded collaborations with Jonathan Davis and Swizz Beatz. Marz had a song on \\"Gorilla Pimpin\\" thanking the Juggalos. Jonathan Davis from Korn and ICP have been at odds since Violent J made statements to Davis about his childhood. Davis informed Marz he would have to cut the word \\"Juggalo\\" from the album. He refused and self-released the album, \\"Gorilla Pimpin'\\", which includes a song titled \\"Cut Throat\\" that featured Jonathan Davis. In 2004, Marz started his own record label, Billion Dollar Ballers Entertainment. He released TGZ Nation The Mixtape under this label. Hukic has had Marz tracks included in several films including Life and Lyrics (2006 - \\"Whut It Do\\" and \\"Video Tape It\\")Life & Lyrics Soundtrack details and It's a Boy Girl Thing (2006 - \\"Red Carpet Pimpin'\\"). == The Billion Dollar Baller Show == In 2006, Marz teamed up with Fearless Radio to launch his own radio show with B.D.B. labelmates Pack and DJ E.L.I.—The Billion Dollar Baller Show == Marz Presents: Grind Music The Movement == In 2007, Marz released his 4th album, Marz Presents: Grind Music The Movement.

Featuring a number of contemporary musical acts and performers, it was intended to mark the first five years of the independent label movement in the UK record industry and Rough Trade itself. It was the first in a series of many cassette releases from the paper, including the C86 compilation of 1986. ==Background== C81 was compiled by NME journalist Roy Carr, and Christopher Rose, who worked in public relations for Rough Trade. To obtain a copy, NME readers needed to collect two coupons from the magazine and send off £1.50. The first printed coupons and advertisement for the cassette were in the issue dated 31 January 1981. By the time C81 went on general sale at the end of May that year, 25,500 copies had been sold through the coupon offer, which represented a \\"big commercial success\\" according to Carr. The tape contained a set of 25 diverse tracks ranging from post-punk (Red Crayola, Essential Logic, D.A.F., The Raincoats), jazz (James Blood Ulmer), poetry (John Cooper Clarke), ska (The Beat), electronic (Cabaret Voltaire) to veteran 'Canterbury Scene' performer Robert Wyatt. It was accompanied by the 'C81 Owner's Manual', a 32-page booklet of lyrics and artwork that readers would assemble themselves by cutting up and folding a page from the tabloid sized magazine. This consisted of 16 small double sided panels, and was designed to be slipped into the cassette case.NME/Rough Trade C81 (1981) « Press Play and Record A running joke throughout the booklet was the comparison of a number of acts on the tape to various periods in the history of The Velvet Underground. When C81 went on general sale in May 1981 Chrysalis Records refused to re-licence the tracks by The Specials and Linx, and these were then replaced by Panther Burns and Television Personalities. Publishing a tape was an acknowledgment of the flourishing self-published cassette culture of the time that the NME had been supporting during its short lived Garageland column. An alternative view, however, was that the C81 cassette was more akin to 'bandwagon jumping', drawing on the enthusiasm and momentum of the cassette culture movement and using this as a promotional tool, whilst failing to acknowledge that movement, and ignoring its inherent critique of the established music industry.\\"NME, though, disillusioned many of the more radical independent producers with its 1981 'C81' compilation cassette, produced in collaboration with Rough Trade. This release drew on the growing enthusiasm for cassettes being generated, not just by the independent cassette labels, but also by the appearance of the personal stereo. 'C81' gave no acknowledgement of the former, though, and was seen as being directed more at the consumer lifestyle market of the latter.\\" - Rosen, P, '\\"It was easy, it was cheap, go and do it!\\" Technology and Anarchy in the UK Music Industry', 1997, published in: Twenty-First Century Anarchism; Unorthodox ideas for a new Millennium, Purkis, J & Bowen, J.

Perzel represented 172nd Legislative District (Northeast Philadelphia) in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1978 until 2010. From April 2003 to January 2007, he served as House Speaker. He lost his bid for re-election to Democrat Kevin Boyle in 2010. Perzel was convicted in August, 2011, of a variety of corruption related charges and, in March, 2012, was sentenced to 30 months in prison. ==Early years== Perzel is a graduate of Abraham Lincoln High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in 1975 from Troy State University in Alabama. After graduating from university, he returned to Philadelphia and became a waiter. Immediately before his political career, he was maitre d' at Pavio's Restaurant in Somerton, a section of Northeast Philadelphia. ==Politics== Perzel was noticed by Philadelphia Republican boss Billy Meehan, who selected him to be a GOP committeeman in 1972. In 1976, after graduating from Troy State University, he unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the House. In 1978, he made a successful campaign for the House, focusing on the poor attendance record of the Democratic incumbent, Francis Gleeson. Over the years, he rose in seniority in the House, holding the offices of Republican Whip, Policy Committee Chairman and Chairman of the House Republican Campaign Committee. He was elected Majority Leader in 1994. Perzel hit some bumps on his route to the leadership. In November 2000, Perzel nearly suffered defeat when a wave of support for then-Vice President Al Gore brought out Democratic voters in Philadelphia in larger than expected numbers. Perzel survived by less than 100 votes. 2002 brought redistricting and a more favorable district for Perzel. In a 2002 PoliticsPA Feature story designating politicians with yearbook superlatives, he was named the \\"Hardest Working.\\" In 2001, he was named \\"Politician of the Year\\" by PoliticsPA. Perzel was appointed as a commissioner to the Delaware River Port Authority by Democratic Governor Ed Rendell in 2003. On November 2, 2010, Perzel lost his seat to Democrat Kevin Boyle, brother of Rep. Brendan Boyle. Perzel captured 46% of the vote to Boyle's 54%. Perzel was the only Republican incumbent in Pennsylvania to lose in the 2010 elections. ==Speakership== On March 29, 2003, Speaker of the House, Matt Ryan, died after battling cancer. On April 15, 2003, the House elected Perzel as Speaker. He became one of the most powerful legislative leaders in the Pennsylvania General Assembly since James Manderino. Perzel was instrumental in the state takeover of the poorly performing Philadelphia School District, the Philadelphia Parking Authority, and the Philadelphia Convention Center. He was also a key figure in the 2005 pay raise debacle. During the furor, Perzel became the butt of jokes due to an unfortunate photograph. While reading to students in Pittsburgh, he was photographed in front of a class display full of pink pigs. The pay raise opposition had used a 25-foot pink pig in its demonstrations, and the photograph was widely circulated in order to embarrass the Speaker. In defending the pay raise, Perzel has made a number of controversial statements, including assertions that some cow-milkers and tattoo artists earned more than his members. In addition, Perzel has commented that some of the members were unable to obtain credit cards. Perzel has been criticized by conservatives for compromising with fellow Philadelphian, Governor Ed Rendell. Perzel supported the 2003 tax increase proposed by Rendell as well as Act 71, the law that legalized slot machine gambling in Pennsylvania. ===2007 Speaker election=== Republicans lost the majority in the 2006 elections by one seat. Perzel sought to convince a Democrat to change parties or abstain from the election for speaker so that he could remain in office. After Democrat Tom Caltagirone of Reading announced that he would support Perzel rather than Democrat Bill DeWeese for Speaker, it appeared likely that Perzel would be elected Speaker presiding over a Democratic majority. At the last minute, however, DeWeese nominated another Northeast Philadelphia Republican, Dennis O'Brien. The tactic was successful, as O'Brien was elected by a vote of 105 to 97. The Republican caucus created the new title of Speaker Emeritus which gave Perzel a role without displacing other members of the House leadership. Even though he lost the majority of his power, he remained a \\"powerful force in the House due to his institutional knowledge.\\" Perzel made a bid to return to the House GOP leadership after the 2008 elections, but was defeated by incumbent Sam Smith for the position of Minority Leader. ==Aristotle scandal== On September 10, 2008 the office of then-State Attorney General Republican Tom Corbett announced that Perzel was under investigation for deals he made with the data firm Aristotle, Inc. during his tenure as Speaker of the House. Perzel had contracted the firm to provide the Republican Caucus with its constituency service program in deals worth over $1,870,000. Corbett's agents were investigating whether the sophisticated data collection software was used for reelection campaigns in violation of state laws against the use of public funds for campaign purposes. On September 11, 2008 the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that the contract contained specific references for gathering information related to election purposes and the distribution of yard signs. The Republican Attorney General's office stated that it would issue indictments either before October 1, 2009 or after the election to avoid having \\"undue influence\\" on the November election. After indictment, Perzel turned himself into local police on November 13, 2009. and was released from custody on $100,000 bond that same day after surrendering his passport. He lost his 2010 re-election bid to Democrat Kevin Boyle. Perzel pleaded guilty on August 31, 2011 to eight criminal charges, including two counts of conflict of interest, two counts of theft, and four counts of conspiracy.http://www.boston.com, September 1, 2011, Ex-Pa. speaker pleads guilty to corruption, by the Associated Press On March 21, 2012, Common Pleas Court Judge Richard Lewis sentenced Perzel to 30 months in prison and to pay one million dollars restitution to the state. The penalty of one million dollars was later dropped on appeal. ==Ward leader== Perzel was the Republican Ward Leader of the 64th Ward Republican Executive Committee. ==References== ==External links == * Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Speakers of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives Category:Members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives Category:Pennsylvania Republicans Category:Politicians from Philadelphia Category:American people convicted of theft Category:Pennsylvania politicians convicted of crimes ","title":"John Perzel"},{"id":"2584069","text":"Jossy Mehsen Mansur (June 7, 1934, Aruba – October 15, 2016) was the editor of the Papiamento-language newspaper Diario in Aruba. He wrote two dictionaries for the Papiamento language and a history of Aruba among other books. ==Powerful Aruban business family== Mansur was a descendant of a family which originally came from Lebanon and settled on the island of Aruba. The Mansur family made its fortune as cigarette manufacturers and in the import-export business. With a licence of Philip Morris, they were the major suppliers of Marlboro in the Caribbean basin for many years (the licence has been withdrawn). The Mansurs sponsored the Marlboro Red Tigers baseball team as well as the Aruban People's Party (Arubaanse Volkspartij, AVP) of former Prime Minister Henny Eman.

Answer: \\"The big family in Aruba we used for laundering money and moving cocaine.\\" ==Alleged involvement in cigarette smuggling and money laundering== The Mansur family was involved in cigarette smuggling from Aruba to Colombia. For over 50 years, Philip Morris' main distributor in Latin America was the Mansur Free Zone Trading Company, NV. Cigarettes were shipped to Aruba or Panamanian free trade zones operated by the Mansurs and then into Colombia's special customs zone, Maicao, just across the border from Venezuela. One of Philip Morris' main distributors within Colombia was Samuel Santander Lopesierra, at one time a senator in the Liberal Party. Dubbed \\"the Marlboro Man\\" by the Colombian media, in reference to his alleged cigarette smuggling activities, Lopesierra is named in a U.S. federal court affidavit filed in conjunction with the Mansur money-laundering indictment.Major Tobacco Multinational Implicated In Cigarette Smuggling, Tax Evasion, Documents Show , by The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, January 31, 2000Tobacco Companies Linked to Criminal Organizations in Cigarette Smuggling , by The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, March 3, 2001 In that affidavit, an FBI agent working undercover says he was told by one of the original defendants in the Mansur indictment, that Lopesierra was part of a scheme to convert narco dollars into shipments of goods bound for Colombia.

Two family members, the cousins Eric and Alex Mansur, have been indicted by the U.S. attorney in Puerto Rico. They reportedly funneled US$500,000 in campaign cash to Colombian President Ernesto Samper through the wife of a jailed Cali cartel boss during the 1994 election campaign. Mr. Samper denied it. The Mansurs subsequently were awarded a monopoly for Colombian gambling, which was canceled in 1997 by a government watchdog agency that smelled impropriety.Drug Smugglers’ Dutch Treat, by Lucy Komisar, The Wall Street Journal, May 29, 1997See: Juan O.

The report by the Dutch Internal Security Service describes security in Aruba, saying that foreign organizations fighting crime in the region are almost unanimous in their view of the Aruban business community as providing services for (laundering specialists of) regional drug cartels. The report mentions the Mansurs by name and portrays them as criminals who were associated with criminal organizations involved in drugs trafficking, gun trafficking and laundering money obtained from criminal activities. Despite the fact that the report was classified as top secret, it was leaked to the press and its contents became public. The suit was dismissed on procedural grounds for failure to exhaust Mansur's civil remedies in the Netherlands courts.Messrs. L. E. and J. Mansur (represented by Dr. Jan M.

The ongoing disagreement between Mansur and Oduber dates back many years. During the election campaign in 2001 Oduber's party even had stickers made stating \\"Don’t believe Diario.\\"Country report 2005, Inter American Press Association Mansur strongly advocated a point of view in the cases of Eduardo Mathew and Natalee Holloway. He appeared regularly on Fox News and Nancy Grace's Headline News show commenting on the disappearance of Natalee Holloway on Aruba in 2005. Mansur formed his own \\"investigative team\\" and his newspaper repeatedly published new leads.

While the quality of work varies, Mansur's eclectic interests may provide more psychological insight into him. While he was rumored to have made liberal use of ghost writers and editors, Mansur's literary aspirations are undeniable, documenting both Aruban social and cultural history and keeping the linguistic aspirations of Papiamento alive through both linguistic editorial and translation work. *Mansur, Jossy M.

During the 1980s, he was one half of comic double act \\"The Oblivion Boys\\" with Stephen Frost. Arden was born in Newbury, Berkshire. He and Frost came to prominence in the late 1970s alternative comedy boom, and became recognisable to a national audience with regular spots on Saturday Live. In the early 1980s they were instrumental in the forming of long-running north London comedy show News Revue, and shortly afterwards began appearing as a pairing in episodes of series such as The Black Adder and The Young Ones. They are perhaps most remembered for a series of commercials for Carling Black Label lager, one of which involved Arden and Frost appearing in the nude. He continued to perform with Frost in comedy clubs, although did not follow his partner into the genre of improvisation.

Haneburg is a castle with two wings of Leer in East Frisia, Germany. It is one of the few buildings remaining of the Renaissance time in north-west Germany, which was much affected by the Netherlands. The castle was built by the chieftain of Leer, Hayo Unken, in the middle of the 15th century. Subsequently, the castle passed via the Frese family into the possession of the Hane family, from whom the building takes its present name. Joest Hane, the steward (Drost) of the Count of East Frisia in Stickhausen, began to repair the castle in 1621 and extended it by the addition of the southern Renaissance wing. His son Dietrich Arnold Hane built the northern wing in 1671. Until some years ago the Haneburg was an old people's home. After complex renovation work it is today the home of the office of the people's high school for the city and district of Leer. Temporarily it is in use for art exhibitions and conferences. It is the property of the district of Leer, which uses the knights' hall for representative causes. However, historical interiors are no longer present in the castle.

Kahn is credited with creating the first camera phone, being a pioneer for wearable technology intellectual property, and is the author of dozens of technology patents covering Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) modeling, wearable, eyewear, smartphone, mobile, imaging, wireless, synchronization and medical technologies. ==Early life and education== Kahn grew up in Paris, France. He was born to Jewish immigrants of modest means. His mother, Claire Monis, was an Auschwitz survivor, violinist and lieutenant in the French resistance. His father was a self-educated mechanical engineer with a socialist bent. Kahn was educated in mathematics at the ETH Zurich, Switzerland (Swiss Federal Polytechnic Institute), on a full scholarship and University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, France. He received a masters in mathematics. He also received a masters in musicology composition and classical flute performance at the Zurich Music Conservatory in Switzerland. As a student, Kahn developed software for the MICRAL, which is credited by the Computer History Museum as the first ever microprocessor-based personal computer.computerhistory.org ==Career== ===Technology companies=== Philippe Kahn working on the first camera phones June 11th, 1997, Santa Cruz, CA: Image taken by Philippe Kahn after his daughter's birth. July 1st, 2010, Double Jeopardy question Kahn has founded four software companies: Fullpower Technologies, founded in 2005, LightSurf Technologies, founded in 1998 (acquired by Verisign in 2005), Starfish Software, founded in 1994 (acquired by Motorola in 1998, and subsequently Google in 2011), and Borland, founded in 1982 (acquired by Micro Focus in 2009). ====Borland (1982–1995): compilers and tools==== Kahn founded Borland in 1982, and was its CEO until 1995. At the time it was a competitor of Microsoft's, and produced programming language compilers and software development tools. Its first product, Turbo Pascal, sold for $49.95 at a time when programming tools cost hundreds or thousands of dollars. Kahn was President, CEO, and Chairman of Borland and, without venture capital, took Borland from no revenues to a US$500 million run-rate. Kahn and the Borland board came to a disagreement on how to focus the company. In January 1995, Kahn was forced by the board to resign from his position as CEO, and he founded Starfish Software. ====Starfish Software (1995–1998): wireless synchronization==== Starfish Software was founded in 1995 by Philippe Kahn as a spin-off from the Simplify business unit from Borland and Kahn's severance from Borland. TrueSync was the first Over-The-Air (OTA) synchronization system. Starfish was successfully acquired by Motorola for US$325 million in 1998. ====LightSurf Technologies (1998–2005): multimedia messaging==== Kahn and his wife Sonia co-founded multimedia messaging company LightSurf Technologies in 1998. LightSurf commercialized Picture-Mail and the camera phone. In 2005, LightSurf was acquired by Verisign for US$300 million. Syniverse Technologies acquired Lightsurf from Verisign in 2009. ====Fullpower Technologies (2005–present): wearable technology==== Fullpower, founded in 2005, provides a patented ecosystem for wearable and Internet of Things sensor-fusion solutions supporting networks of sensors. The company's expertise is sleep monitoring technology using sensors and artificial intelligence. The inspiration behind some of Fullpower's technology stems from Kahn's passion for sailing. During a demanding race requiring sailors to sleep less than an hour every 24-hour period, Kahn began experimenting with biosensors and three-axis linear accelerometers that could detect micromovements and provide meaningful recommendations. Kahn created prototype sleep trackers using biosensors that optimized 26-minute power naps to maximize sleep benefits and sail time. ===First camera phone=== In 1997, Kahn created the first camera phone solution sharing pictures instantly on public networks. The impetus for this invention was the birth of Kahn's daughter. Kahn had been working for almost a year on a web server-based infrastructure for pictures, that he called Picture Mail. At the hospital, while his wife was in labor, Kahn jury-rigged a connection between a mobile phone and a digital camera and sent off photos in real time to the picture messaging infrastructure he had running in his home. Kahn later said \\"I had always wanted to have this all working in time to share my daughter’s birth photo, but I wasn’t sure I was going to make it. It’s always the case that if it weren’t for the last minute, nothing would ever get done.\\" In 2016 Time Magazine included Kahn's first camera phone photo in their list of the 100 most influential photos of all time. In 2017, Subconscious Films created a short film recreating the day that Philippe instantly shared the first camera- phone photo of the birth of his daughter Sophie.1997: The Birth of the Camera Phone, https://vimeo.com/221117048 ===Patents=== Kahn has filed for or has been granted over 230 patents internationally, in fields including artificial intelligence-modeling tools, Internet of Things, motion detection, wearable technology, Global Positioning Systems, telecommunications, telemedicine, and sleep monitoring. ==Gay rights advocacy== Under Kahn's direction, Borland became the first software company to offer domestic partners full benefits and a pioneer for gay rights in Silicon Valley. Kahn was a key speaker at the pivotal gay rights conference on the Apple campus on October 19, 1993. == Personal life == Kahn has four children. The first three – Laura, Estelle and Samuel – are from his first marriage. He later married to Sonia Lee, with whom he has a daughter, Sophie. Sonia co-founded three of Kahn's companies with him: Fullpower Technologies, LightSurf and Starfish Software. ===Sailing and sports=== Philippe Kahn's focus on the environment and the outdoors led him to the sport of sailing. Kahn's sailing team, Pegasus Racing, competes in many world championships each year around the world. An offshore sailor with over 10 trans-Pacific crossings, Kahn holds the Transpac double handed (two crewmember) record from San Francisco to Oahu, Hawaii.Transpacific Yacht Race – The perfect ride? – By Kimball Livingston, 7:40 AM on Thu May 19, 2011 His sailing achievements also include winning the double handed division of the 2009 Transpacific Yacht Race from Los Angeles to Hawaii, and setting the Transpac record at 7 days, 19 hours, beating the previous time of 10 days, 4 hours. Kahn's son Samuel (\\"Shark\\") also took up sailing as a boy. In his teenage years he had several outstanding race wins, including the 2003 Melges 24 Worlds race right after he turned 15. He has competed against his father. ==Lee-Kahn Foundation== Kahn and his wife Sonia run the Lee-Kahn Foundation.

Well-tuned networks can perform up to 10 times faster in some cases. However, blindly following instructions without understanding their real consequences can hurt performance as well. == Network and system characteristics == === Bandwidth-delay product (BDP) === Bandwidth-delay product (BDP) is a term primarily used in conjunction with TCP to refer to the number of bytes necessary to fill a TCP \\"path\\", i.e. it is equal to the maximum number of simultaneous bits in transit between the transmitter and the receiver. High performance networks have very large BDPs. To give a practical example, two nodes communicating over a geostationary satellite link with a round-trip delay time (or round-trip time, RTT) of 0.5 seconds and a bandwidth of 10 Gbit/s can have up to 0.5×1010 bits, i.e., 5 Gbit = 625 MB of unacknowledged data in flight. Despite having much lower latencies than satellite links, even terrestrial fiber links can have very high BDPs because their link capacity is so large. Operating systems and protocols designed as recently as a few years ago when networks were slower were tuned for BDPs of orders of magnitude smaller, with implications for limited achievable performance. === Buffers === The original TCP configurations supported TCP receive window size buffers of up to 65,535 (64 KiB - 1) bytes, which was adequate for slow links or links with small RTTs. Larger buffers are required by the high performance options described below. Buffering is used throughout high performance network systems to handle delays in the system. In general, buffer size will need to be scaled proportionally to the amount of data \\"in flight\\" at any time. For very high performance applications that are not sensitive to network delays, it is possible to interpose large end to end buffering delays by putting in intermediate data storage points in an end to end system, and then to use automated and scheduled non-real-time data transfers to get the data to their final endpoints. == TCP speed limits == Maximum achievable throughput for a single TCP connection is determined by different factors. One trivial limitation is the maximum bandwidth of the slowest link in the path. But there are also other, less obvious limits for TCP throughput. Bit errors can create a limitation for the connection as well as RTT. === Window size === In computer networking, RWIN (TCP Receive Window) is the amount of data that a computer can accept without acknowledging the sender. If the sender has not received acknowledgement for the first packet it sent, it will stop and wait and if this wait exceeds a certain limit, it may even retransmit. This is how TCP achieves reliable data transmission. Even if there is no packet loss in the network, windowing can limit throughput. Because TCP transmits data up to the window size before waiting for the acknowledgements, the full bandwidth of the network may not always get used. The limitation caused by window size can be calculated as follows: \\\\mathrm{Throughput} \\\\le \\\\frac {\\\\mathrm{RWIN}} {\\\\mathrm{RTT}} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! where RWIN is the TCP Receive Window and RTT is the round-trip time for the path. At any given time, the window advertised by the receive side of TCP corresponds to the amount of free receive memory it has allocated for this connection. Otherwise it would risk dropping received packets due to lack of space. The sending side should also allocate the same amount of memory as the receive side for good performance. That is because, even after data has been sent on the network, the sending side must hold it in memory until it has been acknowledged as successfully received, just in case it would have to be retransmitted. If the receiver is far away, acknowledgments will take a long time to arrive. If the send memory is small, it can saturate and block emission. A simple computation gives the same optimal send memory size as for the receive memory size given above. === Packet loss === When packet loss occurs in the network, an additional limit is imposed on the connection. In the case of light to moderate packet loss when the TCP rate is limited by the congestion avoidance algorithm, the limit can be calculated according to the formula (Mathis, et al.): \\\\mathrm{Throughput} \\\\le \\\\frac {\\\\mathrm{MSS}} {\\\\mathrm{RTT} \\\\sqrt{ P_{\\\\mathrm{loss} }}} where MSS is the maximum segment size and Ploss is the probability of packet loss. If packet loss is so rare that the TCP window becomes regularly fully extended, this formula doesn't apply. ==TCP options for high performance== A number of extensions have been made to TCP over the years to increase its performance over fast high-RTT links (\\"long fat networks\\" or LFNs). TCP timestamps (RFC 1323) play a double role: they avoid ambiguities due to the 32-bit sequence number field wrapping around, and they allow more precise RTT estimation in the presence of multiple losses per RTT. With those improvements, it becomes reasonable to increase the TCP window beyond 64 kB, which can be done using the window scaling option (RFC 1323). The TCP selective acknowledgment option (SACK, RFC 2018) allows a TCP receiver to precisely inform the TCP sender about which segments have been lost. This increases performance on high-RTT links, when multiple losses per window are possible. Path MTU Discovery avoids the need for in-network fragmentation, increasing the performance in the presence of packet loss. == See also == * Bufferbloat * Explicit Congestion Notification == References == == External links == * RFC 1323 - TCP Extensions for High Performance * RFC 2018 - TCP Selective Acknowledgment Options * RFC 2582 - The NewReno Modification to TCP's Fast Recovery Algorithm * RFC 2488 - Enhancing TCP Over Satellite Channels using Standard Mechanisms * RFC 2883 - An Extension to the Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) Option for TCP * RFC 3517 - A Conservative Selective Acknowledgment-based Loss Recovery Algorithm for TCP * RFC 4138 - Forward RTO-Recovery (F-RTO): An Algorithm for Detecting Spurious Retransmission Timeouts with TCP and the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) * TCP Tuning Guide, ESnet * The Cable Guy: TCP Receive Window Auto- Tuning * The Web100 Data Bandwidth Testing * DrTCP - a utility for Microsoft Windows (prior to Vista) which can quickly alter TCP performance parameters in the registry. * Information on 'Tweaking' your TCP stack, Broadband Reports * TCP/IP Analyzer, speedguide.net * NTTTCP Network Performance Test Tool, Microsoft Windows Server Performance Team Blog * Best Practices for TCP Optimization - ExtraHop Tuning Category:Network performance ","title":"TCP tuning"},{"id":"2584137","text":"Antonio Carrillo Flores (June 23, 1909 – March 20, 1986) was a Mexican statesman, born in Mexico City.

It was designed by Harvey Gordon in 1857, two years before Oregon was admitted to the Union. The seal was preceded by the Salmon Seal of the Provisional Government and the Seal of the Oregon Territory. The state seal is mandated by Article VI of the Oregon Constitution. ==History== historical coat of arms (illustrated, 1876) The first seal for Oregon was during the Provisional Government that ran from 1843 to 1849. That government used the Salmon Seal, a round seal featuring three sheaves of grain and a single salmon.Horner, John B. (1919). Oregon: Her History, Her Great Men, Her Literature. The J.K. Gill Co.: Portland. p. 96, 127, 174. The salmon was at the bottom, with Oregon along the top. The salmon was designed to symbolize the fishing industry and the grain to represent agriculture. Designed to be neutral concerning the Oregon Question and whether the U.S. or Britain would ultimately control the region, the seal was used until the Oregon Territory was created and the territorial government arrived in 1849. With the arrival of Governor Joseph Lane in 1849 the territorial government took control of the region. That year the government adopted a new seal featuring a motto and a variety of motifs. In the center was a sailing vessel used to represent commerce, and above that was a beaver to symbolize the fur trade that was prominent in Oregon's early recorded history. On the left of the ship was a Native American and on the right an eagle. Above the beaver on a banner was the Latin motto, Alis Volat Propriis, translated as \\"She flies with her own wings\\". Along the perimeter were five stars at the bottom and Seal of the Territory of Oregon on the top. In 1857, the Oregon Constitutional Convention was held in the capital of Salem where the delegates drafted a constitution to prepare for statehood and adopted a new seal to be used once statehood was achieved. The convention appointed Benjamin F. Burch, LaFayette Grover, and James K. Kelly to design a new seal.Corning, Howard M. (1989). Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 233. A proposal for a seal from Harvey Gordon was used with the addition of an elk added by the committee. Usage began after Oregon became the 33rd state on February 14, 1859, and the number of stars was increased to 33 from the original 32 by the Oregon Legislative Assembly (Minnesota became a state in 1858). == Design == Flag of Oregon (obverse) Whereas the existence of an Oregon state seal is written into Oregon's state constitution, the design of the seal itself is dictated by Oregon Revised Statute (ORS) chapter 186. The statutes list two laws pertaining to design and usage of the seal. According to ORS 186.020, the seal consists of an outer ring with the text \\"State of Oregon\\", \\"1859\\". The inner circle contains an American eagle atop a shield. The shield depicts mountains, an elk, a covered wagon, and the Pacific Ocean. In the ocean, a British man- of-war is departing and an American steamer is arriving, symbolizing the end of British rule in the Oregon Country.

He was known as an author of books that draw upon African mythology, traditional Zulu folklore, extraterrestrial encounters and his own personal encounters. His last work was a graphic novel called the Tree of Life Trilogy based on his writings of his most famous book, Indaba my Children. In 2018 he was honoured with an USIBA award presented by the South African Department of Arts and Culture, for his work in Indigenous Wisdom. Credo called himself a sanusi (common spelling isanuse) which is a type of Zulu diviner or sangoma. The term stems from a more historic time and is not widely used today, even in a traditional setting. Credo lived with his wife Virginia in Kuruman, where they ran a hospice clinic. ==Early life== His father was a widower with three surviving children when he met his mother. His father was a builder and a Christian and his mother was a young Zulu girl. Caught between Catholic missionaries on one hand, and a stubborn old Zulu warrior, Credo Mutwa's maternal grandfather, his parents had no choice but to separate. Credo was born out of wedlock, which caused a great scandal in the village and his mother was thrown out by her father. Later he was taken in by one of his aunts.Credo Mutwa biography. He was subsequently raised by his father's brother and was taken to the South Coast of Natal (present day KwaZulu-Natal), near the northern bank of the Mkomazi River. He did not attend school until he was 14 years old. In 1935 his father found a building job in the old Transvaal province and the whole family relocated to where he was building. After falling severely ill, he was taken back to KwaZulu-Natal by his uncle. Where modern medicine had failed, his grandfather, a man whom his father despised as a heathen and demon worshipper, helped him back to health. At this point, Credo began to question many of the things about his people the missionaries would have them believe. \\"Were we Africans really a race of primitives who possessed no knowledge at all before the white man came to Africa?\\" he asked himself. His grandfather instilled in him the belief that his illness was a sacred calling that he was to become a sangoma, a healer. He underwent thwasa (sangoma training and initiation) with his grandfather and mother's sister, a young sangoma named Mynah. ==Kwa-Khaya Lendaba cultural village== Ngungunyane on the left and King Shaka on the right.Initiation area of the Kwa-Khaya Lendaba Cultural village in Soweto In 1974, Credo obtained a piece of land on the Oppenheimer gardens in Soweto in order to create an African cultural village to preserve cultural heritage and his own teachings. He created traditional dwellings imaginatively representing building patterns from across Africa, while human and mythological figures brought to life African folk-lore, beliefs and traditions as seen through his artistic vision. At the time, as the locals were steeped in Christianity, they were suspicious of the cultural village. Credo believed that the great unrest in Johannesburg and the popularisation of communism in the black struggle drew Africans away from their traditional roots. Unlike most political activists, he actually supported a separation between white and black in order to preserve black traditional tribal customs and way of life. In 1976, students partially burnt down the cultural village after he was misquoted on Afrikaans radio, as they saw the village promoting tribalism and separate development. Parts of the village was burnt again in the mid-1980s during a strike against the West Rand city council. Sculpture of King Khandakhulu discussing his sexually transmitted infection with his gods Following the murder of his son by black political \\"activists\\" and the second burning of his village, Credo moved away from Soweto and developed a cultural tourist village in Lotlamoreng, Mahikeng, (known at that time as Bophuthatswana). Here he supervised the building of small cultural villages, each representing the traditional cultures of the main South African tribal peoples. The Kwa-Khaya Lendaba cultural village in Soweto is currently being restored and is still open to the public free of charge. Tour guides are available from the caretaker of the village. ===Prophetic Sculptures=== Although many of the sculptures at Kwa-Khaya Lendaba were unfamiliar to the Africans they were meant to represent, a number of them have been said to be prophetic in nature. Most notably, were claims of predicting the coming of HIV/AIDS to South Africa. This was seen in his fictional sculptures of King Khandakhulu, who had 200 wives. He couldn't satisfy them all sexually, and so they went out and satisfied themselves elsewhere, which led to them all contracting incurable sexually transmitted infections. The sores on King Khandakhulu's penis resemble the AIDS ribbon. These sculptures were created in 1979, three years before scientists uncovered the human immunodeficiency virus. Claims of his other predictions include the destruction of World Trade Centres in the September 11 attacks, Chris Hani's assassination, and the ousting of president Thabo Mbeki, among others. ==Views on HIV/AIDS== Mutwa was an active and vocal advocate in the use of traditional African medicines for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer and tuberculosis. He created a trust called the Vulinda Trust in 1999 to preserve traditional knowledge and to promote the use of these traditional medicines. The primary focus of his research had been on a South African plant called unwele in Zulu (Sutherlandia frutescens). Unwele is traditionally used as a wellbeing tonic, and has also demonstrated anticancer activity through in vitro studies. Research of the efficacy of Sutherlandia frutescens in the treatment of HIV/AIDS is ongoing and phase IIb trials are being conducted at the South African Herbal Science and Medicine Institute (SAHSMI). ==\\"Reptilian agenda\\"== Mutwa had allied himself with David Icke's theory of a \\"reptilian agenda\\" – i.e. that \\"a reptilian race\\" evolved on earth and not of alien origin, has controlled the world for thousands of years\\".

It spanned from Spain eastward across Eurasia to Canada and from the arctic islands southward to China. It had a cold, dry climate; the vegetation was dominated by palatable high-productivity grasses, herbs and willow shrubs, and the animal biomass was dominated by bison, horses, and woolly mammoth. This ecosystem covered wide areas of the northern part of the globe, thrived for approximately 100,000 years without major changes, and then suddenly became all but extinct about 12,000 years ago. == Naming == At the end of the 19th century, Alfred Nehring (1890) and Jan Czerski (Iwan Dementjewitsch Chersky, 1891) proposed that during the last glacial period a major part of northern Europe had been populated by large herbivores and that a steppe climate had prevailed there. In 1982, the scientist R. Dale Guthrie coined the term \\"mammoth steppe\\" for this paleoregion. == Origin of the mammoth steppe == The last glacial period, commonly referred to as the 'Ice Age', spanned from 126,000 YBP–11,700 YBP and was the most recent glacial period within the current ice age which occurred during the last years of the Pleistocene epoch. This arctic environment was very cold and dry and probably dusty, resembling mountaintop environments, and was very different from today's swampy tundra. It reached its peak during the last glacial maximum, when ice sheets commenced advancing from 33,000 years BP and reached their maximum positions 26,500 years BP. Deglaciation commenced in the Northern Hemisphere approximately 19,000 years BP, and in Antarctica approximately 14,500 years BP, which is consistent with evidence that it was the primary source for an abrupt rise in the sea level at that time. During the peak of the last glacial maximum, a vast mammoth steppe stretched from the Iberian Peninsula across Eurasia and over the Bering land bridge into Alaska and the Yukon where it was stopped by the Wisconsin glaciation. This land bridge existed because more of the planet's water was locked up in ice than now and therefore the sea levels were lower. When the sea levels began to rise this bridge was inundated around 11,000 years BP. During glacial periods, there is clear evidence for intense aridity due to water being held in glaciers and their associated effects on climate. The mammoth steppe was like a huge 'inner court' that was surrounded on all sides by moisture-blocking features: massive continental glaciers, high mountains, and frozen seas. These kept rainfall low and created more days with clear skies than are seen today, which increased evaporation in the summer leading to aridity, and radiation of warmth from the ground into the black night sky in the winter leading to cold. This is thought to have been caused by seven factors: #The driving force for the core Asian steppe was an enormous and stable high-pressure system north of the Tibetan Plateau. #Deflection of the larger portion of the Gulf Stream southward, past southern Spain onto the coast of Africa, reduced temperatures (hence moisture and cloud cover) that the North Atlantic Current brings to Western Europe. #Growth of the Scandinavian ice sheet created a barrier to North Atlantic moisture. #Icing over of the North Atlantic sea surface with reduced flow of moisture from the east. #The winter (January) storm track seems to have swept across Eurasia on this axis. #Lowered sea levels exposed a large continental shelf to the north and east producing a vast northern plain which increased the size of the continent to the north. #North American glaciers shielded interior Alaska and the Yukon Territory from moisture flow. These physical barriers to moisture flow created a vast arid basin or protected 'inner court' spanning parts of three continents. == Environment (or Biota) == Climatic suitability for the woolly mammoths in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. Increasing intensities of red represent increasing suitability of the climate and increasing intensities of green represent decreasing suitability. Black points are the records of mammoth presence for each of the periods. Black lines represent the northern limit of modern humans and black dotted lines indicate uncertainty in the limit of modern humans (D. Nogués-Bravo et al. 2008). Animal biomass and plant productivity of the mammoth steppe were similar to today's African savannah. There is no comparison to it today. === Plants === The paleo- environment changed across time, a proposal that is supported from mammoth dung samples found in northern Yakutia. During Pleniglacial interstadials, alder, birch, and pine trees survived in northern Siberia, however during the Last Glacial Maximum only a treeless steppe vegetation existed. At the onset of the Late Glacial Interstadial (15,000–11,000 BP), global warming resulted in shrub and dwarf birch in northeastern Siberia, which was then colonized by open woodland with birch and spruce during the Younger Dryas (12,900–11,700 YBP). By the Holocene (10,000 YBP), patches of closed larch and pine forests developed. Past researchers had once assumed that the mammoth steppe was very unproductive because they had assumed that its soils had a very low carbon content; however, these soils (yedoma) were preserved in the permafrost of Siberia and Alaska and are the largest reservoir of organic carbon known. It was a highly productive environment. The vegetation was dominated by palatable high-productivity grasses, herbs and willow shrubs. Herbs were far more widespread than they are today, and were the main food source of the large plant eating mammals. === Animals === The mammoth steppe was dominated in biomass by bison, horse, and the woolly mammoth, and was the center for the evolution of the Pleistocene woolly fauna. Notable carnivores found across the whole range of the mammoth steppe included Panthera spelaea, the wolf Canis lupus and the brown bear Ursus arctos. While the cave hyena was part of mammoth steppe faunas in Europe, it did not extend into the core high latitude north asian range of the biome. On Wrangel Island, the remains of woolly mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, horse, bison and musk ox have been found. Reindeer and small animal remains do not preserve, but reindeer excrement has been found in sediment. In the most arid regions of the mammoth steppe that were to the south of Central Siberia and Mongolia, woolly rhinoceros were common but woolly mammoths were rare. Reindeer live in the far north of Mongolia today and historically their southern boundary passed through Germany and along the steppes of eastern Europe, indicating they once covered much of the mammoth steppe. Mammoths survived on the Taimyr Peninsula until the Holocene. A small population of mammoths survived on St. Paul Island, Alaska, up until 3750 BC, and the small mammoths of Wrangel Island survived until 1650 BC. Bison in Alaska and the Yukon, and horses and muskox in northern Siberia, have survived the loss of the mammoth steppe. One study has proposed that a change of suitable climate caused a significant drop in the mammoth population size, which made them vulnerable to hunting from expanding human populations. The coincidence of both of these impacts in the Holocene most likely set the place and time for the extinction of the woolly mammoth. == Decline of the mammoth steppe == The mammoth steppe had a cold, dry climate. During the past interglacial warmings, forests of trees and shrubs expanded northward into the mammoth steppe, when northern Siberia, Alaska and the Yukon (Beringia) would have formed a mammoth steppe refugium. When the planet grew colder again, the mammoth steppe expanded. This ecosystem covered wide areas of the northern part of the globe, thrived for approximately 100,000 years without major changes, and then suddenly became extinct about 12,000 years ago. There are two theories about the decline of the mammoth steppe. === Climate change === The Climatic Hypothesis assumes that the vast mammoth ecosystem could have only existed within a certain range of climatic parameters. At the beginning of the Holocene 10,000 years ago, mossy forests, tundra, lakes and wetlands displaced mammoth steppe. It has been assumed that in contrast to other previous interglacials the cold dry climate switched to a warmer wetter climate that, in turn, caused the disappearance of the grasslands and their dependent megafauna. The extinct steppe bison (Bison priscus) survived across the northern region of central eastern Siberia until 8000 years ago. A study of the frozen mummy of a steppe bison found in northern Yakutia, Russia indicated that it was a pasture grazer in a habitat that was becoming dominated by shrub and tundra vegetation. Higher temperature and rainfall led to a decrease in its previous habitat during the early Holocene, and this led to population fragmentation followed by extinction. In 2017 a study looked at the environmental conditions across Europe, Siberia and the Americas from 25,000–10,000 YBP. The study found that prolonged warming events leading to deglaciation and maximum rainfall occurred just prior to the transformation of the rangelands that supported megaherbivores into widespread wetlands that supported herbivore-resistant plants. The study proposes that moisture-driven environmental change led to the megafaunal extinctions, and that Africa's trans-equatorial position allowed rangeland to continue to exist between the deserts and the central forests; therefore fewer megafauna species became extinct there. === Human predation === The Ecosystem Hypothesis assumes that the vast mammoth ecosystem extended over a range of many regional climates and was not affected by climate fluctuations. Its highly productive grasslands were maintained by animals trampling any mosses and shrubs, and actively transpiring grasses and herbs dominated. At the beginning of the Holocene the rise in precipitation was accompanied by increased temperature, and so its climatic aridity did not change substantially. As a result of human hunting, the decreasing density of the animals was not enough to maintain the grasslands, leading to an increase in forests, shrubs and mosses with further animal reduction due to loss of feed. The mammoth continued to exist on isolated Wrangel Island until a few thousand years ago, and some of the other megafauna from that time still exist today, which indicates that something other than climate change was responsible for megafaunal extinctions. Remains of mammoth that had been hunted by humans 45,000 YBP have been found at Yenisei Bay in the central Siberian Arctic. Two other sites in the Maksunuokha River valley to the south of the Shirokostan Peninsula, northeast Siberia, dated between 14,900 and 13,600 years ago showed the remains of mammoth hunting and the production of micro-blades similar to those found in northwest North America, suggesting a cultural connection. == Last remnants == Ubsunur Hollow Biosphere Reserve located on the border of Mongolia and the Republic of Tuva is one of the last remnants of the mammoth steppe During the Holocene, the arid-adapted species became extinct or were reduced to minor habitats. Cold and dry conditions similar to the last glacial period are found today in the eastern Altai-Sayan mountains of Central Eurasia, with no significant changes occurring between the cold phase of the Pleistocene and the Holocene. Recent paleo-biome reconstruction and pollen analysis suggest that some present-day Altai-Sayan areas could be considered the closest analogy to the mammoth steppe environment. The environment of this region is considered to have been stable for the past 40,000 years. The Eastern part of the Altai- Sayan region forms a Last Glacial refugium. In both the Last Glacial and modern times, the eastern Altai-Sayan region has supported large herbivore and predator species adapted to the steppe, desert and alpine biomes where these biomes have not been separated by forest belts. None of the surviving Pleistocene mammals live in temperate forest, taiga, or tundra biomes. The areas of Ukok-Sailiugem in the southern Altai Republic, and Khar Us Nuur and Uvs Nuur (Ubsunur Hollow) in western Mongolia, have supported reindeer and saiga antelope since the glacial period. == See also == *Pleistocene megafauna *Pleistocene Park – a project to restore a small part of what once was the mammoth steppe. *Quaternary extinction event == References == Category:Tundra Category:Montane grasslands and shrublands Category:Ecoregions Category:Ice ages Category:Last Glacial Maximum ","title":"Mammoth steppe"},{"id":"2584201","text":"Lake Edward (larger) and Lake George (smaller) connected by the Kazinga Channel Hippos at Kazinga Channel Fishermen at the Kazinga Channel The Kazinga Channel in Uganda is a wide, long natural channel that links Lake Edward and Lake George, and a dominant feature of Queen Elizabeth National Park.

Telgte is also known for its Nativity Museum (Krippenmuseum) and its fair (Mariä-Geburts- Markt). Nobel-winner Günter Grass's novel The Meeting at Telgte (Das Treffen in Telgte) is set in Telgte during the negotiations of the Peace of Westphalia which ended the Thirty Years' War. ==Politics== The city of Telgte consists of three quarters: Telgte, Westbevern and Westbevern Vadrup. Until the 1970s Westbevern was an independently administered village that consisted of Vadrup and Brock (Brock was incorporated into Ostbevern in a communal reform). Through Westbevern flows the river Bever, a tributary of the Ems. An attractive tourist destination is Haus Langen, with a former double mill at the Bever. ===International relations=== Telgte is twinned with:= * 25px Polanica-Zdrój, Poland * 25px Stupino, Russia * 25px Tomball, United States ===Mayors since 1946=== { align=left border=0 - bgcolor=#FFFFFF  colspan=6 align=center  - bgcolor=#CCDDEE - bgcolor=#DDEEFF 1946–1947Wilhelm Lütke-Schwienhorst, CDU - bgcolor=#DDEEFF 1947–1949Ferdinand Busch, CDU - bgcolor=#DDEEFF 1949–1951Friedrich Sube, Zentrum - bgcolor=#DDEEFF 1951–1952Heinrich Decker, CDU - bgcolor=#DDEEFF 1952–1964Bernhard Rumphorst, CDU - bgcolor=#DDEEFF 1964–1967Wilhelm Hotte, CDU - bgcolor=#DDEEFF 1967–1969Friedrich Koppernagel, CDU - bgcolor=#DDEEFF 1969–1975Günter Karthaus, CDU - bgcolor=#DDEEFF 1975–1978Albert Bruens, CDU - bgcolor=#DDEEFF 1978–1984Günter Karthaus, CDU - bgcolor=#DDEEFF 1984–1996Reinhold Hotte, CDU - bgcolor=#DDEEFF 1996–1999 Klaus Beck, SPD - bgcolor=#DDEEFF 1999–2004Ulrich Roenigh, CDU - bgcolor=#DDEEFF 2004–2009Dr. Dietrich Meendermann, CDU - bgcolor=#DDEEFF since 2010Wolfgang Pieper, BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN - bgcolor=#DDEEFF } ===Population trend=== { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\"  valign=\\"top\\"  { !

Pietro Pitati (in Latin, Petrus Pitatus) (?-fl. ca. 1550) was an Italian astronomer and mathematician. Bernardino Baldi, in his Cronica de matematici (1707) calls Pitati a noble Veronese who was trained in mathematics by a Benedictine friar named Innocentio da Novara.Table of contents for Baldi, Cronica de matematici, 1707 . It is known that he was the author of several astronomical works and almanacs. His Paschales atque nouiluniorum mensurni canones. De varia paschalis solemnitatis obseruatione...De Hebraica anni quantitate...Calendarium nouum cum noua aurei numeri positione, ortu quoque, & occasu stellarum fixarum (Venice, March 1537) is one of many sixteenth century attempts to reform the calendar, and establish, among other things, the correct day of Easter. This was his first work.This entry (in a rare-books catalogue) suggests that a similar treatise was presented to Pope Pius IV in 1550, but \\"never published\\". On the other hand, Pitati's Compendium (next item described in the main article) contained material bearing on calendar reform and was published in more than one edition, it was said by J D North (1983, cited below) to have been written 1539; the sources appear to show some uncertainty or inconsistency about identifying versions of Pitati's writings. Pitati also wrote another book bearing on the length of the solar and lunar year, the fixed stars, and calendar reform, entitled: Compendium . . . super annua solaris atque lunaris anni quantitate Paschalis item solennitatis juxta veteres ecclesiae canones recognitione Romanique calendarii instauratione deque vero Passionis Dominicae die ortu quoque et occasu stellarum fixarum, in tres divisum Tractatus.This 'Compendium' of Pitati is cited by J D North (1983, cited below) as written 1539 and published at Verona (1564); but Lynn Thorndike wrote that it appeared at Verona, 1560, with a revised edition published at Basel in 1568 (Lynn Thorndike, 'A history of magic and experimental science: vol.V, the sixteenth century', New York, 1941, Columbia University Press, at page 265). Pitati's proposal for calendar reform \\"pleaded for the rule whereby three out of four centennial years be ordinary (non leap- years). This is [now] the Gregorian rule.\\"J D North, \\"The Western Calendar - 'Intolerabilis, Horribilis, et Derisibilis': Four Centuries of Discontent\\", pages 75-113 in G.V. Coyne (ed.), The Gregorian Reform of the Calendar: Proceedings of the Vatican conference to commemorate its 400th anniversary. (Vatican City: Specola Vaticana), 1983, at page 101. Pitati compiled ephemerides, to which he added supplements over the years, such as Almanach nouum...Superadditis annis quinque supra ... Ephemeridas 1551. ad futurum Christi annum 1556. Isagogica in coelestem Astronomicam disciplinam ... Tractatus tres perbreues de Electionibus, Reuolutionibus annorum, & mutatione aeris. Item horariae tabulae per altitudinem solis in die, ac stellarum in nocte ad medium sexti climatis.(Venice, 1542). The lunar crater Pitatus is named after him. The mathematician and astronomer Giovanni Padovani was a student of Pitati. ==References== ==Sources== * Euromusicology * Polybiblio * Cronica de Matematici Category:1550 deaths Category:People from Verona Category:Italian astronomers Category:16th-century Italian mathematicians Category:Italian Roman Catholics Category:16th-century astronomers Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Gregorian calendar ","title":"Pietro Pitati"},{"id":"2584234","text":"Altmann or Altman may refer to: ==People== * Altman (surname) * Altmann (surname) * Altmann of Passau, bishop (1020–1091) ==Places== * Altmann (mountain), a summit of the Appenzell Alps * Altman, Colorado, a ghost town * Altman, West Virginia ==Companies== * Altman (automobile), Ohio-based manufacturer * Altmann (1905 automobile), an early German automobile * Altman Lighting Co., American lighting manufacturer ==Other uses== * Republic of Austria v.

At 39, he was the nation's youngest Premier. He was a strong advocate of what he called \\"pragmatic socialism\\" and believed that agricultural reform was crucial to the ultimate success of Nigeria. ==Life== Michael Okpara, an Ohuhu-Igbo, was born on December 25, 1920 at Umuegwu Okpuala, Ohuhu, in the area of Umuahia, in the present day Abia State of Nigeria. Although he was the son of a labourer, he was able to attend mission schools and later went to Uzuakoli Methodist College, where he won a scholarship to study medicine at Yaba Higher College, Lagos. Completing his medical studies at the Nigerian School of Medicine, he worked briefly as a government medical officer before returning to Umuahia to set up a private practice. While involved in his practice, he developed an interest in the Zikist Movement (named after Nnamdi Azikiwe), a militant wing of the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC). After rioting workers were shot by police at the Enugu coal mines in 1949, Okpara was arrested for his alleged complicity in inciting the riot, though he was soon released. After the granting of internal self-rule in 1952, he was elected into the Eastern Nigerian House of Assembly on the NCNC platform. Between 1952 and 1959 he held various Cabinet positions in Eastern Nigeria, ranging from Minister of Health to Minister of Agriculture and Production. In 1953, when NCNC legislators revolted against the party leadership, he remained loyal and joined forces with Azikiwe. In November 1960, when Azikiwe left active politics to become Nigeria's first African Governor-General, Okpara was elected leader of the NCNC. His outspoken manner led to a severe strain in relations between his party and the ruling Northern People's Congress. ===After independence=== Okpara was the leader of the NCNC and Premier of Eastern Nigeria during the First Republic from 1959 to 1966. Although he was one of the politicians detained soon after the military coup of January, 1966, he survived the army revolt, in which the other two premiers were killed. A strong advocate of what he termed \\"pragmatic socialism\\", he believed that Nigeria's salvation depended on a revolution in agriculture. To this end, he acquired and managed a large farm in his hometown, called Umuegwu Okpuala Mixed Farms, which inspired many Eastern Nigerian leaders to follow suit. He also championed the educational and infrastructural development of Eastern Nigeria. He never owned a house of his own while he was in government. When the Nigerian Civil War ended, he went into exile in Ireland. Before his return from exile in 1979, his close associates and beneficiaries took up a collection to build him a house in his village, Umuegwu. Okpara died on 17 December 1984. ===Legacy=== He is a member of the Royal Academy of Physicians of Great Britain. Michael Okpara Way, in Abuja is named after him, as is the Michael Okpara University of Agriculture in Umudike, Okpara Square in Enugu; Michael Okpara College of Agriculture in Imo State (since renamed the Imo State Polytechnic). He received the award of GCON (Grand Commander of the Order of the Niger), one of Nigeria's highest honours, in 1964. There is a statue of him in Enugu, Enugu State, and also another statue of him in Umuahia, the capital of the present day Abia State. ==References== *Portrait of a Leader by H. K. Offonry.

Revivo liked that the club had no senior team and he would be a free agent once he reached 18. When he turned 19, Giora Spiegel brought him to Bnei Yehuda after both Hapoel Kfar Saba and Maccabi Petah Tikva turned him down. Revivo spent three seasons at Bnei Yehuda before transferring to city rivals, Hapoel. When Reuven Atar requested to leave Maccabi Haifa for Hapoel Haifa, Ya'akov Shahar was quick to sign a replacement. He brought in Revivo, who was happy to join Haifa since he believed that from there he could get to a European club. In his first season with Haifa, Revivo led the league (along with Amir Turgeman) with 17 goals. In his second season, he wanted to move from the left side of the midfield to the center of the pitch. Then club manager, Giora Spiegel, was reluctant but in order to avoid a fight with his star, he released Alon Mizrahi. Revivo paid off dividends and was once again the league leading goal scorer. Haifa was quick to sell their star to Spanish club, Celta de Vigo. Revivo became a starter at Celta Vigo. In October 1996, shortly after Revivo joined the club, he made headlines because of the club's league clash on Yom Kippur. Revivo desperately wanted to avoid the match that fell on the Jewish holiday. The club was able to move the match fixture ahead by a couple of hours and Revivo played for as long he could before being brought off in the second half to hurry home for the holiday. He played in Spain a few successful years, and was very popular in Spain. He was named co- winner of the 1998 Israel Sports Figure of the Year Award. His first two years with Fenerbahçe were a success, and he led the team to the 2001 Turkish championship, but then he lost the attention of the club's management after other famous foreign players were brought in. He decided to leave, and caused much controversy with his move to Istanbul rivals Galatasaray. His spell at Galatasaray only lasted a year before he left Turkey. After his return to Israel, he signed for Israel's F.C. Ashdod, but after 12 games he retired from football. He is now a successful businessman and one of the former owners of F.C. Ashdod. ===Israeli national team === Revivo made his first appearance for a national side on December 18, 1990, playing with the Israel national under-18 football team against their Portuguese counterparts at the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon. Revivo played in the midfield along with Avi Nimni and Eyal Berkovic who he would end up playing with most of his national team career. A year and a half later, Revivo debuted with the Israel national under-21 football team on May 13, 1992 in a friendly against their Turkish counterparts at Herzliya Municipal Stadium in Israel. He scored on his debut and added another four goals in nine appearances, including a brace in a 1994 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualifier against Austria. Six months after making his under-21 debut, he represented the full side in a 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifier at Ramat Gan Stadium against Sweden. Revivo became a fixture in the national team lineup under Shlomo Scharf and competed for Israel in three FIFA World Cup qualifying campaigns and UEFA European Football Championship qualifying campaigns in addition to 26 friendly matches. ==Honours== ===Club=== ;Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv * Toto Cup: 1991–92 ;Maccabi Haifa * State Cup: 1994–95 ;Fenerbahçe * Süper Lig: 2000–01 ;Galatasaray * Süper Lig: Runner up 2002–03 ====Individual==== * Liga Leumit Leading scorer: 1994–95, 1995–96 * Best Player: 1994–95, 1995–96Israel - Player of the Year *Member of the Israeli Football Hall of Fame ==See also== *Sports in Israel *List of select Jewish football (association; soccer) players ==References== * ==External links== * * * Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Israeli Jews Category:Jewish footballers Category:Israeli footballers Category:Israeli expatriate sportspeople in Spain Category:Israeli expatriate sportspeople in Turkey Category:Association football wingers Category:Israel international footballers Category:Israeli expatriate footballers Category:Israeli businesspeople Category:Hapoel Ashdod F.C. players Category:Gadna Tel Aviv Yehuda F.C. players Category:Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv F.C. players Category:Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C. players Category:Maccabi Haifa F.C. players Category:RC Celta de Vigo players Category:La Liga players Category:Fenerbahçe S.K. footballers Category:Galatasaray S.K. footballers Category:Football players from Ashdod Category:F.C.

The magazine was reborn and issued its next issue on 28 February 2017.Magazine gay tetu revient kiosque ==History== Published since 1995, co-founded by Didier Lestrade and Pascal Loubet, and historically directed by Pierre Bergé, Têtu was started following the demise of Gai Pied magazine (published between 1979 and 1992). Pierre Bergé sold the magazine in January 2013 and since then it has been owned by Jean-Jacques Augier. Têtu declared bankruptcy in January 2015 and went into liquidation in July 2015 having made €1.1million ($1.2million) in losses in 2014. In November 2015 a French start-up, Idyls, bought Têtu and it started publishing again online only. ==Overview== The magazine contains interviews on LGBT issues, with politicians, celebrities, writers, dancers and so forth, along with articles and reviews on LGBT-themed books, films, plays or video games. Another section is concerned with LGBT news around the world, country by country. There are also posters, advertisements of brand clothes for men. Additionally, some pages are dedicated to news about AIDS, prevention and treatment. Periodically a free information guide entitled Têtu+ is published about HIV and AIDS. The magazine has also touched upon international cases when coming to LGBTQs public figures of non-French cultures. In October 2012, Tetu have sent reporters to Jordan to do a story on Jordanian LGBT magazine's spokesperson, model Khalid, aka Kali of My.Kali magazine. ==Controversy== In July 2011, Alexis Palisson featured in a topless pose in Têtu wearing a fake moko and holding a taiaha. This caused controversy in New Zealand, with some Maori saying that Palisson was being disrespectful to their culture and that permission should have been sought from a particular iwi as the moko usually represents iwi affiliation. Palisson was eventually forced to apologise for any offence caused and stressed that he respects tattoo traditions. ==References== ==External links== * Official site Category:1995 establishments in France Category:2015 disestablishments in France Category:Cultural magazines Category:French-language magazines Category:LGBT-related magazines published in France Category:Lifestyle magazines Category:Magazines established in 1995 Category:Magazines disestablished in 2015 Category:Magazines reestablished in 2017 Category:Magazines published in Paris ","title":"Têtu"},{"id":"2584287","text":"Raymond George Gosling (15 July 1926 – 18 May 2015) was a British scientist. While a PhD student at King's College, London he worked under the supervision of Rosalind Franklin. Their crystallographic experiments, together with those of Maurice Wilkins of the same laboratory, produced data that helped James Watson and Francis Crick to infer the structure of DNA. ==Early years== He was born in 1926 and attended school in Wembley. He studied physics at University College London from 1944 to 1947 and became a hospital physicist at the King's Fund and Middlesex Hospital between 1947 and 1949 before joining King's College London as a research student, from which he eventually received his PhD. ==Career== ===Work at King's College London and DNA=== When he arrived at King's College London, Gosling was directed by Sir John Randall to work on the problem of the structure of DNA. Randall was convinced that DNA was the material which transmitted the genetic code. Randall assigned him to work on X-ray diffraction with Maurice Wilkins, analysing samples of DNA which they prepared by hydrating and drawing out into thin filaments and photographing in a hydrogen atmosphere. He made the first x-ray diffraction image of crystallized DNA. His comment on this discovery was \\"I must be the first person ever to make genes crystallize\\", although he was probably unaware of the prior work of Florence Bell. After the initial work producing the first x-ray diffraction of DNA, Randall reassigned Gosling to work with Rosalind Franklin, who had been just hired to join King's College in 1951. He did this without consulting with Wilkins, a factor which may have contributed to the animosity between the two.Williams 2019, page 282-283. During the next two years, the pair worked closely together to perfect the technique of X-ray diffraction photography of DNA and obtained at the time the sharpest diffraction images of DNA. They produced the first X-ray diffraction photographs of the \\"wet form B\\" (B-DNA) paracrystalline arrays of highly hydrated DNA. In 1952 Gosling made the best X-ray diffraction image of DNA known as Photo 51. This piece of evidence helped Francis Crick and James D. Watson to decipher the correct chemical structure. Crick, Watson and Wilkins shared the 1962 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine on discoveries of nucleic acid structure. Gosling was the co-author with Franklin of one of the three DNA double helix papers published in Nature in April 1953. Gosling was not recognized by the Nobel Committee and Franklin had died four years before. When Franklin left King's College, Gosling was reassigned back to work with Wilkins, with whom he formally completed his thesis work. After the first Nature article on the x-ray diffraction results leading to the double helix model, he and Franklin (who had by that time left King's College) followed up their DNA x-ray analysis with a second article in Nature.

Gosling went on to lecture in physics at Queen's College, University of St Andrews in Scotland, and then found a long-term position at the University of the West Indies. For a few years he continued with crystallography research, focusing on analysis of the structure of nucleotides, but then shifted toward research in the field of medical physics, working on designing equipment to study and diagnose atherosclerosis. ===Work at Guy's Hospital=== He returned to the UK in 1967 and became Lecturer and Reader at Guy's Hospital Medical School, and Professor and Emeritus Professor in Physics Applied to Medicine from 1984. Here he helped develop the underlying basic medical science and technology for haemodynamic doppler ultrasound vascular assessment in the Non Invasive Angiology Group, and set up the clinical Ultrasonic Angiology Unit. \\\\- Abstract Gosling served on numerous committees of the University of London, notably relating to radiological science, and retained an active professional involvement in medical physics almost to the end of his life. == Personal background == Gosling and his wife Mary had four sons, the eldest of whom is the furniture designer Tim Gosling.

Population: ==History== The settlement of Stupino was first mentioned in 1507. Almost all other villages which have been merged into modern Stupino have been known since at least the beginning of the 16th century and were mainly founded on monastery lands. In 1934, Stupino was merged with the work settlement of Elektrovoz. In 1938, Elektrovoz was granted town status and renamed Stupino. The history of the town is closely linked with the history of the Stupino Metallurgical Company (now known as CMK), which became the town's main industrial enterprise sustaining much of the population. In October 1941, during World War II, the factory was evacuated to Kuybyshev and Kamensk- Uralsky. In February 1942, the factory was returned to Stupino and quickly resumed operation.Official website of CMK. СMK. History. 1941-1945 After the war, Stupino remained partially closed.

He has had a long musical career playing with a large variety of other musicians, particularly Richard Thompson and John Martyn. For four years, between 1964 and 1967, he was a member of Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated, led a trio that included guitarist John McLaughlin, and was a founding member of the British folk-jazz band Pentangle. Since 1987, he has also recorded four solo albums. He converted to Islam in 1990. \\"In 1999 Danny was interviewed for the BBC TV series Faces of Islam in which he discussed becoming a Muslim and his realisation of the fact that whilst he had only converted to Islam in 1990, the Muslim faith had always been within him.\\" ==Biography and career== Thompson was born in Teignmouth, Devon. His father, a miner, joined the Royal Navy at the start of World War II and was lost in action whilst crewing submarines. When Thompson was aged 6, the family moved to London and he was brought up in the working-class area of Battersea. At school he played competitive football and was a junior for Chelsea, the team he has supported ever since. Whilst at school he learnt guitar, mandolin, trumpet and trombone before settling on the upright bass as his instrument of choice. Thompson was a member of the folk-jazz group Pentangle, throughout its first incarnation (1967–1973) and in some of its subsequent versions and reunions. In 1987, Thompson released his debut solo album Whatever to critical acclaim. While he has had his own album releases, Thompson has been predominantly a session musician contributing to other artists' recordings and tours, such as with John Martyn and with Richard Thompson (no relation; e.g. Mirror Blue, The Old Kit Bag, and the concert DVD release Richard Thompson Live in Austin Texas, from the Austin City Limits televised concerts). Danny Thompson lived in Clopton, Suffolk during the late 1970s and early 1980s with his wife Daphne and son Dan (Danny Junior, who went on to be the drummer with Hawkwind (1985–88)) Early in the 1980s he moved back to London. He received a Lifetime achievement award in the 2007 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. In the early 1980s he worked closely with documentary film-maker, Roy Deverell and composed music for two of his award-winning films, Echo of the Wild and A Passion to Protect. The films are about John Aspinall's pioneering work with endangered mammals. ==Partial discography== ===Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated=== *Red Hot from Alex (1964) *Sky High (1966) *Blues Incorporated (1967 - re-issue of Sky High) ===Alexis Korner=== *I Wonder Who (1967) *A New Generation of Blues (1968) ===Pentangle=== *The Pentangle (1968) *Sweet Child (1968) *Basket of Light (1969) *Cruel Sister (1970) *Reflection (1971) *Solomon's Seal (1972) *Open the Door (1985) ===Danny Thompson=== *Whatever (1987) *Whatever Next (1989) *Elemental (1990) *Whatever’s Best (1995) *Danny Thompson & Peter Knight (1995) Resurgence – RES108CD *Connected (2012) ===Danny Thompson, Allan Holdsworth and John Stevens=== *Propensity (2009, recorded 1978) ===Dizrhythmia=== *Dizrhythmia (1988) *Too (2016) ===Richard Thompson and Danny Thompson=== *Live at Crawley (1995) *Industry (1997) ===Jon Thorne & Danny Thompson=== *Watching the Well (2010) ===Others=== Danny Thompson has played on dozens of albums and singles during his career.

There is no one set of laws that apply to the distribution, purchase, or possession of Internet pornography. This means that, for example, even if a pornographer is legally distributing pornography, the person receiving it may not be legally doing so due to local laws. ==Child pornography and the Internet== Child pornography is illegal in most countries with coordinated enforcement by Interpol and policing institutions of various governments, including among others the United States Department of Justice. Even so, the UK based NSPCC said that worldwide an estimated 2% of websites still had not been removed a year after being identified. Recent investigations include Operation Cathedral that resulted in multi-national arrests and 7 convictions as well as uncovering 750,000 images with 1,200 unique identifiable faces being distributed over the web; Operation Amethyst which occurred in the Republic of Ireland; Operation Auxin; Operation Avalanche; Operation Ore based in the United Kingdom; Operation Pin; Operation Predator; the 2004 Ukrainian child pornography raids and the 2008 US child pornography raid. New technology that aids those who produce this material include inexpensive digital cameras and Internet distribution has made it easier than ever before to produce and distribute child pornography. The producers of child pornography try to avoid prosecution by distributing their material across national borders, though this issue is increasingly being addressed with regular arrests of suspects from a number of countries occurring over the last few years. The legal status of simulated or \\"virtual\\" child pornography varies around the world. Simulated child pornography that do not pass the Miller test was banned in the United States in 2003 when the PROTECT Act was signed, it is illegal in the European Union,Eko, L. S. (2006, Jun) Regulation of Online Child Pornography Under European Union and American Law. Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, Dresden International Congress Centre, Dresden, Germany Online Retrieved 2008-04-22 and in Australia its legal status is unclear and, as of 2007, untested in the courts. Child pornography may be simulated by the use of computersVirtueel filmpje geldt ook als porno, AD, March 11, 2008 or adults made to look like children.Paul, B. and Linz, D. (2008). \\"The effects of exposure to virtual child pornography on viewer cognitions and attitudes toward deviant sexual behavior ,\\" Communication Research, 35(1), 3-38 In 2008, it was discovered that the United States authorities will post fake hyperlinks claiming to be child pornography and then raiding, arresting, and prosecuting anyone who was found using the IP address that visited them, even someone whose computer was an open wifi. In 2008, a man in Middlesbrough, UK, was found guilty of downloading \\"child pornography\\" when he downloaded computer generated cartoons.Child porn in cartoon style - man convicted, Sep 26, 2008 by Gareth Lightfoot, Evening Gazette ==Internet pornography laws in various countries== ===United States=== With the exception of child pornography, the legal status of accessing Internet pornography is still somewhat unsettled, though many individual states have indicated that the creation and distribution of adult films and photography are legally listed as prostitution within them. The legality of pornography at the federal level has been traditionally determined by implementing the Miller test. This test dictates that the opinion of the local community on a specific pornographic piece is most important in determining its legality. Thus, if a local community determines a pornographic work to meet its standard for obscenity then it is more likely to be banned. This means that a pornographic magazine that might be legal in California could be illegal in Alabama. This standard on pornographic legality is extremely difficult to uphold for the internet given that the internet contains copious amounts of pornography. It has been argued that if the Miller test were applied to the Internet then, in effect, the community standards for the most conservative community would become the standard for all U.S.-based Web sites. The courts are currently examining this issue. The first attempt to regulate pornography on the Internet was the federal Communications Decency Act of 1996, which prohibited the \\"knowing\\" transmission of \\"indecent\\" messages to minors and the publication of materials which depict, in a manner \\"patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs\\", unless those materials were protected from access by minors, for example by the use of credit card systems. Immediately challenged by a group of organizations spearheaded by the ACLU, both of these provisions were struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union (1997). The \\"indecent transmission\\" and \\"patently offensive display\\" provisions were ruled to limit the freedom of speech guarantee of the First Amendment. A second attempt was made with the narrower Child Online Protection Act (COPA) of 1998, which forced all commercial distributors of \\"material harmful to minors\\" to protect their sites from access by minors. \\"Material harmful to minors\\" was defined as materials that by \\"contemporary community standards\\" are judged to appeal to the \\"prurient interest\\" and that show sexual acts or nudity (including female breasts). Several states have since passed similar laws. An injunction blocking the federal government from enforcing COPA was obtained in 1998. In 1999, the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the injunction and struck down the law, ruling that it was too broad in using \\"community standards\\" as part of the definition of harmful materials. In May 2002, the Supreme Court reviewed this ruling, found the lower court's given reason insufficient and returned the case to the circuit court. In March 2003, the 3rd Circuit Court again struck down the law as unconstitutional, this time arguing that it would hinder protected speech among adults. The administration appealed; in June 2004 the Supreme Court upheld the injunction against the law, ruling that it was most likely unconstitutional but that a lower court should determine whether newer technical developments could affect this question. On March 22, 2007, COPA was found to violate the First and Fifth Amendments of the United States Constitution and was struck down. Another act intended to protect children from access to Internet pornography is the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) of 2000. It requires that public libraries, as a condition of receiving federal subsidies for Internet connectivity, employ filtering software to prevent patrons from using Internet terminals to view images of obscenity and child pornography, and to prevent children from viewing images \\"harmful to minors\\", a phrase encompassing pornography that has been held by the Supreme Court to be protected by the First Amendment for adults. The act allows librarians to disable the filtering software for adult patrons with \\"bona-fide research or other lawful purposes\\". The act was challenged by the American Library Association on First Amendment grounds, and enforcement of the act was blocked by a lower court. In June 2003, the Supreme Court reversed and ruled that the act was constitutional and could go into effect. The production of sexually explicit materials is regulated under 18 U.S.C. 2257, requiring \\"original\\" producers to retain records showing that all performers were over the age of 18 at the time of the production for inspection by the Attorney General. The 18 U.S.C. 2257 disclaimer is common on Internet sites distributing pornography, but the Department of Justice has rarely if ever enforced the provision. Although the law had been on the books for over 10 years, the Justice Department never actually inspected anyone. It was not until pressure from Congress, and conservative religious groups spurred the administration of George W. Bush and Attorney General Gonzales to begin inspections of larger commercial pornography companies primarily in the Los Angeles area. Despite fearing mass inspections, harassment, and prosecution, the Justice Department inspected less than two dozen companies (out of several thousand operating), and no prosecutions resulted from any of the inspections. Retired FBI agents conducted the inspections, and generally arrived with a list of videos whose records they wanted to examine (most likely, to avoid potential Fourth Amendment conflicts on issues of probable cause). According to pornography executives, the agents were always courteous and professional, suggesting changes or modifications to the companies' record-keeping processes. Once Attorney General Alberto Gonzales left the Justice Department, the inspections ended. In 2005, the Department of Justice issued regulations that expand the definition of a \\"secondary producer\\" of sexually explicit material. As of June 23, 2005, federal regulations apply the 2257 record-keeping requirement to secondary producers, and defines them as including anyone who \\"inserts on a computer site or service a digital image of, or otherwise manages the sexually explicit content of a computer site or service that contains a visual depiction of, an actual human being engaged in actual or simulated sexually explicit conduct.\\" 73 Fed. Reg. at 77,468. On October 24, 2007, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Ohio issued a judgment against the 2257 law, ruling it as unconstitutional according to the First Amendment. However, the Sixth Circuit subsequently reheard the case en banc and issued an opinion on February 20, 2009, upholding the constitutionality of the record-keeping requirements, albeit with some dissents. The Sixth Circuit en banc decision was appealed to the US Supreme Court where on Monday October 5, 2009, the US Supreme Court denied certiorari without comment not addressing the Sixth Circuit decision that 18 USC 2257 is not constitutionally \\"vague and overbroad\\" and able to be enforced. See the one line denial on page nine of the Supreme Court order list for October 5, 2009.Connection Distributing Co. v. Holder, (Supreme Court list of orders) In February 2001, Buffnet, a New York Internet Service Provider, pleaded guilty in state court to a misdemeanor count of knowingly providing access to child pornography, after being notified by police of the content and not taking action. The ISP faced a $5000 fine. ===United Kingdom=== The sale or distribution of hardcore pornography through any channel was prohibited until the rules were relaxed in 2002. However, pornographic videos sold or distributed legally within the UK must receive a certificate from the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) and the rules are still quite strict. In 1996, internet service providers started the Internet Watch Foundation to watch for pornographic content that is in violation of British law and report it to the police. The web filter Cleanfeed is used by the largest ISP, BT Group, to block sites on the Internet Watch Foundation's list, which include sites that are \\"criminally obscene\\" as well as child pornography. The government ordered all ISPs to have a Cleanfeed-like system by the end of 2007. The possession of pornographic images for private use has traditionally not been an offence in the UK. This means that UK citizens have been able to access content on sites overseas without breaking any laws, except for child pornography. However, adult pornography that falls under the Government's classification of \\"extreme pornography\\" became illegal to possess as of January 26, 2009, carrying a three-year prison sentence. This was proposed by the Government after the murder of Jane Longhurst, claiming that such material was viewed by murderer Graham Coutts. Critics of the law have pointed out that it criminalises images of legal acts between consenting adults and have criticised the lack of evidence of a link between viewing such material, and violent crime. In 2013, Prime Minister David Cameron introduced plans to filter internet pornography by default in the UK. By the end of 2014, access to internet pornography was blocked unless subscribers specifically chose to 'opt out' by contacting their ISP. This was done in an effort to reduce the number of children having access to pornography on the Internet. The plans were criticised as likely to sweep up non-pornographic content, disclose intimate information to the government, and as unwarranted censorship. In December 2014, the jurisdiction of the BBFC was extended with the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014 to include pornography available over video on demand and streaming platforms, effectively aligning internet pornography laws with the Video Recordings Act 1984. This brought a renewed controversy over the banning of depiction of certain sex acts including depictions \\"physical or verbal abuse\\", \\"roleplay as non-adults\\", urolagnia, and female ejaculation, among others. The Digital Economy Act 2017 includes powers to require age-verification for pornographic Internet sites and the government accepted an amendment to allow the regulator to require ISPs to block access to non-compliant sites. As the BBFC have been appointed as the regulator, this has caused discussion about ISPs being required to block content that is prohibited even under an R18 certificate, the prohibition of some of which is itself controversial. === Australia === Internet pornography in Australia is subject to a multifaceted regulatory framework. Criminal legislation is in force at the Commonwealth, state and territory levels targeting those involved in the production, dissemination and consumption of illegal internet pornography (including online child abuse pornography and online pornography featuring adults portrayed as children). It is illegal for internet content providers within Australia to 'broadcast' internet pornography classified as MA15+ to R18+ unless such internet pornography is subject to an age verification system or internet pornography which may be classified as X18+ to RC content that is not subject to an Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) infringement notice through exceptions. Under an internet filter, proposed by Senator Stephen Conroy, internet pornography hosted outside Australia classified by the ACMA under the Classification Board legislation will be blocked if such internet pornography is deemed by the AMCA to be refused classification (RC), or 'potentially' refused classification. Refused classification (RC) does include real child abuse internet pornography and bestiality internet pornography, however it may also include content discussing or illustrating examples of internet pornography (including both, illegal internet pornography and internet pornography featuring adults portrayed as children) which may limit discussion and debate to authorised statutory persons only, rather than open and free public debate. Criminal legislation is complemented by a further tier of regulation which provides a range of administrative remedies designed to deal with the availability of inappropriate content by removing it from the internet or by blocking access to it. Online content scheme Since January 1999, internet pornography considered offensive or illegal has been subject to a statutory scheme administered by ACMA as Australia's media regulator. Established under Schedule 5 to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, the online content scheme evolved from a tradition of Australian content regulation in broadcasting and other entertainment media. This tradition embodies the principle that – while adults should be free to see, hear and read what they want – children should be protected from material that may be unsuitable for (or harmful to) them, and everyone should be protected from material that is highly offensive. The online content scheme seeks to achieve these objectives by a number of means such as complaint investigation processes, government and industry collaboration, and community awareness and empowerment. While administration of the scheme is the responsibility of ACMA, the principle of ‘co-regulation’ underpinning the scheme reflects parliament's intention that government, industry and the community each plays a role in managing internet safety issues in Australia. Investigations into internet pornography A central feature of the online content scheme is the complaints mechanism that allows members of the Australian public to submit complaints to ACMA about offensive and illegal internet content. Offensive and illegal internet content will be ‘prohibited’ under the scheme if it meets certain classification thresholds, irrespective of where the content is hosted. If prohibited content is hosted in Australia, ACMA will direct the internet content host to remove the content from its service. If prohibited content is not hosted in Australia, ACMA will notify the content to the suppliers of accredited filters in accordance with the Internet Industry Association's internet content code of practice so that access to that content is blocked for users of those filters. In addition, sufficiently serious internet content (for example, illegal material such as child pornography) will be referred by ACMA under specialized agreements to the appropriate law enforcement agency, or, where appropriate, to a fellow member of the Internet Hotline Providers’ Association (INHOPE). Between January 2000 and June 2006, ACMA received over 5,000 complaints from the public about offensive and illegal internet content hosted in Australia and overseas, resulting in the removal or blocking of almost 4,000 individual items of online content. Approximately 60% of such content was also referred to law enforcement agencies on the basis that it related to material classifiable as ‘RC’ (see below). Classification of internet pornography Internet pornography will be ‘prohibited’ by ACMA if certain classification thresholds are met. These thresholds form part of the National Classification Scheme (which also applies to other forms of media such as publications, films and video games) and are agreed by the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth, States and Territories. The thresholds are articulated in a National Classification Code and in Guidelines. The Classification Board (part of the Attorney-General's Department) is Australia's official classification body. In the course of investigating potentially prohibited internet content, ACMA may seek a formal classification decision from the Classification Board, or it may make its own assessment of the content against the National Classification Code and in Guidelines. In summary, the following categories of internet content are prohibited: • Content classifiable as ‘RC’ (‘refused classification’). Such content includes, for example, illegal material (such as child sexual abuse material) and other highly offensive material (such as bestiality). • Content classifiable as ‘X18+’. Such content includes material containing real depictions of actual sexual activity. • Content hosted in Australia which is classified ‘R18+’ and not subject to a restricted access system which complies with criteria determined by ACMA. Content classified R18+ is not considered suitable for minors. Such content includes, for example, material containing implied (or simulated) sexual activity. Internet pornography will be prohibited if it falls within the ‘RC’ or ‘X18+’ classifications or, for content hosted in Australia that is not restricted by an adult verification procedure, if it falls within the ‘R18+’ classification. Victorian legislation In Victoria, the law states that child pornography ‘means a film, photograph, publication or computer game that describes or depicts a person who is, or who looks like, a minor under 18 engaging in sexual activity or depicted in an indecent manner or context. Under this law, ‘publications’ also include stories, poems, essays, drawings and cartoons. === Finland === Finnish law specifically prohibits either real or realistic imagery which sexually depicts children. The illegality thus excludes non- realistic imagery. === Indonesia === The legal situation in Indonesia tightened sharply in 2008 with the passing of the Bill against Pornography and Pornoaction. Law books of Indonesia KUHP (Kitab Undang-Undang Hukum Pidana) article number 282 says that \\"it is forbidden to spread pornographic content\\". But there have been Indonesian pornographic pay sites with Indonesian nude models that exploit legal loopholes. === Hong Kong === Pursuant to the Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance (Cap 390), it is an offence to publish an obscene article. Publication covers distribution, circulation, selling, hiring, giving, or lending the obscene article. Distribution by email would fall within the definition of distribution, as would the placing of an obscene article on a web site. It should also be noted that distribution does not require any element of financial gain to be present. The definition of article includes \\"anything consisting of or containing material to be read or looked at or both read and looked at, any sound recording, and any film, video-tape, disc or other record of a picture or pictures.\\" The article will be considered obscene if, by reason by its obscenity, \\"it is not suitable to be published by any person.\\" Obscenity includes \\"violence, depravity and repulsiveness\\". The penalty for this offence is up to three years imprisonment and a fine of up to HK$1,000,000. Related cases (see Edison Chen photo scandal): * On January 27, 2008, The Hong Kong Police Force arrested suspects who were accused of uploading pornographic images after a multi-billion entertainment company filed a complaint about these photos available on the internet having been fabricated and might charge the offender for defamation. Moreover, the Prevention of Child Pornography Ordinance, Cap.579, was enacted to deal with the problems associated with child pornography in Hong Kong. Under Section 3, dealing in any of the following manners with child pornography, such as “prints, makes, produces, reproduces, copies, imports or exports”; “publishes” or “ has in his possession” is an offence. A child is a person under the age of 16. “Child pornography” means a photograph, film, computer-generated image or other visual depiction that is a pornographic depiction of a child. “Pornographic depiction” means a visual depiction that depicts a person as being engaged in explicit sexual conduct, whether or not the person is in fact engaged in such conduct; or a visual depiction that depicts, in a sexual manner or context, the genitals or anal region of a person or the breast of a female person. In Hong Kong, recent data shows that $14k is funded towards hentai/pornography companies. Producers are beginning to believe this is \\"A special skill and talent\\" or in other words, a paying job. === Gaza Strip === Hamas authorities of the Gaza Strip began blocking Internet pornography sites in late May 2008.Hamas bans pornographic websites in Gaza Strip. Reuters, May 19, 2008.Hamas takes aim at Internet porn in Gaza . AFP, June 9, 2008 ===Malaysia=== In July 2018, the Malaysian police announced the creation of the Malaysian Internet Crime Against Children Investigation Unit (MICAC) that is equipped with real-time mass internet surveillance software developed in the United States and is tasked with the monitoring of all Malaysian Internet users even on mobile phones, with a focus on pornography and child pornography. The system creates a \\"data library\\" of users which includes details such as IP addresses, websites, locations, duration and frequency of use and files uploaded and downloaded. Visiting these websites are subject to either questioning by police or imprisonment. ===Philippines=== As of January 14, 2017, several pornography sites, mostly mainstream ones such as Pornhub and XVideos, have been blocked in the Philippines as part of a government crackdown on child pornography. The Philippine government cites Republic Act 9775 or the Anti-Child Pornography Law as legal justification for the blocks. The list of sites blocked vary depending on the internet service provider enforcing them. === Russia === Roskomnadzor, the Russian government's media overseer, has the power to order the blocking of pornographic websites. In 2015, the agency ordered the blocking of the Russian-language version of Pornhub and 10 other pornographic sites on the basis of a court ruling. In early 2015, the Roskomnadzor has blocked over 100 pornography sites, making it difficult to view in Russia. Two more websites PornHub and YouPorn were blocked in Russia in September 2016. PornHub was unblocked in 2017. === India === * The selling and distribution of pornographic material is illegal in India under section 292 * The distribution, sale, or circulation of obscene materials and the selling of pornographic content to any person under age 20 years are illegal under section 293 and IT Act-67B. * Child pornography is illegal and strictly prohibited across the country under section 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000 * The manufacturing, publishing and distribution of pornography is illegal in India under section 292, 293. In July 2015 the Supreme Court of India refused to allow the blocking of pornographic websites and said that watching pornography indoors in the privacy of ones own home was not a crime. In August 2015 the Government of India issued an order to Indian ISPs to block at least 857 websites that it considered to be pornographic. In 2015 the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had asked internet service providers to take down 857 websites in a bid to control cyber crime, but after receiving criticism from the authorities it partially rescinded the ban. The ban from the government came after a lawyer filed a petition in the Supreme Court arguing that online pornography encourages sex crimes and rapes. In February 2016 the Supreme Court asked the Indian Government to suggest ways of banning all forms of child pornography. In October 2018 the government directed Internet service providers to block 827 websites that host pornographic content following an order by the Uttarakhand High Court. The court cited the rape of a 10th standard girl from Dehradun by four of her seniors. The four accused told police that they raped the girl after watching pornography on the Internet. ===Singapore=== The Media Development Authority, a government-run agency in Singapore, blocks a \\"symbolic\\" number of websites containing \\"mass impact objectionable\\" material, including Playboy, and Sex.com. In addition, the Ministry of Education, Singapore blocks access to pornographic websites. However, access to a pornographic website is decriminalised in Singapore except for downloading its content, which is prohibited. ===South Africa=== Since 2007, it is illegal to host a pornographic website in South Africa. However, accessing international porn websites is not an offence. ===Thailand=== A few pornographic websites are accessible in Thailand, mostly foreign, as long it's for personal use. ==References== Category:Internet governance Category:Erotica and pornography websites Category:Sex laws Category:Pornography law ","title":"Legal status of Internet pornography"},{"id":"2584326","text":"Bismuthia is a rare dermatological condition that results from the prolonged use of bismuth. Much more rarely than with silver, bismuth may produce a generalized persistent skin discoloration resembling argyria. The conjunctivae and oral mucosa, as well as skin, are commonly afflicted by the condition. Pigment granules are evenly scattered through the dermis, producing a blue, or bluish gray skin color by the scattering phenomenon. It is extremely rare, and as a consequence is poorly understood by modern medicine. Special stains and spectroscopic methods must be utilized for identification of skin pigments affected by bismuth. Usually, bismuth produces a black line, due to bismuth sulfide, along the gums, near the teeth, similar to the Burton's line which can be found in lead poisoning. This is not likely to occur if the gum is edentulous or the gum and the teeth normal. It is more common when gingivitis and carious teeth are present. Bismuth excess may cause stomatitis. On even rarer occasions, bismuth has been reported to cause pigmentation of the vagina and cervix. == References == * The University of Massachusetts Online Article on Pigmentation Disease * Beerman & Colburn - American Journal of the Medical Sciences, Volume 231: 451, 1956 * Jeghers - New England Journal of Medicine 231: 122 & 181, 1944 Category:Bismuth Category:Disturbances of human pigmentation ","title":"Bismuthia"},{"id":"2584329","text":"James Francis \\"Jock\\" McHale, (12 December 1882 – 4 October 1953) was an Australian rules football player and coach for the Collingwood Football Club in the Victorian Football League in a marathon career that extended from 1903 to 1949. == Early life == The son of an Irish-born policeman, John Francis, and his wife Mary (née Gibbons), the young McHale was born in Sydney, New South Wales but moved to Melbourne with his family at age 5. He attended St Brigid's primary school in North Fitzroy and St Paul's in Coburg, then moved on to Christian Brothers' College (Parade) in East Melbourne and completed three years of secondary school. Having just turned 15, he left school to take a position with the McCracken Brewery. == Playing career == McHale joined Coburg, at the time a junior club, and came to notice with his consistency, which led to an invitation to play at Collingwood. McHale made his league debut in 1903 for the black and white, playing as a half-back before moving into the centre. Durability was the cornerstone of his reputation as a player – he set a VFL record by playing 191 games consecutively between 1906 and 1917. This record was not beaten until 1943. He served as captain-coach from 1912–1913 and as a playing coach from 1914 up to the 1917 premiership, his second premiership after being part of the 1910 premiership side. McHale played a handful of matches in 1918 and 1920, but from 1918 to 1949 he made his name as the most successful coach in VFL/AFL history, deeds for which he is best remembered. As a player, McHale played 261 games and kicked 18 goals, as well as representing Victoria. == Coaching career == In total, McHale coached 714 VFL games with 467 wins and 10 draws (a 66.1% winning rate). This included a record 59 finals matches and 16 Grand Finals for eight premierships. His tally of 714 games was the record for most VFL/AFL games coached until 2015, when it was passed by Footscray, West Coast, Collingwood and Carlton coach Mick Malthouse. Stylistically, he was regarded more for his analytical and ability to inspire, rather than as a teacher of skills. His football brain earned him the respect of his players and the football public. His stint as coach encompassed three enormously successful eras: 1917–1922 (five Grand Finals in six years for two flags), then 1925–1930 (six successive Grand Finals for four flags) and finally 1935–1939 (five successive Grand Finals for two flags). The strength of Collingwood under McHale lay in its evenness and adherence to team discipline. McHale fashioned the team as a machine, with no part bigger than the whole – he and his players accepted the same amount of pay every week. He placed great store in his own ability to pick players' strengths and fitness levels and he would assess his players each week during a traditional Thursday Night match-day type training. Although in the years before and after the war Collingwood earned a reputation for failing in tough finals matches, McHale's reputation is assured for guiding the club in achieving VFL football's greatest single feat: the unequalled record of four premierships in a row, set between 1927 and 1930. During the war, Collingwood fell on its first barren period since the formation of the club in 1892. McHale rode out the privations of the period and the Magpies re-emerged as a contender in 1945. However, the club suffered a series of disappointing finals losses and McHale conceded to age early in 1950 and retired. He stayed intimately involved with the club and helped plan the Magpies' campaign in the 1953 Grand Final. When Collingwood won the match to end a premiership drought of 17 years, McHale was overwhelmed with emotion. The next day he suffered a heart attack, and he died on 4 October at his home in Coburg (noted Collingwood benefactor John Wren suffered a heart attack while watching the same final match, and he died on 26 October 1953). ===Coaching statistics=== : - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"1912   18  9  9  0  50.0%  7  10 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"1913   19  13  6  0  68.4%  3  10 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"1914   18  10  7  1  58.3%  5  10 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"1915   18  14  4  0  77.8%  1  9 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"1916   13  6  6  1  50.0%  2  4 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"1917   16  12  5  1  69.4%  1  6 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"1918   16  11  5  0  68.8%  2  8 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"1919   19  15  4  0  80.0%  1  9 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"1920   19  12  7  0  63.2%  4  9 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"1921   17  9  8  0  52.9%  3  9 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"1922   18  12  6  0  66.7%  1  9 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"1923   16  8  7  1  53.1%  5  9 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"1924   16  8  8  0  50.0%  6  9 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"1925   20  14  6  0  70.0%  4  12 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"1926   20  15  5  0  75.0%  1  12 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"1927   20  17  3  0  85.0%  1  12 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"1928   21  17  3  1  83.3%  1  12 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"1929   20  19  1  0  95.0%  1  12 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"1930   20  16  4  0  80.0%  1  12 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"1931   19  12  7  0  63.2%  4  12 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"1932   20  15  5  0  75.0%  3  12 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"1933   18  11  7  0  61.1%  6  12 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"1934   19  13  5  1  71.1%  4  12 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"1935   21  16  3  2  81.0%  2  12 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"1936   20  17  3  0  85.0%  2  12 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"1937   21  15  6  0  71.4%  3  12 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"1938   21  14  7  0  66.7%  4  12 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"1939   21  16  5  0  76.2%  2  12 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"1940   18  8  10  0  44.4%  8  12 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"1941   18  12  6  0  66.7%  5  12 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"1942   14  2  12  0  14.3%  10  11 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"1943   15  5  10  0  33.3%  10  11 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"1944   18  7  11  0  38.9%  10  12 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"1945   22  15  7  0  68.2%  2  12 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"1946   22  13  8  1  61.4%  2  12 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"1947   19  11  7  1  60.5%  5  12 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font- weight:normal\\"1948   21  14  7  0  66.7%  3  12 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal\\"1949   20  13  7  0  65.0%  3  12 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=2 Career totals ! 713 ! 466 ! 237 ! 10 ! 66.1% ! colspan=2 } ==Recognition== In 1996 Jock McHale was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame and then was elevated to legend status in 2005. Since 2001, the premiership coach is awarded the Jock McHale Medal, in honour of McHale's brilliant coaching record. The AFL has retrospectively made this award to each premiership coach since 1950, the year after McHale retired as a coach. Crime novelist Kerry Greenwood wrote the 1991 short story The Vanishing of Jock McHale's Hat. It was adapted into a season 2 episode of Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries, titled \\"Marked for Murder\\", which aired in 2013. ===1930 Grand Final=== The AFL officially recognises McHale as having coached 714 games and eight premierships, but it is a matter of some historical controversy that the 1930 Grand Final and premiership are credited to McHale's statistics.http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2015/04/22/bartlett- malthouse-break-record-nz McHale had coached the team throughout that year and into the week of the Grand Final, but was absent on the day of the Grand Final, having fallen ill with influenza days before the game. Club treasurer Bob Rush performed the match day coaching duties in his place. For many years, Rush was credited with having coached the game; but after a decision in 2014 by the AFL's historians, McHale is now credited as Collingwood's sole coach in the game. ==Death== Jock McHale died of a heart attack on 4 October 1953, aged 70 at his home in Coburg, only a week after Collingwood had won its first Premiership in seventeen years. He is buried with his wife Violet, son James and daughter Mary. McHale is buried at Coburg Cemetery, Preston, Victoria.

These less viscous inks, which tend to saturate more deeply and more widely into paper than other types of ink, give roller ball pens their distinctive writing qualities. The writing point is a tiny ball, usually 0.5 or 0.7 mm in diameter, that transfers the ink from the reservoir onto the paper as the pen moves. == Advantages == Close up of an extra fine roller ball pen next to something written with it There are two main types of roller ball pens: liquid ink pens and gel ink pens. The 'liquid-ink' type uses an ink and ink supply system similar to a fountain pen, and they are designed to combine the convenience of a ballpoint pen with the smooth \\"wet ink\\" effect of a fountain pen. The 'liquid-ink' type rollerball pens were introduced in 1963 by the Japanese company Ohto. The gel ink type rollerball pens were patented in 1982 by Sakura Color Products. Gel inks usually contain pigments, while liquid inks are limited to dyestuffs, as pigments will sink down in liquid ink (sedimentation). The thickness and suspending power of gels allows the use of pigments in gelled ink, which yields a greater variety of brighter colors than is possible in liquid ink. Gels also allow for the use of heavier pigments with metallic or glitter effects, or opaque pastel pigments that can be seen on dark surfaces. Liquid ink roller ball pens flow extremely consistently and skip less than gel ink pens do. The lower viscosity of liquid ink increases the likelihood of consistent inking of the ball, whereas the higher viscosity of gel ink produces \\"skipping\\", that is, occasional gaps in lines or letters. In comparison to ballpoint pens, * Rollerball pens have a unique ink flow system for an even, high-performance writing experience. * Less pressure needs to be applied to the pen to have it write cleanly. This permits holding the pen with less stress on the hand, saving energy and improving comfort. This can also translate to quicker writing speeds. This is especially true of liquid ink pens. * The inks usually have a greater range of colors due to the wider choice of suitable water-soluble dyes and/or to the use of pigments. * They tend to write more clearly than ballpoint pens do. == Disadvantages == Close-up shot of a rollerball pen tip There are a number of disadvantages inherent to roller ball pens: * Roller ball pens with liquid-ink are more likely to \\"bleed\\" through the paper. Liquid ink is more readily absorbed into the paper due to its lower viscosity. This viscosity also causes problems when leaving the tip on the paper. The bleed-through effect is greatly increased as the ink is continually absorbed into the paper, creating a blotch. This does not affect gel-ink roller ball pens as much. This is one way through which the thickness of gel-ink gives it an advantage, in that it isn't as prone to being absorbed. Though the bleed-through effect of a gel-ink roller ball is greater than that of a ballpoint, it is usually not too significant. * Roller ball pens generally run out of ink more quickly than ballpoints because roller balls use a greater amount of ink while writing. This is especially true of liquid-ink roller balls, due to gel ink having a low absorption rate as a result of its thickness. Neither lasts as long as a ballpoint. * Uncapped roller ball pens are more likely to leak ink when, for example, placed into a shirt pocket, but most pens include caps or other mechanisms to prevent this from happening. * A roller ball tip is more likely to clog and jam when writing over correction fluid that has not yet completely dried. This often renders the ink cartridge useless. ==Standards== The International Organization for Standardization has published standards for roller ball pens: ; ISO 14145-1:1998: Roller ball pens and refills – Part 1: General use ; ISO 14145-2:1998: Roller ball pens and refills – Part 2: Documentary use (DOC) To comply to the ISO 14145-2:1998 documentary use standard the following has to be established by an ISO/IEC 17025 accredited laboratory: * Erasure resistance – The surface of the testing paper shall show clear evidence of damage before the line is rendered invisible when tested. * Ethanol resistance – The line shall remain visible when tested with a 50% aqueous ethanol solution (volume fraction). * Hydrochloric acid resistance – The line shall remain visible when tested with a 10% aqueous hydrochloric acid solution (mass fraction). * Ammonium hydroxide resistance – The line shall remain visible when tested with a 10% aqueous ammonium hydroxide acid solution (mass fraction). * Bleaching resistance – The line shall remain visible when tested with an aqueous 3% freshly made solution of chloramine-TStandard designation: N-chloro-p-toluene sulfonamide sodium salt. IUPAC designation: N-chloro-4-methyl-benzene sulfonamide sodium salt. (mass fraction). * Water resistance – The line shall remain visible when tested with water. * Light resistance – The line shall remain visible when tested with light. Most roller ball refills comply to the ISO 14145-2:1998 standard and are approved for documentary use. == Uses == Former MI-6 agent Richard Tomlinson alleges that Pentel Rolling Writer roller ball pens were extensively used by SIS agents to produce secret writing (invisible messages) while on missions..

Noted film critic Raymond Durgnat famously asked if he was \\"the brother of Quo?\\".p.71 Frayling, Christopher Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone\\" 1981 Routledge Dan's most notable role was The Triumph of Hercules (1964), in which he portrayed Hercules battling golden giants and trying to save his princess love from her evil relative. The film was quickly followed by Hercules the Invincible retitled Son of Hercules in the Land of Darkness, in The Sons of Hercules television package by Embassy Pictures. What made Vadis stand out from other athletes and bodybuilders in these films was the obvious speed, dexterity, agility and all around durability that he brought to his films, bringing much needed energy to what otherwise may have been average fight scenes. After the sword and sandal films faded he moved into spaghetti westerns, then became a recurring face in Clint Eastwood movies such as High Plains Drifter, The Gauntlet, Every Which Way But Loose, Any Which Way You Can and Bronco Billy. He died 11 June 1987 in Lancaster, California, United States, in a car in the desert, his death was declared an accidental drug overdose with acute ethanol and heroin-morphine intoxication.

The sagas were written down between 1220 and 1280, much later than the initial time of action 970–1030. The Saga of Erik the Red and The Saga of the Greenlanders both contain different accounts of Norse voyages to Vinland. The name Vinland meaning \\"Wineland,\\" is attributed to the discovery of grapevines upon the arrival of Leif Eiriksson in North America. The Vinland Sagas represent the most complete information we have about the Norse exploration of the Americas although due to Iceland's oral tradition, they cannot be deemed completely historically accurate and include contradictory details. However, historians commonly believe these sources contain substantial evidence of Viking exploration of North America through the descriptions of topography, natural resources, and native culture. In comparing the events of both books, a realistic timeline can be created. The veracity of the Sagas was supported by the discovery and excavation of a Viking Era settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland, Canada. Research done in the early 1960s by Norwegian explorer Helge Ingstad and his wife, archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, identified an old Norse settlement located at what is now the L'Anse aux Meadows National Historic Site of Canada. ==Translations== English translations of both of the Vinland sagas can be found in the following works: *Kunz, Keneva; Sigurdsson, Gisli, The Vinland Sagas, London: Penguin, 2008, . *Kunz, Keneva, The Sagas of the Icelanders, London: Penguin, 2005, . *Magnusson, Magnus; Palsson, Hermann, The Vinland Sagas, London: Penguin, 1973, . ==See also== * Vikings * Vinland ==Notes== ==References== *Brown, Nancy Marie (2012) Song of the Vikings: Snorri and the Making of Norse Myths (Palgrave Macmillan) *Haugen, Einar (2007) Voyages To Vinland – The First American Saga Newly Translated And Interpreted (Barzun Press) *Hreinsson, Vidar (1997) The Complete Sagas of Icelanders (Leifur Eiriksson Publishing, Reykjavik, Iceland) ==Further reading== *Grove, Jonathan.

As at 2019, the town has a population of 6,324. ==History== Historic town center of Polanica-Zdrój Polanica-Zdrój was first documented in 1347 under the name Heyde, when it was part of the Kingdom of Bohemia. At the time it belonged to the House of Glaubitz, and in the following centuries it often changed owners. From the end of the 16th century the village was co-owned by the Jesuits, who contributed to its development. In 1645 it was destroyed by Swedish troops during the Thirty Years' War. In 1742 the settlement – like all the area – was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. The settlement grew quickly during the 19th century, becoming a popular health resort in the 1870s, after Prussia had become a component state of Germany in 1871. In 1890 a rail connection to Glatz (Kłodzko) was completed. Until 1933, that is the year the Nazis came to power in Germany, a Polish guesthouse existed in the town. During both world wars the sanatoria were turned into military hospitals. The town became part of Poland after World War II under the terms of the Potsdam Agreement. It was granted town rights in 1945 and its first mayor was Kazimierz Dąbrowski. On 28 June 1972 the Catholic parishes of Polanica-Zdrój were redeployed from the traditional Hradec Králové diocese (est. 1664; Ecclesiastical Province of Bohemia) into the Archdiocese of Wrocław.Paulus VI, Constitutio Apostolica father/paul vi/apost constitutions/documents/hf p-vi apc 19720628 vratislaviensis lt.html \\"Vratislaviensis – Berolinensis et aliarum\\", in: Acta Apostolicae Sedis, 64 (1972), n. 10, pp. 657seq.

The famine is estimated to have caused the deaths of about 10 million people, and Warren Hastings’s 1772 report estimated that a third of the population in the affected region starved to death. Rajat Datta estimates a much lower revised number, in the range of around 2 million dead within 6–7 months. The famine is one of the many famines and famine-triggered epidemics that devastated the Indian subcontinent during the 18th and 19th century. It is usually attributed to a combination of weather and the policies of the British East India Company. The start of the famine has been attributed to a failed monsoon in 1769 that caused widespread drought and two consecutive failed rice crops. The devastation from war, and exploitative tax revenue maximisation policies of the rapacious British East India Company after 1765 crippled the economic resources of the rural population., Quote: \\"Before long the province, already devastated by war, was struck down by the famine of 1769, then further ruined by high taxation. Company tax collectors were guilty of what today would be described as human rights violations. A senior official of the old Mughal regime in Bengal [or in other sources, an anonymous contemporary pamphleteer] wrote in his diaries: “Indians were tortured to disclose their treasure; cities, towns and villages ransacked; jaghirs and provinces purloined: these were the ‘delights’ and ‘religions’ of the directors and their servants.” Nobel prize winning Indian economist Amartya Sen describes it as a man-made famine, noting that no previous famine had occurred in Bengal that century, and the region under the Muslim rule was one of the world's major economic power and signalled the proto-industrialisation. Historian William Dalrymple held that the deindustrialisation of Bengal and the British policies were the reasons for the mass famine and widespread atrocities. ==Name== The Bengali name ‘Chiẏāttôrer mônnôntôr’ is derived from Bengali calendar year 1176 and the word for famine (‘chiāttôr’ - ‘76’; ‘-er’ - ‘of’; ‘mônnôntôr’ - ‘famine’ in Bengali).Kedarnath Mazumdar, Moymonsingher Itihash O Moymonsingher Biboron, 2005, , pp. 46–53, Anandadhara, 34/8 Banglabazar, Dhaka. ==Background== The famine occurred in Bengal, then ruled by the British East India Company. This territory included modern West Bengal, Bangladesh, and parts of Assam, Odisha, Bihar, and Jharkhand. It was earlier a province of the Mughal empire from the 16th century and was ruled by a nawab, or governor. In early 18th century, as the Mughal empire started collapsing, the nawab became effectively independent of the Mughal rule. In the 17th century, the English East India Company was granted the town of Calcutta by the Mughal Prince Shah Shuja. During the following century, the company obtained sole trading rights for the province and became the dominant power in Bengal. In 1757, at the Battle of Plassey, the British defeated the nawab Siraj Ud Daulah and plundered the Bengali treasury. In 1764 their military control was reaffirmed at Buxar. The subsequent treaty gave them taxation rights; the Company thereby became the de facto ruler of Bengal. Raids conducted by the Maratha bargis (bargir) mostly from Nagpur in the 1760s led to widespread theft and destruction and presumably reduced the region's ability to deal with the ensuing shortages. ==Famine== Henry Singleton and Charles Knight entitled Scarcity in India, 1794, depicting a two sailors bargaining with an Indian woman, offering a mirror and watch in exchange for fruit The regions in which the famine occurred affected the modern Indian states of Bihar and West Bengal in particular, but the famine also extended into Orissa and Jharkhand as well as modern Bangladesh. Among the worst affected areas were Birbhum and Murshidabad in Bengal, and Tirhut, Champaran and Bettiah in Bihar. A partial shortfall in crops, considered nothing out of the ordinary, occurred in 1768 and was followed in late 1769 by much more severe conditions. By September 1769 after the failure of the annual South-East monsoon there was a severe drought, and alarming reports were coming in of rural distress. These were, however, largely ignored by company officers. By early 1770 there was starvation, and by mid-1770 deaths from starvation were occurring on a large scale. In 1770, a great epidemic of smallpox raged in Murshidabad and killing 63,000 of its inhabitants, including Nawab Najabat Ali Khan. He was succeeded by his brother Ashraf Ali Khan, who also died from smallpox two weeks after his coronation. Later in 1770 good rainfall resulted in a good harvest and the famine abated. However, other shortfalls occurred in the following years, raising the total death toll. The famine killed an estimated ten million Indians in Bihar and Bengal, approximately one-third of the population of the Bengal presidency. Rajat Datta estimates a toll of 2 million dead within 6–7 months, claiming that the 10 million figure carries \\"little conviction\\" and is \\"a largely inflated number\\"; this would be closer to 7% of the population during that period. As a result of the famine, large areas were depopulated and returned to jungle for decades to come, as the survivors migrated in search of food. Many cultivated lands were abandoned—much of Birbhum, for instance, returned to jungle and was virtually impassable for decades afterwards. From 1772 onwards, bands of bandits and Thugs became an established feature of Bengal, and were only brought under control by punitive actions in the 1790s. ==Responsibility of the British East India Company== In addition to its profits from trade, the company had been given rights of taxation in 1764. In Bengal, these profits came from both land tax and trade tariffs. Within the first few years of its ability to tax, the Company doubled the total land tax; most of this revenue flowed back to English investors.Romesh Dutt The Economic History of India under early British Rule (1906) As the famine approached its height in April 1770, the Company faced declining profits. Acting upon the advice of Mahomed Reza Khan, the Naib, the Council added 10% to the land tax of the ensuing year. The company had no plan for dealing with the grain shortage, and actions were only taken insofar as they affected the mercantile and trading classes. Land revenue decreased by 14% during the affected year, but recovered rapidly. According to McLane, the first governor-general of British India, Warren Hastings, acknowledged \\"violent\\" tax collecting after 1771: revenues earned by the company were higher in 1771 than in 1768. Hastings became Governor of Bengal at the end of April 1772, and in November reported to the company the preliminary result of his investigations into the revenue: > It was naturally to be expected that the diminution of the revenue should > have kept an equal pace with the other consequences of so great a calamity; > that it did not was owing to its being violently kept up to its former > standard. To ascertain all the means by which this was effected will not be > easy; it is difficult to trace the progress of the collections through all > its intricate channels, or even to comprehend all the articles which compose > the revenue in its first operations. One tax, however, we will endeavour to > describe, as it may serve to account for the equality which has been > preserved in the past collections, and to which it has principally > contributed. It is called najay, and is an assessment upon the actual > inhabitant of every inferior division of the lands to make up for the loss > sustained in the rents of their neighbours who are either dead or have fled > the country. This tax, though equally impolitic in its institution and > oppressive in the mode of exacting it, was authorised by the antient and > general usage of the country. It had not the sanction of Government, but > took place as a matter of course. ... The tax not being levied by any fixed > rate or standard fell heaviest upon the wretched survivors of those villages > which had suffered the greatest depopulation, and were of course the most > entitled to the lenity of Government. It had also this additional evil > attending it in common with every other variation from the regular practice: > that it afforded an opportunity to the farmers and shicdars, to levy other > contributions on the people under color of it, and even to encrease this to > whatever magnitude they pleased, since they were in course the judges of the > loss sustained and of the proportion which the inhabitants were to pay to > replace it. == See also == * List of famines * Timeline of major famines in India during British rule * Bengal famine of 1943 ==References== * * * Brooks Adams, The Laws of Civilizations and Decay.

Through training courses, a member of the organization can become accredited as a \\"Certified Relocation Professional,\\" a \\"Senior Certified Relocation Professional,\\" and a \\"Global Mobility Specialist,\\" which entitles the member to include the professional designations CRP, SCRP and/or GMS after his or her name. Worldwide ERC publishes a monthly magazine, Mobility as well as several Web-based newsletters and bulletins, including Globility. ==Research== ===Annual rankings of U.S. cities=== Worldwide ERC's annual Best Cities for Relocating Families and Best Cities for Relocation Singles surveys began ranking U.S. cities in 2003 to determine which metro areas are most likely to foster successful relocations. Success is determined by whether a transferring employee remains in his or her new position and does not quit due to dissatisfaction with the new home community—an expensive failure in HR terms for the employer who paid for the move. A number of measurable features can affect the ease with which a family or single person can move to a city and the ease of settling into a new life there. ====Analyzing cities' suitability for newly relocated families==== For each year's \\"Families\\" survey, traditional factors such as commute times, tax rates, average home cost, and home appreciation are combined with more diverse cost of living and quality of life variables—like the ability to qualify for in-state tuition, the service quality of local utilities, auto taxes, per- capita volunteerism, and the quantity of family-friendly events and venues. Fee and occupancy rates for temporary housing and self storage are also used to predict the ease of a transition to a large city. The quality and availability of elder-care and assisted-living reflects a city’s investment in the needs of modern, multi-generational families. number-one ranked metropolitan areas for relocating families, by size { border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5  size category  2004  2005  2006 - large pop. 500,000\\\\+ Austin-San Marcos, TX Washington DC–VA–MD–WV Louisville, KY–IN - medium 250,000–500,000 Boulder-Longmont, CO Boulder-Longmont, CO Evansville, IN- KY - small 50,000–250,000 Yolo County, CA Athens, GA Athens, GA } ====Analyzing cities' suitability for newly relocated singles (unmarried)==== For each \\"Singles\\" ranking, the survey considers demographic and economic factors that helps measure the number of unmarried newcomers in each metro area (largest 100 metros only). Newcomers tend to be more open to befriending fellow newcomers, so the cities that tend to attract them foster easier assimilation. The measurement factors include the percentage of singles between the ages of 25-34, recent job growth, recent change in each area's 25-34 age-group, and median age (with \\"ideal range\\" set to 25-34). Other, less critical, criteria for singles include gender parity, \\"fan friendly\\" sports venues, climate, per-capita volunteerism (a way for the \\"transitionally shy\\" to warm up to new acquaintances), on-premises food and beverage spending, availability and pricing of temporary housing and storage, apartment rents, utility customer-service levels, public university residency requirements, and online dating as well as heavy concentrations of Starbucks, other coffee houses, highly rated restaurants, health clubs and nightclubs. top five metropolitan areas for relocating singles only metros with populations over 500,000 were evaluated { border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 rank  2004  2005  2006 -  1.

Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. . Such treatment has been superseded as the best practice for treating the disease because of \\"numerous side effects and monitoring requirements, their limited efficacy, and very slow onset of action\\". Similar to silver, a gold preparation used parenterally for a long period may rarely produce a permanent skin pigmentation – especially if the skin is exposed to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet radiation. The skin's pigmentation (in this condition) has been described as uniformly gray, grayish purple, slate gray, or grayish blue, and is usually limited to exposed portions of the body. It may involve the conjunctivae over the scleras but usually not the oral mucosa. Location of pigment predominantly in the upper dermis leads to the blue component of skin color through the scattering phenomenon. It is much less likely to be deposited in the nails and hair. Chrysiasis was said to have been much more common when medicines containing traces of gold were used for treatment of tuberculosis (commonplace forms of treatment nearly fifty years ago). Treatments containing gold traces were also used to treat cases of rheumatoid arthritis – but because the dose used for tuberculosis was higher than for arthritis, it has not afflicted many subscribing to such treatments. Gold can be identified in the skin chemically by light microscopy, electron microscopy, and spectroscopy. There is no way to reverse or treat chrysiasis. == See also == * Argyria * Carotenodermia * Colloidal gold * Gold salts * Gold toxicity == Notes == == References == * Jeghers - New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 231: 122 & 181, 1944 * Scamberg - \\"Chrysoderma - A permanent gold staining of the skin\\".

He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduating in 1842. He studied law in Concord with his older brother, Daniel Moreau Barringer, who would enjoy a successful law practice and serve two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. Their brother, Victor Clay Barringer, like Rufus later served as officer in the Confederate States Army. Entering politics as a Whig, Rufus Barringer represented Cabarrus County in the House of Commons in the North Carolina General Assembly from 1848 until 1850. A Unionist in his political views, he represented his district as an elector during the 1860 presidential election.Warner, p. 17. As a young man before he married, Barringer is known to have had a relationship with Roxanna Coleman, a young enslaved African- American woman held by planter Daniel Coleman, Sr. Barringer fathered two mixed-race sons with her, Thomas Clay and Warren Clay. Their son Warren Clay Coleman, born into slavery in 1849, after the war became a successful businessman in Cabarrus County, in part aided by his father's influence and expertise as a lawyer. In addition to owning stores and a rental company in Concord, Coleman was a founder in 1895 of the first African-American owned and operated textile mill. ===First two marriages=== Barringer married Eugenia Morrison in 1854. They had two children, Paul and Anna. Eugenia died of typhoid fever in 1858. Two of her sisters also married men who became generals during the Civil War, Stonewall Jackson and D. H. Hill. In 1861, Barringer married again, to Rosalie Chunn of Asheville, They had a son, Rufus Clay Barringer, Jr. Rosalie died in 1864 during the American Civil War. ==Civil War== When North Carolina seceded from the Union in May 1861, Barringer's first loyalty was to his state, even though he'd been opposed to secession. He raised a company of 100 horsemen, the \\"Cabarrus Rangers,\\" who were designated as Company F of the 1st North Carolina Cavalry Regiment with Barringer as their captain. The regiment performed picket and scouting duty under J.E.B. Stuart during the Peninsula Campaign, the Seven Days Battles, Second Manassas and the Maryland Campaign in 1862. Barringer led his company during the 1863 Gettysburg Campaign, where he was severely wounded in the face at the Battle of Brandy Station, an injury that took five months for his recovery. He was promoted to major for his gallantry and served in the Bristoe Campaign, where he was slightly wounded on October 14, 1863. During the winter, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assigned temporary command of the 4th North Carolina Cavalry. Barringer was promoted to brigadier general on June 6, 1864, and assigned command of North Carolina's cavalry brigade until his capture during the Battle of Namozine Church in Virginia on April 3, 1865. After a brief interview with President Abraham Lincoln behind Union lines at City Point, Virginia, he was sent to Fort Delaware as a prisoner of war. Lincoln, a personal friend and former Congressional colleague of Barringer's brother, provided a note to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton asking for special treatment for Barringer in captivity. Unfortunately, Lincoln's favor backfired. After his assassination, Barringer fell under suspicion due to his brief meeting with Lincoln less than two weeks prior. He was repeatedly questioned regarding any role he may have played in the conspiracy. He wasn't released from custody until late July, months after most other Confederate prisoners had been freed. During the war, he had fought in seventy-six engagements and had suffered three separate wounds. ==Post-war== Barringer returned to North Carolina in August and established a law practice in Charlotte. He also owned a tenant farm and helped expand the state's railroad system. He married again in 1870, to Margaret Long of Orange County, North Carolina. They had one son, Osmond L. Barringer (1878-1961). She also helped raise his older children. While he mostly did not live in Concord, he is believed to have advised his son Warren Clay Coleman on his businesses and investments. He was able to see the ambitious young man succeed and become very wealthy. Barringer was a delegate to the 1875 North Carolina Constitutional Convention. He unsuccessfully ran for lieutenant governor in 1880 as a Republican, losing to James L. Robinson. He retired from his law practice in 1884. He became a writer, completing a history of the 9th North Carolina Cavalry. He died in 1895 and was buried in the Elmwood Cemetery in Charlotte.Owen and Owen, Generals at Rest, p. 174 ==See also== *List of American Civil War generals (Confederate) ==Notes== ==References== * Barringer, Sheridan R., Fighting for General Lee: Confederate General Rufus Barringer and the North Carolina Cavalry Brigade, Savas Beatie, 2016, . *University of North Carolina library * * Warner, Ezra J., Generals in Gray: Lives of the Confederate Commanders, Louisiana State University Press, 1959, . *Marquis Who's Who, Inc.

The condition was named after the yellowish (ocher-like) discoloration of the tissue seen on microscopic examination. Macroscopically, though, the affected tissues appear bluish-grey because of a light-scattering phenomenon known as the Tyndall effect. The condition is most often associated with alkaptonuria, but can occur from exogenous administration of phenol complexes such as hydroquinone. It was first described by Rudolf Virchow in 1865.Findlay GH, et al. Ochronosis. Clinics in Dermatology 1989;7:28-35 == Types== The two types of ochronosis are endogenous and exogenous. The endogenous variety is an autosomal-recessive disease, known as alkaptonuria, that is caused by a lack of homogentisate oxidase enzyme.Charlín, R., Barcaui, C. B., Kac, B. K., Soares, D. B., Rabello-Fonseca, R. and Azulay-Abulafia, L. (2008), Hydroquinone-induced exogenous ochronosis: a report of four cases and usefulness of dermoscopy. International Journal of Dermatology, 47: 19–23. Exogenous ochronosis is an avoidable dermatitis that can be caused by the topical application of compounds such as hydroquinone or phenols. It was first seen in 1912, when a patient who used phenol on a leg ulcer was found by Beddard and Plumtre to have this condition.Beddard AP, Plumtre CM. \\"A further note on ochronosis associated with carboluria\\". Q S Med 1912; 5: 505–507. Hydroquinone-induced exogenous ochronosis was found in 1975 by Findlay, who observed the condition in patients who used skin lightening creams containing the compound.FINDLAY, G., MORRISON, J. and SIMSON, I. (1975), Exogenous ochronosis and pigmented colloid milium from hydroquinone bleaching creams. British Journal of Dermatology, 93: 613–622. The three clinical stages of exogenous ochronosis are:Dogliotte M, Leibowitz M. \\"Granulomatous ochronosis – a cosmetic- induced skin disorder in blacks\\". S Afr Med J 1979; 56: 757–760. # Erythema and mild hyperpigmentation # Hyperpigmentation and \\"caviar-like\\" lesions # Papulonodular lesions ==Signs and symptoms== * Skin: The pigment is deposited throughout the skin, but only becomes apparent in certain locations, where the concentration is great enough to be seen clinically. This usually occurs in areas where connective tissue is thick (joints, tympanic membrane) or close to the surface of the skin (thenar and hypothenar eminences and the sides of the fingers). In exogenous ochronosis, the hyperpigmentation is localized to the area where the inciting agent is applied. Intradermal nevi can appear like blue nevi. * Eye: Ocular manifestations are frequent in patients with ochronosis; most commonly hyperpigmentation of the sclera, primarily observed symmetrically to both sides of the cornea within the palpebral fissure. Furthermore, brown pigment spots in the limbus are generally considered pathognomonic. These ocular signs generally occur early in the development of the disease and can serve as a valuable diagnostic feature of the disease. * Cartilage: Darkening and hardening of ear cartilage is a prominent feature of ochronosis. Nasal cartilage is also frequently involved. The voice can be affected by hardening of the laryngeal cartilage. Stiffening of the ribs with decreased lung function has also been reported. The intervertebral cartilage is also more prone to herniation. * Connective tissue: Hardening of tendons and ligaments can predispose them to rupture. Color changes in the joints can be observed clinically. Arthropathy is common due to chronic inflammation and microruptures. * Heart valves: Stenosis can results from the increased rigidity of the connective tissue as well as chronic inflammation. Symptoms of exogenous ochronosis include:Olumide, Y. M., Akinkugbe, A. O., Altraide, D., Mohammed, T., Ahamefule, N., Ayanlowo, S., Onyekonwu, C. and Essen, N. (2008), Complications of chronic use of skin lightening cosmetics. International Journal of Dermatology, 47: 344–353. # Yellow-brown, banana-shaped fibers # Caviar-like papules # Brown-grey or blue- black hyperpigmentation Most of the lesions are seen on areas of the body that get the most sun. == Causes == Exogenous ochronosis can be caused from long- term use of certain \\"skin-lightening\\" products, even if the hydroquinone is in amounts as small as 2%. Skin-lightening products are still prevalent in many parts of the world. This may be due to aesthetic or social-standing reasons, in areas where a lighter skin tone is considered to be a sign of wealth or beauty. Also, skin-lightening creams containing compounds such as hydroquinone are commonly used to help with hyperpigmentation disorders such as melasma.Rajaratnam R, Halpern J, Salim A, Emmett C. Interventions for melasma. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2010, Issue 7. Art. No.: CD003583. . Hydroquinone is the compound most frequently used in skin-whitening products. Due to concerns about its side effects, it was almost banned by the FDA in 2006, as medical issues of carcinogenicity and reports of disfiguring ochronosis existed.Toombs, E. L. (2007), Hydroquinone – what is future?. Dermatologic Therapy, 20: 149–156. In the European Union hydroquinone has been banned in cosmetic creams since 2000. Long-term use of creams containing this compound may lead to exogenous ochronotic lesions. The duration of use is directly proportional to the risk of developing the condition, with most cases occurring after years of use. Around 10–15 million skin lightening products are sold annually, with Japan being the major buyer. ==Pathophysiology== Ochronosis occurs because of deposition of phenols (such as homogentisic acid and hydroquinone) as plaques in the matrix of cartilage. The pigments can also be incorporated into collagen and elastin fibers. In the skin, the pigment alters the structure of the fibers, causing enlargement and curling. The embedded pigments also form crosslinks with pigment depositions in adjacent fibers, stabilizing and reducing the elastic recoil of the fibers. This results in hardening of elastic structures, increasing their rigidity and brittleness. Once ruptured, the exposed pigments cause a foreign body reaction and inflammation. This pigment deposition also invokes deposition of hydroxyapatite, the mineral responsible for bone calcification, further hardening the connective tissue. The pigment can also be excreted by glandular cells in apocrine and ceruminous sweat glands, as well as breast and prostate tissue. This results in darkly pigmented sweat and breast milk. Excretion of the pigment is only found in endogenous ochronosis and should not occur from topical phenols. Pathophysiology of alcaptonuria is due to the absence of functional homogentisate dioxygenase in the liver. ==Diagnosis== The diagnosis is often made as an incidental finding intraoperatively. Cartilage exposed to the air turns dark gray or black within minutes. ==Treatment== Treatment is predominantly preventive. Avoidance of topical phenols and diets low in tyrosine may help. Replacement and repair of damaged tissue is also possible. Hydroquinone-induced exogenous ochronosis is an avoidable dermatosis that is exceedingly difficult to treat. However, some studies show that treatment may be possible with a Q-switched alexandrite (755 nm) laser.Bellew, S. G. and Alster, T. S. (2004), Treatment of Exogenous Ochronosis With a Q-Switched Alexandrite (755 nm) Laser. Dermatologic Surgery, 30: 555–558. Individuals with this disorder are recommended to stop using hydroquinone-containing compounds. Awareness of this is important, as dermatologists may think the symptoms a patient is exhibiting are a melasma, and prescribe a hydroquinone- containing cream. ==See also== * Alkaptonuria * Tyrosinemia * Phenylketonuria * List of cutaneous conditions == References == == External links == Category:Amino acid metabolism disorders Category:Autosomal recessive disorders Category:Skin conditions resulting from errors in metabolism ","title":"Ochronosis"},{"id":"2584427","text":"The Triumph of Hercules, the 1964 film, was one of many Italian sword and sandal epics during the 1960s craze. Originally titled Il Trionfo di Ercole, the film was directed by Alberto De Martino. Hercules was portrayed by Dan Vadis. The film was released internationally as Hercules vs the Giant Warriors, and also as Hercules and the Ten Avengers. ==Plot== Hercules is called upon to fight seven golden giants summoned by the Dagger of Jae, sister of Juno (Hera), who dislikes Hercules \\"for certain family reasons.\\" Hercules also fights to protect his princess love, but matters are complicated by her evil relative Milo, who has murdered her father the king but has tricked her into thinking it was someone else because she trusts him too much. Milo tricks Hercules into killing his friend, for which he is punished by his father Jove (Jupiter/Zeus) who takes away his enormous strength, because he has misused it. Milo is conspiring with his sorceress mother to take the throne for himself. Now only as strong as a mortal man, Hercules is overpowered when he tries to rescue the princess Ate (pronounced Ah-tay) from Milo and is then accused of being a fraud. Milo tries to kill both Hercules and Ate by chaining them to a giant wooden lever with spikes, complete with a cage over Hercules which he must support while rocks are piled on him: if he can hold it up, then he will prove himself the true Hercules (which he is) but if not, then he will be guilty and he and Ate will die together for conspiring to steal the throne and give it to an imposter. As the weight of the stones and rocks drive the de-powered Hercules to his knees, he sincerely begs his father Jove to let him die if it is his destiny but to spare Ate who is innocent. Jove resolves this by restoring Hercules's demi-god strength, allowing him to overpower the soldiers, save Ate, and thwart Milo along with his seven golden giants and evil mother. The two bumbling thieves also prove useful in the climax. In the end, Hercules marries Ate and becomes king of her city. ==Cast== *Dan Vadis as Hercules *Marilù Tolo as Princess Ate *Pierre Cressoy as Prince Milo *Moira Orfei as the Sorceress Pasiphae *Annamaria Mustari as Hera/Juno *Nazzareno Zamperla as Thief ==Production== Marilu Tolo was given tinted lenses to play a malicious doppelgänger Hercules' love interest Princess Ate.

UMCOR is a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization operated under the auspices of the General Board of Global Ministries. One hundred percent of donations are directed to an earmarked project or relief effort. Administrative expenses are funded by an annual offering collected by United Methodist churches on UMCOR Sunday. UMCOR works through programs that address hunger, poverty, sustainable agriculture, international and domestic emergencies, refugee and immigrant concerns, global health issues, and transitional development. These programs are categorized into three major areas: Humanitarian Relief / Disaster Response, Sustainable Development and Global Health (in collaboration with UM Global Ministries). ==History== In response to World War II's devastating effects around the world the 1940 General Conference of the Methodist Church (USA) passed a resolution to form a relief agency. Originally named the Methodist Committee for Overseas Relief (MCOR), it was begun as a temporary organization. MCOR was to \\"respond to the vast needs of human suffering worldwide\\" by analyzing the most critical needs in the world and relaying these needs to local churches who would in turn provide monetary assistance. From the outset, the agency promoted ecumenical partnership with other denominational relief efforts. At the 1972 General Conference the name was changed to UMCOR and was legislated as a permanent entity under the auspices of the United Methodist Church's General Board of Global Ministries (GBGM). As UMCOR grew, the committee began to see the need to streamline its outreach efforts. The five areas of relief were created to encourage a more efficient distribution of aid. ==Mission== When UMCOR was first formed, the mission was, \\"to provide relief in disaster areas, aiding refugees and confronting the challenge of world hunger and poverty.\\" Today the agency's mission has changed very little. According to the United Methodist Book of Discipline, UMCOR's current responsibility is \\"To provide immediate relief of acute human need and to respond to the suffering of persons in the world caused by natural, ecological, political turmoil, and civil disaster.\\" ==Financing and donations== Unlike most relief organizations, UMCOR was designed so that 100 percent of all donations go directly to the intended projects. This goal was achieved by instituting the One Great Hour of Sharing (OGHS) donation. The OGHS is an annual collection taken at United Methodist churches around the world in March. UMCOR receives enough support through OGHS each year to cover all overhead, administrative, and operation costs for the coming year. Excess funds received from OGHS are directed to UMCOR's most urgent or least funded projects. Every dollar received in response to emergency appeals is spent on direct relief. ==Areas of relief== In an effort to streamline relief efforts around the world UMCOR has developed five core areas of relief: Hunger, Health, Refugees, Emergencies, and Relief Supplies. Each area of relief consists of many projects in different distressed areas of the world. ===Hunger=== Starvation and poverty remain among the largest humanitarian problems in the world. As an aid organization, UMCOR addresses these problems through their World Hunger/Poverty program. This program's main emphasis lies in supplying food to hungry people worldwide. However, the committee believes that food distribution is not the complete answer to the hunger problem. Alongside supplying food, UMCOR helps poor countries and regions develop their own food stocks. UMCOR provides seeds, tools, and training to advance agricultural efforts. It also collaborates with the National and World Councils of Churches, Heifer Project International, and Habitat for Humanity. In addition to these efforts, UMCOR is active in educating the public on political issues like trade policies, international debt, and political sanctions which promote worldwide hunger and poverty. UMCOR's Hunger actions include Food Security in Southern Africa which helped to develop farming techniques in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Water of Life which built wells in Afghanistan, and Filling in the Gaps in Haiti which provides school lunches for over 16,800 children in Haiti. UMCOR also supports National Hunger Awareness Day (June 3), World Food Day (October 16), and World Fair Trade Day (May 8). ===Health=== The second core area of relief that UMCOR provides is Health. UMCOR's health initiative focuses on providing primary health care support, building capacity of health care institutions, offering health education and training, promoting health care, distributing medication, supplies, and equipment, and supporting maternal and pediatric health care. One of UMCOR's tools in the fight against disease is the Health Kit. Health Kits consist of a hand towel, a washcloth, a comb, a nail file or fingernail clippers, a bar of soap, a toothbrush, a tube of toothpaste, and six adhesive bandages. These health kits are sent to people who cannot acquire these supplies due to poverty, natural disaster, or other reasons. UMCOR encourages local churches and other groups to compile Health Kits to donate to the agency's mission. UMCOR believes that by individuals assembling these Health Kits that the donator will better understand the need for providing this type of aid. Current projects and programs that UMCOR undertakes include HIV/AIDS Programs, Landmine Removal, Hospital Revitalization, and Comprehensive Community-Based Health Primary Care (CCPHC) Programs. ===Refugees=== In this core area, UMCOR provides relief to peoples displaced from their homes due to violence, oppression, and natural disaster. Refugees was one of the first and largest areas to which UMCOR provided relief when the committee was first formed. World War II had caused a great influx of refugees fleeing from the war and the rate never slowed down. Today most of UMCOR's Refugee aid is provided in El Salvador, Guatemala, Liberia, Mozambique, Cuba, Vietnam, and Eastern Europe. UMCOR's Refugee aid consists of fulfilling the primary needs of the displaced peoples. Food, shelter, and medicine are among the first supplies distributed. UMCOR also realizes the long-term effects of displacement. After primary needs are filled the agency helps refugees by supporting settlement through finances and labor or aids in planning the return home. UMCOR also provides counseling to refugees after being displaced. Throughout the aid processes UMCOR teams with the National Council of the Churches of Christ (NCCC), Church World Service (CWS), and local ecumenical agencies. Refugee core area programs include Justice for Our Neighbors, legal immigration counseling, and support of World Refugee Day (June 20). Most of UMCOR's Refugee projects are need based and cannot be converted to long-term projects. ===Emergency=== UMCOR's goal in emergency response is to \\"provide relief and rehabilitation for the entire person – physical, social, and psychological- in a distress situation.\\" The agency prepares for both immediate and long-term relief efforts after a disaster by stockpiling aid items and keeping a unit of trained \\"disaster response specialists\\" ready for immediate dispatch. UMCOR pays special attention to the emotional and psychological issues that result from a disaster. A program designed to supply pastor care to children is at the forefront of UMCOR's efforts in this area. Most notably UMCOR has recently responded to hurricane disasters in the United States, the December 26, 2004, tsunami in South East Asia, earthquakes in Turkey and Pakistan, political upheaval in Kosovo, famines in Southern and Eastern Africa, and a volcano in the Democratic Republic of Congo. UMCOR also responds to many other smaller disasters which occur, on average, once or more a week. In January 2010, UMCOR executive director Samuel W. Dixon Jr. died in the collapse of the Hotel Montana in Haiti. Dixon was part of a group of six UMCOR missionaries and relief specialists caught up in the massive earthquake. The delegation was making plans for improving medical services in Haiti. The minister Clinton C. Rabb also died in the collapse. ===Relief supplies=== The final core area of UMCOR's relief efforts is known as Relief Supplies. This area is supplementary to the other four areas in that it receives and assembles various kits which are then directed to other core areas. For example, the Health Kits mentioned above are received, assembled, packaged, and then distributed under the Health core area. Relief Supplies encourages volunteer support in assembling and distributing the kits so that volunteers can become more connected to the actions of UMCOR. Relief Supplies formulated six different kits that are sent around the world. Bedding Kits consist of two bed sheets, two pillow cases, and two pillows. Cleaning Buckets contain 17 different items to assist people in cleaning after a flood or hurricane. Health Kits, as described above, provide hygiene supplies to areas where basic sanitary items are unaffordable or unavailable. Layette kits are made of diapers, baby clothing, and blankets which are designed to meet the basic non- medical supplies needed directly after childbirth. School Kits are assembled with scissors, paper, a ruler, pencil sharpener, pencils, crayons and an eraser. They are designed to promote learning in areas where educational buildings and supplies are scarce or nonexistent. The final kit that Relief Supplies creates and distributes is the Sewing Kit. Sewing Kits provide recipients with three yards of fabric, scissors, needles, threads, and buttons. Sewing kits are intended to help people learn to create their own clothing instead of simply supplying garments. This kit also promotes cultural preservation by allowing recipients to sew clothing in their own cultural styles. Kit contents change periodically. Check the UMCOR website for the latest requirement/ To facilitate rapid response and utilize volunteer workers, UMCOR operates two supply depots, the UMCOR Sager Brown depot in Baldwin, Louisiana and UMCOR Depot West in Salt Lake City, Utah. ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Justice for Our Neighbors national website Category:Humanitarian aid organizations Category:Methodist organizations Category:Organizations established in 1940 Category:History of Methodism in the United States Category:Charities based in New York (state) ","title":"United Methodist Committee on Relief"},{"id":"2584445","text":"Ferrovanadium (FeV) is an alloy formed by combining iron and vanadium with a vanadium content range of 35–85%. The production of this alloy results in a grayish silver crystalline solid that can be crushed into a powder called \\"ferrovanadium dust\\".Hathaway, G. J.; Proctor, N. H. Proctor and Hughes chemical hazards of the workplace; Wiley-Interscience: Hoboken, 2004. Ferrovanadium is a universal hardener, strengthener and anti-corrosive additive for steels like high-strength low-alloy steel, tool steels, as well as other ferrous-based products. It has significant advantages over both iron and vanadium individually. Ferrovanadium is used as an additive to improve the qualities of ferrous alloys. One such use is to improve corrosion resistance to alkaline reagents as well as sulfuric and hydrochloric acids. It is also used to improve the tensile strength to weight ratio of the material. One application of such steels is in the chemical processing industry for high pressure high throughput fluid handling systems dealing with industrial scale sulfuric acid production. It is also commonly used for hand tools e.g. spanners (wrenches), screwdrivers, ratchets, etc. Picture of Ferrovanadium == Composition == Vanadium content in ferrovanadium ranges from 35% to 85%. FeV80 (80% Vanadium) is the most common ferrovanadium composition.Swinbourne, D. R.; Richardson, T.; Cabalteja, F. Understanding ferrovanadium smelting through computational thermodynamics modeling. Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy 2016, 125 (1), 45–55. In addition to iron and vanadium, small amounts of silicon, aluminum, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, arsenic, copper, and manganese are found in ferrovanadium. Impurities can make up to 11% by weight of the alloy. Concentrations of these impurities determine the grade of ferrovanadium.Gasik, M.

There are two common ways in which ferrovanadium in produced, silicon reduction and aluminum reduction. === Reduction by silicon === Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), ferrosilicon (FeSi75), lime (CaO) and slag (recycled vanadium containing waste) and are combined in an electric arc furnace heated to 1850 °C.Vermaak , M. K. G. Vanadium recovery in the electro- aluminothermic production of ferrovanadium. thesis, 2000 Silicon in the ferrosilicon reduces the vanadium in V2O5 to vanadium metal. The vanadium then interacts with the iron to form ferrovanadium. Excess lime and V2O5 are added to use up the silicon and refine the metal. This process produces vanadium concentrations between thirty-five and sixty percent. 2 V2O5 \\\\+ 5 (Fey/5Si)alloy \\\\+ 10 CaO → 4 (Fey/4V)alloy \\\\+ 5 Ca2SiO4 === Reduction by Aluminum === Iron, V2O5, aluminum, and lime are combined in an electric arc furnace. Like the silicon, aluminum reduces the vanadium in V2O5 to vanadium metal. The vanadium metal dissolves into the iron and forms the ferrovanadium alloy.Sutulov, A.; Wang, C. T. Vanadium processing https://www.britannica.com/technology/vanadium-processing#ref82021 (accessed Mar 22, 2018). The resulting ferrovanadium has a vanadium concentration between seventy and eighty-five percent. 3 V2O5 \\\\+ 10 Al → 6 V + 5 Al2O3 Vx \\\\+ Fe1−x → (Fe1−xVx)alloy == Toxicology == Ferrovanadium dust is a mild irritant that affects the eyes when touched by contaminated skin and the respiratory tract when inhaled. The dust caused chronic bronchitis and pneumonitis in animals exposed to high concentration (1000–2000 mg/m3) at intervals for two months. However, no such long-term effects have been observed in humans. === Occupational exposure === The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) states that an employee who is working eight hours a day, five days a week, can be exposed to ferrovanadium dust in their place of work at concentrations of up to 1.0 mg/m3 without adverse effects.Barceloux, D. G. Vanadium. Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology 1999, 37 (2), 265–278. Short-term exposures should be kept below 3.0 mg/m3. It is suggested that those working with high concentrations of ferrovanadium dust wear a respirator to prevent inhalation and irritation of the respiratory tract. == Steel == The most common use of ferrovanadium is in the production of steel. In 2017, 94% of domestic consumption of vanadium was to produce iron and steel alloys.U.S. Geological Survey; Vanadium. Mineral commodity summaries 2018: U.S. Geological Survey 2018, 180-181. Ferrovanadium and other vanadium alloys are used in carbon steel, alloy steel high strength steel, and HSLA (High Strength Low Alloy) steel.Tian, P.; Zhong, Z.; Bai, R.; Zhang, X.; Gao, H. Application of Different Vanadium Alloys in Steel. Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Information Systems and Industrial Applications 2015, 861-864. These steels are then used to make automotive parts, pipes, tools, and more. The addition of ferrovanadium toughens the steel making it more resistant to temperature and torsion. This increase in strength is a result of the formation of vanadium carbides which have a rigid crystal structure as well as a finer grain size which decreases the ductility of the steel.Britannica, T. E. of E. Vanadium https://www.britannica.com/science/vanadium (accessed Mar 22, 2018). In addition to adding to the composition of the steel, ferrovanadium can also be used as a coating on the steel. When coated with nitrated ferrovanadium, the abrasion resistance of steel increases 30-50%.Ivanova, E. A.; Narkevich, N. A.. Coatings Dispersely Hardened by Nitrided Ferrovanadium and Applied by the Electron-Beam Method. Steel in Translation 2008, 38 (10), 820–823. == Market == Between 2013 and 2017, the United States imported 13,510 tons of ferrovanadium, a majority of which came from Czechia, Austria, Canada, and the Republic of Korea. The price of ferrovanadium has fluctuated dramatically since 1996, hitting an all-time high in 2008 at $76041.61/ton FeV80.Bumbac, C. Journal of Global Economics 2011, 3 (3), 30–41. In more recent years, it has once again seen an increase in price as environmental standards shut down some of the vanadium producers in China. These shutdowns, as well as the closure of a South African vanadium mine, created a vanadium shortage, forcing ferrovanadium factories to reduce their production of ferrovanadium, decreasing its supply and driving up the price. == See also == * Ferroalloy * Steel alloy * Vanadium * Vanadium (V) oxide == References == * https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/14928220#section=Top * https://www.eaglealloys.com/vanadium/ Category:Vanadium compounds Category:Ferrous alloys ","title":"Ferrovanadium"},{"id":"2584449","text":"In mathematics and abstract algebra, the two-element Boolean algebra is the Boolean algebra whose underlying set (or universe or carrier) B is the Boolean domain. The elements of the Boolean domain are 1 and 0 by convention, so that B = {0, 1}. Paul Halmos's name for this algebra \\"2\\" has some following in the literature, and will be employed here. ==Definition== B is a partially ordered set and the elements of B are also its bounds. An operation of arity n is a mapping from Bn to B. Boolean algebra consists of two binary operations and unary complementation. The binary operations have been named and notated in various ways. Here they are called 'sum' and 'product', and notated by infix '+' and '∙', respectively. Sum and product commute and associate, as in the usual algebra of real numbers. As for the order of operations, brackets are decisive if present. Otherwise '∙' precedes '+'. Hence A∙B + C is parsed as (A∙B) + C and not as A∙(B + C). Complementation is denoted by writing an overbar over its argument. The numerical analog of the complement of X is 1 − X. In the language of universal algebra, a Boolean algebra is a \\\\langle B,+,.,\\\\overline{..},1,0\\\\rangle algebra of type \\\\langle 2,2,1,0,0\\\\rangle. Either one-to-one correspondence between {0,1} and {True,False} yields classical bivalent logic in equational form, with complementation read as NOT. If 1 is read as True, '+' is read as OR, and '∙' as AND, and vice versa if 1 is read as False. These two operations define a commutative semiring, known as the Boolean semiring. ==Some basic identities== 2 can be seen as grounded in the following trivial \\"Boolean\\" arithmetic: : \\\\begin{align} &1 + 1 = 1 + 0 = 0 + 1 = 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &0 + 0 = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &0\\\\cdot0 = 0\\\\cdot1 = 1\\\\cdot0 = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &1\\\\cdot1 = 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\overline{1} = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\overline{0} = 1 \\\\end{align} Note that: * '+' and '∙' work exactly as in numerical arithmetic, except that 1+1=1. '+' and '∙' are derived by analogy from numerical arithmetic; simply set any nonzero number to 1. * Swapping 0 and 1, and '+' and '∙' preserves truth; this is the essence of the duality pervading all Boolean algebras. This Boolean arithmetic suffices to verify any equation of 2, including the axioms, by examining every possible assignment of 0s and 1s to each variable (see decision procedure). The following equations may now be verified: : \\\\begin{align} &A; \\\\+ A = A \\\\\\\\\\\\ &A; \\\\cdot A = A \\\\\\\\\\\\ &A; \\\\+ 0 = A \\\\\\\\\\\\ &A; \\\\+ 1 = 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &A; \\\\cdot 0 = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\overline{\\\\overline{A}} = A \\\\end{align} Each of '+' and '∙' distributes over the other: *\\\\ A \\\\cdot (B+C) = A \\\\cdot B + A \\\\cdot C; *\\\\ A+(B \\\\cdot C) = (A+B) \\\\cdot (A+C). That '∙' distributes over '+' agrees with elementary algebra, but not '+' over '∙'. For this and other reasons, a sum of products (leading to a NAND synthesis) is more commonly employed than a product of sums (leading to a NOR synthesis). Each of '+' and '∙' can be defined in terms of the other and complementation: * A \\\\cdot B=\\\\overline{\\\\overline{A}+\\\\overline{B}} * A+B=\\\\overline{\\\\overline{A} \\\\cdot \\\\overline{B}}. We only need one binary operation, and concatenation suffices to denote it. Hence concatenation and overbar suffice to notate 2. This notation is also that of Quine's Boolean term schemata. Letting (X) denote the complement of X and \\"()\\" denote either 0 or 1 yields the syntax of the primary algebra of G. Spencer-Brown's Laws of Form. A basis for 2 is a set of equations, called axioms, from which all of the above equations (and more) can be derived. There are many known bases for all Boolean algebras and hence for 2. An elegant basis notated using only concatenation and overbar is: # \\\\ ABC = BCA (Concatenation commutes, associates) # \\\\overline{A}A = 1 (2 is a complemented lattice, with an upper bound of 1) #\\\\ A0 = A (0 is the lower bound). # A\\\\overline{AB} = A\\\\overline{B} (2 is a distributive lattice) Where concatenation = OR, 1 = true, and 0 = false, or concatenation = AND, 1 = false, and 0 = true. (overbar is negation in both cases.) If 0=1, (1)-(3) are the axioms for an abelian group. (1) only serves to prove that concatenation commutes and associates. First assume that (1) associates from either the left or the right, then prove commutativity. Then prove association from the other direction. Associativity is simply association from the left and right combined. This basis makes for an easy approach to proof, called \\"calculation\\" in Laws of Form, that proceeds by simplifying expressions to 0 or 1, by invoking axioms (2)-(4), and the elementary identities AA=A, \\\\overline{\\\\overline{A}}=A, 1+A = 1, and the distributive law. ==Metatheory== De Morgan's theorem states that if one does the following, in the given order, to any Boolean function: * Complement every variable; * Swap '+' and '∙' operators (taking care to add brackets to ensure the order of operations remains the same); * Complement the result, the result is logically equivalent to what you started with. Repeated application of De Morgan's theorem to parts of a function can be used to drive all complements down to the individual variables. A powerful and nontrivial metatheorem states that any theorem of 2 holds for all Boolean algebras. Conversely, an identity that holds for an arbitrary nontrivial Boolean algebra also holds in 2. Hence all the mathematical content of Boolean algebra is captured by 2. This theorem is useful because any equation in 2 can be verified by a decision procedure. Logicians refer to this fact as \\"2 is decidable\\". All known decision procedures require a number of steps that is an exponential function of the number of variables N appearing in the equation to be verified. Whether there exists a decision procedure whose steps are a polynomial function of N falls under the P = NP conjecture. ==See also== *Boolean algebra *Bounded set *Lattice (order) *Order theory ==References== ==Further reading== Many elementary texts on Boolean algebra were published in the early years of the computer era.

The resort is the seventh Disney Vacation Club resort and is situated on the former site of the Disney Institute. It first opened May 17, 2004 and was built in three phases. It is now the largest Disney Vacation Club resort. The resort was inspired by the city of Saratoga Springs, New York. The resort was designed by Graham Gund Architects of Cambridge, Massachusetts. There are a total of 18 Villa Buildings providing 828 Vacation Home Units (1,260 guest rooms), plus an additional 60 Treehouse Villas. Available rooms range from single room studios to three bedroom extended family suites on two floors (Grand Villas). Like other Disney Vacation Club resorts, the studios offer kitchenettes, bathrooms, one queen bed, and one sleeper sofa. While the resort has one of the lowest costs for villas on property, the Springs area is now premier status, resulting in increased prices due to the popularity. The popularity of this area is a result of the location, being one of the closest areas to the main lobby including two restaurants, the Artist's Palette and The Turf Club Bar and Grill, and the main pool, High Rock Spring pool. In October 2007, the resort received designation in the Florida Green Lodging Program. A view of Congress Park, the first phase of Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa which opened in May 2004. ==History== The resort opened in 4 phases: * Phase 1: 4 Villa Buildings in one section called Congress Park opened with 184 Vacation Home units (280 guest rooms) on May 17, 2004. * Phase 2: 8 Villa Buildings in two sections called The Springs and The Paddock started opening in Spring 2005 eventually adding 368 Vacation Home Units (560 guest rooms). * Phase 3: 6 Villa Buildings in two sections called The Carousel and The Grandstand completed the (then) final phase of this large resort in Summer 2007, adding 276 Vacation Home Units (420 guest rooms). *Phase 4: Treehouse Villas built in natural forest glens with 60 three-bedroom homes opened on June 1, 2009. These stand-alone structures—elevated 10 feet off the ground on pedestals and beams—are nestled unobtrusively into natural glens alongside the Sassagoula River. ==Reservations== Reservations may be made directly through Disney like a normal hotel, and Disney Vacation Club members may book reservations using their vacation club points. Intermediary agencies allow non Disney Vacation Club members to book reservations using Disney Vacation Club Points. == Dining == The Turf Club Bar and Grill offers a full-service restaurant and lounge area. The lounge area is known as the \\"Turf Club Lounge\\" which offers a full- size pool table and full-service bar. The Turf Club restaurant serves only dinner. The Artist's Palette is a market-style counter service eatery that offers both hot and cold meals and food grocery items including a bakery and wine selection. The restaurant is themed after an artist's studio. The Artist's Palette also offers a gift shop adjacent to the eatery with Disney merchandise, resort merchandise, sundries, and other convenience items for guests. On The Rocks pool bar is the main poolside bar located at the High Rock Spring Pool. The bar offers alcoholic drinks and beverages, soft drinks, light snacks, and a refillable mug station. The Paddock Grill is a poolside bar at The Paddock Pool. In addition to offering drinks it also has a lengthy counter service food menu. It is open all day, including having many breakfast options. The Backstretch Pool Bar is a poolside bar at The Grandstand pool. In addition to drinks, this poolside bar offers some light meals and snacks. == Spa and recreation == The Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa offers recreational activities. Recreational activities includes the main pool, three additional pools, a spa and fitness center, bike and surrey rentals, an arcade, a \\"Community Hall\\" (arts, crafts, and entertainment center), and the Lake Buena Vista Golf Club. Senses - A Disney Spa offers professional spa treatments and packages. The center features relaxing mineral pools and private treatment rooms for spa guests. Lake Buena Vista Golf Course is a golf course. The golf club entrance is located on the lower level of the Carriage House lobby building and is only accessible behind the Carriage House lobby building below the Turf Club Bar & Grill. The course has been a host to PGA and LPGA events. High Rock Spring Pool is the original feature pool of the resort located outside the main/clubhouse building. It is designed as a natural spring with rocks, geysers, trees, and other themed touches. It features a zero-depth entry into the pool, a waterslide that starts at the top of the spring with turns and drops into the pool below, two hot tubs outside the pool, a pop jets area for young children (with Donald Duck in a spring), and an adult bar called \\"On The Rocks Pool Bar\\" with pool chairs. The Paddock Pool is a second feature pool. Added in 2011, it was built due to the increased guest capacity of the Saratoga Springs Resort. Following the addition of this pool, guests who are located in the back of this large themed resort no longer must travel to the original feature pool all the way in front of resort to enjoy a feature pool. This second feature pool is the same size of the original feature pool and is themed to Paddock Village and the Springs area with a zero-depth entry into the pool, a waterslide that starts in a water tower-type structure and goes into the pool, two hot tubs, a restroom/changing room facility, and a quick service restaurant serving American, healthy, children's and Italian foods in a building themed to a Paddock building similar to the main lobby area. This building also includes a fountain drink station which accommodates to guests who purchase the souvenir mugs that get free refills. A seating area for a quick service restaurant, a pool bar adjacent to the restaurant, pool chairs and play area for young children with a spring creek theme are included. The children's play area includes smaller waterslides and a splash bucket that drops every few minutes. Additional pools are also located in The Grandstand, Congress Park, and at the Treehouse Villas. These 'quiet' pools also include whirlpools, and many include children's play areas. == Transportation == Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa is served by Disney Transport bus and watercraft transportation. For bus service, there are five bus stops located throughout the resort. The bus stops are The Springs (Guest Villa 3101 - 4436 & The Carriage House), Congress Park (Guest Villas 1101 - 2836), The Paddock (Guest Villas 4501 - 6836), The Carousel (Guest Villas 7101 - 7836), and The Grandstand (Guest Villas 8101 - 9836). Buses at Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa have direct routes to all theme parks and water parks such as the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, Disney's Animal Kingdom, Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon. As of August 29, an internal bus route serving all stations will be available. Watercraft service is available to Disney Springs, with connecting service to Disney's Old Key West Resort and Disney's Port Orleans Resort at Disney Springs. Bus transportation to Disney Springs only goes to the Congress Park bus stop as of November 2016 due to access via watercraft and walking. In addition to the water taxi and bus service, there is a walkway that connects the resort to Disney Springs. Transportation to a Walt Disney World Resort Golf Course is also available by taxi, which will be arranged by the Bell Services Desk, located at the Carriage House. Upon return to Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa, the Pro Shop at the golf course will arrange a return taxi. This service is free of charge. There is an easement for monorail expansion, but there are currently no plans for such an expansion. As of January 2017, the springs area rooms are now premiere status, resulting in higher costs per night. The popularity of this area has increased in recent years due to the proximity to the main area including Artists pallet, high springs pool, and the dining restaurant. == Disney Vacation Club Preview Center == The Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa contains the Disney Vacation Club Preview Center, the official open house and sales center for the Disney Vacation Club. The center includes a preview lobby and several full- scale model villas of the latest Disney Vacation Club resorts. == Walt Disney World Conference Center == The Walt Disney World Conference Center was a chalet-style building that was designed for small and medium-sized business meetings. It opened in August 1980 along the banks of Club Lake and was then converted into part of the Disney Institute. It was later demolished when construction began on the Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa, which now stands on the grounds of the former Institute. The conference center had four rooms which could be broken down into several configurations. The largest breakout room, at , could seat 505 guests with theater-style seating. Each meeting room faced the lake and had automatic lighting that would turn on when external light conditions required them. Meeting planners could have themed entertainment with the Disney characters as well as the ability to arrange for a round of golf or a tennis match. The conference center could not handle large conventions and the large groups were forced to use newly created meeting spaces at the Walt Disney World Dolphin, Walt Disney World Swan, Disney's Contemporary Resort, and Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa hotels, which resulted in the closure of the conference center. == References == == External links == * Category:Disney Vacation Club Category:Hotels established in 2004 Category:Hotel buildings completed in 2004 Category:2004 establishments in Florida ","title":"Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort &amp; Spa"},{"id":"2584458","text":"Tashi Lhunpo Monastery (), founded in 1447 by the 1st Dalai Lama,Chö Yang: The Voice of Tibetan Religion and Culture.

Gangchen Kyishong, Dharmasala, H.P., India. is the traditional monastic seat of the Panchen Lama, and an historically and culturally important monastery in Shigatse, the second-largest city in Tibet. The monastery was sacked when the Gorkha Kingdom invaded Tibet and captured Shigatse in 1791 before a combined Tibetan and Chinese army drove them back as far as the outskirts of Kathmandu,Chapman, Spencer F.

Readers Union Ltd., London. when they were forced to agree to keep the peace in the future, pay tribute every five years, and return what they had looted from Tashi Lhunpo.Richardson (1984), p. 69. The monastery is the traditional seat of successive Panchen Lamas, the second highest ranking tulku lineage in the Gelug tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. The \\"Tashi\\" or Panchen Lama had temporal power over three small districts, though not over the town of Shigatse itself, which was administered by a dzongpön (prefect) appointed from Lhasa.Chapman (1940), p. 141. Located on a hill in the center of the city, the full name in Tibetan of the monastery means \\"all fortune and happiness gathered here\\" or \\"heap of glory\\". Captain Samuel Turner, a British officer with the East India Company who visited the monastery in the late 18th century, described it in the following terms: Monks hurrying to services, Tashi Lhunpo, 1993 Pilgrims circumambulate the monastery on the lingkhor (sacred path) outside the walls. Although two-thirds of the buildings were destroyed during the excesses of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, they were mainly the residences for the 4,000 monksDowman (1988), p. 273Chapman (1940), p. 140. and the monastery itself was not as extensively damaged as most other religious structures in Tibet, for it was the seat of the Panchen Lama who remained in Chinese-controlled territory. However, during 1966 Red Guards led a crowd to break statues, burn scriptures and open the stupas containing the relics of the 5th to 9th Panchen Lamas, and throw them in the river. Some remains, though, were saved by locals, and in 1985, Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama, began the construction of a new stupa to house them and honour his predecessors. It was finally consecrated on 22 January 1989, just six days before he died aged fifty-one at Tashi Lhunpo. \\"It was as if he was saying now he could rest.\\"Sun (2008), pp. 84–85. Two novice monks. Tashi Lhunpo, 1993 ==History== The Thanka Wall overlooking the monastery The monastery was founded in 1447 CE by Gedun Drub, the disciple of the famous Buddhist philosopher Je Tsongkhapa and later named the First Dalai Lama. The construction was financed by donations from local nobles. Later Lobsang Chökyi Gyalsten, the Fourth Panchen Lama and the first Panchen Lama to be recognized as such by the rulers of Mongolia, made major expansions to the monastery. Since then, all Panchen Lamas have resided at Tashi Lhunpo, and have managed to expand it gradually. In 1791 the monastery was attacked and looted by an army of Nepalese Gurkha warriors but were driven out by the Tibetans, and by the Chinese who simultaneously strengthened their position in the temple and Tibet. In 1960, the monastery was dismantled by the Chinese army whilst the Panchen Lama was absent, although less damage was inflicted on the monastery than on most others around Tibet. During the 1960s many senior lamas and monastics left Tibet and helped re-establish new monasteries in India, Nepal and Bhutan. The late Panchen Lama did not leave Tibet and consequently many of the senior lamas from Tashi Lhunpo Monastery remained inside Tibet. Therefore, while other monasteries-in-exile have expanded and developed under the guidance of senior lamas, Tashi Lhunpo has remained at a disadvantage, although in 1972 a new campus of Tashi Lhunpo Monastery was built by Tibetan exiles at a settlement in Bylakuppe, Karnātakā in southern India. The 11th Panchen Lama, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, was officially recognised by the 14th Dalai Lama on 14 May 1995, then kidnapped by Chinese authorities on 17 May 1995 before his enthronement at Tashi Lhunpo. Gedhun Choekyi Nyima remains forcibly detained at an undisclosed location. Choekyi Gyalpo, the Chinese government's proxy acting as the 11th Panchen Lama was disputedly enthroned under Chinese supervision at the monastery in November/December 1995, after Gedhun Choekyi Nyima had already been officially recognized. Since the early 1980s parts of the Tashi Lhunpo monastery have been open to the public. Tashi Lhunpo in its heyday housed over 4,000 monks and had four Tantric colleges, each with its own Khenpo, or Abbot. After the death of a Panchen Lama, these four Khenpos led the search for his infant reincarnation and one of them always acted as a prime minister of Tsang under the control of the Dalai Lama in Lhasa. Tashi Lhunpo is an important tourist attraction in Tibet today. ==Branch monasteries== Tashilhunpo Monastery.

II c. 29) was one of the legislative measures introduced by the British Parliament, within its system of Trade and Navigation Acts. The Act sought to increase the importation of pig and bar iron from its American colonies and to prevent the building of iron-related production facilities within these colonies, particularly in North America where these raw materials were identified. The dual purpose of the act was to increase manufacturing capacity within Great Britain itself, and to limit potential competition from the colonies possessing the raw materials. ==The provisions of the Act== The Act contained several provisions, applying from 24 June 1750: * Duty on the import of pig iron from America should cease. * Duty on bar iron imported to London should cease. * Such bar iron might be carried coastwise or by land from there to Royal Navy dockyards, but otherwise not beyond 10 miles from London. * The iron must be marked with its place of origin (most, if not all, pig iron was already marked). * No mill or engine for slitting or rolling iron or any plating forge to work with a tilt hammer or any furnace for making steel should be erected in America. * Colonial governors were required to certify what mills of these types already existed. ==Its later amendments and repeal== The limitation of imported bar iron to London and the dockyards was partly repealed in 1757 by 30 Geo. II c.16, duty- free imports to any part of Great Britain being permitted. A clause requiring bar iron to be marked was similarly repealed as unnecessary. A part of the act was also repealed by the American dominions (Trade with) Act 1765, (5 Geo. III c.45). The whole Act was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1867, due to the replacement of colonial rule with the Dominion of Canada. ==Implications== Pig iron had been exported from Virginia and Maryland since the 1720s, but little came from other colonies, nor did bar iron. The continuance of this was encouraged, as was the production and export of bar iron (which required a finery forge using a helve hammer not a trip hammer). Conversely, the Act was designed to restrict the colonial manufacture of finished iron products and steel. Existing works could continue in operation, but no expansion would be possible in the output of: *knives, scythes, sickles and other edged tools as a tilt hammer would be needed to produce thin iron, and a steel furnace to make steel. *nails which were made from rod iron, from a slitting mill. *Tinplate, which required a rolling mill. This was the raw material from which tinsmiths made a wide variety of goods from tinned sheet iron. This was a continuation of a long term British policy, beginning with the British Navigation Acts, which were designed to direct most American trade to England (from 1707, Great Britain), and to encourage the manufacture of goods for export to the colonies in Britain. The Iron Act, if enforced, would have severely limited the emerging iron manufacturing industry in the colonies. However, as with other trade legislation, enforcement was poor because no one had any significant incentive to ensure compliance. Nevertheless, this was one of a number of measures restrictive on the trade of British Colonies in North America that were one of the causes of the American Revolution. Part of the reason for lax enforcement may be due to the involvement of Colonial Officials in iron works. Virginia Governors Gooch and Spotswood were both deeply involved in iron manufacture. Gooch was a part owner of the Fredericksville Ironworks. Spotswood owned Tubal Ironworks (a blast furnace and probably finery forge) and the double air furnace at Massaponnax. Other prominent members of the Virginia aristocracy and House of Burgesses involved in the iron industry included John Tayloe (Bristol Ironworks, near Fredericksburg; Neabsco Ironworks; and Occoquan Ironworks), Augustine Washington, George's father (Accoceek/Potomac Ironworks), and Benjamin Grimes (Grimes Recovery and a bloomery near Fredericksburg). ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Contemporary debate on the Iron Act * Green Castle Museum website * Text of the Iron Act Act Category:Great Britain Acts of Parliament 1750 Category:Laws leading to the American Revolution Category:1750 in the Thirteen Colonies Category:Repealed Great Britain Acts of Parliament ","title":"Iron Act"},{"id":"2584470","text":"Chinese Air Force may refer to: *People's Republic of China military air ** People's Liberation Army Air Force: the air force of the People's Republic of China ** People's Liberation Army Naval Air Force: the air component of the navy ** People's Liberation Army Ground Air Force: the air component of the ground force *Republic of China military air: **Republic of China Air Force: the air force of China from 1920 to 1949, 1949 until now operating Taiwan only. **Republic of China Navy air component: Republic of China Naval Aviation Command **Republic of China Army air component *China Air Task Force: An interim unit formed mainly from the Flying Tigers after their disbandment on July 4, 1942 and before their reunion, in part, within the 14th Air Force in 1943.

It was written and produced by the husband-and-wife team of Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer, and directed by Shyer. == Plot == Peter Brackett and Sabrina Peterson are two rival Chicago newspaper reporters. Sabrina is young and ambitious, whereas Peter is a fading star and has just published his first novel. They reluctantly join forces to unravel the mystery behind a train derailment. They argue over almost everything but discover a conspiracy involving genetically altered milk. ==Cast== * Julia Roberts - Sabrina Peterson * Nick Nolte - Peter Brackett * Saul Rubinek - Sam Smotherman/Ernesto Vargas * James Rebhorn - The Thin Man * Robert Loggia - Matt Greenfield, Chronicle Editor * Kelly Rutherford - Kim * Olympia Dukakis - Jeannie, Peter's Secretary * Marsha Mason - Senator Gayle Robbins * Eugene Levy - Justice of the Peace * Charles Martin Smith - Rick Medwick * Dan Butler - Wilson Chess * Paul Gleason - Kenny Bacon * Jane Adams - Evans * Lisa Lu - Virginia Harvey * Nora Dunn - Lindy * Megan Cavanagh - Mrs. Delores Beekman ==Production== Nolte and Roberts notoriously did not get along with each other during the making of the film. Roberts has described him as \\"disgusting,\\" whereas Nolte has said she's \\"not a nice person.\\" ==Reception== The film grossed over $30 million in box-office receipts in the United States and less than $62 million worldwide. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 22% rating based on 46 reviews. The site's consensus states: \\"There appears to be no Love lost between the fatally mismatched coupling of Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte in this screwball misfire that just isn't worth the Trouble.\\" Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F. Todd McCarthy of Variety magazine wrote: \\"The goings-on seem lacking in wit and inspiration, tolerably entertaining but far from effervescent.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \\"Maybe it would have been funnier if the evil cow conglomerate had been replaced by something sillier and more lightweight; it's hard to sustain a romantic comedy in the face of death threats.\\" According to Nolte, it's the worst film he has ever appeared in. He felt he sold his soul by doing it, and he did it only for the money. As a result, he was tense while on the set, and did not have a good working- relationship with Julia Roberts. Roberts has on her part called Nolte the worst actor she has ever worked with.Nick Nolte - Biography TalkTalk == Year- end lists == * 6th worst – Peter Travers, Rolling Stone * Top 12 worst (Alphabetically ordered, not ranked) – David Elliott, The San Diego Union- Tribune *Dishonorable mention – Glenn Lovell, San Jose Mercury News * Dishonorable mention – Dan Craft, The Pantagraph ==Music== Elmer Bernstein originally wrote the underscore, but his music was thrown out and David Newman called in at such a late stage that posters with Bernstein's name on the credits were already displayed. With only two weeks to rescore the film, Newman - who usually orchestrates the bulk of his scores himself - utilized a small army of orchestrators to help him complete the score: Scott Smalley, Chris Boardman, William Kidd, Peter Tomashek, Steven Bramson, Christopher Klatman, Don Davis, Joel Rosenbaum, Arthur Kempel (misspelt \\"Kempl\\" in the end credits), Mark McKenzie, Brad Warnaar (misspelt \\"Warner\\" in the end credits) and John Neufeld. The soundtrack album was released by Varèse Sarabande, including a cover version of the Smokey Robinson song \\"You've Really Got a Hold on Me\\"; only Smalley and Boardman receive orchestrator credit on the album (however, Ross receives an acknowledgement - as does Alan Silvestri, who was also attached to the project). # Here's Peter (5:09) # Here's Sabrina (1:54) # Calling All Boggs (1:15) # Honeymoon Night (4:55) # Two Scoop Snoops (3:39) # Everybody Buys the Globe (:46) # Scoop de Jour (3:15) # Sabrina's Hip (1:04) # Wild Goose Chase (1:16) # The Beekman Agreement (2:02) # Keyhole Foreplay (1:20) # Happily Ever After (2:21) # \\"I Love Trouble\\" (3:43) # You've Really Got a Hold On Me - Robbyn Kirmsse (3:37) ==References* Category:1994 films Category:Films directed by Charles Shyer Category:Films with screenplays by Charles Shyer Category:1990s romantic comedy films Category:Films set in Chicago Category:Films shot in Chicago Category:Films shot in Wisconsin Category:American films Category:English- language films Category:Touchstone Pictures films Category:Caravan Pictures films Category:Films about journalists Category:Films with screenplays by Nancy Meyers Category:Films scored by David Newman Category:1994 comedy films ","title":"I Love Trouble (1994 film)"},{"id":"2584477","text":"Disney's Old Key West Resort is a Disney Vacation Club resort at the Walt Disney World Resort.

The location was one of the main cities of the Roman province of Mauretania Tingitana. ==Geography== Ancient Lixus is located on Tchemmich Hill on the right bank of the Loukkos River (other names: Oued Loukous; Locus River). It lies just to the north of the modern seaport of Larache.Prehistoria de España: Trabajos dedicados al IV Congreso Internacional, Santiago Alcobé y Noguer The site lies within the urban perimeter of Larache, and about three kilometres inland from the mouth of the river and the Atlantic ocean. From its 80 metres above the plain the site dominates the marshes through which the river flows. To the north, Lixus is surrounded by hills which themselves are bordered to the north and east by a forest of cork oaks. Among the ruins are Roman baths, temples, 4th-century walls, a mosaic floor, a Christian church and the intricate and confusing remains of the Capitol Hill. ==History== ===Legends=== Some ancient Greek writers located at Lixus the mythological garden of the Hesperides, the keepers of the golden apples. The name of the city was often mentioned by writers from Hanno the Navigator to the Geographer of Ravenna, and confirmed by the legend on its coins and by an inscription. The ancients believed Lixus to be the site of the Garden of the Hesperides and of a sanctuary of Hercules, where Hercules gathered gold apples, more ancient than the one at Cadiz, Spain. However, there are no grounds for the claim that Lixus was founded at the end of the second millennium BC. ===Phoenicians=== Lixus (, ) was first settled by the Phoenicians in the 8th or 7th centuryBC and was later controlled directly from Carthage. It was part of a chain of Punic towns along the Atlantic coast of modern Morocco; other major settlements further to the south are Chellah (called Sala Colonia by the Romans)C. Michael Hogan, Chellah, The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham and Mogador. When Carthage's empire fell to Rome during the Punic Wars, Lixus, Chellah, and Mogador became outposts of the province of Mauretania Tingitana. ==== Ambiguous \\"Punicity\\" ==== Archaeologist, Pierre Cintas, in 1954 concluded that while Carthaginian pottery was discovered in Moroccan sites, no archaeological evidence existed for the presence of Carthaginian settlers in Lixus even though historians identified the city as being one of Phoenician foundation and serving as an important city of the Punic west. Armand Luquet, in the 1970s also found insufficient archaeological data which could serve as evidence for Carthaginian settlement of Lixus. In relation to the 'Punicity' of Moroccan sites such as Lixus, Professor Josephine Crawley Quinn stresses an ambiguity: \\"It is not in fact easy to demonstrate any occupation of coastal sites by Carthaginian colonists or other settlers, since most of the sites traditionally labelled 'Punic' could be interpreted equally well as indigenous settlements engaged in the exchange of local products for imported goods.\\" ===Roman Empire=== Lixus flourished during the Roman Empire, mainly when the emperor Claudius (AD 41-54) established the province of Africa with full rights for the citizens. Lixus was one of the few Roman cities in Berber Africa that enjoyed an amphitheater. In the third century, Lixus became nearly fully Christian and there are even now the ruins of a Paleochristian church overlooking the archaeological area. ===Destruction=== The Muslim invasions destroyed the Roman city. Some Berber life was maintained for about a century after the Islamic conquest of North Africa, attested by the presence of a mosque and a house with a patio with walls covered with painted stucco. ===Archaeological work=== The site was excavated continuously from 1948 to 1969.The Phoenicians, by Sabatino Moscati In the 1960s, Lixus was restored and consolidated. In 1989, following an international conference which brought together many scientists, specialists, historians and archaeologists of the Mediterranean around the history and archaeology of Lixus, the site was partly enclosed. Work was undertaken to study the Roman mosaics of the site, which constitute a very rich unit. Lixus was on a surface of approximately . The excavated zones constitute approximately 20% of the total surface of the site. == World Heritage Status == This site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on July 1, 1995 in the Cultural category. ==See also== * Iulia Valentia Banasa * Iulia Constantia Zilil * Iulia Campestris Babba * Tingis * Tamuda * Thamusida * Volubilis * Sala Colonia * Roman 'Coloniae' in Berber Africa ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * * . == External links == * Lexicorient entry * Ville de Lixus - UNESCO World Heritage Centre * Lixus the Roman city Category:Mauretania Tingitana Category:Populated places established in the 7th century BC Category:Phoenician colonies in Africa Category:Roman towns and cities in Morocco Category:Archaeological sites in Morocco Category:Buildings and structures in Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima Category:Larache ","title":"Lixus (ancient city)"},{"id":"2584556","text":"\\"Missouri Waltz\\" is the official state song of Missouri and is associated with the University of Missouri. ==History== The \\"Missouri Waltz\\", which had been a minstrel song, became the state song under an act adopted by the General Assembly on June 30, 1949. The song came from a melody John Valentine Eppel heard Lee Edgar Settle play. Mr. Settle was a well known rag time piano player and the song he wrote and played, The Graveyard Waltz, was the actual melody for the Missouri Waltz. John V. Eppel claimed he wrote it but it was well known at the time that the melody was actually written by Lee Edgar Settle. The Missouri Waltz was arranged by Frederic Knight Logan, using lyrics written by James Royce Shannon. First published in 1914, early popular versions were by The Victor Military Band, Prince's Orchestra, Jaudas' Society Orchestra, Elsie Baker, Henry Burr & Albert Campbell, and by Earl Fuller. The song enjoyed fresh success in 1939 when it was featured in the film The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Sales increased substantially after Missourian Harry S Truman became president, and it was reported that the \\"Missouri Waltz\\" was his favorite song. Although, when asked about his feelings the following reply was published by the White House: > \\"President's attitude towards the song? He can take it or leave it. Is it > really his favorite? No. Does he play it often? No. Is Margaret ever heard > singing it? No. What is the President's reaction to song's adoption by > Missouri as state song? See answer to first question.\\"\\"A History of > Missouri\\" by Richard S. Kirkendall, University of Missouri Press, 1986, p > 389 Although the song is often associated with Harry Truman, the president did not claim it as his favorite song. In fact, he had this to say about it in a television interview: \\"If you let me say what I think, I don't give a ... about it, but I can't say it out loud because it's the song of Missouri. It's as bad as 'The Star Spangled Banner' as far as music is concerned.\\" The song was performed a capella by Marideth Sisco for the opening scene of the 2010 film Winter's Bone which starred Jennifer Lawrence in her breakout role. The song is played by the University of Missouri's Marching Mizzou at every home football game to a unique marching style in 3/4 time. Singer Linda Ronstadt reports that the Missouri Waltz has been an earworm in recent years. == Lyrics == Hush-a-bye, ma baby, slumbertime is comin' soon; Rest yo' head upon my breast while Mommy hums a tune; The sandman is callin' where shadows are fallin', While the soft breezes sigh as in days long gone by. Way down in Missouri where I heard this melody, When I was a little child upon my Mommy's knee; The old folks were hummin'; their banjos were strummin'; So sweet and low. Strum, strum, strum, GUM, strum, Seems I hear those banjos playin' once again, Hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, That same old plaintive strain. Hear that mournful melody, It just haunts you the whole day long, And you wander in dreams back to Dixie, it seems, When you hear that old time song. Hush-a-bye ma baby, go to sleep on Mommy's knee, Journey back to Dixieland in dreams again with me; It seems like your Mommy is there once again, And the old folks were strummin' that same old refrain. Way down in Missouri where I learned this lullaby, When the stars were blinkin' and the moon was climbin' high, Seems I hear voices low, as in days long ago, Singin' hush-a-bye. The original 1914 lyrics: Hush-a-bye, ma baby, slumbertime is comin' soon; Rest yo' head upon my chest while Mammy hums a tune; The sandman is callin' where shadows are fallin', While the soft breezes sigh as in days long gone by. Way down in Missouri where I heard this melody, When I was a Pickaninny on ma Mammy's knee; The darkies were hummin'; their banjos were strummin'; So sweet and low. Strum, strum, strum, strum, strum, Seems I hear those banjos playin' once again, Hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, That same old plaintive strain. Hear that mournful melody, It just haunts you the whole day long, And you wander in dreams back to Dixie, it seems, When you hear that old time song. Hush-a-bye ma baby, go to sleep on Mammy's knee, Journey back to Dixieland in dreams again with me; It seems like your Mammy was there once again, And the darkies were strummin' that same old refrain.

Maya is known for her disastrous relationship with Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) and her dangerous feud with Dev's wife Sunita Parekh (Shobna Gulati). She held the pair hostage in her flat, and set the building on fire. As she made her escape, Maya was involved in a car accident. ==Storylines== Maya, dubbed \\"Mad Maya\\", starts out as a lawyer. Originally, she advises Roy (David Neilson) and Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh) about matters regarding legal custody of baby Amy Barlow. She falls for shopkeeper Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin), who seems to take an immediate liking to her. Despite striking up a friendship with Frankie Baldwin (Debra Stephenson), very quickly, it seems there is something wrong as she steals vases and kidnaps Monica, Tyrone Dobbs' (Alan Halsall) dog. She also leaves a restaurant without paying and drives Dev around a country road extremely fast, threatening not to stop the car unless he proposes to her. At her engagement party to Dev, Tyrone tries to ruin the event by telling everyone that she killed his dog and he compares her to Cruella De Vil, but she resists this. Dev rekindled his love for ex-girlfriend Sunita Parekh (Shobna Gulati) when he discovers she has a brain tumour. Maya is sympathetic and decides to use this by playing the caring friend and telling Sunita she might be putting pressure on Dev. When Dev announces his love for Sunita, Maya trashes the shop and the flat. Sunita recovers and Dev dumps Maya and starts dating Sunita again. At Dev and Sunita's engagement party, Maya wrecks Sunita's dress by spilling a glass of wine on it. Then, she marries several illegal immigrants, posing as Sunita. Consequently Dev and Sunita are arrested on their wedding day as the marriage is not legal. Dev is freed and starts investigating, finding a taxi driver who took Maya to one of the illegal weddings to convince the police that Maya was behind these plans. This clears Sunita's name and she is released and Maya is arrested and charged but released on bail. In revenge, she sets fire to all of Dev's shops before taking Sunita hostage. She phones Dev and asks him to come home, which he does, and finds a message from Maya in lipstick on the table, telling him to go to the shop on Coronation Street. This is the only property that has not been destroyed. When he arrives and sees a bound and gagged Sunita, he tells her that everything will be ok but Maya knocks him out and ties him up too. When he wakes up, they talk about how he dumped her and how upset she was. Later a policeman comes to the door. Dev screams to attract attention but Maya gags him to stop his cries for help and tells the police that she is Sunita. While she does this, Dev gets a knife and cuts his legs free. When Maya returns, she turns the gas on the stove on and leaves the kitchen, telling Dev that if he believes in reincarnation that maybe next time he would come back as something better and starts a fire in the shop below, leaving them tied up inside a locked room. Soon, Jamie Baldwin (Rupert Hill) and Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) notice the fire and Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) calls the fire brigade. Dev breaks the window with the curtain rail, attracting the attention of people below. Ciaran McCarthy (Keith Duffy) and Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward) come to the rescue. Dev is released by Ciaran while Charlie rescues Sunita just before the shop explodes. Maya is quite shocked when Dev and Sunita are rescued as she is watching from her car at the other end of the street and then tries running Dev and Sunita over but misses when Charlie and Ciaran pull them out of the way. She crashes into a wall but gets up and starts the car again, reversing it out to try again but a truck crashes into the back and smashes her into another wall. Maya is alive and goes to the same hospital as Sunita but when Sunita finds out, she leaves immediately as she is worried about her safety until Shelley Unwin (Sally Lindsay) tells her that Maya is on life support and her hospital room is under police guard. After coming out of intensive care, Maya is remanded in custody to await trial. Little is now known about Maya. She was last mentioned when Leanne offered Dev a share of her restaurant business in 2007 as Maya had tried to tempt Leanne into suing Dev for unfair dismissal from the Corner Shop at the beginning of her campaign of revenge. ==Reception== In 2004, ITV received complaints because of a scene in which viewers saw Maya threaten Sunita with a statue of Hindu god Lord Ganesh. ITV has apologised for the scene, But Hindu leaders rejected the apology. Ramesh Kallidai, secretary of the Hindu Forum of Britain, said: \\"The apology is not unconditional, it makes a justification for the behaviour. This is not acceptable to us.\\" The scene was part of a long-running storyline in the ITV1 soap. It showed Maya, played by Sasha Behar, threatening Sunita (Shobna Gulati), saying her husband would come home to find her \\"beaten to death by Ganesh\\", the God of good fortune. Radio Times included Maya on their feature profiling bunny boilers. Opining on her fixation with Dev they stated: \\"While we might question the object of Maya's fixation - Dev, for heaven's sake? - there's no denying her single-mindedness.\\" They also commented on her career status adding: \\"As ever in soap, the middle classes are trouble - Maya was a solicitor.\\" ==See also== *List of soap opera villains ==References== ==External links== Category:Coronation Street characters Category:Fictional lawyers Category:Television characters introduced in 2003 Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional characters with psychiatric disorders Category:Female villains ","title":"Maya Sharma"},{"id":"2584567","text":"Negusa Nagast Haile Selassie with other Ethiopian nobles and retainers. Ras Makonnen Wolde Mikael surrounded by retainers. Until the end of the Ethiopian monarchy in 1974, there were two categories of nobility in Ethiopia. The Mesafint ( , modern , singular , modern , \\"prince\\"), the hereditary nobility, formed the upper echelon of the ruling class. The Mekwanint (, modern singular , modern or , \\"governor\\") were the appointed nobles, often of humble birth, who formed the bulk of the aristocracy. Until the 20th century, the most powerful people at court were generally members of the Mekwanint appointed by the monarch, while regionally, the Mesafint enjoyed greater influence and power. Emperor Haile Selassie greatly curtailed the power of the Mesafint to the benefit of the Mekwanint, who by then were essentially coterminous with the Ethiopian government. The Mekwanint were officials who had been granted specific offices in the Abyssinian government or court. Higher ranks from the title of Ras through to Balambaras were also bestowed upon members of the Mekwanint. A member of the Mesafint, however, would traditionally be given precedence over a member of the Mekwanint of the same rank. For example, Ras Mengesha Yohannes, son of Emperor Yohannes IV and thus a member of the Mesafint, would have outranked Ras Alula Engida, who was of humble birth and therefore a member of the Mekwanint, even though their ranks were equal. There were also parallel rules of precedence, primarily seniority based on age, on offices held, and on when they each obtained their titles, which made the rules for precedence rather complex. Combined with the ambiguous position of titled heirs of members of the Mekwanint, Emperor Haile Selassie, as part of his programme of modernising reforms, and in line with his aims of centralising power away from the Mesafint, replaced the traditional system of precedence with a simplified, Western-inspired system that gave precedence by rank, and then by seniority based when the title had been assumed irrespective of how the title was acquired. ==Imperial and royal titles== ===Negusa Nagast=== Emperor Tewodros II of the Ethiopian Empire. The Negusa Nagast ( , \\"King of Kings\\") was the Emperor of Ethiopia. Although several kings of Aksum used this style, until the restoration of the Solomonic dynasty under Yekuno Amlak, rulers of Ethiopia generally used the style of Negus, although \\"King of Kings\\" was used as far back as Ezana. The full title of the Emperor of Ethiopia was Negusa Nagast and Seyoume Igziabeher (; \\"Elect of God\\"). The title Moa Anbessa Ze Imnegede Yehuda (\\"Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah\\") always preceded the titles of the Emperor. It was not a personal title but rather referred to the title of Jesus and placed the office of Christ ahead of the Emperor's name in an act of Imperial submission. Until the reign of Yohannes IV, the Emperor was also Neguse Tsion (, , \\"King of Zion\\"), whose seat was at Axum, and which conferred hegemony over much of the north of the Empire. The Emperor was referred to by the dignities of the formal Girmawi (, , \\"His Imperial Majesty\\"), in common speech as Janhoy ( , \\"Your [Imperial] Majesty, or lit. \\"sire\\" ), in his own household and family as Getochu (our Master in the plural), and when referred to by name in the third person with the suffix of Atse (effectively \\"Emperor\\", i.e. Atse Menelik). All formal speech concerning the Emperor was in the plural, as was his own speech; Haile Selassie, for instance, referred to himself in the first-person plural at all times, even in casual conversation and when speaking in French (however this was not the case when he spoke in English, in which he was not fully fluent). ===Nigiste Negestatt=== Empress Regnant Zewditu of the Ethiopian Empire. The Nigiste Negestatt (ንግሥተ ነገሥታት ) was Empress Regnant in her own right, literally \\"Queen of Kings,\\" or \\"Queen of Queens,\\" or \\"female ruler of an empire.\\" Zewditu (reigned 1917–1930) was the only woman to be crowned in Ethiopia in her own right since ancient times. Rather than take the title itege, which was reserved for empress consorts, Zewditu was given the feminine version of nigusa nigist to indicate that she reigned in her own right. She was accorded the dignity of Girmawit (\\"[Her] Imperial Majesty\\") and the title of Siyimta Igzi'abher (ሥይምተ እግዚአብሔር , \\"Electress of God\\"). She was commonly referred to as nigist, translated as \\"Queen\\". The 1955 Constitution of Ethiopia excluded women from the succession to the throne so this title was effectively abolished. ===Itege=== Empress Consort Taytu Betul of the Ethiopian Empire. An Itege (እቴጌ ) was an Empress Consort. This refers to the wives of incumbent emperors. Empresses were generally crowned as consorts by the emperor at the Imperial Palace. However, Taytu Betul, consort of Menelik II, became the first Itege to be crowned by the Emperor at church rather than at the Palace. Her coronation took place on the second day of the emperor's coronation holiday. Menen Asfaw became the first Itege to be crowned by the archbishop on the same day and during the same ceremony as her husband, Haile Selassie. The Itege was entitled to the dignity of Girmawit (\\"Her/Your Imperial Majesty\\"). ===Negus=== King Haile Selassie of the Solomonic dynasty. A Negus ( , \\"king\\") was a hereditary ruler of one of Ethiopia's larger provinces, over whom collectively the monarch ruled, thus justifying his imperial title. The title of Negus was awarded at the discretion of the Emperor to those who ruled important provinces, although it was often used hereditarily during and after the Zemene Mesafint. The rulers of Begemder, Shewa, Gojjam, Wollo, all held the title of Negus at some point, as the \\"Negus of Shewa\\", \\"Negus of Gojjam\\", and so forth. During and after the reign of Menelik II virtually all of the titles either lapsed into the Imperial crown or were dissolved. In 1914, after having been appointed \\"Negus of Zion\\" by his son Lij Iyasu (Iyasu V), Mikael of Wollo, in consideration of the hostile feelings this provoked in of much of the nobility in northern Ethiopia (particularly Le'ul Ras Seyoum Mengesha, whose family had resented being denied the title by Menelik), who were now technically made subordinate to him, instead elected to use the title of Negus of Wollo. Tafari Makonnen, who later became Emperor Haile Selassie, was bestowed the title of Negus in 1928; he would be the last person to bear the title. Despite this, European sources referred to the Ethiopian monarch as the Negus well into the 20th century, switching to Emperor only after the Second World War - around the same time the name Abyssinia fell out of use in favour of Ethiopia in the west. ===Le'ul=== Le'ul or Leul ( , \\"Prince\\") was a princely style used by sons and grandson of the Emperor. It conferred upon its holder the title of Imperial Highness. The style first came into use in 1916, following the enthronement of Empress Zewditu ===Le'elt=== Le'elt (ልዕልት ) \\"Princess\\". This title came into use in 1916 upon the enthronement of Zewditu. Reserved at birth for daughters of the monarch and patrilineal granddaughters. Usually bestowed on the wives of Leul Ras, as well as the monarch's granddaughters in the female line upon their marriages. The notable exception to the rule was Leult Yeshashework Yilma, Emperor Haile Selassie's niece by his elder brother, who received the title with the dignity of \\"Highness\\" from Zewditu upon the princess' marriage to Leul Ras Gugsa Araya Selassie in 1918, and then again from her uncle upon his coronation in 1930 with the enhanced dignity of \\"Imperial Highness\\". ===Abeto=== Abetohun ( ) or Abeto ( )Prince. Title reserved for males of imperial ancestry. The title fell into disuse by the late 19th century. Lij Iyasu attempted to revive the title as Abeto-hoy (\\"Great Prince\\"), and this form is still used by the current Iyasuist claimant Girma Yohannes Iyasu. It was also bestowed on Lij Tedla Melaku, a direct-line descendant of Iyasu I and member of the dual dynastic House of Tekle Giyorgis II, by the Crown Council of Ethiopia. ===Ras=== Ras (, compare with Arabic Rais)One of the powerful non-imperial; historian Harold G. Marcus equates this to a duke. The combined title of Leul Ras was given to the heads of the cadet branches of the imperial dynasty, such as the Princes of Gojjam, Tigray and the Selalle sub-branch of the last reigning Shewan Branch. ===Emebet=== An Emebet Hoy (እመቤት ሆይ , \\"Great Royal Lady\\") was a title reserved for the wives of those bearing the title of Leul Dejazmach and other high ranking women of royal blood. Alternatively, an Emebet (እመቤት, \\"Royal Lady\\" ) was a title reserved for the unmarried granddaughters of the monarch in the female line (they were generally granted the title of leult upon marriage), and to the daughters of the Leul Ras. ===Bitwoded=== Bitwoded (An office thought to have been created by Zara Yaqob who appointed two of these, one of the Left and one of the Right. These were later merged into one office, which became the supreme grade of Ras, \\"Ras Betwadad\\". Marcus equates the style to an earl. ===Lij=== Lij ()Title issued at birth to sons of members of the Mesafint, the hereditary nobility. ==Men's military titles== * Dejazmach (ደጅ አዝማች , \\"Commander or General of the Gate\\")a military title meaning commander of the central body of a traditional Ethiopian armed force composed of a vanguard, main body, left and right wings and a rear body.Ethiopia Military Tradition in National Life Library of Congress Marcus equates this to a count. The heirs of the \\"Leul Rases\\" were titled Leul Dejazmach to elevate them above the non-imperial blood Dejazmaches. * ' (ፊት አውራሪ , Commander of the Vanguard)a military title meaning commander of the vanguard of a traditional Ethiopian armed force. Marcus equates this to a baron. * ' (ቀኝ አዝማች , Commander of the Right wing)a military title meaning commander of the right wing of a traditional Ethiopian armed force. * ' (ግራ አዝማች , Commander of the Left wing)a military title meaning commander of the left wing of a traditional Ethiopian armed force. * ' (አዝማች , Commander of the Rearguard)a military title meaning commander of the rearguard of a traditional Ethiopian armed force. This was usually a trustworthy counselor and the leader's chief minister. * ' (ባላምባራስ , Commander of an Amba or fortress)these could also be commanders of the guards, artillery or cavalry of a traditional Ethiopian armed force, basically a man entrusted with important commands. ==Women's honorifics== *Woyzero (ወይዘሮ , Dame)Originally high noble title that over time came to be the general accepted form of address for married women in general (Mrs.). It was still awarded by the Emperor on rare occasions in the 20th century to non-royal women, and sometimes with the higher grade of Woizero Hoy (Great Dame). *Woyzerit (ወይዘሪት , Lady)Originally high ranking noble title for unmarried women, now the general accepted form of address for unmarried women in general (Miss). It was sometimes awarded with the added distinction of Woizerit Hoy (Great Lady), but only to widows. ==Important regional offices== * Bahr negus (ባህር ንጉሥ , \\"ruler of the Seas\\")King of the territories north of the Mareb River, and as a result the most powerful office in medieval Ethiopia after the Emperor himself. As a result of the revolts of the Bahr negus Yeshaq and the self-determination of Medri Bahri in modern-day Eritrea in the later 16th century, this office lost much of its power. Although men are mentioned as holding this office into the early 18th century, they were of little consequence. * Meridazmach (መርዕድ አዝማች , \\"Fearsome Commander\\" or \\"supreme general\\")This title is related to \\"Dejazmach\\" or \\"Qeñ Azmach\\" above. Beginning in the 18th century, this came to denote the ruler of Shewa until Sahle Selassie dropped it in favor of the title of Negus. Later revived in 1930 in Wollo for Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen. *Mesfin Harar (መስፍነ ሐረር )Duke of Harar. Hereditary title created in 1930 for Emperor Haile Selassie's second son, Prince Makonnen. (The wife of the Mesfin was properly titled Sefanit, but was more commonly referred to as the Mesfinit). Upon the death of the Prince, his son Prince Wossen Seged was elevated as Mesfin Harar and would currently be second in line in the line of succession if Ethiopia were still a monarchy after Prince Zera Yacob. * Nebura ed (ንቡረ እድ , one put in office through the laying of hands\\")civil governor of Axum reserved for the clergy. Also called Liqat Aksum. Because of the historical and symbolic importance of this city, the rules of precedence promulgated in 1689 ranked the Nebura ed ahead of all of the provincial governors. Indeed, when the title was granted with Ras Warq (the right to wear a coronet), it was higher than even the title of Ras. Although a civil title granted by the Emperor, it was usually bestowed on a clergyman due to Axum's status as the holiest site of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church within the country.Edward Ullendorff notes that the title of \\"Nebura ed\\" is also used by the head of Basilica Church of St Maryam at Addis Alem, \\"built by Menelik as the southern Aksum\\". (The Ethiopians, 2nd ed. [London: Oxford, 1960], p. 109) The title of Nebure ed was also granted to the administrator of the Church of St. Mary at Addis Alem, founded by Menelik II west of Addis Ababa. However the Nebura ed of Addis Alem was much further down the hierarchy than the Nebura ed of Axum, and was not accorded the Ras Warq. * Tigray Mekonnen (ትግራይ መኮንን )created for Ras Alula governor of the province of Tigray. Under the rule of Emperor Yohannes IV in the late 19th century, the Tigray Mekonnen briefly became responsible for the territories once controlled by the Bahrnegus, and became the most powerful governor of Eritrea. * Wagshum (ዋግሹም )governor (or shum) of the province of Wag. The Wagshum was a hereditary title, and these rulers traced their ancestry back to the imperial family of the Zagwe dynasty. *Shum AgameGovernor of Agame province of Tigray, and hereditary in the family of Dejazmach Sabagadis Woldu, a major figure of the Zemene Mesafint (Era of the Princes) period. Ras Sebhat Aregawi, a longtime rival of the family of Emperor Yohannes IV was one of the more famous of the Shum Agame. *Shum Tembien (ሹም ታምብየን )Governor of Tembien district of Tigray. Emperor Yohannes IV was the son of Shum Mercha of Tembien. *JantirarTitle reserved for the males of the family who ruled over the mountain fortress of Ambassel in Wollo (now Debub Wollo Zone). The title of Jantirar is among the oldest in the Ethiopian Empire. Empress Menen, consort of Emperor Haile Selassie, was the daughter of Jantirar Asfaw. ==Important offices of the Imperial Court== ===Enderase=== The Enderase () acted as the Regent of the Empire in times of the Emperor's youth, infirmity, or other limited capacity. Empress Zauditu, who reigned from 1917 to 1930, was obliged to share power with an Enderase, Ras Tafari Makonnen, who was also her designated heir, and thus assumed the throne as Emperor Haile Selassie in 1930. The title used by the monarch's representatives to fiefs and vassals (in this sense, a Viceroy). In the 20th century, the title was used by some provincial governors, chiefly that of the autonomous province of Eritrea which was restored to Ethiopia in 1952. The title was still used after the dissolution of the federal arrangement, and was uniformly adopted by the rulers of the other provinces as well. Emperor-in-exile Amha Selassie appointed Prince Bekere Fikre-Selassie \\"Enderase\\" in right of the Crown Council of Ethiopia in 1993, as his representative, and who still holds the office, as Crown Prince Zera Yacob Amha Selassie has not declared himself Emperor. ===Reise Mekwanint=== Reise Mekwanint (ርእሰ መኳንንት , \\"head of the nobles\\") was a title granted during the Zemene Mesafint, which raised its holder over all appointed nobles. It was bestowed upon the Enderase, who during that period held most of the (considerably diminished) imperial power. It was last granted to Yohannes IV by his brother-in-law Tekle Giyorgis II (Wagshum Gobeze) before the former deposed the later and seized the throne for himself. ===Tsehafi Taezaz=== The Tsehafi Taezaz (, translated as \\"Minister of the Pen\\") was the most powerful post at the Imperial court. According to John Spencer, he was \\"the one who traditionally walked two steps behind the Emperor to listen to and write down all orders that the latter gave out in the course of an audience or an inspection tour.\\" Spencer adds that under Haile Selassie the Tsehafe Tezaz safeguarded the Great Seal, kept the records of all important appointments, and was responsible for publishing all laws and treaties; \\"his signature, rather than that of the Emperor, appeared on those [official] publications although the heading in each case referred to His Imperial Majesty.\\" The office was combined with that of Prime Minister during the tenure of Aklilu Habte-Wold (1961–1974). ===Afe Negus=== Afe Negus (አፈ ንጉሥ , \\"mouth of the King\\") Title for the Imperial Supreme Court Justices that is equivalent to \\"Lord Justice\\" or \\"Lord Chief Justice\\" (in the case of the Chief Justice). The title was originally given to the two chief heralds who acted as official spokesmen for the Emperor, hence the name \\"mouth of the King\\". Since the Emperor never spoke in public, these officials always spoke in public on his behalf (speaking as if they were the Emperor). By 1942, this title was granted only to Justices of the Imperial Supreme Court.Margary Perham, The Government of Ethiopia, second edition (London: Faber and Faber, 1969), p. 154 ===Liqe Mekwas=== The Liqe Mekwas (ሊቀ መኳስ ) was the impersonator or double of the Emperor, who accompanied him in battle. Two trusted and highly favored officials were given this title. They always walked or rode on either side of the monarch in battle, or in public processions, dressing as magnificently, or more magnificently then he, in order to distract assassins.Perham, The Government of Ethiopia, p. 86 ===Aqabe Se'at=== The Aqabe Se'at (አቃቤ ሰዓት , \\"keeper of time\\") was a high official, often a clergyman, who was responsible for keeping the Emperor's schedule and had authority over the clergy assigned to the Imperial Court. The position was one of immense power in medieval times, but became largely titular under the Gondarine Emperors and eventually went out of existence. ===Blattengeta=== The Blattengeta (ብላቴን ጌታ , \\"lord of the pages\\") was a high court official that served as administrator of the Palaces. The title was later used as an honorific. ===Blatta=== Blatta (ብላታ , \\"page\\") was the rank of high court officials in charge of maintaining palace protocol and meeting the personal needs of the Imperial family. ===Basha=== Basha (ባሻ ) was a rank originally derived from the Turkish (Ottoman)/Egyptian title of Pasha, but considered a lower rank in Ethiopia, whereas Pasha was a high rank at the Turkish and Egyptian courts. ==Important offices of the civil government== ===Negadras=== A Negadras (ነጋድራስ , \\"head of the merchants\\") was the appointed leader of a larger town's merchants, who supervised the operations of the markets, the administration of customs, and the collection of taxes. By the end of the 19th century a negadras was often the single most important official in a town, essentially acting as its mayor. By 1900 the various negadrasoch had been subordinated to the negadras of Addis Ababa, Haile Giyorgis Woldemikael, who by 1906 supervised foreign businesses and diplomatic missions in the capital, the organisation of hand was responsible for granting concessions and contracts to foreign enterprises, making the post the de facto Mayor of Addis Ababa, Chief of police, Minister of Commerce and Minister of Foreign Affairs. These functions were separated by the formation of the first cabinet in 1907, with Haile Giyorgis appointed to those posts. With Haile Giyorgis' removal from office by then-Regent Ras Tafari Makonnen in 1917, the post of negadras of Addis Ababa lost most of its powers to the office of Kantiba, the head of the municipal government, which had been created in 1910, with other towns later following suit. ===Kantiba=== Kantiba (ከንቲባ , \\"mayor\\" or \\"Lord Mayor\\") is a mayor of a large town or city in modern times. In ancient times a kantiba was a chief, the king's lieutenant that used to govern a province or more provinces. He had soldiers. The kantiba had the task to administrate the given areas. In certain cases the title of kantiba could have passed down from father to son, and in some others the title was given to elected individuals for a few years, where at the end of the mandate another person was elected. ==See also== *Ethiopian ecclesiastical titles *Ethiopian military titles *Somali aristocratic and court titles ==References== == Sources == * Ethiopia: a country study.

It is close to the Commercial Road shopping centre. British Transport Police maintain a presence at the station. There is a taxi rank at the front of the building and regular local buses within five minutes' walking distance. The station, which is managed by South Western Railway, has ticket barriers in operation. == History== Aerial view of the station in 1946 View of the west end of platforms 2 (left) and 1 (right) View of the 1980s British Rail era canopy over upper level platforms 1 & 2 View of the surviving Admiralty Line level crossing gates on Edinburgh Road close to Victoria Park. The station was first opened as Portsmouth on 14 June 1847. It was later renamed Portsmouth Town on 2 October 1876 to avoid confusion with other stations in Portsmouth, such as Portsmouth Harbour. The station's present-day name of Portsmouth & Southsea originates from the closure of the Southsea Railway branch line, which had a terminus station in Southsea named East Southsea from 1885-1914. Competing trams and trolleybuses put the Southsea Railway out of business and it was closed in 1914. Train passengers and tourists bound for Southsea were then diverted to Portsmouth's main railway station, Portsmouth Town which was later renamed Portsmouth & Southsea in 1925. Portsmouth & Southsea station was once the junction for the Portsmouth Dockyard branch, known as the Admiralty Line. The line branched off from the west end of today's platform 1 and passed through Victoria Park, close to the rear of Stanhope Road, before crossing Bishop Crispian Way via a level crossing (the gates still exist) and entering the naval base at the Unicorn Gate. Part of the station, specifically the 1980s canopy over high level platforms 1 and 2, is still in its original red Network SouthEast livery. == Services == The station is located on the Portsmouth Direct Line which runs between London Waterloo and Portsmouth Harbour. In addition there are regular services to Cardiff Central, Bristol Temple Meads, Southampton Central, Eastleigh, Woking, Brighton, Gatwick Airport, East Croydon and London Victoria. The station is split into two distinct parts: the high level (one island platform for through trains) and the low level (two bay platforms) where some trains terminate. In addition, Hovertravel run a bus service from Portsmouth & Southsea which connects to their Hovercraft service from Southsea to the Isle of Wight. The IoW terminal is located next to Ryde Esplanade, with a single price ticket for journeys via rail/hover/rail, similar to that provided by Wightlink from Portsmouth Harbour.

All of that module, class or function's services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility. Robert C. Martin, the originator of the term, expresses the principle as, \\"A class should have only one reason to change,\\" although, because of confusion around the word \\"reason\\" he more recently stated \\"This principle is about people.\\" ==History== The term was introduced by Robert C. Martin in an article by the same name as part of his Principles of Object Oriented Design, made popular by his book Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices. Martin described it as being based on the principle of cohesion, as described by Tom DeMarco in his book Structured Analysis and System Specification, and Meilir Page-Jones in The Practical Guide to Structured Systems Design. In 2014 Martin wrote a blog post entitled The Single Responsibility Principle with a goal to clarify what was meant by the phrase \\"reason for change.\\" ==Example== Martin defines a responsibility as a reason to change, and concludes that a class or module should have one, and only one, reason to be changed (e.g. rewritten). As an example, consider a module that compiles and prints a report. Imagine such a module can be changed for two reasons. First, the content of the report could change. Second, the format of the report could change. These two things change for very different causes; one substantive, and one cosmetic. The single- responsibility principle says that these two aspects of the problem are really two separate responsibilities, and should, therefore, be in separate classes or modules. It would be a bad design to couple two things that change for different reasons at different times. The reason it is important to keep a class focused on a single concern is that it makes the class more robust. Continuing with the foregoing example, if there is a change to the report compilation process, there is a greater danger that the printing code will break if it is part of the same class. ==See also== * Separation of concerns * Chain-of-responsibility pattern * Cohesion (computer science) * Open/closed principle * SOLID — the \\"S\\" in \\"SOLID\\" stands for the single-responsibility principle * GRASP (object-oriented design) ==References== ==External links== * The Secret behind the Single Responsibility Principle * The Single Responsibility Principle Category:Software design Category:Programming principles ","title":"Single-responsibility principle"},{"id":"2584593","text":"A public interface is the logical point at which independent software entities interact.

It is one of the delusional misidentification syndromes; although rare, it is most commonly associated with acquired brain injury, particularly simultaneous damage to the right cerebral hemisphere and to both frontal lobes. ==Presentation== Reduplicative paramnesia has been reported in the context of a number of neurological disorders, including stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, tumor, dementia, encephalopathy and various psychiatric disorders. Taken from the Benson and colleagues study, the following example illustrates some of the core features of the delusion. In this instance, the patient had suffered a head injury after a fall in his home. The impact had caused a fractured skull and frontal lobe damage to both sides (although more pronounced on the right) owing to the formation of intracerebral hematomas: The illusory relocation to a familiar place (such as a home or town the patient knows well) is a common theme, although occasionally the patient may believe that they are resident in more fantastical or exotic locations (such as Timbuktu). ==Mechanism== Early psychodynamic explanations suggested that reduplicative paramnesia was not directly connected to brain injury, but arises from a motivated denial of illness; particularly, as Weinstein and KahnWeinstein, E.A. & Kahn, R.L. (1955) Denial of Illness: Symbolic and Physiological Aspects. Springfield, IL: Thomas. claimed, in those that regard illness as a \\"imperfection, weakness or disgrace\\". Other early investigators, did accept that brain injury was an important factor, but suggested that the disorientation was a \\"hysterical reaction\\" motivated by a desire to return home. The majority of modern theories, however, suggest that the disorder is caused by disruption to the brain systems involved in memory and familiarity. This was the theme of Pick's original explanation, in which he suggested that the crucial mechanism was a \\"convulsive attack\\" that disrupted conscious memory. Benson and colleagues later argued that damage to the right hemisphere of the brain rendered patients unable to maintain orientation owing to impaired visuospatial perception and visual memory, while frontal lobe damage made it difficult to inhibit the false impressions caused by disorientation. More recent research has broadly supported this view, and links have been made to the literature on confabulation, where patients seem to recall false memories without any realisation that they are false, often also in the context of frontal lobe damage. Right hemisphere damage is also linked to anosognosia, where patients seem unaware of often striking disabilities present after brain injury, also suggesting a link to the lack of insight seen in this disorder. One case study has suggested a more refined explanation, suggesting that damage to the ventral stream of the visual system, that connects the visual cortex to areas in the temporal lobes, could produce the required visuospatial disorientation and poor memory integration. The temporal areas (including the hippocampus) are known strongly to interact with the frontal lobes during memory formation and retrieval, suggesting an explanation for why frontal damage could also lead to the condition. ==History== The term reduplicative paramnesia was first used in 1903 by psychiatrist Arnold Pick to describe a condition in a patient with suspected Alzheimer's disease who insisted that she had been moved from Pick's city clinic to one she claimed looked identical but was in a familiar suburb. To explain the discrepancy she further claimed that Pick and the medical staff worked at both locations. In retrospect, however, the phenomenon has been found to have been first reported by the Swiss naturalist Charles Bonnet in 1788,Charles Bonnet's description of Cotard's delusion and reduplicative paramnesia in an elderly patient (1788) who described a woman who also had what would now be called Cotard delusion. Henry HeadHead, H. (1926) Aphasia and Kindred Disorders. London: Cambridge University Press. and Paterson and Zangwill later reported on soldiers who had the delusional belief that their hospital was located in their home town, although in these cases traumatic brain injury seemed to be the most likely cause. It wasn't until 1976 that serious consideration was given to the disorder, when three cases were reported by Benson and colleagues. Benson not only described striking reduplication syndromes in his patients, but also attempted to explain the phenomena in terms of the neurocognitive deficits also present in the patients. This was one of the first attempts to give a neuropsychological explanation for the disorder. ==See also== * Delusional misidentification syndrome * Paramnesia (Commonly called Déjà vu) * Capgras delusion ==References== Category:Delusional disorders Category:Delusions ","title":"Reduplicative paramnesia"},{"id":"2584618","text":"Atmos may refer to: * An abbreviation for the Earth's atmosphere * The atmosphere (unit), a unit of pressure Atmos may also refer to: * ATMOS (festival), The Technical Festival of BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus * Atmos Energy Corporation, a U.S. energy company * Atmos clock, a clock manufactured by Jaeger-LeCoultre, which runs on changes in ambient temperature * Oric Atmos, a home computer first marketed in 1984 * Ambience (sound recording), sounds of a given location or space * Dolby Atmos, surround sound format * ATMOS Software, an Australian computer and video game company * Atmos (character), a minor character in the 30th century DC Universe * Atmos Heating Systems, a British supplier of industrial and domestic heaters * ATMOS (ATMospheric Omission System), fictional technology in the 2008 Doctor Who two-part serial \\"The Sontaran Stratagem\\" / \\"The Poison Sky\\" * ATMOS 2000, a self-propelled Israeli artillery system produced by Soltam Systems Ltd * EMC Atmos, a clustered computer storage system from EMC Corporation * Workshop on Algorithmic Approaches for Transportation Modeling, Optimization, and Systems (ATMOS) * Atmos (album), an album by Miroslav Vitouš == See also == * Atos (disambiguation) ","title":"Atmos"},{"id":"2584636","text":"Bedhampton railway station serves the former village of Bedhampton, now a suburb lying a mile west of the centre of Havant, in Hampshire, England. ==History== Opened in 1906 as \\"Bedhampton Halt\\", the station was at first staffed separately but in the late 1940s it came under the control of Havant; since then it has been manned only part time: a ticket office on Platform 2 (Portsmouth bound) is staffed during the peak morning rush hour.

He was a native of Birmingham, Alabama. Benjamin originally learned to play drums in the style of the big band jazz groups in the 1940s. In 1958, Benjamin was Motown's first studio drummer, where he was noted for his dynamic style. Several Motown record producers, including Berry Gordy, refused to work on any recording sessions unless Benjamin was the drummer and James Jamerson was the bassist. The Beatles singled out Benjamin's drumming style upon meeting Gordy in the UK. Among the Motown songs Benjamin performed the drum tracks for are early hits such as \\"Money (That's What I Want)\\" by Barrett Strong, \\"Shop Around\\" by The Miracles and \\"Do You Love Me\\" by The Contours; as well as later hits such as \\"Get Ready\\" and \\"My Girl\\" by The Temptations, \\"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\\" by Stevie Wonder, \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" by Gladys Knight & the Pips, and \\"Going to a Go-Go\\" by The Miracles. Benjamin was influenced by the work of drummers Buddy Rich and Tito Puente. He recorded with a studio set composed of Ludwig, Slingerland, Rogers and Gretsch components and probably Zildjian cymbals. By the late 1960s, Benjamin struggled with drug and alcohol addiction, and fellow Funk Brothers Uriel Jones and Richard \\"Pistol\\" Allen increasingly recorded more of the drum tracks for the studio's releases. Benjamin died on April 20, 1969, of a stroke at age 43. Benjamin was inducted into the \\"Sidemen\\" category of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003.

She induced cardiac arrest in patients by injecting their intravenous therapy bags with massive doses of epinephrine, an untraceable heart stimulant. She would then respond to the coded emergency, often resuscitating the patients herself. Gilbert's known victims are Stanley Jagodowski, Henry Hudon, Kenneth Cutting, and Edward Skwira. == Early life and education == Gilbert was born on November 13, 1967, in Fall River, Massachusetts, the elder of Richard and Claudia Strickland's two daughters. Richard was an electronics executive, while Claudia was a homemaker and part-time teacher. As Gilbert entered her teenage years, friends and family noticed that she was habitually lying. She had a history of faking suicide attempts to manipulate people. According to court records, Gilbert has made violent threats against others since she was a teenager. She graduated from Groton-Dunstable Regional High School in Groton, Massachusetts. In 1986, she enrolled at Bridgewater State College in Bridgewater, Massachusetts. After a fake suicide attempt, Gilbert was ordered psychiatric treatment by Bridgewater State College officials. Because of this, in 1987, she transferred to Mount Wachusett Community College in Gardner, Massachusetts and then to Greenfield Community College in Greenfield, Massachusetts. She graduated from the latter with a nursing diploma, becoming a registered nurse in 1988. Later that year, she married Glenn Gilbert. == Career and murders == In 1989, she joined the staff of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Northampton. She was featured in the magazine VA Practitioner in April 1990. Although other nurses noticed a high number of deaths on Gilbert's watch, they passed it off and jokingly called her the \\"Angel of Death.\\" In 1996, however, three nurses reported their concern about an increase in cardiac arrest deaths and a decrease in the supply of epinephrine, and an investigation ensued. Gilbert telephoned in a bomb threat to attempt to derail the investigation. Gilbert left the hospital in 1996 amid a hospital investigation into the many suspicious patient deaths that occurred during her shifts. That fall, Gilbert checked herself into psychiatric hospitals seven times, staying between one and 10 days each time. In January 1998, Gilbert stood trial for calling in a bomb threat to the Northampton VAMC to retaliate against coworkers and former boyfriend James Perrault (who also worked at the hospital) for their participation in the investigation. In April 1998, Gilbert was convicted of that crime. VA hospital staff members speculated that Gilbert may have been responsible for 350 or more deaths and more than 300 medical emergencies. The prosecutor in her case, Assistant U.S. Attorney William M. Welch II, asserted that Gilbert used these emergency situations to gain the attention of then- boyfriend Perrault, a VA police officer—hospital rules required that hospital police be present at any medical emergency. Perrault testified against her, saying that she confessed at least one murder to him by phone while she was hospitalized in a psychiatric ward. Defense attorney David P. Hoose claimed reasonable doubt based on a lack of direct evidence. FMC Carswell, where Gilbert is incarcerated William Boutelle, a psychiatrist who served as chief of staff at the Northampton VAMC, has theorized that she created emergency medical crisis situations to display her proficiency as a nurse. According to court records, Gilbert had made violent threats against others since she was a teenager. At the trial, prosecutors said Gilbert used a large kitchen knife in an assault in Greenfield, Massachusetts in January or February 1988. Prosecutors said she tried twice to murder a person by poison in November 1995. Prosecutors said that Gilbert tried to poison a patient at the VA hospital on Jan. 28, 1996, and that she caused a medical emergency by removing a patient's breathing tube at the VA hospital on Jan. 30, 1994. Prosecutors said that Gilbert abandoned a patient undergoing cardiac arrest on Nov. 9, 1995, and then asked another nurse to accompany her on a check of patients. Prosecutors said she waited until her colleague independently spotted the patient's difficulty before raising an alarm. Gilbert forced an untrained colleague to use cardiac defibrillation paddles on a patient during a medical emergency on Nov. 17, 1995, by refusing to use the equipment herself. Prosecutors said Gilbert threatened the life of at least one person verbally and physically in July 1996. While working as a home health aide before becoming a registered nurse and about eight years before her VAMC crimes, Gilbert purposely scalded a mentally handicapped child with hot bath water. On March 14, 2001, a federal jury convicted Gilbert on three counts of first- degree murder, one count of second-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder. Though Massachusetts does not have capital punishment, her crimes were committed on federal property and thus subject to the death penalty. Prosecutors, in an attempt to secure a penalty of death, sought to admit evidence of aggravating factors during the penalty phase, including Gilbert's 1998 conviction for the bomb threat; the defense introduced evidence of mitigating factors, including the well-being of Gilbert's two children. On March 26, 2001, the jury recommended a sentence of life imprisonment. On March 27, the judge formally sentenced Gilbert to four consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole, plus 20 years. Gilbert was transferred from a prison for women in Framingham, Massachusetts to a special federal prison in Texas, where she has remained ever since. She is serving her sentence at Federal Medical Center, Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas. In July 2003, Gilbert dropped her federal appeal for a new trial after a then-recent US Supreme Court ruling that would have allowed prosecutors to pursue the death penalty upon retrial. ==Personal life== Gilbert has two sons with Glenn Gilbert.

It was first published by The Bobbs-Merrill Company (then the Bowen-Merrill Company) in 1898 and proved an enormous success. According to the New York Times, in its third year on the market the book was still selling so well that it was #9 on the list of bestselling novels in the United States for 1900. The book spawned an entire industry of historical romantic novels and films. In 1901, playwright Paul Kester wrote the Broadway play and by 1907 When Knighthood Was in Flower was still being printed by the reprint publisher, Grosset & Dunlap, when the film rights were sold to Biograph Studios. It was sometimes known by the title When Knights Were Bold and should not be confused with the 1906 play When Knights Were Bold which also inspired several film adaptations. ==Plot summary== Set during the Tudor period of English history, When Knighthood Was in Flower tells the tribulations of Mary Tudor, a younger sister of Henry VIII of England who has fallen in love with a commoner. However, for political reasons, King Henry has arranged for her to wed King Louis XII of France and demands his sister put the House of Tudor first, threatening, \\"You will marry France and I will give you a wedding present – Charles Brandon's head!\\" ==Adaptations== ===1908 adaptation=== Although no film copy exists, the book is believed to have been adapted to a 1908 motion picture of the same name or under the title When Knights Were Bold by D.W. Griffith and directed by Wallace McCutcheon. ===1922 adaptation=== The 1922 version is most remembered as the vehicle for Marion Davies financed by William Randolph Hearst and his company Cosmopolitan Productions. Directed by Robert Vignola and starring Hearst's mistress Marion Davies and Forrest Stanley, it was a big-budget silent film. ===1953 adaptation=== In 1953, Major's book was remade by Walt Disney with the title The Sword and the Rose in the United States, but released with the original title in the United Kingdom. This version was adapted for the screen by American Lawrence Edward Watkin, but was filmed in the United Kingdom. Directed by Ken Annakin with a British and French cast, it starred Richard Todd and Glynis Johns.

It connects Magadan with the town of Nizhny Bestyakh, located on the eastern bank of Lena River opposite Yakutsk. At Nizhny Bestyakh the Kolyma Highway connects to the Lena Highway. The Kolyma Highway is also known as the Road of Bones. Locally, the road is known as Trassa ( – \\"The Route\\"), or Kolymskaya trassa ( – \\"The Kolyma Route\\"), since it is the only road in the area and therefore needs no special name to distinguish it from other roads. ==History== Road construction A ZIS-6 Lorry in 1938 The Kolyma is paved 52 km. from Yakutsk (Nizhny Bestyakh) to Tyungyulyu. The road today near Magadan. Paving extends over the 150 km nearest to Magadan; elsewhere the road mainly comprises gravel. The Dalstroy construction directorate built the Kolyma Highway during the Soviet Union's Stalinist era. Inmates of the Sevvostlag labour camp started the first stretch in 1932, and construction continued with the use of gulag labour until 1953.

But no one knows, even approximately, how many of these prisoners died. Even historians who have spent years studying Kolyma come up with radically different numbers. I asked four such researchers, who between them have written or edited more than half a dozen books on the gulag, what was the total Kolyma death toll. One estimated it at 250,000, another at 300,000, one at 800,000, and one at 'more than 1,000,000.'\\" people who died while constructing it were laid beneath or around the road.Thompson G., (2002) Kolyma – The Road of Death As the road is built on permafrost, interment into the fabric of the road was deemed more practical than digging new holes to bury the bodies of the dead. Middleton, Nick, Going to Extremes ==Present== In 2008, the road was granted Federal Road status, and is now a frequently maintained all-weather gravel road. When the road was upgraded, the route was changed to bypass the section from Kyubeme to Kadykchan via Tomtor, and instead pass from Kyubeme to Kadykchan via a more northern route through the town of Ust-Nera. The old 420 km section via Tomtor was largely unmaintained; the 200 km section between Tomtor and Kadykchan was completely abandoned.Colebatch, Walter. Siberian Extreme 2010 – Back for More, 8 July 2010. Retrieved 25 July 2014. This section is known as the Old Summer Road, and has fallen into disrepair, with washed-out bridges and sections of road reclaimed by streams in summer. During winter, frozen rivers may assist river crossings. Old Summer Road remains one of the great challenges for adventuring motorcyclists and 4WDers. The area is extremely cold during the winter. The town of Oymyakon, approximately 100 km from the highway, is believed to be the coldest inhabited place on earth.p. 57, Extreme Weather: A Guide & Record Book, Christopher C.

After the fall of the Soviet government, the road was first traversed by Western motorcyclists in summer 1995, when the British Mondo Enduro team completed a crossing from Yakutsk to Magadan. Shortly afterwards a Norwegian wanderer Helge Pedersen also completed the road, starting from Magadan. In 2006, two French adventurers (Cyril Delafosse-Guiramand and Guillaume Tourlourat) walked to Yakutsk on the old road. Subsequent notable traverses by motorcycle include Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman's round-the-world motorcycle journey in 2004, made into a popular television series, book and DVD, all named Long Way Round. However, due to the timing of the journey and the condition of the road, it was not possible for them and their support crew to complete the traverse unassisted. They instead joined a Russian freight convoy, whose trucks were able to ford the still swollen rivers. Simon Milward completed the road in 2001 by motorbike and it was cycled in the 2004 winter by Alastair Humphreys and Rob Lilwall,https://roblilwall.com/ followed on foot by Rosie Swale-Pope in 2005 and ridden solo on motorcycle by both Adrian Scott and by Russian woman Sasha Teplyakova (via the Old Summer Road) the same year. In 2006, the Hungarian talk show host, Sándor Fábry, and the painter András Wahorn made an assisted trip on the road from Magadan to Yakutsk (using the Tomtor road) on a 30 years old Cadillac Eldorado Convertible car, as part of their Cadillac Drive TV show, driving from Los Angeles to Budapest. In 2007 the Polish Motosyberia team completed the Old Summer Road. In 2009 Walter Colebatch and Tony Pettie on the Sibirsky Extreme Project completed the new road, from Yakutsk to Magadan via Ust-Nera, in three and a half days. In 2010 Walter Colebatch returned to host the first commercial motorcycle tour on the Road, in which Sherri-Jo Wilkins became the first foreign female rider to ride the road. In September 2010, Paul and Dean Martinello together with Barton Churchill, completed the Old Summer Road into Magadan, and remain the latest motorcycle arrival to Magadan – 30 September. In summer 2012, Sean Ardley of California cycled the road from Magadan to the Lena River in 16 days, 12 hours. In June 2013, Nikolaos J. Kavouras member of Motorcycle Club of Kozani, was the first Greek biker who made the new road (via Ust-Nera) in four days, completed his \\"mongolia2magadan\\" effort. Commercial trips for small numbers of motorcycles are available. The very first attempt to ride a motorcycle in winter condition was made by Dan Popescu, motorbiker, the Romanian Motorcyclists Association (AMR) president in late March 2012. He rode one Aprilia Pegaso 650 IE on the distance between Yakutsk to near Kyubeme in few days, including night time riding, the coldest temperature down to −35 °C, helped by a back up team in two 4×4s including an ambulance. The recent completion of the Old Summer Road was done during August 2015 by the leavinghomefunktion team, an international group of young artists on Ural motorcycles with side-cars. In July 2018, David Fletcher, Gary Rice (both from England, on Husqvarna 701) and Johannes Micheler (from Germany, on KTM 640 LC4) completed the Road of Bones via the old summer road. ==Route== {class= - !Distance  Place  Remark -  0 km  Nizhny Bestyakh / Yakutsk  on the Lena River -   Tyungyulyu  End of paving -   Krest-Khaldzhay  colspan=9  Road, northeast, summer ferry across the Aldan River. -   Khandyga  on the Aldan River -   colspan=9  Alternative: Summer Hydrofoil from Yakutsk down the Lena and up the Aldan, , 10 hours. -   colspan=9  over Suntar-Khayata mountains, pass, Vostochnaya River. -   Kyubeme -   (New route) Ust-Nera  on the Indigirka River, east: several mining towns, Artyk town, headwaters of the Nera River, pass. -   colspan=9 Alternative: (Old Summer Road route) northeast to Tomtor, road northeast (may not be passable except when frozen), into Magadan Oblast. -   Kadykchan  (nearby are coal mines and the old Myaundzha uranium processing centre). -   Susuman -   Debin  with the Kolyma River bridge -   Orotukan  road turns southeast and south, of largely unpopulated taiga, -   Gerba  road 44H-3 to Omsukchan forks off; beginning of Anadyr Highway (under construction) -   Atka  enters lowlands, -   Palatka -   Sokol -   Magadan } There is also a scenic shortcut from Magadan to Susuman via Ust-Omchug called the Tenkinskaya Trassa, which receives a lot less heavy traffic than the main section of the M56 between Magadan and Susuman.

Royal West has limited enrollment, and prospective students are only admitted after an entrance examination and interview. It is situated on Easton Avenue in Montreal West, but its students come from all parts of the Greater Montreal Area. Royal West Academy is part of the English Montreal School Board (EMSB). The EMSB allows Royal West to choose the first 180 students who score the highest points on the entrance exams held, usually, in October. The first 75-80 students with the highest grades get an \\"early acceptance\\"; the next 300 are interviewed, where they choose the next 110 that get to attend the following school year. Royal West has also placed high in scholastic math competitions, including its rank of first in Quebec in 2006. ==History== The grounds where Royal West is now located was once the Aberdeen School of Coteau Saint-Pierre. In 1894, the Aberdeen School was founded. It was renamed as the Montreal West High School in 1921. Ten years later, in 1931, the building was demolished and a larger building was built in its place. In 1951 and 1959, an extension to the main structure was built to make way for an elementary school. The extensions are what is now called the west wing. In 1980, the elementary school was closed because of poor enrollment. The Royal Vale elementary school moved in, but was closed as well. Finally, in 1983, the Royal Vale French immersion high school and Montreal West High School merged to form Royal West Academy. The new Royal West Academy is quite different from its predecessor; unlike most public schools it has a uniform and an entrance examination. Until 1998 the school was within the Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal.\\"Schools\\" (Archive). Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal. January 17, 1998.

Students are encouraged to submit art and literature for The Phoenix and there is one illustration of a Phoenix that is chosen each year for the cover. ==School grounds== One of the RWA Logos The oldest and largest section of the school is shaped like a rectangle and runs from end to end of the school property. It stands three stories high. Behind the main structure, there is a two-story addition colloquially entitled the West Wing. The school houses three gymnasiums (only two in use), three science laboratories, an auditorium, music room, a cafeteria, two art rooms, an exercise room (rarely used/ dance show and school teams only), three computer labs, and its own library. Royal West has two outdoor fields, one to the front of the school building and one to the back. The front field is a rectangular field with parameters suited mainly to soccer and football. The front field is used for classes, soccer and football games and on the last day of school for the annual Shaving Cream Fight. The back field is mainly used for classes and the BBQ held twice a year. During the 2000s, plans were drawn up to enlarge the school using portion of land where the new gymnasium and the back field is currently. In 2007, construction of the new gymnasium began. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on June 21, 2007. The new gym was opened during the first few weeks of 2008. The first major event held in the new gym was a basketball game between the teachers and the Montreal Alouettes. ==Student groups== ===Student Life Association=== The Student Life Association (SLA) at Royal West Academy is the organization responsible for most student life events at the school. These events include school dances, the Variety Show, Winter Carnival Day, Free Dress Days, BBQs, Movie nights, etc. In May of every school year, a full week of campaigning followed by a presentation of platforms by all Slates (2 Secondary 4 students, one Secondary 3 student, and one Secondary 2 student) who are willing to become the SLA executives for the following year, takes place. All students in the school vote for who they want to be responsible for their student life in the following year. Additionally, the Student Life Association is also made up of a Dance Committee, a Refreshments Committee, an Athletics Chair, a Special Events committee, an Environment Committee and Social Justice Club liaison, and others deemed appropriate by the executives. Members are awarded 3 extra- curricular credits of their choice for their work throughout the entire school year. Orientation Day Every year, the Student Life Association organizes an orientation day for new students, and secondary I. Group leaders participate in fun activities with students, organized by animators. Students are additionally given a tour of the school. Some traditional activities include dodgeball, and Earth Ball, played with a large red ball. The entire Student Life Association takes part. This year, the Environment Committee took part, organizing educative activities, and giving each participant a reusable lunch bag, and water bottle, as well as pen made from recycled materials. ===Prefects=== Prefects aid the school staff in ensuring that rules and proper conduct are followed by the student population. This usually translates into Prefects being present during cafeteria and library hours, as well as during special events and assemblies. Each prefect is awarded with one community and one cultural credit. Prefects are identifiable by their grey vests and head prefects are identifiable by their tartan vests, which they wear during their duty. Prefects are selected in May for the following school year. There are two head prefects, (seniors) and two foot prefects (Juniors). These head and foot prefects are elected by the other prefects. Prefects applying must be in grade 9 or 10, must submit an application in the form of an essay, and agree to an interview with the head and foot prefects, along with the involved staff. At this interview, candidates are tested to ensure that they are compliant to the form of leadership practiced by the head prefects. There are approximately 30 prefects each year. ===Bands=== The Honour Band represents the school in music competitions and festivals, and performs live for special occasions such as Memorial Day and graduation ceremonies. It consists of students in grades 9 through 11 who are selected through auditions. Its members wear specially made burgundy coats with pins representing the number of years they have been in band. The band also elects student executive members each year. The members of the student executive are the President, who acts as a liaison between the students and the band director, the Vice- President, who runs the publicity crew and prints tickets for each concert, the bookkeeper, (formerly known as the secretary/treasurer), who takes attendance each rehearsal and event, the Librarian, who organizes and distributes sheet music to the band, and the Equipment Manager, who is in charge of the Setup Crew, who in turn make sure that the stage is properly prepared for performances. The Royal West Academy Honour Band is also the only high school marching band in the city of Montreal, and participates annually in numerous parades in Ontario and the Montreal region, including the Montreal St. Patrick's Day Parade. Every year, an Honour Band performance trip is planned. Most recently, the Honour Band visited Cuba on a cultural exchange. There is also a Winds band composed of juniors, a Jazz Band composed of seniors, and an a cappella choir. In July 2008, the Jazz Band was selected to play on the main stage for Montreal's JazzFest. The Honour Band most recently won a gold medal at the 2014 English Montreal School Board (E. M. S. B.) Music Festival. ===Environment Committee=== The Environment Committee used to be called the \\"Environment Club\\", but underwent a name change to better reflect its current organization and objectives. Royal West Academy's Environment Committee is made up of students in grades 8 through to 11 who share the common goal of protecting our natural environment.http://www.rwaec.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=50&Itemid;=53 Consequently, the committee holds a variety of events throughout the school year to raise awareness of numerous environmental issues. Its annual \\"Earth Week\\" includes fun and informative events such as a \\"No Car Day\\", \\"No Trash Day\\" and a \\"No Lights Day\\", as well as assemblies, tree plantings, organic baking sessions and after-school screenings of environmental documentaries. During the 2006-2007 school year, it invited guest speakers from Greenpeace and the Sierra Club of Canada to come and talk about climate change, as well as the need to modify our daily habits to diminish our impact on the environment. During the 2008-2009 school year, members of the committee chose to present at these assemblies as opposed to inviting guest speakers; the assemblies during Earth Week therefore showcased all that committee members have done, and plan to do in the coming years, to make Royal West Academy more environmentally-friendly. The Environment Committee is also actively involved in changing the school's and the EMSB's environmental policies. It has built a park in the school's backfield,Royal West Academy Environment Committee campaigned Montreal West Town Hall for better recycling facilities (and thus helped to bring in a new recycling program)Montreal Gazette, \\"Victory parade on Earth Day\\" and is currently trying to eliminate cafeteria waste by replacing plastic utensils with reusable and compostable ones. The Environment Committee also has its own bi-monthly newsletter, the Eco-Ego, which features articles written by students on a variety of environmental topics. The Eco-Ego is published as part of the school's monthly newsletter, the RWA News. In addition, the committee regularly attends environmental forums as representatives of the school's environmental movement. In 2008, they were the \\"hosts\\" of Learning for a Sustainable Future's EcoLeague Youth Forum, which took place at Environment Canada's Biosphere Environment Museum. All students at RWA are able to apply to become members of the committee at the end of the school year for the following school year. As of the beginning of the 2009-2010 school year, the environment committee has its own homeroom, room 104. Members of the committee are invited to participate in an annual nature hike. On June 22, 2009, students hiked on Mont Saint-Hilaire. There is also an annual \\"eco-trip\\" that many Environment Committee members choose to attend, but the trip is open to all students at Royal West. During the 2008-2009 school year, the \\"eco-trip\\" was to a sustainable village in Costa Rica. The Environment Committee has a liaison within the Student Life Association so as to help Student Life Association become more environmentally friendly and to help the Environment Committee in its publicity campaigns. In 2009, they took part in the SLA's Orientation Day. ===Dance Show=== Royal West is well-known for their yearly dance show. All grade levels are involved and students practice all year long. 5-6 grade 10-11 students are chosen to be executive producers of the dance show. Their role is to organize the entire dance show from start to finish: running auditions, choreographing dances, responsible for accounting and ensuring all runs smoothly throughout the year and the day of. The dance show usually takes place at the end of March. Some dance scenes performed include hip-hop, stomp, salsa, contemporary, couples, dancehall and many more. ===Social Justice Club=== The Social Justice Club is a student-run activist group whose purpose is to spread awareness within Royal West and within the community of current social or political issues. It explores topics as various as human rights, HIV/AIDS, and land mines in its weekly meetings and organises awareness campaigns, fundraisers, supply packages, and petitions with the objective being to cause positive change. Its yearly trip has brought members to other countries including Ecuador, Bolivia, Brazil, Honduras, and South Africa to gain a better perspective of the world. The club supported a petition campaign demanding action by Stephen Harper and the Canadian government to return the Cree their lands, which are being used for oil. Additionally, members of the Social Justice Club publish a periodical newsletter called \\"The Activist,\\" which features letters from students, editorials, and articles on different social justice issues in Canada and around the world. ===Debating=== The school is well known for its debating team, which has a long and successful history at both the provincial and national level. The team is coached weekly by a dedicated staff member and student managers. ===Reach For The Top=== The school has had a Reach For The Top team for several years. In 2008, the team became the Provincial Champions and went on to compete in the National Competition. ===Bardolators=== The school has a theatre group for students that performs two Shakespeare plays per year and Shakescenes, which are presented to the Secondary 1 to 3 English classrooms. It has weekly meetings and rehearsals in the auditorium. There are many Bardolator trips. In 2008 and 2016, the students went to England: specifically, London and Stratford-upon-Avon. Most years, it visits Stratford, Ontario. A graduating Bardolator used to receive a special academic course credit for the activities in theatre but now receives all possible extracurricular credits. ===Shaving Cream Fight=== At the last day of school before exams, students of Royal West gather in the front field and participate in a ritual in which they cover each other in shaving cream, with classical music blasted over loudspeakers. ===Welcome Back BBQ=== The Welcome Back BBQ is set up every year, usually during the first month and the second Friday of the school year. Students gather in the back field and feast on hot dogs and chips. Games such as tug of war and watermelon-eating contests are set up on the field to entertain students. The event is organized by the SLA. ===Goodbye BBQ=== The Goodbye BBQ is more recently established and takes place during the last month and last Friday of the school year. It is similar in structure to the Welcome Back BBQ. Students gather in the grounds behind the school, where hot dogs, drinks, popsicles, and watermelon slices are served. Various games are set up throughout the field to entertain the students, such as hot potato. Also, during both the Welcome and the Goodbye BBQs, people sing karaoke. The event is also organized by the SLA. ==Notable graduates== *Conrad Pla, Canadian Actor *Tim Fletcher of The Stills *Adam Gollner, author *Dan Guterman, staff writer, The Colbert Report *Laurin Liu, former NDP MP *Parker Mitchell, co-CEO and co-Founder of Engineers Without Borders Canada *Robert Naylor, actor *Karl R.

Nordstrom, Scandinavia Since 1500, 2000, p. 36, , It also settled Swedish, Danish and Holy Roman Imperial claims regarding the Livonian War. Unfavourable for Sweden, it assured Danish hegemony in Northern Europe for a short period. Yet, because of its inconclusiveness it did not prevent further warfare between Denmark-Norway and Sweden ending only in the 1720s.The Riverside Dictionary of Biography: A Comprehensive Reference Covering 10,000 of the World's Most Important People, From Ancient Times to the Present Day herausgegeben von American Heritage Dictionary, 2005, p. 295, , ==Background== The Kalmar Union comprising Sweden, Denmark and Norway, had broken apart in 1523. Frederick II of Denmark attempted to restore the Union under his rule. Frederick underlined his claim by using the Union's three crowns in his coat of arms and invaded Sweden in 1563; both actions are considered the starting events of the Seven Years' War. While the Danes had the upper hand in land battles and captured Älvsborg, the Swedes performed better in naval battles and in Livonia, which had been secularized before and now was a subject of territorial competition of the surrounding powers.Fred Singleton, Frederick Bernard Singleton, Anthony F. Upton, A Short History of Finland, 1998, p. 37, , ==The treaty== In July 1570, Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor initiated a peace congress in Stettin (after 1945 Szczecin), aiming to mediate between Sweden and Denmark.R. Nisbet Bain, Scandinavia: A Political History of Denmark, Norway and Sweden from 1513 to 1900, 2006 [1905], p. 83, , Several diplomats acted as mediators: The host, Pomeranian duke Johann Friedrich of Pomerania-Stettin, acted as head of the delegates sent by his emperor, Maximilian; French envoy at the Danish court Charles Dancey, who had been heavily involved in the preparation of the congress, was among the mediators; Martin Kromer, bishop of Warmia (Ermland) and others were sent by the Polish king Sigismund Augustus; Augustus of Saxony attended in person. Of the parties, Denmark was represented by Peder Bille (Bilde), Jørgen Rosenkrantz, Henrik Rantzau, Niels Kaas, and Joachim Henke (Hinck); Sweden sent baron Jöran Gera, Bengt Gylta, Erik Gyllenstjerna (Gyllenstierna), and others.Eduard Maria Oettinger, Geschichte des dänischen Hofes, 1857, pp. 242-3 In the resulting treaty, Sweden and Denmark-Norway agreed on the following: *The Danish-Norwegian king, Frederick II of Denmark, renounced all claims upon Sweden. *The Swedish king, John III of Sweden, renounced all pretensions to Norwegian provinces and Gotland. Thus, Sweden acknowledged for the first time Skåne, Blekinge and Halland as Danish provinces. *Sweden was forced to pay 150,000 riksdaler for the ransom of Älvsborg Castle (Älvsborgs lösen; Elfsborgs løsen). To pay this extraordinarily high amount of money, Sweden heavily taxed all moveables in the country, resulting in further impoverishment of the war-torn population. Unburned towns had to pay one twelfth, peasants one tenth, burned down towns one eighteenth of their properties' value.Charles Poor Kindleberger, A Financial History of Western Europe, 1993, p. 227, , *Sweden was also forced to pay 75,000 daler to Lübeck. *Sweden turned over her possessions in Livonia for a payment by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II. ==Outcome== With the treaty, Denmark became the supreme and dominating power in Northern Europe, yet failed to restore the Kalmar Union. The disputes concerning the three crowns insignia remained unsolved, and the unfavorable conditions for Sweden led to a series of future conflicts ending only in 1720/21. Lübeck gained nothing from the treaty: though granted privileges by Sweden, these did not enhance Lübeck's position as John III of Sweden granted the same privileges to the Pomeranian port of Stralsund, his war-time ally. The payments promised to Lübeck were never transferred. Swedish pirates continued to capture Lübeck's shipments, and the town as well as the whole Hanseatic League, had to acknowledge her degradation to a second-class power. Neither did Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor, pay the compensation promised to Sweden, and therefore lost his influence on the Baltic affairs. The terms of the treaty regarding Livonia were ignored, and the contemporary Livonian War dragged on. Denmark received all payments, though always late except for the first. John III was determined to keep his only port on the Scandinavian west coast, and his efforts included the sale of warships and devaluation of the Swedish currency. ==See also== *List of treaties *Treaty of Stettin (1630) *Treaty of Stettin (1653) *Treaty of Stettin (1715) ==References== ==External links== *Scan of the Dano-Swedish treaty at IEG Mainz *Scan of the German-Swedish treaty concerning Livonia at IEG Mainz *Scan of the treaty between Lübeck and Sweden at IEG Mainz Szczecin Szczecin Category:History of Szczecin Category:History of Lübeck Szczecin Szczecin Category:Treaties of Denmark–Norway Stettin (1570) Category:1570 in Denmark Category:1570 in Sweden Category:1570 in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:1570 treaties ","title":"Treaty of Stettin (1570)"},{"id":"2584796","text":"Statue of Queen Charlotte in the Square Queen Square is a garden square in the Bloomsbury district of central London. Many of its buildings are associated with medicine, particularly neurology. ==Construction== Queen Square in 1786, painted by Edward Dayes. The fields to the north reach as far as Hampstead. The church of St George the Martyr is in the left foreground. Also visible are the first few houses beyond the corner of Cosmo Place now containing the Queen's Larder. Queen Square was originally constructed between 1716 and 1725. It was formed from the garden of the house of Sir John Cutler baronet (1608–1693), whose last surviving child, Lady Radnor, died in 1697 leaving no issue. It was left open to the north for the landscape formed by the hills of Hampstead and Highgate. == Queen Charlotte and treatment for George III == A statue contained within the square was misidentified as depicting Queen Anne. This statue is now believed to be a portrayal of Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III. George III was treated for mental illness in a house in Queen Square towards the end of his reign. The public house on the southwest corner of the square, called \\"the Queen’s Larder\\", was, according to legend, used by Queen Charlotte to store food for the king during his treatment. The church, dedicated to St George the Martyr, was built following public subscription in 1706. The church's rector from 1747 to 1765 was the famous antiquary William Stukeley, whose rectory was next to the residence of the Duke of Powis.'Queen Square and Great Ormond Street', Old and New London: Volume 4 (1878), pp. 553-564 ==Late 19th century== Built in the early 18th century as a fashionable area, by the mid-19th century it had attracted many French refugees and the shops of sundry booksellers and print sellers. It became a favoured centre for charitable institutions, including the Roman Catholic Aged Poor Society at #31, and the Society of St Vincent de Paul. Gradually the mansions were turned into hospitals and other institutions. The first institution which is still in the square was started by Johanna Chandler in 1860.Jennett Humphreys, ‘Chandler, Johanna (1820–1875)’, rev. Patrick Wallis, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 7 Dec 2014 Elizabeth Malleson started the Working Women's College here in 1864.Owen Stinchcombe, ‘Malleson , Elizabeth (1828–1916)’, rev. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 29 July 2015 The College of Preceptors (also known as the College of Teachers) occupied #42 Queen Square from 1855 until 1887. ==20th and 21st centuries == Many of the buildings surrounding the square are devoted to providing, researching and administering health care. Two hospitals, the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (NHNN), often referred to synechdochally as \\"Queen Square\\", and the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine (formerly the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital), make up the east side of the square. The Institute of Neurology, part of University College London (UCL), is located in the north east corner of the square. The former Institute for Public Health takes up much of the north side - the building is now used as the administrative centre for the NHNN and Institute of Neurology. Several buildings on the west side of the square are devoted to medical research and are part of the Institute of Neurology and other departments of UCL. These include Alexandra House at number 17, which houses the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit. The Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging (commonly referred to as the Functional Imaging Laboratory) is located at number 12. Numbers 8-11, the Sir Charles Symmonds House, houses the Dementia Research Centre on the first floor and the Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases on the ground floor. At the southern end of the square is the church mentioned above, the Mary Ward Centre for adult education, and the former Italian Hospital, now part of Great Ormond Street Hospital for children (whose main buildings are in Great Ormond Street, off Queen Square). A women-only Turkish bath operated in Queen Square from 1930 to 1962. The site is now occupied by the Imperial Hotel.http://www.queensquare.org.uk/archives/record/QSA/15196 One of the buildings, the Sobell Department, contains a lecture theatre used by UCL for postgraduate teaching.

Das was part of a group of moderate Indian nationalists that sought to create a \\"British-style\\" public school in India, which ultimately led, after his death, to the creation of The Doon School. ==Early life and career== After completing school and university education in England, Das returned to India in 1894. The idea of The Doon School originated from his participation in the\\"growing search for a national Indian identity.\\" Although he died seven years before the school actually opened, Das and others in his informal group had lobbied for it during the 1920s. Das and the rest of the group envisaged an Indian school patterned on the British public school, which he felt had effectively trained young men to become responsible and resourceful administrators throughout the British Empire. But in contrast to British schools, the founders of the Doon School wanted an Indian school to be nonsectarian and responsive to Indian aspirations. The founders saw Doon as the training ground for a new generation of Indian leaders who would take over the reins of administration and government following Independence. By copying the model of the British public school, the founders were attempting to show that Indians could compete with the British on their own terms without relinquishing their national or cultural identity. This reflected the views of many Indian leaders and intellectuals of the time, but certainly not all. Characteristically, Jawaharlal Nehru welcomed the creation of the school but Mohandas K. Gandhi would have nothing to do with it. In 1922, Das he was appointed Advocate- General of Bengal.The Edinburgh Gazette. 7 November 1922. Page 701 In 1927, he became a member of the Viceroy's Executive Council of Lord Irwin. ==Personal life== Das was born in 1870 to Durga Mohan Das, a social reformer. He belonged to the Baidya Das family of Telirbagh, Bikrampur, Dhaka, now in Bangladesh. He was cousin to Chittaranjan Das and Sudhi Ranjan Das (Chief Justice of India). Das's two sisters were Sarala Roy who founded the Gokhale Memorial School in Calcutta, and Abala Bose, wife of scientist Jagadish Bose. Das was married to Bonalata Devi. One of his grandsons, Shomie Das, went on to serve as headmaster of The Doon School. == Death == In the summer of 1928, SR Das spent a good deal of his time in England visiting schools and discussing his scheme with well known educationists. Towards the end of that summer, he returned to India and went to Shimla to resume his duties. He soon became unwell and died in Calcutta on 26 October 1928. ==References== ==Further reading== *Chopra, Radhika & Jeffery, Patricia M. (Eds.) (2005). Educational Regimes in Contemporary India.

When users try to log in, the fake login program can then capture user passwords for later use.

Their first product, the Fairlight, was a glass-fibre body shell priced at £49 for fitting to a Ford chassis. The first car, not destined for production, which subsequently became known as the Ginetta G1, was based on a pre-war Wolseley Hornet six. The four Walklett brothers each had their areas of expertise: Bob was the managing director, Douglas was the mechanical engineer and also handled the electrical work, Ivor was the designer and Trevers was the stylist, working closely with Ivor. From their original base, the company moved to Witham, Essex, in 1962, and between 1972 and 1974 operated from larger premises in Ballingdon Street adjacent to the railway bridge Sudbury, Suffolk, before returning to Witham. In 1988, the Walklett brothers needed bigger premises and so moved the company to Scunthorpe where they could expand. On 7 November 1989, the Walkletts sold Ginetta to an international group of enthusiasts, based in Sheffield and run by managing director Martin Phaff. Ginetta was in a strong financial position at the time of its sale and the Walkletts went on to retire. Under Phaff, the company went on to produce the Ginetta G20 and the Ginetta G33. It was during this period that the company hit troubled times. ===21st century=== In late 2005, Ginetta was acquired by LNT Automotive, a company run by race car driver, engineer and businessman Lawrence Tomlinson. His aims were in line with the founders; to produce innovative, capable and great value sports cars. In mid-2007, Ginetta moved to a factory near Leeds, with a target to sell 200 cars per year. Tomlinson himself penned the base specification for the Ginetta G50, which marked 50 years of Ginetta production and became a successful GT4 car. In March 2010, Ginetta acquired the Somerset-based sports car manufacturer Farbio, and re-badged their car as the Ginetta F400. In March 2011, Ginetta launched the G55, which competed in the Michelin Ginetta GT Supercup and was built to comply to the GT3 class regulations. In October 2011, Ginetta launched the G60, a two-door mid-engine sports car developed from the F400 and powered by a Ford-sourced 3.7 litre V6 engine. ==Models== Models produced by Ginetta include the following: ===G2=== Ginetta's first car, the G2, was produced as a kit car for enthusiasts and consisted of a tubular frame chassis to take Ford components and aluminium body. About 100 were produced. === G3 and G4=== 1964-1968 Ginetta G4R The G3 was introduced with a glass fibre body in 1959 to be followed by the G4 in 1961.For road test see Motor Sport, September 1962, Pages 690, 693. The G4 used the new Ford 105E engine and had a glass fibre GT-style body along with the suspension updated to coil springing at the front with a Ford live axle at the rear. Whereas the G2 and G3 had been designed for racing, the G4 was usable as an everyday car but still was very competitive in motorsport with numerous successes. In 1963, a coupé variant was introduced alongside the open-top variant and a BMC axle replaced the Ford unit at the rear.Motor Sport, May 1963, Pages 345-346. In road tests, the car attains a top speed of with a 1,500 cc engine.Motor Sport, April 1964, Pages 260-261. The series III version of 1966 added pop-up headlights. Production stopped in 1968 but was revived in 1981 with the Series IV which was wider and longer than the III. Over 500 units were made up to 1969 with a variety of Ford engines. ===G4 Series IV=== Ginetta G4 Series IV The G4 was re-introduced in 1981 as the G4 Series IV, with a new chassis.Peter Higston, The Enthusiasts' Guide to Buying a Classic British Sports Car, 2007, page 60 It was produced through to 1984 with approximately 35 examples built. The Series IV was powered by a 1,599 cc Ford four-cylinder engine.John Blunsden, The Observer's Book of Automobiles, Twenty-fifth Edition, 1982, page 92 ===G10, G11 and G12=== Ginetta G12 Launched at the 1965 Racing car show, the Ginetta G10 was meant to be a more powerful racing car than its predecessors. Weighing around and fitted with a V8 engine from the Ford Mustang, it was well received by the enthusiasts. Ginetta works driver Chris Meek secured a win with a prototype at the car's debut at Brands Hatch, beating a Jaguar E-Type which was considered to be the most successful GT racing car. However Ginetta failed to make a homologated version of the G10 in order for it to keep competing and as a result, it was forced out of the competition with a total production of only three cars. Following the reception the G10 had generated, Ginetta produced the G11, a street legal version of the G10 with the same body but with the Ford V8 replaced by the MGB 1800 engine. However, slow deliveries of the engine curbed production of the car and therefore only a handful were made.https://www.dkeng.co.uk/press/1451909267-94fe01c5a552f5a3b1ba64b0dcd53506.pdfGinetta G10 and G11 Unveiled in 1966, the G12 was an evolution of the G4 but had many new features that made it stand apart from its predecessors. The car had a new tubular steel space frame chassis, with the cockpit section mounted to it for extra strength, while removable body work allowed for easy repair. The front suspension consisted of Triumph-derived uprights and double wishbones (with camber adjustment courtesy of rose-joints on the upper items) and coil springs. While, at the rear, the usual arrangement of single upper transverse links with lower reversed wishbones (with rose-joints) and radius arms was present, along with coil springs. The car was fitted with anti-roll bars for increased safety, and the Triumph-sourced Girling disc brakes at the front and rear ensured increased stopping power. Power came from a 1.0 litre Cosworth SCA inline-four engine, though larger engines were fitted later such as an Aston Martin V8, but were less successful. The G12 dominated the competition in its class, outclassing Lotus Elan 26Rs and Coventry Climaxes, winning the 1,150 cc MN series. Outside track racing, the G12 also found success at hill climb events, before it was replaced by the G16. Approximately 28 were built. ===G15=== 1969 Ginetta G15 In 1967 the G15, utilizing a rear-mounted 875 cc Sunbeam Imp engine, was launched.Michael Sedgwick & Mark Gillies, A-Z of Cars 1945-1970, page 82 This two-seat coupé had a glass fibre body bolted to a tube chassis and used Imp rear and Triumph front suspension. Approximately 800 were produced from 1967 to 1974 and the car was fully type approved allowing for complete Ginetta cars to be sold for the first time. Eight G15s were produced with Volkswagen engines and called \\"Super S\\". ===G21=== 1974 Ginetta G21 In 1970, the G15 was joined by the larger G21, which was initially available with either a 4-cylinder 1.75 litre sourced from the Rootes Group (Sunbeam) or a 3.0 litre Ford Essex V6 engine. The car largely used Rootes components. The 1.7 litre Sunbeam Rapier engine subsequently became the standard four-cylinder engine for the car. 80 cars in total were produced before production ceased in 1974 due to the oil crisis. The car was later morphed into an open top G23 and G24 coupé version but none of those variants went to production. ===G19=== The G19 was a single seater Formula 3 racing car of which only one was produced. ===G20=== 2005 Ginetta G20 ===GRS Tora=== Trevor Walklett owned a 1968 Hillman Hunter which had been put up due to rust. Inspired by the success of the Dutton Sierra estate kit car, Ginetta developed a Range Rover-inspired fibreglass station wagon body for installation onto the Hunter's underpinnings. Called the GRS Tora Mark I it was first shown in October 1982, going on sale the next year. Although it was a two-door estate, it used the front doors of a four-door Hunter. These are shorter than a normal two-door design, leading to limited rear seat access and somewhat awkward proportions. More troubling was that the Hunter's fuel tank and filler location meant that the rear gate opening was very high, limiting the cars utility. In October 1983, a GRS Tora Pickup was shown.Pyman, p. 6 In August 1984, the GRS Tora Mark II started deliveries. This version rectified the concerns with the rear opening, with a relocated fuel tank (and filler now mounted on the flank of the car) allowing for a full-height rear gate. Being more expensive than the simpler Mark I model the two were offered side by side. Sales of the GRS Tora helped Ginetta stay afloat in the 1980s, but by 1988 Tora production gradually came to a halt as the market was changing and donor cars were becoming rarer. At the July 1989 Newark Kit Car Show, Ginetta showed a GRS Tora Mark III. Unlike previous models, this was a four-door estate (of a rather beefy appearance) on Ford Cortina saloon underpinnings. It used the doors as well as the taillights of a Mark IV Cortina four-door saloon, and had Cortina engines or the option of a Perkins diesel. Only two were built, and Ginetta went back to its main business of making sports cars. All in all, about 320 Toras of all variants were built. ===G26, G28, G30 and G31=== Following reorganisation, the company moved to Scunthorpe and began making cars in kit form again in the 1980s starting with the G27 and followed by the G26, G28, G30 and G31, with all cars using Ford parts. The G26 was the first model to arrive, in 1984. The G26 and G31 both used flip-up headlamps; the G26 and G30 were fastback coupés while the G28 and G31 had a notchback profile. The design used the Ford Cortina Mk3/Mk4 drivetrain and parts installed in a galvanized steel chassis of Ginetta's own construction. Originally, only four-cylinder engines could be fitted, but the G28's taller bonnetline made room for Ford's Cologne V6 engine. The bodywork was fibreglass, although the doors were the Ford Fiesta's steel units. The rear window on the fastback designs was also from the Fiesta, while the sportier notchbacks used the small window from the Sierra XR4i. 280 G26 were built. While the G31 was the last addition to the G26 line, it sold pretty well, with around 70 cars finished. Six G28 and fourteen G30 were finished, although since these cars were only available as kits it is unknown how many kits were actually sold. The total production of the G26 and its derivatives is about 370 cars. The G29 code was assigned to a one-off competition car for the Thundersports racing series. ===G27=== The G27, which was introduced in November 1985, was a two-seater sports car derived from the G4. It uses the front suspension from the Triumph Vitesse, a modified Jaguar independent rear suspension, and could be fitted with a wide range of engines up to the Rover V8. This design was then used for the G33's bodywork as well. ===G32 and G33=== It was decided to re-enter the complete car business with the mid-engined G32 with a choice of 1.6 or 1.9 litre four-cylinder engine, available as a coupé or convertible and the G33 speedster which was equipped with a 3.9 litre Rover V8 capable of a top speed of and a acceleration time of 5 seconds. In 1990, the G32 coupé cost £13,700 (), the convertible £14,600 (), and the G33 £17,800 (). The G33 was a development of the G27, itself derived from the G4. Unlike the G27, the G33 was only available as a complete car. In terms of appearance, the windshield, with its body-coloured frame, was the main difference compared to the G27. Under the body, the G33 used the suspension parts from the rear-wheel drive Ford Sierra Cosworth, rather than the mixed setup from the G27. ===G50=== Ginetta G50 GT4 After Ginetta was acquired by Lawrence Tomlinson in 2005, the company began work on the design of the Ginetta G50 - utilising a 3.5 litre V6 engine, generating a power output of - to celebrate the company's 50th anniversary. In 2007, the car competed in its first race in the European GT4 Cup, in Nogaro France, finishing second. Soon after this success, the car was officially launched at Autosport International in early 2008 alongside its sister car, the Ginetta G50 GT4. Together, they have become Ginetta's best selling cars, and have race wins that include the Dubai 24 Hour endurance race in 2012 with Optimum Motorsport. ===G60=== Ginetta G60 In March 2010, Lawrence acquired the Somerset-based sports car manufacturer Farbio, and in doing so inherited the F400, which was subsequently redesigned, redeveloped and rebranded from the Farbio Marque, into the Ginetta G60; a two-door mid-engined sports car which shares the same 3.7-litre V6 engine as its G55 GT3 stablemate and is capable of in 4.9 seconds, with a top speed of . ===G40=== Ginetta G40 In 2010, Lawrence implemented a newer, safer car into the existing Ginetta Junior series and in doing so, replaced the old Ginetta G20 race car with a G40J. Following the success of the G40J, Ginetta decided to introduce a Ginetta G40 Challenge car for the adult racers in its Challenge series. With the same engine as its sister car, the G40 Challenge car is capable of and competes against existing G20 models. Today, the car features heavily in the Total Quartz Ginetta GT5 Challenge. Ginetta unveiled its second road car, the Ginetta G40R, in 2011. It was designed to mimic the Walklett brothers' original vision of 'a race car for the road'. Capable of in 5.8 seconds, the G40R shares a number of characteristics with its racing siblings. ===G55=== Ginetta G55 2011 saw the introduction of the G55 Cup car to the Ginetta GT Supercup, which, until that point, had only featured the G50 Cup car. Offering a 3.7 litre V6 engine generating a maximum power output of , the car provided Ginetta with the basis for their Ginetta G55 GT3 car; a larger spec car which gives GT teams a 4.35 L V8 powerplant. ===Akula=== Ginetta Akula On 5 March 2019, at the Geneva International Motor Show, Ginetta announced a new supercar called the Akula, Russian for \\"shark\\". ==Motorsport== ===Michelin Ginetta GT4 SuperCup=== The Michelin Ginetta GT4 SuperCup is a single-class race series which features both the Ginetta G50 and G55 sports cars; running in support of the British Touring Car Championship. The championship began as the Ginetta G50 Cup in 2008, supporting the British Formula Three Championship and British GT Championship. In 2009, it moved to support the BTCC. In 2011, with the introduction of the Ginetta G55, the championship became the Michelin Ginetta GT4 SuperCup. The 2014 season will be the fourth running of the Michelin Ginetta GT4 Supercup, but it will be the first year in which the G50 GT4 and G55 GT4 cars are consolidated into one single class. In order to maintain fair competition, the two models will be equalised through a balance of performance test. ===Protyre Motorsport Ginetta GT5 Challenge=== The Protyre Motorsport Ginetta GT5 Challenge offers a unique, low-cost opportunity to race in a single-make racing championship, over seven race weekends supporting the British GT package. For 2014, the series will once again return to Spa for an international round alongside the Swedish Ginetta Challenge series. A popular entry-level championship for many GT racers, the series boasts packed grids with close racing. All weekends are triple headers, providing 21 races throughout the season, with all races counting towards the final championship positions. ===Prototype=== Ginetta G60-LT-P1 Ginetta supplies customer LMP3 cars for the European Le Mans Series and Asian Le Mans Series as well as the IMSA Prototype Challenge. In 2017, Ginetta developed a LMP1 class car the Ginetta G60-LT-P1.http://sportscar365.com/lemans/wec/ginetta-announces- lmp1-chassis-for-2018/ For the 2018-19 FIA World Endurance Championship season Ginetta entered 2 G60-LT-P1 in the WEC series in conjunction with TRSM Racing Manor. At the 2018 24 Hours of Le Mans, the #5 car finished 5th in class, while the #6 car retired after 10 hours due to persistent electrical issues. ==See also== * List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * ==External links== * Official Ginetta Cars website * Ginetta Owners Club * Ginetta Racing Site * Ginetta Club Category:Car manufacturers of the United Kingdom Category:Manufacturing companies based in Leeds Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1958 Category:1958 establishments in England ","title":"Ginetta Cars"},{"id":"2584871","text":"Talal El Karkouri (, born 8 July 1976) is a Moroccan former professional footballer.

He played in the UEFA Cup and UEFA Champions League, but after failing to capture a regular place he was sent on loan to Aris in Greece. On 31 January 2003 he was loaned to Sunderland of the Premier League until the end of the season. His spell was affected by injury, and he was released on 26 May after the club were relegated. The Black Cats lost in all eight of his appearances. ===Charlton=== In the summer of 2004, he was bought by Charlton Athletic of the Premier League for £1 million. He scored 5 goals in his debut season at Charlton, starting with the only goal in a win over Blackburn Rovers on 27 September 2004, by heading Danny Murphy's corner. He also scored the club's goal of the season against Arsenal. On 6 April 2006, having made only 12 appearances all season, he was loaned to Al-Gharafa in Qatar.

He was accused of a similar act against Reading on 9 April 2007 later in the same season, this time involving Reading striker Leroy Lita, who headbutted him. Reading boss Steve Coppell accused El Karkouri of faking a 'death roll' and claimed that he would have needed treatment in intensive care had Lita headbutted him. Lita urged the FA to do something about 'diving cheats' after being hit with the ban. He said \\"I didn't touch him, he went down like an idiot and it was cheating\\". The FA disagreed and banned the Reading striker for three games for violent conduct. Coppell did not apologise for his comments. ===Qatar=== On 10 June 2007, following his release and Charlton's relegation, El Karkouri signed a two-year contract with Qatar Sports Club.

It is part of the Prague metropolitan area. It lies upon the Elbe river, Brandýs nad Labem on the left bank and Stará Boleslav on the right bank. Brandýs nad Labem dates its origin to the 13th century. The town was originally named as Boleslav by Boleslav I who built here his castle in the beginning of the 10th century. In 1960, the two adjacent towns were joined to form one town of Brandýs nad Labem-Stará Boleslav. With a population of about 19,000, it is the second largest Czech united pair of towns after Frýdek-Místek. ==Stará Boleslav== Stará Boleslav is a historical Czech town and the oldest pilgrimage site in Central Bohemia. It was an early Přemyslid dynasty stronghold built in the late 9th and 10th century and surrounded by stone ramparts. Its fame came from a major historical event: the murder of Prince Wenceslas by his brother Boleslav at the gate of St Cosmas and Damian Church on September 28, 935 (or 929). After his death, Wenceslas was proclaimed a saint by the church and became the patron saint of the Czech nation as well as a symbol of moral reinforcement during hard times. After the year 1039, Bretislaus I established a new Romanesque basilica dedicated to St. Wenceslas (consecrated in 1046 by the Prague bishop) at the site of the murder and pilgrimage site. Moreover, Bretislaus I had the Collegiate Chapter of St Cosmas and Damian, the oldest in Bohemia, built next to the basilica. By the end of the 11th century, the adjoining Romanesque St Clement Chapel was built. It is valuable for its Romanesque frescos from the latter half of the 12th century depicting scenes from St Clement's life and martyrdom. In 1310 Bohemia fell under the House of Luxemburg and subsequently the Habsburgs. Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV (d.1368) visited the town in the 14th century, supported the Chapter, and had new ramparts built. The Hussite Wars starting in 1420 represented the beginning of the town's decline. Most of the buildings, including the Chapter house and the churches, were burned down, and the Chapter fled to Žitava. In the late 16th and early 17th centuries, Boleslav regained its earlier fame through the cult of Madonna. In 1617–1625 the new baroque Church of the Assumption of Mary was built by Jacoppo de Vaccani, containing a relief of the Madonna called the Palladium of the Czech Lands. In 2003, the St Wenceslas National Pilgrimage to Stará Boleslav was renewed and is now the largest official celebration of St Wenceslas Day (Czech Statehood Day, September 28). On this occasion Pope Benedict XVI visited the St Wenceslas basilica and held mass for over 50,000 people who had gathered in Stará Boleslav. ==Legacy of the Communist regime== According to an article in Le Monde, the town is one of the least religious in all of the Czech Republic, and indeed of all of Europe and the world. Communists tried to repress the Catholic religion from the 1950s to the 1980s, something which continues to have profound effects on contemporary life in the town. ==Trivia== The name of this municipality is the second longest in the Czech Republic (after Nová Ves u Nového Města na Moravě) with 32 letters and spaces. ==Twin towns – sister cities== Brandýs nad Labem- Stará Boleslav is twinned with: * Dunaivtsi, Ukraine * Gödöllő, Hungary * Montescudaio, Italy ==Gallery== Image:Stara Boleslav.JPGMedieval tower in Stará Boleslav Image:Mariánské náměstí.jpgCenter of Stará Boleslav Image:BazilikasvVaclavasb.jpgSt. Wenceslas basilica in Stará Boleslav Image:PannaMariasb.jpgChurch of the Assumption of Mary in Stará Boleslav ==ReferencesMunicipal website * Place of pilgrimage Category:Cities and towns in the Czech Republic Category:Populated places in Prague-East District ","title":"Brandýs nad Labem-Stará Boleslav"},{"id":"2584874","text":"Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) is a Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) family multicast routing protocol defined by Experimental RFC 3618. Despite becoming the IPv4 de facto standard for inter-domain multicast, development of the protocol stopped in 2006 and it was decided by the authors not to proceed with making it a proposed standard. MSDP interconnects multiple IPv4 PIM Sparse-Mode (PIM-SM) domains which enables PIM-SM to have Rendezvous Point (RP) redundancy and inter-domain multicasting RFC 4611. MSDP uses TCP as its transport protocol. Each multicast tree needs to have its own RP. All of the RPs are peers (directly or through other MSDP peers). Messages contain the sender (source) address and the multicast group address (S,G). If an RP on its own domain receives a message, it determines if there are listeners for this group. If listeners exist, it triggers a PIM join into the source domain towards the data source. In a peering relationship, one MSDP peer listens for new TCP connections on the well-known port 639. MSDP is deliberately unspecified for IPv6, for a number of reasons, including that protocols such as Source-Specific Multicast (SSM), Bi-directional Multicast and IPv6 Embedded Rendezvous Points would mean there was less requirement for MSDP. ==External links== * Multicast BGP == References == Category:Routing protocols Category:Internet protocols ","title":"Multicast Source Discovery Protocol"},{"id":"2584875","text":"The addition of Finnish area in the Treaty of Tyavzino The Treaty of Teusina, Tyavzin or Tyavzino (), also known as the Eternal Peace with Sweden in Russia, was concluded by Russian diplomats under boyar Afanasiy Pushkin (the poet's ancestor) and ambassadors of the Swedish king at the village of Tyavzino (, ) in Ingria on 18 May 1595 to end the Russo-Swedish War (1590–95) between the powers. The treaty revised the provisions of the Truce of Plussa of 1583, restoring to Russia all territory then ceded to Sweden except for Narva. Russia received most of Ingria, with the towns of Ivangorod, Jama, Koporye and Korela Fortress. In effect, the treaty restored the borders predating the Livonian War. The Swedish-Russian border was delineated from the outstream of the Systerbäck river into the Gulf of Finland, over lakes Saimaa, Inari, the settlement of Neiden and up to the Murman Sea. Russia had to renounce all claims on Estonia including Narva, and Sweden's sovereignty over Estonia from 1561 was confirmed.

'migration-anxiety') is the experience of migratory restlessness. == Ethology == In ethology, Zugunruhe describes anxious behavior in migratory animals, especially in birds during the normal migration period. When these animals are enclosed, such as in an Emlen funnel, Zugunruhe serves to study the seasonal cycles of the migratory syndrome. Zugunruhe involves increased activity towards and after dusk with changes in the normal sleep pattern. > \\"In accordance with their inherited calendars, birds get an urge to move. > When migratory birds are held in captivity, they hop about, flutter their > wings and flit from perch to perch just as birds of the same species are > migrating in the wild.

Accessed 30 January 2018. == Etymology == Zugunruhe is borrowed from German; it is a German compound word consisting of Zug, \\"move, migration,\\" and unruhe (anxiety, restlessness). The word was first published in 1707, when it was used to describe the \\"inborn migratory urge\\" in captive migrants. Though common nouns are normally not capitalised in English, Zugunruhe is sometimes capitalised following the German convention. ==Effect== Zugunruhe has been artificially induced in experiments by simulating long days. Some studies on White-crowned Sparrows have suggested that prolactin is involved in the pre-migratory hyperphagia (feeding), fattening and Zugunruhe. However, others have found that prolactin may merely be associated with lipogenesis (fat accumulation). Researchers have been able to study the endocrine controls and navigational mechanisms associated with migration by studying Zugunruhe. The phenomenon of Zugunruhe was generally believed to be found only in migratory species; however, a study of a resident species has shown low-level Zugunruhe, including oriented activity, suggesting that the endogenous mechanisms for migratory behaviour may be present even in a resident species. Further suggestions for endogenous programs are provided by observations that the number of nights on which Zugunruhe is exhibited by caged migrants appears related to the distance of migration involved. ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Bird migration Category:Ethology Category:German words and phrases ","title":"Zugunruhe"},{"id":"2584882","text":"The Qing Ding Pearl (《慶頂珠》, simplified 庆顶珠) is a Chinese play.

The author proposes that sometime around the end of the last Ice Age this civilisation ended in cataclysm, but passed on to its inheritors profound knowledge of such things as astronomy, architecture and mathematics. Hancock's views are based on the idea that mainstream interpretations of archaeological evidence are flawed or incomplete. The book was followed by Magicians of the Gods.https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2015/12/13/religion- spirituality-and-faith/ ==Thesis== The Mesoamerican deity Quetzalcoatl as depicted in the Codex Magliabechiano. Hancock argues for a civilisation centred on Antarctica (which lay farther from the South Pole than today) that supposedly left evidence (the \\"fingerprints\\" of the title) in Ancient Egypt and American civilisations such as the Olmec, Aztec and Maya. Hancock discusses: * creation myths describing deities like: ** Osiris, Thoth (Egypt) ** Quetzalcoatl (Mesoamerica) ** Viracocha (Andes) * a range of archaeological sites such as Tiwanaku in Bolivia. Tiwanaku was a planned city which, according to UNESCO, reached its peak between 400 AD. and 900 AD,Tiwanaku: Spiritual and Political Centre of the Tiwanaku Culture UNESCO. but is assigned an earlier date by Hancock. Tiwanaku is also featured in other works of \\"alternative archaeology\\", including Von Däniken's Chariots of the Gods? Von Däniken suggested that it provides evidence of an extraterrestrial civilisation, whereas Hancock does not argue for \\"ancient astronauts\\"; he proposes Atlantis as the origin of a lost civilisation. Hancock suggests that in 10,450 BC, a major pole shift took place. Before then, Antarctica lay farther from the South Pole than today, and after then, it shifted to its present location. The pole-shift hypothesis hinges on Charles Hapgood's theory of Earth Crustal Displacement.Hapgood, Charles Hutchins; Earth's Shifting Crust: A Key to Some Basic Problems of Earth Science (Pantheon Books, 1958; foreword by Albert Einstein) Hapgood had a fascination with the story of Atlantis and suggested that crustal displacement may have caused its destruction. His theories have few supporters in the geological community compared to the more widely accepted model of plate tectonics, but they were adopted by Rose and Rand Flem-Ath's When the Sky Fell: in Search of Atlantis (1995/2009) in which they expand the evidence for Charles Hapgood's theory of earth-crust displacement and propose Antarctica as the site of Atlantis. ==Reception== Members of the scholarly and scientific community have described the proposals put forward in the book as pseudoscience and pseudoarchaeology.Fagan, Garrett G.

In a November 2009 interview with the London magazine Time Out, Emmerich states: \\"I always wanted to do a biblical flood movie, but I never felt I had the hook. I first read about the Earth's Crust Displacement Theory in Graham Hancock's Fingerprints of the Gods.\\" In the extras of the Blu-ray 10,000 BC, the director Emmerich and his co-writer Harald Kloser said that they had found inspiration in the same book. ==Notes== ==External links== *Brass, M., 2002, Tracing Graham Hancock's Shifting Cataclysm.

He was important to the expedition because of his service as a carpenter, and he published the first journal of the expedition in 1807, seven years before the first publication based on Lewis and Clark's journals. ==Early life== Gass was born in Falling Springs (present day Chambersburg), Pennsylvania, of Scots-Irish ancestry. His parents were Benjamin and Mary McLene Gass. Benjamin Gass and his father, William, were prominent citizens and members of the local Presbyterian Church in the small frontier town.. He began his military career in 1792, with a Virginia militia or ranger company stationed in Wheeling fighting against Indians. In 1794 he helped build the house of James Buchanan, Sr. near Mercersburg Pennsylvania and became acquainted with the young future U.S. President, James Buchanan, Jr. He joined the U.S. Army in 1799, serving under General Alexander Hamilton until 1800. He rejoined the army in 1803 and served in Kaskaskia, Illinois, near St. Louis. ==Expedition and later life== His skill as a carpenter was important to the expedition-- he led the construction of the Corps' three winter quarters, hewed dugout canoes, and built wagons to portage the canoes 18 miles around the falls of the Missouri. On the return trip, Gass was given command of the majority of the party for a short period while Clark and Lewis led smaller detachments on separate explorations. He remained in the army after the expedition returned, serving in the War of 1812, in which he lost an eye, and fighting in the battle of Lundy's Lane. During the Civil War, Gass at the age of 91 years had to be removed from a recruiting station after he wanted to enlist to fight the rebels. (Wisdom of History by J. Rufus Fears). At the age of 60, he married Maria Hamilton, aged 20. She bore seven children (six of whom survived to adulthood) over the remaining 15 years of her life. They settled in Wellsburg, West Virginia, where he died, 98 years of age, the oldest surviving member of the expedition. He kept a journal that was published in 1807, the first published journal from the expedition. In it, he coined the term “Corps of Discovery”. The book was first printed and sold by subscription in Pittsburgh at $1.00 per copy. It was later reprinted in England and translated into French and German.

Body in white (BIW) is the stage in the automobile manufacturing in which a car body's frame has been joined together, that is before painting and before the motor, chassis sub-assemblies, or trim (glass, door locks/handles, seats, upholstery, electronics, etc.) have been integrated into the structure. Assembly involves different techniques such as welding (spot, MIG/MAG), riveting, clinching, bonding and laser brazing. The term derives from manufacturing practices before steel unibody monocoques -- when automobile bodies were made by outside firms on a separate chassis with an engine, suspension, and fenders attached. The manufacturers built or purchased wooden bodies (with thin, non-structural metal sheets on the outside) to bolt onto the frame. The bodies were painted white prior to the final color. A folk etymology for body in white is the appearance of a car body after it is dipped into a white bath of primer (undercoat paint)-- despite the primer's actual gray color. BIW could also refer to when car bodywork would be made of timber - all timber products, furniture etc., are considered to be \\"in the white\\" when at the stage of raw timber before finishing or varnishing. In car design, the \\"body in white\\" phase is where the final contours of the car body are worked out, in preparation for ordering of the expensive production stamping die. Extensive computer simulations of crash-worthiness, manufacturability, and automotive aerodynamics are required before a clay model from the design studio can be converted into a body in white ready for production. Factories may offer BIW cars to racers, who then may replace up to 90% of the car with aftermarket parts, and niche manufactures like Ruf Automobile start their cars with BIWs from other makers. ==Related terms== A related term in the automotive industry is \\"Body in black\\". This can refer to a car body that is formed of alternate materials such as composites rather than conventional metal; these composite materials, such as carbon fiber, are black rather than white. \\"Body in black\\" can also refer to a step in the design process in which a mock-up of a new car skin is built, in order to perform exacting measurements during the design and pre-production processes. ==References== ==External links== *Images and information on body-in-white, Cambridge University Category:Automotive engineering ","title":"Body in white"},{"id":"2584938","text":"The Karen Blixen Museum, located 10 km outside of Nairobi, Kenya, \\"at the foot of the Ngong Hills\\",Dinsen, Isak.

Although, strictly, it is nothing more than saying the surfaces have curvature and tangency alignment – to ideal aesthetical reflection quality, many people interpret class A surfaces to have G2 (or even G3) curvature continuity to one another (see free form surface modelling). Bézier surface map definition Class A surfacing is done using computer-aided industrial design applications. Class A surface modellers are also called \\"digital sculptors\\" in the industry. Industrial designers develop their design styling through the A-Surface, the physical surface the end user can feel, touch, see etc. A surface being created from curves. ==Application== A common method of working is to start with a prototype model and produce smooth mathematical Class A surfaces to describe the product's outer body. From this the production of tools and inspection of finished parts can be carried out. Class A surfacing complements the prototype modelling stage by reducing time and increasing control over design iterations. Class A surfaces can be defined as any surface, that has styling intent, that is either seen, touched, or both and mathematically meets the definition for Bézier. ===Automotive design application=== Smooth horizon reflection of Mazda RX-8 is achieved by Class-A surfaces of the fender, bonnet & windscreen as visible in this image In automotive design application Class A surfaces are created on all visible exterior surfaces (ex; body panels, bumper, grill, lights etc.) and all visible surfaces of see-touch & feel parts in interior (ex: Dashboard, seats, door pads etc.). This can also include beauty covers in the engine compartment, mud flaps, trunk panels and carpeting. ===Product design application=== Back surfaces of iPhone 3G. Apple uses Autodesk Alias for all their products In the product design realm, Class A surfacing can be applied to such things like housing for industrial appliances that are injection moulded, home appliances, highly aesthetic plastic packaging defined by highly organic surfaces, toys or furniture. Among the most famous users of Autodesk Alias software in product design is Apple. ===Aerospace design application=== Aerospace has styling and product design considerations in interiors like bezels for air vents and lights, interior roof storage racks, seats and cockpit area etc. In recent years Airbus used ICEM Surf for generating the exterior surface geometry for Aesthetics and Aerodynamic optimisation before delivering the surface to downstream CAD software like CATIA.http://www.nanco.se/news/2005/050622.shtml Airbus A380 design team used ICEM Surf for generating outer surfaces ===Clay modelling=== Class A surfacing / digital sculpting is similar to clay modelling with the added advantage of computing power to change or incorporate design changes in existing/new design. Moreover, the revisions of clay modelling and refinement iteration are carried out in digital version. The scanned data of a selected clay model will be taken as a \\"Point cloud data\\" input, and Class A designers work on this Point cloud data to generate preliminary surfaces and further refine them to Class A surfaces. ==Notable software== Class A surfacing is also called \\"digital sculpting\\" with numerous software tools now available in the automotive industry.

From 1991 to January 2017, Investors in People was owned by the UK government. As of 1 February 2017, Investors in People transitioned into the Investors in People Community Interest Company. Investors in People assessments are conducted locally through local Delivery Centres across the UK and internationally. ==History== In 1990 the Department of Employment was tasked with developing a national standard of good practice for training and development. Investors in People was born and officially launched at that year's CBI Conference in Glasgow by then Secretary of State for Employment, the Rt Hon Michael Howard QC MP. Investors in People UK was formed in 1991 to protect the integrity of the Investors in People framework. It was a non- departmental public body and received funding from the former UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). The organisation was based in London, United Kingdom and managed the development, policy, promotion and quality assurance of the Investors in People framework. From April 2010 the work of the organisation was transferred to UKCES (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) which was responsible for the strategic ownership of Investors in People until January 2017, when the organisation transitioned into a Community Interest Company on 1 February 2017. == The Sixth Generation Standard == In September 2015, Investors in People launched the sixth generation standard, evolved from the previous fifth generation to keep pace with modern practices. The current framework reflects the latest workplace trends, leading practices and employee conditions required to create outperforming teams. The latest framework focuses on three key areas: leading, supporting and improving. Within these sit nine performance indicators based on the features of organisations that consistently outperform industry norms. Organisations are assessed against these indicators using a performance model made up of four levels: Developed, Established, Advanced, High-Performing. In order to achieve the minimum level of accreditation against this framework, an organisation must meet all nine indicators at 'Developed' level. ==Accreditation== Thousands of organisations from the public and private sector have achieved accreditation. In 1999 it was estimated that one in three UK organisations was accredited, with one quarter of the UK workforce working for an Investors in People accredited company in 2002. In 2011, 2,873 UK schools held the Standard. As of 2013, there are four levels of accreditation: Accredited, Silver, Gold and Platinum. ==Research== The Standard is regularly reviewed by Investors in People (formally as part of the UK Commission for Employment and Skills) and independent research is conducted on the benefits of working with the Investors in People framework and the impact of achieving recognition. This research has indicated that Investors in People has a positive impact on performance. Investors in People also commissions regular research into employee views and attitudes. This includes their employment satisfaction survey, the annual Job Exodus Trends Report. The research looks at workers feelings towards changing job in the next 12 months and those actively looking for a new position. In 2009 Investors in People funded research together with the Health and Safety Executive and the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development concluding that companies that treated their staff well had a better chance of surviving economic downturn. Research in August 2005 found over a third of British workers believed colleagues who stuck to their contractual hours were \\"not pulling their weight\\". In 2002 Investors in People researched graduate employment trends, concluding that two thirds of graduates believe training and development is one of the most important factors when choosing an employer ==Investors in People International== Though UK-based, the Standard has been licensed to a number of other countries through Investors in People International. Investors in People International operates in more than 80 countries and delivers services in more than 30 languages. ==References== == External links == *Investors in People official website (investorsinpeople.com) * Solutions Driven obtain IIP Platinum and IIYP Gold * Royal Mail Address Management Unit obtain IiP Gold Standard Category:Organisations based in the City of Westminster ","title":"Investors in People"},{"id":"2584964","text":"A latte stone in Latte Stone Park, Hagåtña, Guam A latte stone, or simply latte (also latde or latti), is a pillar (Chamorro language: haligi) capped by a hemispherical stone capital (tasa) with the flat side facing up. Used as building supports by the ancient Chamorro people, they are found throughout most of the Mariana Islands. In modern times, the latte stone is seen as a sign of Chamorro identity and is used in many different contexts. == Construction == Reconstruction of how latte structures may have looked Latte stones have been made of limestone, basalt, or sandstone. Typical pillars range in height from 60 centimeters to three meters, and generally narrow towards the top. The pillar was normally quarried and then transported to the construction site. For small to medium-sized lattes, the capstone was a large hemispherical coral head that was gathered from a reef. The massive capstones found in Rota were instead quarried, like the pillars. In Oceania the latte stone is unique to the Marianas, though megaliths of differing construction and purpose are common to Oceanic cultures. Similarities between the latte stone and the wood posts made by the Ifugao sub-group of the Igorot in the Philippines, on which they build rice stores, have been pointed out. The rounded capstones help prevent rats from climbing up the pillar. A similar wood post construction appears to be depicted in a relief carving at Borobodur, Java, which has caused one scholar to put forward the disputed theory of a prehistorical cultural exchange between the Marianas and Java. Latte stones varied greatly in size. The smallest were several feet tall. The largest latte still standing is 16 feet (5m) tall, located on Tinian at the House of Taga. In Rota, quarried latte would have stood 25 feet (8m) high if erected. The largest shaft found here weighs 34 tons while the largest cap weighs 22 tons. == Use == The House of Taga on Tinian, 1902 The history of the pre-contact Marianas is usually divided into three periods: Pre-Latte, Transitional Pre-Latte, and Latte. Latte stones began to be used in about 800 A.D. and became increasingly more common until the arrival of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 and Spanish colonization, when they fell rapidly out of use and were entirely abandoned by about 1700. Latte stones have been found on Guam and the southern islands in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, including Rota, Tinian, Aguijan, and Saipan, as well as several small northern islands, such as Pagan. Undisturbed stones are found usually arranged in parallel pairs of between eight and fourteen lattes framing a rectangular space. The more pairs in the structure, the taller the latte stones. One twenty latte arrangement was found in the current location of the military Ordnance Annex on southern Guam. While none of the early European visitors to the islands appear to have drawn pictures of latte stones in use, several Spanish accounts from the 16th and 17th centuries state that houses were erected on the stones, with one eyewitness specifying that the structures on lattes were used to shelter proas and served as community meeting places. However, the lack of definitive, consistent evidence means that all theories are disputed. Some archaeologists believe that only high status Chamorros lived in structures built on latte stones, while others have put forward the theory that all Chamorros in the Latte Period lived in latte structures, and that the height and number of the stones in the structure indicated social status. Other structures in a latte village, which may have included cooking huts, canoe houses and public houses for unmarried men, were built on the ground, typically in an A-frame of wood poles, often bamboo, with thatched roofs of grass, coconut fronds or Nipa fronds. == Cultural context == The Flag of the Northern Mariana Islands centers on a latte Archaeologists who have worked in the Marianas since the end of World War II have noted a distinct difference between latte stones located along the coast and those located inland. Coastal latte tend to be placed in sand containing extensive relics of habitation, including shards of pottery, fish and animal bones, and stone and shell tools. Human burials were placed within sand containing these archaeological remnants, either within or near sets of lattes. In contrast, the soil in which inland latte stones are placed rarely has an archaeological stratum or associated burial. The implication is that mainland latte sites were temporarily occupied, and perhaps that there was a change in burial practice in the later Latte Period. By the 18th and 19th centuries, travelers to the Marianas noted lattes only in abandoned areas, where they had apparently been left after foreign-introduced disease had decimated the Chamorro population. In modern times, latte stones are a symbol of Chamorro identity and are found in a wide variety of government, business and personal contexts. Concrete lattes are sometimes incorporated into new buildings, while residents of the Marianas will sometimes incorporate actual latte stones into the landscaping around their homes. A latte stone features on the US quarter coins for both Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. Highway shields marking Northern Mariana Islands highways superimpose the route number on a white outline of a latte stone. == See also == * History of Guam * Moai * Monolithic architecture * Nan Madol * Staddle stones == References == == Further reading == * * * . == External links == * Category:Megalithic monuments Category:Guamanian culture Category:Outdoor sculptures Category:Rock art of Oceania ","title":"Latte stone"},{"id":"2584966","text":" HMS Achille was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy.

After hours of fierce fighting, Argonauta fell silent and closed her gunports, but before Achille could accept her surrender, her French namesake of 74 guns, moved in to engage the British ship. After exchanging broadsides, the French ship sailed on and was replaced on the starboard side by the 74-gun French ship , and for the next hour and a quarter she lay close alongside Achille, receiving a pounding that eventually forced Berwick to surrender with over 250 casualties – almost half her crew. Achille took possession, and transferred some of her crew back on board as prisoners.

The English version of the film runs for 90 minutes and is dubbed. ==Plot== In ancient Greece, a race of evil aliens from the Moon land on Earth. For years they have terrorized the nearby city of Samar. Hercules (Maciste in the original version) (Alan Steel) attempts to free the people of the kingdom of Samar from the rule of their evil queen (Jany Clair). She is under the spell of invading Moon Men who demand children for sacrifice in hopes their spilled blood can revive their own dead queen. The Queen of Samar has made a pact with the Moon men to conquer the world and become the most powerful woman alive. The downtrodden residents of Samar cheer the arrival of the mighty Hercules, who on their behalf faces deadly obstacles, battles the Moon monsters and eventually confronts the leader of the Moon men, Redolphis (Roberto Ceccacci), a metal-headed giant. The term The Moon Men and the plot element of such beings seeking to conquer the Earth appeared earlier in the novel of that name by American writer Edgar Rice Burroughs, though the details of the conquest in Burroughs' book are very different from the film. ==Cast== * Alan Steel as Hercules/Maciste * Jany Clair as Queen Samara * Anna Maria Polani as Agar * Nando Tamberlani as Gladius * Jean-Pierre Honoré as Darix * Delia D'Alberti as Billis / Selene (as Delia d'Alberti) * Goffredo Unger as Mogol * Franco Morici as Timor * Attilio Dottesio as Remar * Roberto Ceccacci as Redolphis * Stefano Carletti as Mogol * Paola Pitti as Taris (as Paola Piretti) * Giuliano Raffaelli as Tirteo - tavernkeeper * Anna Maria Dionisi as Tavernkeeper's wife * Salvatore Borghese as Aggressor of Maciste upon his arrival * Antonio Corevi as Rubio, the imperial guard officer ==Production== In the original Italian-language version, the hero was not Hercules but Maciste, originally a hero in silent Italian cinema.

By so limiting the source, SSM reduces demands on the network and improves security. SSM requires that the receiver specify the source address and explicitly excludes the use of the (*,G) join for all multicast groups in RFC 3376, which is possible only in IPv4's IGMPv3 and IPv6's MLDv2. Source-specific multicast is best understood in contrast to any-source multicast (ASM). In the ASM service model a receiver expresses interest in traffic to a multicast address. The multicast network must # discover all multicast sources sending to that address, and # route data from all sources to all interested receivers. This behavior is particularly well suited to groupware applications where # all participants in the group want to be aware of all other participants, and # the list of participants is not known in advance. The source discovery burden on the network can become significant when the number of sources is large. In the SSM service model, in addition to the receiver expressing interest in traffic to a multicast address, the receiver expresses interest in receiving traffic from only one specific source sending to that multicast address. This relieves the network of discovering many multicast sources and reduces the amount of multicast routing information that the network must maintain. SSM requires support in last-hop routers and in the receiver's operating system. SSM support is not required in other network components, including routers and even the sending host. Interest in multicast traffic from a specific source is conveyed from hosts to routers using IGMPv3 as specified in RFC 4607. SSM destination addresses must be in the ranges \`232.0.0.0/8\` for IPv4. For IPv6 current allowed SSM destination addresses are specified by \`ff3x::/96\`, where the hexadecimal digit \`x\` represents the scope. Note however that the allocation may be extended in the future so receivers and network equipment should treat any \`ff3x::/32\` address as SSM. == References == * * == External links == * JAVA Source-specific multicast support library Category:Internet broadcasting Category:Internet Protocol Category:Network protocols ","title":"Source-specific multicast"},{"id":"2585006","text":"Talisman Energy Inc. was a Canadian multinational oil and gas exploration and production company headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. It was one of Canada's largest independent oil and gas companies. Originally formed from the Canadian assets of BP Canada Ltd. it grew and operated globally, with operations in Canada (B.C., Alberta, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Quebec) and the United States of America (Pennsylvania, New York, Texas ) in North America; Colombia, South America; Algeria in North Africa; United Kingdom and Norway in Europe; Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Australia in the Far East; and Kurdistan in the Middle East. Talisman Energy has also built the offshore Beatrice Wind FarmBeatrice Wind Farm Demonstrator website in the North Sea off the coast of Scotland. The company was acquired by Repsol in 2015 and in January 2016 was renamed to Repsol Oil & Gas Canada Inc. The company initially grew quickly through a number of mergers and acquisitions, which reflects in the complex history and large diversity of holdings. In the 2015 Forbes Global 2000, Talisman Energy was ranked as the 1728th -largest public company in the world. Talisman was the first Canadian company to join the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights Plenary Group (Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights)Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights Plenary Group website and is a participant in the United Nations Global Compact. ==History== ===Background: 1925–92=== The origins of Talisman energy traces to the Supertest Petroleum Corporation, which was founded in 1923 and headquartered in London, Ontario. Supertest station in Toronto, ca. 1965 In 1953, British Petroleum Company (BP) entered the Canadian market through the purchase of a minority stake in Calgary-based Triad Oil Company. In the early 1950s, the power struggle between oil companies and host governments in Middle East started, which hampered operations of British Petroleum in the region, and prompted it to diversify its operations beyond the heavily Middle East dependent oil production. The Canadian holding company of British Petroleum was renamed BP Canada in 1969; and in 1971, it acquired 97.8% stake of Supertest. Subsequently, Supertest was renamed to BP Canada Ltd, and other Canadian interests of British Petroleum were amalgamated to the new company. BP retail operations disappeared from Canada in the early 1980s, when in 1982, BP Canada divested its downstream assets to Petro-Canada, which was at the time owned by the Government of Canada. ===1992–2011=== In 1992, British Petroleum sold off its 57% stake in BP Canada Ltd to the public. BP Canada was later renamed to Talisman Energy Inc. and one of Canada's largest independent oil and gas company was founded. After the split from British Petroleum, Talisman Energy sold off its money losing mining operations and focused on its large natural gas holdings in British Columbia, Canada. Its subsidiary Fortuna Petroleum, became one of the first international oil companies to do business with Cuba. A year later in 1993, Talisman Energy bought Encor Inc from BCE, doubling in size and becoming one of Canada's largest petroleum companies. Talisman Energy acquired Bow Valley Energy from British Gas PLC in 1994, gaining more assets in Canada and an important presence in the North Sea and Southeast Asia. In 1995, it pulled out of Cuba to focus on these areas. In 1997, Talisman Energy launched a takeover bid of Wascana Energy, a former crown corporation of the Saskatchewan government. It got into a bidding war over Wascana with Canadian Occidental Petroleum (later, Nexen), and failed in its attempt. It continued its aggressive expansion, investing in the North Sea and Indonesia; and in 1997, bought the smaller Pembina Resources. In 1999, Talisman Energy acquired Rigel Energy. Since then, Talisman has expanded its operation in Southeast Asia and in the North Sea, with a brief exploration operations in South Eastern Trinidad & Tobago. On May 30, 2007, the company announced the retirement of its longtime President & CEO, James Buckee. John Manzoni, formerly of BP, was named as his successor, effective September 1, 2007. In January 2008, Talisman agreed to buy RSX Energy Inc, an oil and gas company based in Calgary, Alberta focused on exploration and development in Western Canada. Formed in 1997 as Royal Sovereign Exploration Inc. it changed its name to RSX Energy in 2002. ===2012=== In July 2012, Talisman Energy sold part of its interests in Britain to focus on higher-growth shale gas projects in North America and Southeast Asia. A joint venture with China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation Limited (or Sinopec) was announced, that saw Talisman sell 49% of its Aberdeen, Scotland- based North Sea business to Sinopec for US$1.5 billion. On September 10, 2012, the company announced that John Manzoni had agreed to step down as president and CEO, effective immediately, and would be replaced by board member Hal Kvisle. Kvisle had been on Talisman's board of directors since 2010 and was previously CEO of Canadian pipeline builder TransCanada Corp. between 2001 and 2010. The news surprised market analysts and fueled speculation that Talisman was then a greater potential takeover target, similar to that of industry peer Nexen Inc. when it agreed to a $15.1 billion acquisition made by China National Offshore Oil Co. two months earlier. However, Kvisle stressed that he and the board would be focused on making Talisman a \\"sustainable long-term, successful Canadian company\\" rather than putting it up for sale. ===2013=== In October 2013, activist investor Carl Icahn acquired around 61 million shares in the company and announced he would be seeking a place on the board. His acquisition prompted the firm's share price to rocket by 16% before ultimately plummeting 60% over the course of 2014 before Icahn divested. ===Acquisition by Repsol 2014-2015=== Following months of speculation and negotiations, Spanish energy company Repsol tendered an offer to buy Talisman in early December 2014 for per share. Including debt obligations of billion, the deal was worth billion. On February 19, 2015, Talisman shareholders approved the acquisition offer from Repsol with 99 percent of shareholders in each class voting in favor of the deal. In January 2016, Repsol announced that the legal name of Talisman would be changed to Repsol Oil & Gas Canada Inc. effective January 1, 2016. ==Controversy in Sudan== In 1998, Talisman made one of its most controversial moves when it purchased Arakis Energy. The acquired business had involvement in the Sudanese oil industry through a 25% interest in the Greater Nile Oil project operated by the Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company (GNPOC). Further, GNPOC was a consortium which included Sinopec, the national petroleum company of China (40%); Petronas, the national oil company of Malaysia (30%); and Sudapet, the national petroleum company of Sudan (5%).Human Security in Sudan: The Report of a Canadian Assessment Mission At the time, the Second Sudanese Civil War was under way and the government of Sudan was almost totally reliant on oil revenues for its war effort. This war effort was repeatedly accused of war crimes, human rights abuses, and genocide. International observers accused the Sudanese government of forcibly displacing residents to make way for oil exploration and exploitation. As conditions in Sudan worsened, an international outcry developed led by NGOs and churches. They called for divestment in Talisman shares and pushed the Canadian government to penalize the company. As part of this protest, the Presbyterian Church of Sudan sued the company in an American court for genocide, stating that Talisman had helped Sudanese officials \\"bomb churches, kill church leaders and attack villages in an effort to clear the way for oil exploration.\\" In an unprecedented event, an American judge decided the lawsuit was valid, but it was later dismissed by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The court concluded that the plaintiffs had no admissible evidence to support the claims against Talisman Energy. The finding in the U.S. lawsuit is consistent with the report of the Harker mission in 2000, which admonished Talisman for not doing enough to stop human rights abuses by other groups, but did not find that Talisman had actively aided in any atrocities. In response to the allegations, Talisman initiated an annual third-party verified, \\"Corporate Responsibility Report\\" and implementing procedures for monitoring the company's compliance with the International Code of Ethics for Canadian Business.CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2000, SUDAN OPERATIONS , Talisman CR Reports In 2003, Talisman Energy divested the Sudan interest acquired through the Arakis acquisition, selling its complete 25% stake to Indian company ONGC Videsh. Whether this divestiture benefited the people of Sudan is highly questionable, with concern having been raised by one NGO active in the region: \\"If you pressure Talisman to leave Sudan then will the remaining actors take any action to address these critical issues? At least Talisman has taken notice and responded ...\\".

Vignola (born Rocco Giuseppe Vignola, August 5, 1882 – October 25, 1953) was an Italian-American actor, screenwriter and film director. A former stage actor, he appeared in many motion pictures produced by Kalem Company and later moved to directing, becoming one of the silent screen's most prolific directors.Michael R. Pitts, Poverty Row Studios, 1929-1940: An Illustrated History of 55 Independent Film Companies, with a Filmography for Each, McFarland, 2005, p. 236 He directed a handful of films in the early years of talkies but his career essentially ended in the silent era. == Early life == Robert G. Vignola was born in Trivigno, a village in the province of Potenza, Basilicata,Alfred Krautz, Hille Krautz, Joris Krautz, Encyclopedia of film directors in the United States of America and Europe, Volume 2, Saur, 1997, p.221 to Donato Gaetano Vignola, a stone mason, and Anna Rosa Rago. He had three brothers and one sister. Travelling with them, he left Italy in May 1886, at the age of three. He was raised in Albany, New York. Because of his Christian name of Rocco he was nicknamed \\"Rocky\\" on the family’s first census in New York. His name Rocco was later changed to Robert. Trained as a barber in the beginning, at 14 he became interested in the circus, practicing contortion and slackwire, but found his true love was acting at 17, and a year later he founded the \\"Empire Dramatic Club\\" in Albany. == Acting career == In 1901 he started acting on stage professionally and joined the \\"American Stock Company\\" in New York. He made his stage debut in \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", performing with Eleanor Robson Belmont and Kyrle Bellew.Carolin Lowrey, The First One Hundred Noted Men and Women of the Screen, Moffat, Yard, 1920, p.182 In the following years he played leads and became a character actor. Vignola's motion picture career began in 1906 with the short film The Black Hand, directed by Wallace McCutcheon and produced by Biograph Company, generally considered the film that launched the mafia genre. In 1907 he joined Kalem Studios, starring in numerous movies directed by his long-time friend Sidney Olcott often dealing with Irish culture such as The Lad from Old Ireland (1910), The Colleen Bawn (1911), and Arrah-na-Pogue (1911). Olcott would later promote him to assistant director. The Kalem Company traveled across Europe and Middle East, where Vignola did one of his most notable roles as Judas Iscariot in From the Manger to the Cross (1912), among the most acclaimed films of the silent years. According to Moving Picture World, he was the first actor who was placed upon a permanent salary by Kalem. ==Directing career== Vignola, early 1910s Vignola directed 110 pictures from 1911 to 1937. His debut as a film director was Rory O'More (1911), co-directed with Olcott. The Vampire (1913), starring Alice Hollister, was well-received by critics and is sometimes cited as the earliest surviving \\"vamp\\" movie (another title with the same name produced by William Nicholas Selig in 1910 is considered lost). He returned to the theme with The Vampire's Trail (1914), featuring Alice Joyce, Tom Moore and Hollister in a secondary role. He had a long association directing the early movies of Pauline Frederick such as Audrey (1916), Double Crossed (1917), and The Love That Lives (1917). Vignola is best known for directing Marion Davies in several romantic comedies including Enchantment (1921), Beauty's Worth (1922), and the big-budget epic When Knighthood Was in Flower (1922), which achieved critical and commercial acclaim and established Davies as a movie star.Richard Dyer MacCann, Films of the 1920s, Scarecrow Press, 1996, p.119 In 1920, he was offered the role of director-general for the Kinkikan Cinematograph Company in Japan and was honored as \\"outstanding director of the year\\" by Frederick James Smith of the Motion Picture Classic in 1921. The Woman God Changed (1921) and Adam and Eva (1923) were praised for the \\"innovative\\" use of shadows and lighting effects. With the arrival of the sound era, he directed Broken Dreams (1933), in competition for the Best Foreign Film at the 2nd Venice International Film Festival, and The Scarlet Letter (1934), the last film of Colleen Moore. His sound films were not successful and Vignola retired. His final work was The Girl from Scotland Yard (1937). == Death == Vignola died in Hollywood, California in 1953. He was buried in St. Agnes Cemetery, Menands, New York. == Personal life == He lived in a mansion at Whitley Heights owned by William Randolph Hearst. According to legend, Hearst's mistress Marion Davies was allowed to stay without him at Vignola's mansion, worried that she was having affairs and considering Vignola a trusted companion for her as he was homosexual.Richard Alleman, Hollywood: The Movie Lover's Guide, Crown/Archetype, 2013, p.49 Sidney Olcott, alone after the passing of his wife Valentine Grant, spent his later life at Vignola's home, where he died in 1949. Vignola was described by Delight Evans as \\"the sanest and least temperamental of all celluloid creators. He has infinite patience. He has one quality which makes actors want to work for him: consideration.\\" He once said: \\"Before a director can learn to control thousands of people and big stars and big scenes, he must first learn to control himself.\\" He identified himself as a Republican, although he was not much interested in politics. Vignola visited his birthplace Trivigno with his family, provided money to build the town's war monument and maintained correspondence with some of his relatives. ==Partial filmography== ===Actor=== The Stranger (1910) *The Black Hand (1906) *A Runaway Sleighbelle (1907) *The Fight for Freedom (1908) * The Kentuckian (1908) *The Navajo's Bride (1910) *A Lad from Old Ireland (1910) *The Stranger (1910) *A War Time Escape (1911) *Arrah-na-Pogue (1911) *Rory O'More (1911) *The Colleen Bawn (1911) *The O'Neill (1912) *His Mother (1912) *The O'Kalems Visit Killarney (1912) *The Vagabonds (1912) *Far From Erin's Isle (1912) *You Remember Ellen (1912) *A Prisoner of the Harem (1912) *An Arabian Tragedy (1912) *From the Manger to the Cross (1912) *Missionaries in Darkest Africa (1912) *The O'Neill (1912) *The Fighting Dervishes of the Desert (1912) *The Shaughraun (1912) *A Sawmill Hazard (1913) *A Desperate Chance (1913) *The Lady Peggy's Escape (1913) *The Octoroon (1913) *The Scimitar of the Prophet (1913) *The Wives of Jamestown (1913) ===Director=== L-R: Forrest Stanley, Marion Davies, Vignola, and Lyn Harding on the set of When Knighthood Was in Flower, 1922 *Rory O'More (1911) *The Vampire (1913) *The Vampire's Trail (1914) *The Siren's Reign (1915) *Audrey (1916) *Seventeen (1916) *The Evil Thereof (1916) *The Moment Before (1916) *The Spider (1916) *Under Cover (1916) *Great Expectations (1917) *Her Better Self (1917) *The Fortunes of Fifi (1917) *The Hungry Heart (1917) *The Love That Lives (1917) *Double Crossed (1917) *Madame Jealousy (1918) *The Claw (1918) *The Savage Woman (1918) *The Girl Who Came Back (1918) *Women's Weapons (1918) *His Official Fiancée (1919) *Experimental Marriage (1919) *More Deadly Than The Male (1919) *The Heart of Youth (1919) *The Thirteenth Commandment (1920) *The World and His Wife (1920) *Straight Is the Way (1921) *The Woman God Changed (1921) *Enchantment (1921) *Beauty's Worth (1922) *The Young Diana (1922) *When Knighthood Was in Flower (1922) *Adam and Eva (1924) *Yolanda (1924) *Married Flirts (1924) *The Way of a Girl (1925) *Déclassée (1925) * Fifth Avenue (1926) *Cabaret (1927) *Broken Dreams (1933) *The Scarlet Letter (1934) *The Perfect Clue (1935) *The Girl from Scotland Yard (1937) ==References== ==External links== * *Robert G.

Born in County Down, he began a religious reform movement on the American frontier.Reid, D.G., Linder, R.D., Shelley, B.L., & Stout, H.S. (1990). Dictionary of Christianity in America. Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press. Entry on Campbell, Thomas (1763–1854) He was joined in the work by his son, Alexander. Their movement, known as the \\"Disciples of Christ\\", merged in 1832 with the similar movement led by Barton W. Stone to form what is now described as the American Restoration Movement (also known as the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement). ==Early life== Campbell was born in County Down, Ireland (now Northern Ireland), and raised as an Anglican. He was ordained a minister in the Scottish Seceder Presbyterian Church sometime after graduating from the University of Glasgow in 1786. Campbell left Ireland for the United States in April 1807. This move was prompted by the advice of his physician. Once in America, disagreement arose between Thomas and other Presbyterians over certain points related to Calvinist doctrine and the administration of the Eucharist. ==Role in the early Restoration Movement== The Campbell wing of the movement was launched when Thomas Campbell published the Declaration and address of the Christian Association of Washington in 1809. The Presbyterian Synod had suspended his ministerial credentials. In The Declaration and Address he set forth some of his convictions about the church of Jesus Christ, as he organised the Christian Association of Washington, in Washington County, Pennsylvania, not as a church but as an association of persons seeking to grow in faith.McAlister, Lester G. & William E. Tucker (1975), Journey in Faith: A History of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), St. Louis, MO: Chalice Press; On 4 May 1811, the Christian Association reconstituted itself as a congregationally governed church. With the building it constructed at Brush Run, Pennsylvania, it became known as Brush Run Church. When their study of the New Testament led the reformers to begin to practice baptism by immersion, the nearby Redstone Baptist Association invited Brush Run Church to join with them for the purpose of fellowship. The reformers agreed, provided that they would be \\"allowed to preach and to teach whatever they learned from the Scriptures.\\"Davis, M.M. (1915). How the Disciples Began and Grew, A Short History of the Christian Church, Cincinnati, Ohio: The Standard Publishing Company. Thomas and his son Alexander worked within the Redstone Baptist Association during the period 1815 through 1824. While both the Campbells and the Baptists shared practices of baptism by immersion and congregational polity, it was soon clear that the Campbells and their associates were not traditional Baptists. Within the Redstone Association, some of the Baptist leaders considered the differences intolerable when Alexander Campbell began publishing a journal, The Christian Baptist, which promoted reform. The Campbells anticipated the conflict and moved their membership to a congregation of the Mahoning Baptist Association in 1824. ==Theological influences== Campbell was a student of the Enlightenment philosopher John Locke.C. Leonard Allen and Richard T. Hughes, Discovering Our Roots: The Ancestry of the Churches of Christ, Abilene Christian University Press, 1988; While he did not explicitly use the term \\"essentials\\", in the Declaration and Address, Campbell proposed the same solution to religious division as had been advanced earlier by Herbert and Locke: \\"[R]educe religion to a set of essentials upon which all reasonable persons might agree.\\" The essentials he identified were those practices for which the Bible provided \\"a 'Thus saith the Lord,' either in express terms or by approved precedent.\\" Unlike Locke, who saw the earlier efforts by Puritans as inherently divisive, Campbell argued for \\"a complete restoration of apostolic Christianity.\\" Thomas believed that creeds served to divide Christians. He also believed that the Bible was clear enough that anyone could understand it and, thus, creeds were unnecessary.Ron Rhodes, The Complete Guide to Christian Denominations, Harvest House Publishers, 2005; Thomas Campbell combined the Enlightenment approach to unity with the Reformed and Puritan traditions of restoration. The Enlightenment affected the Campbell movement in two ways. First, it provided the idea that Christian unity could be achieved by finding a set of essentials that all reasonable people could agree on. The second was the concept of a rational faith that was formulated and defended on the basis of a set of facts derived from the Bible. ==Life events== Brush Run, Pennsylvania, built in 1811 by the Christian Association of Washington * Born 1 February 1763 in County Down, Ireland.Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L.

The trains were assembled in Portugal by ADtranz at the former Sorefame works at Amadora, based on contracting partnership between Fiat-Ferroviaria as the main contractor and ADtranz and Siemens as the main subcontractors. Beginning 2017, the trains were refurbished, introducing new interiors, livery, seating and features such as Wi-Fi and power outlets. == Description == The Alfa Pendular high speed train is a six car electric multiple unit (EMU), which is derived from and closely resembles the Giugiaro designed Italian Fiat-Ferroviaria ETR 480 Pendolino train. The bogies had to be redesigned to operate on Portugal's track. There are 8 traction motors, installed on all but the two middle vehicles of the train, developing . This M-M-T-T-M-M arrangement spreads the weight of the train, giving it a weight of only per axle, which helps its cornering ability at high speed. During testing, a top speed of was reached close to Espinho in 1998. === Tilting technology === Its tilting train technology, with a maximum tilt angle of 8°, allows the train to negotiate curves at higher speeds than conventional trains. The combination of the resulting high cornering velocity and the tilting movement of the carriages helps ensure a comfortable ride for the passengers, although the jostle and sway compensating for track irregularities may cause \\"travel sickness\\" in those susceptible. The hydraulic tilting system is governed by two gyroscopes in the head cars. The curve is found on the base of the elevation of the external track. The use of this train did not require particular modifications to the existing rail network, but it is expensive in terms of maintenance of the rolling stock because of the complexity of the tilting system. == Stations == The stations served by the Alfa Pendular are from north to south:Comboios de Portugal > Alfa Pendular > Estações *Braga *Guimarães *Famalicão *Trofa *Porto-Campanhã *Vila Nova de Gaia *Espinho *Aveiro *Coimbra-B *Pombal *Entroncamento *Santarém *Lisboa-Oriente *Lisboa-Santa Apolónia (off the lines from/to Faro) *Lisboa-Entrecampos *Pinhal Novo *Tunes *Albufeira *Loulé *Faro Old first class carriage on the Oporto - Lisbon service. == See also == * List of high speed trains == References == == External links == * CP 4000 @ Trainspo Category:Pendolino Category:Tilting trains Category:High-speed rail in Portugal Category:Electric multiple units of Portugal Category:Fiat Ferroviaria ","title":"Alfa Pendular"},{"id":"2585074","text":"Porto Koufo Porto Koufo () is the largest natural harbour in Greece (in depth).

A gravel road connecting Lake Cushman to the state highway system has existed since the late 1950s and was codified into the current state highway system in 1991, prior to being completely paved by 1999. ==Route description== SR 119 begins at an intersection with US 101 in the unincorporated community of Hoodsport, located on the Hood Canal in Mason County. The highway travels west along Finch Creek as Lake Cushman Road into the Olympic Mountains and passes through Hoodsport Community Trail Park, a former state park. SR 119 continues north along the coast of Lake Cushman and Big Creek into Olympic National Forest, where it begins a concurrency with FFH-24 on Staircase Road heading northwest. The concurrent highways travel west along Lake Cushman as SR 119 ends at the entrance to Olympic National Park and the end of pavement. Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year.

Between Lake St. Catherine and Lake Borgne was the original Town of Lake Catherine. Established between Unknown Pass and Miller's Ditch, it was settled for railroad workers, trappers, hunters and fishermen. ==New Orleans Hurricane of 1915== The 1915 Hurricane destroyed the town and thirty-five people lost their lives by remaining in the town. It was rebuilt with a number of hunting and fishing clubs being established along with the railroad workers and the Rigolets Train Station. During the Great Depression, clubs like the Winchester Club, which was for gentlemen only, The Rosemary and St. James Place were boarding houses for families and sportsmen to stay and hunt and fish the area. There were a number of families who owned camps in the area prior to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Some of their family members worked for the railroad and helped maintain the line. The town was built next to the railroad track; the last known resident of the town was Mr. Acy. The entire area was heavily damaged during Katrina. ==New Orleans East Land Bridge== To the north, between Lake St. Catherine and Lake Pontchartrain is a nine-mile (14 km) long populated island known as the New Orleans East Land Bridge which had been well-populated since the 1920s, with several marinas, taverns, and restaurants, boat yards and docking facilities. Pre-Katrina the area total population was 754, not counting the weekend camp owners. On a Labor Day weekend the total population of the area would reach two to three thousand with friends and family all joining together for the last big weekend before winter. The New Orleans East Land Bridge is made up of five distinct residential areas: the Rigolets, Chef Pass, Greens Ditch, Lake St. Catherine, and Fort Pike Subdivision; all of which border Highway 90 in New Orleans East. ==Geography== Lake St. Catherine is a shallow lake. Inlets that feed into it include Fort Pike Canal; Sawmill Pass; Marques Canal; Unknown Pass; Miller's Pass; St. Catherine Pass; and Counterfeit Pass. The lake has excellent fresh water and salt water fishing and is also abundant in crabs, clams, and shrimp. Ponds off the main lake are ideal during hunting season for ducks and geese. ==Hurricane Katrina== St. Nicholas of Myra Church in February 2006 Two lives were lost during Hurricane Katrina in 2005; the death toll would likely have been more severe if most people had not evacuated. Father Arthur Ginart, better known as \\"Father Red\\" to his parishioners, lost his life by choosing to remain in his church, St. Nicholas of Myra, located near Chef Menteur Pass, during the storm. It is assumed that he drowned inside the church and was washed out to sea by the retreating storm surge, which gutted the building. The church was closed, but then reopened in 2014. The second to lose his life was Wayne Aaslestad, who chose to stay with his home and was later found inside his car in Lake Pontchartrain. It is assumed he tried to evacuate too late. ==See also== *Fort Pike Bridge ==References== Saint Catherine Category:Bodies of water of Orleans Parish, Louisiana ","title":"Lake St. Catherine (Louisiana)"},{"id":"2585098","text":"Arctous alpina, with the common names alpine bearberry, mountain bearberry, or black bearberry is a dwarf shrub in the heather family Ericaceae.

It appears to be the first such system ever developed, predating the more famous SABRE system in the US by about two years. Although Ferranti had high hopes that the system would be used by other airlines, no further sales were forthcoming and development of the system ended. Major portions of the transistor-based circuit design were put to good use in the Ferranti-Packard 6000 computer, which would later go on to see major sales in Europe as the ICT 1904. ==Background== In the early 1950s the airline industry was undergoing explosive growth. A serious limiting factor was the time taken to make a single booking, which could take upwards of 90 minutes in total. TCA found their bookings typically involved between three and seven calls to the centralized booking centre in Toronto, where telephone operators would scan flight status displayed on a huge board showing all scheduled flights one month into the future. Bookings past that time could not be made, nor could an agent reliably know anything other than if the flight was full or not - to book two seats was much more complex, requiring the operator to find the \\"flight card\\" for that flight in a filing cabinet. In 1946 American Airlines decided to tackle this problem through automation, introducing the Reservisor, a simple electromechanical computer based on telephone switching systems. Newer versions of the Reservisor included magnetic drum systems for storing flight information further into the future. The ultimate version of the system, the Magnetronic Reservisor, was installed in 1956 and could store data for 2,000 flights a day up to one month into the future. Reservisors were later sold to a number of airlines, as well as Sheraton for hotel bookings, and Goodyear for inventory control. ==TCA experiments== TCA was aware of the Reservisor, but was unimpressed by its limited capabilities in terms of information it could store, and even more by the failure rate which was essentially \\"constant\\". Nor did the Reservisor really change the way the reservations system worked; ticket agents still had to call central booking and talk (typically through an intermediary) to a Reservisor operator to answer queries. TCA asked one of their communications engineers, Lyman Richardson, to study the booking problem, and he quickly came to the opinion that a computerized solution was the only one worth studying. TCA then entered into an agreement to build a prototype system on the University of Toronto's FERUT computer, a surplus Manchester Mark 1 computer they had received in 1952 when the UK's nuclear weapons laboratories had to abandon it after budget cuts. The FERUT-based system was demonstrated in 1953 and was a qualified success; while the programmed logic and data storage/retrieval worked well, input/output was a serious bottleneck that seemed to make the system no better than the mechanical Reservisor. Furthermore the Ferut was vacuum tube based, and thus no more reliable than the Reservisor, TCA's major concern prior to the experiment. Richardson was convinced that the basic concept was sound, and formed a team of himself and several engineers from the university's Computation Center, operating under the aegis of Adalia Ltd., a consulting firm set up by Robert Watson-Watt of radar fame when he moved to Montreal at the end of World War II. They became involved with the newly-forming electronics group at Ferranti Canada, who felt they had a solution to the input/output and reliability problems. Ferranti proposed a \\"transactor\\" (terminal) that used a custom punched card system. Booking agents at the ticketing offices marked the cards with a pencil to select various checkboxes, then inserted it into the transactor which read the marks and punched those codes onto the edge of the card. Cards would then be collected from any number of operators and fed into a normal card reader, which would read them over telephone lines at \\"high speed\\" directly into the central booking computer. The computer itself would be built using transistor-based logic, thereby eliminating downtime due to tube burnout. Such a system had first been proposed in order to improve the reliability of the DATAR system Ferranti had built for the Canadian Navy, and they were convinced of its practicality. TCA was interested and provided $75,000 for the construction of six prototype transactors. In 1957 these were attached to FERUT over telephone lines and the experimental booking program run again. The demonstration was a complete success; users could quickly feed in requests and Ferut was able to book, change, query and cancel flights at speeds that made the Reservisor look terribly slow. ==Deployment== There was some further development and planning, but in 1959 TCA placed a $2 million ($12 million in year-2000 dollars) contract for a deployment system consisting of 350 transactors and all the communications equipment to support them in the field. Ferranti also won the contract for the computer system itself, although IBM had also been considered. The new machine was based on a 25-bit word, using one bit for parity checking and 24 bits for data, and was equipped with 4,096 words of core memory, later expanded to 8,192 words. Storage consisted of five magnetic drums (one was a spare) with 32,768 25-bit words each, and six tape units. Simple load balancing software routed requests across two CPUs, known as Castor and Pollux, the computer as a whole thus becoming Gemini. An internal TCA contest in late 1960 to name the system as a whole resulted in ReserVec for Reservations Electronically Controlled. Installation of the transactors started in April 1961, followed by the computer in the Toronto booking office in August. The system was brought up for testing on October 18th, 1961, connecting additional ticketing offices as the transactors were installed over the next year. By August 1962 the system was complete, and the switch-over from the manual systems to ReserVec was completed on January 24, 1963. Use of ReserVec reduced the head count at the booking office from 230 to 90, and allowed for the sale of thousands of telephone lines formerly needed to reach the human operators. Total turnaround from request to response could be as short as a second, although under load it might drop to two seconds at the worst. The system as a whole could process 10 transactions a second. It is interesting to compare the system with SABRE, being deployed at about the same time by American Airlines. SABRE was first started as an experimental effort in 1953, and a formal development contract signed in 1957. The system was first turned on in 1960, and took over booking functions in December 1964. So while the two projects started at the same time, ReserVec was completed almost two years earlier. While the ReserVec cost $4 million, SABRE was ten times that. Equally interesting is that while the SABRE CPU was about ten times faster, ReserVec handled 80-100,000 transactions a day with a maximum two second delay, while SABRE handled only 26,000 with delays of up to three seconds. Unlike SABRE, however, ReserVec did not store passenger information, which had to be processed manually. In order to address this need, TCA added a second system known as Pioneer, which could link ReserVec's three letter passenger codes with the full passenger records held on a Burroughs D-82 computer (originally designed for US military use). Pioneers were installed only in the Toronto and Montreal offices, smaller offices continued using paper records for user info. ReserVec ran all of TCA's reservations for nine years, with an average downtime of only 120 seconds a year. Originally designed for only 60,000 transactions a day, it was already processing 80 to 100,000 when it was first turned on, and over 600,000 by 1970. Retroactively named ReserVec I, the system was finally replaced at the end of 1970 by a new Univac-based system known as ReserVec II, which featured small computer terminals replacing the punched card systems. ==Disappointing sales== Ferranti, now as Ferranti-Packard, tried to sell the machine as-is to other airlines. The US market seemed to be entirely wrapped up by IBM and Univac, but there was no comparable system in Europe, where a number of airlines were looking at the US developments with interest. Gemini could be sold directly into Europe by Ferranti's existing UK-based sales force. Instead, the UK headquarters decided to build their own solution from scratch. In the end, the UK system would never be delivered; it was still being developed when Ferranti decided to sell off their entire computer division after years of losses. Nevertheless, the work did not go to waste. The engineering team convinced Canadian management to support the development of a business computer aimed at the low-end of the mainframe market. They expanded the ReserVec system with additional hardware to directly support multitasking and various changes to make the system highly modular, making it more attractive to a wider variety of users. Sales of the new Ferranti-Packard 6000 were just starting when the UK headquarters used the design to sweeten the deal when selling off their UK computer divisions, handing the design to the ICT who took over production. This was much to the chagrin of the Canadian staff, most of whom quit. The FP-6000 became the ICT 1904, one of a line of similar machines which sold over 3,000 during the 1960s and 70s. ==References== *John Vardalas, \\"From DATAR to the FP-6000\\", IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, Vol 16 No 2, 1994, pp. 20-30 *Alan Dornian, \\"ReserVec: Trans-Canada Airlines' Computerized Reservation System\\", IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, Vol 16 No 2, 1994, pp. 31-42 Category:Ferranti computers Category:One-of-a-kind computers Category:Transistorized computers Category:Business software Category:Travel technology Category:Air Canada ","title":"ReserVec"},{"id":"2585142","text":"right View Ridge is a neighborhood in north Seattle, Washington. As with all Seattle neighborhoods, its boundaries are not fixed, but can be thought of as NE 65th Street in the south, 40th and 45th Avenues NE in the west, the Sand Point Country Club in the north, and Sand Point Way NE in the east. Many homes offer views of Lake Washington, Mount Rainier, and the Cascade Range. View Ridge Elementary School is located within the neighborhood, and the neighborhood also offers a large park and playfield (View Ridge Park) across the street from the elementary school. The View Ridge Swim and Tennis Club is located on the eastern edge of View Ridge, and the Sand Point Country Club is located on the northern edge. View Ridge is home to a considerable Jewish community, with a Hasidic synagogue, Congregation Shaarei Tefillah Lubavitch, located at the corner of NE 65th St. and 43rd Ave. NE. There are several churches, too: Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Catholic. In addition to the public elementary and middle school, there are many private schools nearby. ==Geography== The view of Mount Rainier and Lake Washington from NE 68th St and 52nd Ave NE View Ridge is roughly bounded by NE 65th Street in the south, beyond which is Hawthorne Hills; 40th and 45th Avenues NE in the west, beyond which is Wedgwood; the Sand Point Country Club in the north, beyond which is Matthews Beach; and Sand Point Way NE in the east, beyond which is Sand Point. View Ridge is located on a hill overlooking Magnuson Park, which was formerly the Naval Air Station Seattle. The neighborhood encompasses an area of approximately . The neighborhood is a high point between the adjacent neighborhoods of Wedgwood and Hawthorne Hills. ==History== View Ridge was first settled in 1936 by Ralph Jones and Al Balch; it is one of the newest neighborhoods in Seattle. Upon buying of forest land in what is now the neighborhood, Jones and Balch cleared trees to create views of Lake Washington and the Cascades. They then sold lots on their land for $450 to $950 and created publicity for their property sales. Their initial success in selling land in View Ridge enabled them to expand their efforts, and they bought more land to reach the current boundaries of View Ridge. The neighborhood was annexed into Seattle in 1942. View Ridge Elementary School was founded with portable classrooms in 1944 and was built in 1948. In the late 1980s, View Ridge became the site of a series of arsons. The first fires occurred in March 1987, when four houses were set on fire in one night, resulting in the death of an elderly couple. In 1989, several more cases of arson were committed in the neighborhood; the arsonists responsible ultimately set forty fires. ==References== Category:Jews and Judaism in Seattle ","title":"View Ridge, Seattle"},{"id":"2585143","text":"Negübei was a khan of the Chagatai Khanate (1271-1272?).

The above internet link gives more information and a photo of the relief. It is a town where Levites lived. It is mentioned twice in the cuneiform Amarna letters from Tell el-Amarna in 1350 BC. The relief depicts the Assyrians removing the people from Ashteroth in 730-727 BC. The relief was excavated at Nimrud by Sir Austen Henry Layard in 1851. The name Ashteroth is inscribed in cuneiform script on the top of the relief. The king in the lower register is Tiglath-pileser III. This is the first exile of the people out of Israel into Assyria. This event is mentioned in the Bible in 2 Kings 15:29. (“In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.”) The Assyrians came back in 722/721 BC and removed the 10 tribes of Israel out of Israel and brought them to Assyria. This relief is hugely important because it shows the beginning of the exile of the 10 tribes of Israel.They never returned. You can see a mound below the town in the relief. That means there was a tell below the town. A tell is where the town is built on top of the previous demolished buildings and pottery etc. The floppy turbans and pointed shoes and the style of the cloaks are typical for Israel at that period. You can see that the same clothes are shown on the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/W_1848-1104-1 which is very close to it in the Assyrian section of the British Museum in London. The Black Obelisk is dated to about 825 BC. It was also excavated at Nimrud by Sir Austen Henry Layard in 1848. It shows king Jehu of Israel (or his representative) offering tribute to Shalmaneser III on the second register down. The clothes are the same as on the Ashteroth relief. ==Etymology== The name translates literally to \\"Astarte of the Horns\\"; Astarte was a fertility goddess in ancient Canaanite religion, and \\"horns\\" were symbolic of mountain peaks. ==Identification== The identification of the two sites is not straightforward, but there is some degree of consensus.Wolf, Umhau C.

Other differences are placing the diacritic for labialization (/w/) before rather than after the letter—ᑖᐺ /tāpwē/ (Western Cree ᑖᐻ),—and several additional series for consonants not found in Western Cree. { class= + Eastern Cree syllabic character table ! rowspan=2Initial ! colspan=\\"7\\"  Vowels ! rowspan=2Final - ! width=\\"40\\"  ê ! width=\\"40\\"  i ! width=\\"40\\"  o ! width=\\"40\\"  a ! width=\\"40\\"  ii ! width=\\"40\\"  oo ! width=\\"40\\"  aa - !  ᐁ  ᐃ  ᐅ  ᐊ  ᐄ  ᐆ  ᐋ  - ! p  ᐯ  ᐱ  ᐳ  ᐸ  ᐲ  ᐴ  ᐹ  ᑉ - ! t  ᑌ  ᑎ  ᑐ  ᑕ  ᑏ  ᑑ  ᑖ  ᑦ - ! k  ᑫ  ᑭ  ᑯ  ᑲ  ᑮ  ᑰ  ᑳ  ᒃ - ! c  ᒉ  ᒋ  ᒍ  ᒐ  ᒌ  ᒎ  ᒑ  ᒡ - ! m  ᒣ  ᒥ  ᒧ  ᒪ  ᒦ  ᒨ  ᒫ  ᒻ - ! n  ᓀ  ᓂ  ᓄ  ᓇ  ᓃ  ᓅ  ᓈ  ᓐ - ! s  ᓭ  ᓯ  ᓱ  ᓴ  ᓰ  ᓲ  ᓵ  ᔅ - ! sh  ᔐ  ᔑ  ᔓ  ᔕ  ᔒ  ᔔ  ᔖ  ᔥ - ! y  ᔦ  ᔨ  ᔪ  ᔭ  ᔩ  ᔫ  ᔮ  ᔾ (ᐤ) - ! r  ᕃ  ᕆ  ᕈ  ᕋ  ᕇ  ᕉ  ᕌ  ᕐ - ! l  ᓓ  ᓕ  ᓗ  ᓚ  ᓖ  ᓘ  ᓛ  ᓪ - ! v*, f*  ᕓ  ᕕ  ᕗ  ᕙ  ᕖ  ᕘ  ᕚ  ᕝ - ! th*  ᕞ  ᕠ  ᕤ  ᕦ  ᕢ  ᕥ  ᕧ  ᕪ - ! w  ᐌ  ᐎ  ᐒ  ᐗ  ᐐ  ᐔ  ᐙ  ᐤ - ! h  ᐦᐁ  ᐦᐃ  ᐦᐅ  ᐦᐊ  ᐦᐄ  ᐦᐆ  ᐦᐋ  ᐦ } * The glyphs for v ([v]) \\\\ f ([f]) and th ([ð] and [θ]) are rare and used only in words borrowed from other languages.

Other finals: * There is in Moose Cree an /sk/ final which merges into one character ᔅ /s/ and ᒃ /k/. ᐊᒥᔉ /amisk/ beaver * The Moose Cree final /y/ is a ring written above the previous syllabic instead of the raised /ya/: ᐋᣁ /āšay/ now. * East Cree has special finals for ᒄ /kw/ and ᒽ /mw/ which are raised versions of the o-syllabics. ᒥᔅᑎᒄ /mistikw/ tree. * Naskapi does not mark vowel length at all and uses two dots, either placed above or before a syllable, for a w: ᐛ wa, ᐖ wo, ᑥ twa, ᒂ kwa, ᒠ cwa (), ᒺ mwa, ᓏ nwa, ᔄ swa, ᔽ ywa. Since Naskapi s- consonant clusters are all labialized, sCw-, these also have the two dots: ᔌ spwa, etc. There is also a labialized final sequence, ᔊ -skw, which is a raised sa-ko. == External links == *Cree syllabics at languagegeek.com Downloadable Unicode syllabics fonts and keyboard layouts for all dialects of Cree *eastcree.org Cree fonts page Fonts and keyboard layouts for East Cree *Talking syllabic chart A mapping between roman and syllabic orthographies for East Cree (audio) Category:Cree language Category:Canadian Aboriginal syllabics ","title":"Eastern Cree syllabics"},{"id":"2585161","text":"Edward & Mrs. Simpson is a seven-part British television series that dramatises the events leading to the 1936 abdication of King Edward VIII, who gave up his throne to marry the twice-divorced American Wallis Simpson. The series, made by Thames Television for ITV, was originally broadcast in 1978. Edward Fox played Edward, and Cynthia Harris portrayed Mrs. Simpson. The series was scripted by Simon Raven, based on Fox's maternal aunt Frances Donaldson's biography of the King, Edward VIII. It was produced by Andrew Brown, overseen by Head of Drama Thames Television Verity Lambert and directed by Waris Hussein. The incidental music was by Ron Grainer. The series, broadcast in the USA in 1979 as installments of the nationally syndicated Mobil Showcase Network, won the 1980 Emmy award for Outstanding Limited Series, and BAFTA Awards in 1979 for Best Actor, Best Design, Best Costume Design, and Best Series or Serial. It has been released on DVD in Region 2 (UK) by Network, and in Region 1 (United States) by A&E.; == Episodes == # The Little Prince: Edward's life in the 1920s as Prince of Wales, his romances with Freda Dudley Ward and Lady Furness, his introduction to Mr. and Mrs. Ernest Simpson. There is a slight historical query as the first official meeting of Edward and Mrs Simpson took place at Burroughs Court near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, on Saturday 10 January 1931. The episode suggests a short meeting took place at the London residence of Lady Furness in the Autumn of 1930 (which is not documented and therefore cannot be proved). # Venus at the Prow: The romance between Edward and Mrs. Simpson develops. # The New King: Edward succeeds to the throne upon the death of his father, King George V, in January, 1936, and asks Mrs. Simpson to marry him. Mr. Simpson agrees to a divorce. The King, Mrs. Simpson, and friends cruise the Mediterranean, an event widely reported by the press outside England. # The Divorce: Edward convinces Mrs. Simpson to go forward with her divorce; she would then be free to marry him and be crowned Queen at the coronation scheduled for May, 1937. The King and the government pressure the British press to maintain silence about the King's romance, but news dribbles into Britain and gossip abounds. The New York Journal breaks the story \\"King will wed Wally\\". # The Decision: Edward is warned that British press silence about his 'friendship' with Mrs. Simpson is about to be broken. The King tells the royal family and the Prime Minister that he intends to marry Wallis Simpson, and will abdicate if he cannot do so as King. # Proposals: Attempts are made to resolve the problem without Edward's abdicating, including a proposal put forth by the King for a morganatic marriage with Wallis Simpson. The British and Commonwealth governments oppose the marriage in any form. # The Abdication: The final days of Edward as King. The signing of the Abdication on 10 December 1936 at Fort Belvedere. The radio broadcast to the nation on 11 December 1936 from the Augusta Tower, Windsor Castle. Edward's exile sailing on from Portsmouth. The marriage of Edward and Mrs Simpson on 3 June 1937. == Music == In 1978, RK Records released an official soundtrack album (UK cat No: RKLP 5003). It had 12 tracks, some composed or arranged by Ron Grainer and all played by his orchestra.Edward & Mrs Simpson, Soundtrack, RK Records, 1978 The track listing is as follows: ;Side one # \\"I've Danced with a Man\\" (Herbert Farjeon) # \\"The Very Thought of You\\" (Ray Noble) # \\"A Room with a View\\" (Noël Coward) # \\"If I Had You\\" (Al Bowlly) # \\"Of Cabbages and Kings\\" # \\"Bring Down the Curtain\\" ;Side two # \\"One More Dance\\" # \\"Dance Little Lady\\" (Coward) # \\"Tango\\" # \\"When Love Grows Cold\\" # \\"Rumours in the Wind\\" # \\"I've Danced with a Man\\" (End Titles/Reprise) (Farjeon) The theme music used for the opening and closing titles was a composite of Herbert Farjeon's 1927 song \\"I've danced with a man, who's danced with a girl, who's danced with the Prince of Wales\\" and the opening of the British national anthem \\"God Save the King.\\" The vocalist for \\"I've Danced with a Man\\", \\"Bring Down the Curtain\\" and \\"One More Dance\\" is Jenny Wren.

She made her debut in the early 1990s as part of the group Speed, which disbanded in March 2000. Eriko began her work away from Speed during 1998, performing \\"Tsumetaku Shinai de\\", under the stage name \\"Eriko with Crunch\\", on the Speed single \\"All My True Love\\". After the group disbanded, Imai continued her career as a solo artist until Speed's reformation in 2008. ==Biography== === Early career (1996–2000) === Imai was born in Okinawa. She was the second-youngest member and one of the main vocalists in the female J-pop group Speed. After Speed's popularity spread widely in Japan, they were asked to act in the movie Andromedia in 1998, Eriko's first acting experience. Eriko also appeared in the drama \\"LxIxVxE\\" in 1999 with fellow Speed member Hitoe. When Eriko began her solo career in early 2000, she teamed up with the dance group Crunch and the unit was named \\"Eriko with Crunch\\". Their first two maxi singles, \\"Red Beat of My Life\\" and \\"Luv is Magic\\" were released the same year. === Post-Speed (2000–2004) === \\"Eriko with Crunch\\" was short-lived, and Imai began her solo career with the single \\"In the Name of Love\\", released in 2000. Also during this year, Eriko participated in her first musical, Ninagawa Hi no Tori, for which she earned a \\"Best Newcomer in Theatre\\" award at the Golden Arrow Awards 2001. Her second solo single, \\"Identity\\", was viewed as a changing point in Eriko's career. Many viewed the music as hard-core rock. The music video for her third single, \\"Set Me Free\\", was shot in Australia, and Imai performed the song in Kuala Lumpur during the 2001 Asia Music Festival. In 2001, Imai released her first album, My Place. Including her self-composed songs \\"Himawari\\" and \\"Dawn\\", it sold 93,700 copies and peaked at No. 7 on the weekly Oricon chart. During this year, Eriko performed in her second drama, ', and appeared in the movie Onmyoji. Eriko's fourth solo single, \\"Don't Stop the Music\\", was aired on Eriko's weekly Monday night radio talk show \\"Eriko Imai Hot Link\\" more than a month prior to its release in January 2002. The single was seen as a change of genre in Eriko's music. At around this time, Eriko considered changing her hairstyle to an Afro. She said that she wanted something new, but was willing to return to a more Japanese-typical hairstyle if the Afro hairstyle reduced her appeal. In July, Eriko released her fifth solo single, \\"Our Relation\\", an upbeat, high-tempo ballad. \\"Our Relation\\" was the second single to be fully produced by Hiroaki Hayama, also used as the second opening theme to Captain Tsubasa: ROAD to 2002. Also in 2002, Eriko appeared in her second musical, Footloose, with V6 member Masayuki Sakamoto, which was extremely well received. From the end of 2002 to mid-2003, Eriko put a temporary hold on solo releases, mainly due to the temporary reformation of Speed for charity Save The Children. Speed became the ambassadors of Save The Children until the end of 2003, during which time they performed on nationwide tours and released singles and an album to raise funds for the charity. It was not until July of that year that Eriko released her sixth and last single, \\"Butterfly\\". \\"Butterfly\\" was a ballad written by Eriko under the name \\"Elly\\". This was the first time Imai officially used the name \\"Elly\\" on one of her works. The song was also the theme song for the anime movie Boku no Songokū, Eriko's first role as a voice actor. That October, Onmyoji 2 was released in Japan, with Eriko reprising her role as the magic spirit Mitsumushi. Between February and March 2004, Eriko performed in the musical Star Tanjō with Hitomi Shimatani and Yukie Nakama. During May 2004, Eriko posted a short message on her official website to officially announce on her marriage to 175R vocalist Shogo. The message talked briefly about the marriage, and she apologised due to its sudden nature. She also mentioned a new life which would be with us on Earth in the upcoming October. Lastly in the message, Eriko asked for guidance on her change from single to a wife and a soon-to-be mother. On 9 June 2004, she and Shogo were married in a shotgun wedding. She also registered her name as Eriko Kinoshita upon the change. Their son, Raimu Kinoshita, was born on 18 October 2004 weighing 3492g. On 25 November 2004, Eriko released her first singles collection, Stairway, to mark her new life journey as a mother and wife. === As Elly (2005–2008) === On 9 June 2005, Eriko announced on her new website that she would return to the music industry as \\"Elly\\". With the new name, Imai branched out into a new genre of music. Upon returning to the music scene Eriko began writing all of her songs, which differed greatly from her former style. On 22 September 2005, Eriko performed her 'Elly Live 2005: Rebirth' concert to mark her 22nd birthday and shift to the new name. This was Imai's first public performance since her marriage and maternity leave. She also released her first indies single under as Elly, sold only at her concert venues. On 18 October 2005, the first birthday of her son, Imai released her first photobook, \\"Egao de Ikō\\", which includes autobiographical thoughts about the periods of her life and career. She also held an autograph session at Shibuya HMV on 6 November. Elly released her second indies single, \\"Journey\\" on 13 May 2006, following up the release with a concert \\"Elly Live 2006: Journey\\" on the same day. In June 2006 Elly held a secret marriage party in Guam. Only her close friends, such as Hiro and Team-F, were invited. On 16 July, she attended Vision Festival Vol.2, where she performed her new song with Vanilla Mood. At the festival, Imai also announced to her fans that her new album Neverland was to be released on 27 September 2006. Given the lack of promotion and Imai's declining popularity, Neverland debuted at No. 149 on the Oricon charts, ultimately being placed at No. 165 on the weekly charts. She performed her \\"Elly Live 2006: Neverland\\" concert tour from October to November, of which one of the performances was attended by fellow Speed members and long-time producer Hiromasa Ijichi. During that particular live, Imai sang Speed singles \\"Walking in the Rain\\" and \\"White Love\\" with Ijichi. In July 2007, it was reported by various sources that Eriko had separated from her husband, Shogo. Reports from TokyoGraph and J!-Ent news sources indicated the separation was due to Eriko's focus on her career and social calendar, with Shogo wanting to raise Raimu. However, this matter was not clarified by either party's management. After these media reports, Eriko posted a short and cryptic message on her official site, reading: \\"only believe what was seen and heard from oneself\\". Many fans took it as an indirect reply to the separation reports and that Eriko was trying to indicate the reports were untrue. Also in August 2007, Imai announced she would be releasing her new single at a later date. The single, however, was never released, instead ending up on Imai's album Utagoe. On 24 September 2007, Eriko and Shogo officially announced their divorce on Imai's website. According to the message, the divorce was mainly due to their divergent views and concepts about the future, and therefore leading to the inability to live together like before. Eriko was given custody of their son, but both agreed to take care of the child together. Imai performed at her mini live concert \\"Elly Live: Instinct\\" on 25 December 2007. Imai held her next live concert in 2008, \\"Elly Secret Live in Sabaku no Bara\\" on 9 February 2008. This secret performance was limited to an audience of only 100 people. In August 2008, Imai decided to regroup with Speed for NTV's 24-hour telethon. During this time she announced that her son has a hearing disability, and wanted to take the opportunity to perform for her son for the first time, and to give hope to others who are also suffering from the same disability. She resumed activities with Speed again starting on 31 August 2008. Eriko also made her first film appearance in almost five years, in \\"Yuzuriha: Kimi mo Mata Tsugi no Kimi e\\", directed by Kentarō Hayase. The picture is a 60th-anniversary project of the Japanese Federation of the Deaf. Eriko also started a web programme called Elly ch: '...& Smile' on 18 October, in which she invites her friends as guests or shows footage of her concerts. === Return to Eriko Imai (2009–present) === Eriko released her second photobook, Kokoro no Uta: Musuko to Ayunda 4 Nenkan, Soshite Korekara, on 14 February 2009. Her new album, Utagoe, was released on 29 April. Her ex- husband, Shogo, composed the songs \\"Kanna\\" and \\"Hana Uta\\" for the album. Utagoe debuted at #31, selling 3,882 copies in its first week. On 10 May, which was Mother's Day, Eriko received a 'Best Mother' award for the second annual 'Best Mother Awards in 2009' in Japan. In 2010, Eriko was a host in the sign language education programme NHK Minna No Showa. (Eriko has a son who is Deaf.) Eriko also made a live announcement via USTREAM on 22 September, 10.10 p.m. to announce her upcoming solo live: 'Imai Eriko live 2010 ~Your selection~' which is currently planned for November. In this concert, Eriko will perform the top 10 favourite songs from her solo careers as Eriko with Crunch, Imai Eriko and elly. Fans will get to choose the top 10 songs via a poll on her website. Follow-up announcements will be made live on USTREAM on 1 and 10 October at 10.10p.m. respectively. She also revealed a new song, temporarily titled \\"Cowgirl\\", on her last Ustream announcement. The official title will be decided once fans gave their ideas through the inquiry forms given out during her lives in November. The song was officially called \\"Cow☆G\\" during her last appearance on Ustream. In 2011, a documentary was broadcast on NHK on 3 May 2011 documenting her life with her son over the past six years. It was broadcast as an Ear Day Special program. The show was entitled Nankurunaisaa ~Imai Eriko ga Musuko to Arunda 6 Nen. Eriko also released a new song, \\"Nankurunaisaa\\", as a digital and iTunes download on 6 April 2011. Eriko released her third book, entitled Oyako Gejiko, on 8 April 2011. Eriko continued to be a host for NHK's Minna no Shuwa on 3 April 2011. === Personal life === After Imai's shotgun wedding in 2004 due to her pregnancy, tabloid magazine Shukan Bunshun quoted a source known to Eriko that her management agency had stopped paying her monthly wage of 200,000 yen and promptly expelled her from the company apartment.Shukan Bunshun, Eriko Imai: From the Truth behind Speed's Break-up to Livelihood Difficulties upon Divorce\\", 15 November 2007, pp.162–3. After struggling for several months, her company relented its punishment by signing a new contract worth 20,000 yen a month. Eriko's nickname is Mikan Seijin (Tangerine Alien). She is an accomplished guitar and flute player. She also plays the piano, as well as composing and writing songs. She is good friends with Hikaru Utada and called her father on air on behalf of her fans when she underwent ovarian cancer surgery. Eriko was once voted as the most popular artist from Japan in Hong Kong, surpassing other popular singers. Eriko began to learn sign language with her son during early 2008. She is also avid in saving the environment by doing bottle-cap collections. In 2016, Imai became a candidate for the Japanese House of Councillors election under the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and won. == Discography == === Albums === Eriko Imai * My Place (18 July 2001) * Single Collection: Stairway (25 November 2004) * (29 April 2009) Elly * Neverland (27 September 2006) === Singles === Eriko with Crunch * Speed – All My True Love (on track , 28 October 1998) * \\"Speed – Breakin' Out to the Morning (on track \\"EVERYDAY, BE WITH YOU\\", 19 May 1999) * \\"Red Beat of My Life\\" (15 March 2000) * \\"Luv is Magic\\" (2 August 2000) Eriko Imai * \\"In the Name of Love\\" (22 November 2000) * \\"identity\\" (7 March 2001) * \\"Set Me Free!\\" (6 June 2001) * \\"Don't Stop The Music\\" (23 January 2002) * \\"Our Relation\\" (10 July 2002) * \\"Butterfly\\" (2 July 2003) Elly * \\"star\\" (22 September 2005) * \\"journey\\" (13 May 2006) === Unreleased songs === * * \\"Good Night\\" * * * \\"New Days\\" * * === DVDs === Eriko Imai * My Place on Films (19 December 2001) * Eriko Imai LIVE 2010～Your Selection」DVD (22 February 2011) Elly * A Gift For You: Elly Live 2006 Neverland (14 February 2007) * A Gift For You Vol.2: Elly Live 2007 Instinct (14 February 2008) === Mobile download (Chaku Uta) === * (18 December 2006) * (1 January 2007) * (7 February 2007) * (6 April 2011) === Books === * (18 October 2005) * (14 February 2009) * (8 April 2011) === Movies === * \\"Andromedia\\" (1998) * \\"Dream Maker\\" (Cameo, 1999) * \\"Pinch Runner\\" (Cameo, 2000) * \\"Onmyoji\\" (2001) * \\"Onmyoji 2\\" (2003) * (Voice and theme song (\\"Butterfly\\"), 2003) * (2009) === Solo lives === * Elly Live 2005: Rebirth (22 September 2005) * Elly Live 2006: Journey (13 May 2006) * Elly Live 2006: Neverland (22–28 October 2006)(12 November 2006, 22 November 2006) * Elly Live 2007: Soar (3 April 2007) * Eriko Imai Christmas Live 2007: Instinct (25 December 2007) * Elly Presents Live 2008 (9 February 2008) * Imai Eriko Live & Talk (30 September 2008) * Imai Eriko Live 2009: Utagoe (23–31 May 2009) -cancelled due to H1N1- * Imai Eriko Live 2010: Your Selection (November 2010) === Musicals === * (2000) * \\"Footloose\\" (2002) * (2004) === TV === * \\"LxIxVxE\\" (1999) * (Guest Appearance, 2000) * \\"Rouge\\" (2001) * (4 April 2010~26 September 2010) * (3 April 2011) === Radio === * \\"Eriko Imai Hot Link\\" (2000–2003) == References == == External links == * Current Official Website (as Elly) * Former Official Website (as Eriko Imai) * * Category:1983 births Category:Japanese female pop singers Category:Japanese actresses Category:Living people Category:Avex Group artists Category:Musicians from Okinawa Prefecture Category:Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) politicians Category:Female members of the House of Councillors (Japan) Category:Members of the House of Councillors (Japan) Category:21st-century Japanese singers Category:21st-century women singers Category:Japanese actor-politicians ","title":"Eriko Imai"},{"id":"2585178","text":"[La] Serenissima ([The] Most Serene) may refer to: ==Certain countries== * , a name for the Republic of Venice * , the official Latin name of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ==Art, entertainment, and media== * La Serenissima (musical ensemble), a British early music/period instrument ensemble * La Serenissima (album), a 1981 album by Rondò Veneziano, also released as Venice in Peril * \\"La Serenissima\\", a single by Rondò Veneziano, later covered by DNA and by Mike Candys * \\"La Serenissima\\", an instrumental track from Loreena McKennitt's release, The Book of Secrets (1997) ==Sport== *Scuderia Serenissima, an auto racing team *Serenissima, a nickname for the San Marino national football team ==Other uses== * La Serenísima, an Argentine dairy products maker * Autostrada A4 (Italy), nicknamed Serenissima after its destination, Venice ==See also== * Most Serene Republic ","title":"Serenissima"},{"id":"2585179","text":"The Poughkeepsie and Eastern Railway was the first railroad to run east from Poughkeepsie, New York, and was taken over by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and assigned to the Central New England Railway in 1907. ==History== ===Beginnings=== The Poughkeepsie and Eastern Railroad was chartered April 13, 1866 to be built from Poughkeepsie on the Hudson River northeast to Boston Corners in Ancram, Columbia County, NY, and then southeast to the Connecticut state line, where it would connect with the Connecticut Western Railroad, which would continue east to Hartford, Connecticut. The line opened on January 24, 1871 and ran from Poughkeepsie to Stissing. At Stissing the P&E; had trackage rights to use that portion of the Dutchess and Columbia Railroad line that ran from Stissing to Pine Plains. On October 1, 1872 the remainder of the P&E; line was opened from Pine Plains to the state line. Haight, Lyndon A.,Pine Plains and the Railroads (1976) The P&E;'s main yard and engine facilities were at the Smith Street Yard in Poughkeepsie, where there was a passenger station, a freight house, turntable and engine house. The local trolley line on Smith St. also served the station. From the Poughkeepsie yard P&E; trains traveled east through Pleasant Valley, Salt Point, Clinton Corners, Stanfordville, Stissing, Pine Plains, Boston Corners and State Line near Millerton. It was anticipated that in addition to passenger service, the railroad would make money hauling iron ore from the ore beds of Columbia County, and milk from local dairy farms; however, revenues were not as great as expected. ===Receivership=== On June 24, 1874 the company went into receivership. It was sold in April 1875 and reorganized May 15 as the Poughkeepsie, Hartford and Boston Railroad. It again went bankrupt and on January 26, 1884 the Hartford and Connecticut Western Railroad bought the section southeast of Boston Corners, to which they already had track rights. The rest was sold in late 1886 and on January 22, 1887 it was reorganized as the New York and Massachusetts Railway. Profit was still hard to come by, and it entered receivership for a third time in February 1893. It was sold under foreclosure March 2 and reorganized April 13 once under the name, the Poughkeepsie and Eastern Railway Company. Yet again, on June 17, 1898, the company went into receivership.

In 1907 the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad bought it and on June 25 merged it into the Central New England Railway. The CNE had been forced to build the parallel Poughkeepsie and Connecticut Railroad in the late 1880s due to the Poughkeepsie and Eastern's refusal to sell. In 1910 the P&C; was abandoned between Salt Point and Pine Plains, with trains rerouted over the P&E.; With the 1925 abandonment of the P&E; from Ancram Lead Mines northeast to Boston Corners, the P&C; served as the sole route east of Pine Plains (it too was closed in 1932).

The 0.94 km2 coral island is known for its birdlife, including sooty terns, fairy terns and common noddies, and for hawksbill and green turtles. It is now a private resort with 24 bungalows. It also contains a small weather station and a small landing strip Bird Island Airport which connects the island with Mahe. Bird Island used to be known as \\"Île aux Vaches\\" due to the numerous dugongs (sea cows) that lived in nearby waters. Between 1896 and 1906, 17,000 tons of guano was removed from the island and exported to Mauritius as fertilizer. The island has been a coconut plantation, and for growing cash crops such as papaya and cotton. Since 1967 it has been privately owned, and conservation measures have taken place such as protection of birdlife and hawksbill turtle nesting sites, the eradication of feral rats and rabbits and the translocation of a population of Seychelles sunbird. Bird Island is named in honour of its spectacular colony of around 700,000 pairs of sooty tern that nest on the island. The birds arrive from late March, laying eggs in May and remaining until October before leaving the island. Another phenomenon especially in October to December arises from the geographical location of Bird Island on the northern edge of the Seychelles Bank.

They came to some prominence with a sound consisting largely of post-punk, spacious guitar hooks and dance-orientated beats, and have been compared to The Cure, and New Order/Joy Division. Later recordings have grown increasingly organic and atmospheric and reveal a kinship with The Smiths, Remain in Light era Talking Heads and Arcade Fire. The name Battle can be seen as an incitement for the individual to fight for their passions. Many of the band's lyrics revolve around this central theme. The band broke up around October 2007. ==Band members== * Jason Bavanandan – vocals, guitar * Oliver Davies – drums * James (Jamie) Ellis – guitar * Tim Scudder – bass, general badass ==History== ===Formation=== Singer Jason Bavanandan and guitarist Jamie Ellis met at school in Lewisham, South East London in the mid-nineties. Having completed school, they both enrolled at the University of Kent at Canterbury, with the intention of forming a band.Official site, \\"thisisbattle.com\\", Team > Who are Battle?. Retrieved 11 March 2007. The resulting band was Casper Jack. The music of Casper Jack was heavily informed by artists such as Oasis and the Small Faces. When the group's original bassist left, Ellis was introduced to Tim Scudder, at which point the band's sound began to change. Influences such as The Strokes, Joy Division and Pixies began to inform the songwriting process. During this period, the band's keyboardist was dismissed, and the drummer left. The next academic year saw drummer, Oliver Davies join the band. The band changed their name first to Morphic Fields, and later to Killing Moon. ===Early singles=== Their first single, \\"Isabelle\\" was released on 24 April 2005 on Fierce Panda Records. Their next single, \\"Demons\\", was released on 26 September 2005 by their permanent label, Transgressive Records and sold out its 1,500 copies in a day. After the free-download \\"Wicked Owl\\", the chart eligible \\"Tendency\\", reached No. 37 in the UK Singles Chart. Next single \\"Children\\", was championed by Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe, and was 'hottest record in the world today' on his show. ===Back to Earth - Mini-album=== On 23 October 2006, Battle released the seven-track mini-album, Back to Earth, which featured new versions of \\"Wicked Owl\\" and \\"Tendency\\". The mini-album was critically acclaimed but not commercially successful. Several of the tracks were produced by Gareth Jones and originally intended for the band's full debut album. \\"I Never Stopped\\" and \\"Easy to Listen to\\" were produced by the band and Jeff Knowler in June 2006. \\"Beautiful Dynasty\\" was released as a vinyl-only single in conjunction with Back to Earth. ===Break the Banks=== In June 2006, copies of the Gareth Jones sessions were leaked in plain black cases under the title Break the Banks. This was reputedly originally intended to be the band's debut album. The album was never released, though several tracks were included on Back to Earth. The band put the absence of a full-debut down to a marked improvement and prolificness in their song-writing. A new album, also titled Break the Banks was released on 3 September 2007, preceded by a single, \\"The Longest Time\\", released on 2 July 2007. Another single, \\"Paper Street\\", was released on 13 September 2007.

The first four novels were illustrated by Robert McCloskey but he declined to handle the last one because production of the fourth disappointed him deeply. It was published in 1986 without any illustrations but the dustjacket by Gail Owens.Sieruta. Four of the five novels share a similar premise: Henry, the son of an American diplomat, lives abroad with his parents. He spends summer vacation with his aunt and uncle in the small town of Grover's Corner, New Jersey, in the same house where his mother grew up. (Uncle Al is Henry's mother's brother.) Henry is a serious, entrepreneurial boy, and most of the books concern his efforts to earn money by starting some kind of business. All of the novels are told as a series of Henry's journal entries recounting his day-by-day adventures throughout the summer. As he explains in his first book, his journal is not a diary. Margaret \\"Midge\\" Glass, a year younger than Henry, is the only person in the neighborhood close to his age. She becomes his friend and business partner throughout the series. Midge is somewhat tomboyish and more spontaneous and free-spirited than Henry, which he sometimes finds annoying. Their relationship sometimes resembles a screwball comedy minus the romance. In all of the books, events spiral out of control, leading to chaotic and humorous misadventures. Henry and Midge are usually the unintentional cause of these adventures, although they're not deliberately mischievous. ==Henry Reed books== In the first book, Henry Reed, Inc. (November 7, 1958, paperback reissue ), 13-year-old Henry meets his aunt Mabel and uncle Al; adopts a stray beagle, Agony; and makes friends with Midge. Henry turns an old family barn into the headquarters for Henry Reed, Inc., a research service. Henry attempts to make money by drilling for oil, hunting for truffles, and experimenting with a homemade weather balloon, among other efforts. His main foils throughout the book are Mr. and Mrs. Apple, who live in the house next door and have an extreme aversion to anyone entering their yard. The second book in the series, Henry Reed's Journey (January 1, 1963, paperback reissue ), is the only one not set in Grover's Corner. Instead, Henry meets Midge and her parents in San Francisco, California, and they drive across the United States to New Jersey. The third book, Henry Reed's Baby-Sitting Service (April 20, 1966, paperback reissue ), is set during the same summer. Henry and Midge decide to become baby-sitters. The Apples have moved away, so Henry and Midge have to deal with the older, disdainful children who moved in next door. Henry Reed's Big Show (October 30, 1970, paperback reissue ), the fourth book, involves Henry and Midge's efforts to become showbiz entrepreneurs. In Henry Reed's Think Tank (1986, paperback reissue ), the fifth book, Henry and Midge return to their roots and set up a think tank to help solve the problems of Grover's Corner residents. This book is set just after the events of Big Show. This is the only book in which Robertson reverts Henry's age — he had gone from 13 to 15 in the previous books, but Robertson makes him 13 again in this novel, presumably to keep him interesting for the younger readers for whom the books were written. ==Awards== * Henry Reed, Inc. received the William Allen White Children's Book Award in 1961 * Henry Reed's Baby-Sitting Service received the William Allen White Children's Book Award and the Pacific Northwest Library Association Young Reader's Choice Award in 1969 Both annual awards are administered by public library systems and judged by schoolchildren. ==See also== * Epistolary novel == References == * \\"Misadventures\\".

It is the third largest granitic island in the Seychelles. It has an area of 20.1 km2 and has a population of 200, mostly workers on the island on the Somali Sea. The main settlement is La Passe, where Hilton Hotel is located. The name Silhouette was given after Étienne de Silhouette (1709-1767), the French minister of finances under Louis XV. ==Geography== The island is mountainous with five peaks over in elevation; Mont Dauban , Mont-Pot-a-Eau , Gratte Fesse , Mont Corgat and Mont Cocos Marrons . As such, it has some of the most dramatic scenery of the islands. Though superficially similar to neighbouring islands, much of Silhouette is made up of younger syenite dated from 63 million years ago. Between Point Ramasse Tout and Point Zeng Zeng lies the only surface volcanic ash in Seychelles. ==Demographics== The population of 200 lives in 3 villages, Grand Barbe, which is on the west coast, Anse Mondon and La Passe on the East coast.Historical Information on Silhouette ==History== The crew of an English East India Company vessel, the Ascension, were the first humans known to step ashore on Silhouette, in 1609. The island was visited by Charles Oger, who took possession of it in the name of the King of France on 28 January 1771. Graves discovered at Anse Lascars were thought to be evidence of earlier visitors, possibly of Arabic origin (hence the name \\"Lascars\\", which is the local term for an Arab). However, when bones from the graves were taken for investigation, they were dated to around 1800, around the time of the first settlement. Also, there is a legend in the Seychelles that the corsair Jean- François Hodoul buried his treasure on Silhouette Island. From the mid-19th century until 1960, the island was owned by the Dauban family, who were originally from France but had settled in Mauritius in 1830. The Dauban family were responsible for developing extensive plantations on Silhouette. There is a mausoleum built in the style of La Madeleine in Paris, Église de la Madeleine, where a number of the family members are buried, including Auguste Dauban, whose business ventures were so extensive he earned the nickname \\"the Rothschild of the Indian Ocean\\". The Dauban era came to an end when Henri Dauban sold the island to a French group. Following the purchase of the island by the Seychelles government in 1983, a small hotel was constructed. This was later replaced by the larger Labriz Resort which was then bought by the Hilton hotel group.Official site The Dauban plantation house has recently been restored, and now is a museum which contains many original photos of the Dauban family. ==Flora and fauna== Silhouette Island is one of the richest biodiversity points in the western Indian Ocean with many endemic and threatened plant and animal species. Among the most important is the Critically Endangered Seychelles sheath-tailed bat. Two roosting caves have been located, part of a single system of passages in a boulder field. Another roost complex was discovered in 2005 and 32 bats recorded. Most of the 75 or so endemic plants of the granitic islands of Seychelles are found on Silhouette, some of them unique to the island. One of the rarest of these is the Critically Endangered Impatiens gordonii, a white-flowered relative of the well-known garden plant Busy Lizzie, only ever recorded on Mahe and Silhouette. In 1987 the surrounding waters were declared a Marine National Park. In 2010, Silhouette National Park was created protecting 93 percent of the landmass. The island is also an Important Bird Area and is considered by the Alliance for Zero Extinction to be an important site for the survival of Critically Endangered species.

Praslin has a population of around 7,533 people and comprises two administrative districts: Baie Sainte Anne and Grand' Anse. The main settlements are the Baie Ste Anne, Anse Volbert and Grand' Anse. It was named Isle de Palmes by explorer Lazare Picault in 1744. During that time it was used as a hideaway by pirates and Arab merchants. In 1768 it was renamed Praslin in honor of French diplomat César Gabriel de Choiseul, duc de Praslin. Praslin is known as a tourist destination with several hotels and resorts, as well as a number of beaches such as Anse Lazio and Anse Georgette. It has substantial tracts of tropical forests with birds such as the endemic Seychelles bulbul and the Seychelles black parrot. The Vallée de Mai Nature Preserve, established in 1979,reserve info is known for the unique coco de mer and vanilla orchids. It has been reported that General Charles George Gordon of Khartoum (1833-1885) was convinced that Vallée de Mai was the Biblical \\"Garden of Eden\\". Praslin is home to Praslin Island Airport, while surrounding islands include Curieuse Island, La Digue, Cousin Island, Cousine Island and Aride Island. There are a few near offshore islets including Round Island (0.193 km2) and Chauve Souris (0.007 km2), both of which have hotel accommodations. Twice in two weeks in August 2011 bull sharks entered the so- called 'safe bathing' area inside the coral reef of Anse Lazio and attacked and killed swimmers less than from shore. However, to put this in perspective, these were the first recorded fatal shark attacks in Seychelles for 50 years and none have been recorded after 2011.

The original music score is composed by Michael Nyman. The film did poorly at the box office and was received as an average film by critics. ==Plot== Daniel Dillon is an Irish immigrant who settles in the high mountains of California during the Gold Rush of 1849. It is now 1867, and Dillon has a vault filled with gold and a town of his own, named Kingdom Come. Dillon owns nearly every business of consequence in the town; if someone digs for gold, rents a hotel room, opens a bank account, or commits a crime, they will have to deal with Dillon. One of the few profitable enterprises in town that Dillon does not own is the saloon/brothel, which is operated by Lucia, his Portuguese lover. Donald Dalglish is a surveyor with the Central Pacific Railroad, which wants to put a train either through Kingdom Come, or somewhere in the vicinity. He is here to decide the route. Dillon is anxious to ensure that the railway line is routed through \\"his\\" town, as this will bring more business. Among the travelers who arrive in town with Dalglish are two women, the beautiful but ailing Elena Burn and her lovely teenage daughter Hope. The presence of these women is deeply troubling for Dillon, for they are the keys to a dark secret Dillon has kept from the people of Kingdom Come for nearly twenty years. Dillon had come to these mountains with his Polish wife Elena and their months-old baby, Hope. On a cold and snowy night they happen upon a shack named Kingdom Come, owned by a disillusioned '49er named Burn. Like Hardy's Mayor of Casterbridge, Dillon sells Elena and Hope to the prospector in exchange for the small gold claim that would later flourish and make Dillon so wealthy. Burn has died, and Elena has come to find Dillon because Burn left her with nothing, she is dying, and she wants Dillon to give her $200 per year so that she can \\"do right by Hope\\". Dillon tells Lucia that they have to end their relationship and gives her some gold bricks and the deeds to her home, the saloon/brothel, and the tobacco house. Lucia is heartbroken, wanting Dillon and not his money. Dillon tells Elena that he never married anyone else because he was always married to her. The two renew their marriage but their time together is short, filled with Dillon's efforts to find a cure for her illness and ending with her death. Elena's death coincides with the decision to route the railway some distance from the town for easier passage and construction. Lucia moves the girls, the booze and the tobacco house to the valley, effectively moving the entire population of Kingdom Come to her new town of Lisboa, named for her father's home in Portugal, to be near the railroad. Following Elena's funeral, Hope tells Dillon that she is leaving to find Dalglish and start a life with him. Dillon takes her up to the original shack Kingdom Come, showing her a picture of their family when she was a baby, and revealing the deal made right on that spot between him and Burn. Hope leaves him and goes to the new Lisboa. Dillon is thus faced with the loss of both Elena and Hope, and his town. He sets fire to all the buildings in Kingdom Come. The smoke attracts the people of Lisboa, who find Dillon's frozen body in the snow near his original shack. Lucia is devastated, crying over the frozen body as it is brought back to the ruins of Kingdom Come. While many of the 'former' townspeople rush to find Dillon's stockpile of gold in the burned out vault, Hope and Dalglish choose instead to follow Dillon's body as Lucia and others continue with it down the mountain. ==Cast== * Peter Mullan as Daniel Dillon * Milla Jovovich as Lucia * Wes Bentley as Donald Dalglish * Nastassja Kinski as Elena Dillon/Burn * Sarah Polley as Hope Dillon/Burn * Julian Richings as Frank Bellanger * Shirley Henderson as Annie * Sean McGinley as Sweetley * Tom McCamus as Burn * Karolina Muller as Young Elena * Barry Ward as Young Dillon * Duncan Frasier as Crocker ==Production== ===Filming=== Primary filming took place at the Fortress Mountain Resort in Kananaskis Country, Alberta, Canada. Near the end of the film, in a scene where the character of Dillon is standing in the street and throws an oil can onto a burning building, you can see the tower, cables and chairs of a modern ski lift in the background. The decision to have the film's dramatic burning of the entire town of Kingdom Come also served as a first step to fulfill the producer's commitment to return the site to its original natural condition. Some secondary filming took place in Colorado. The town that Lucia creates in the valley below Kingdom Come is not to be confused with the real town of Lisbon, California (now the unincorporated community of Arcade), located on the route of the Sacramento Northern Railway which started operation in 1918. ===Soundtrack=== The Claim is Michael Nyman's first (and, as of 2008, only) score for a Western, and his second collaboration with Michael Winterbottom. In it, in particular, in \\"The Shootout,\\" Nyman pays homage to Ennio Morricone's Western scores. \\"The Shootout\\" also incorporates material from A Zed & Two Noughts and Prospero's Books in a layered manner with elements of the main themes of the score and a Morricone-style trumpet motif. The score includes the principal scalar riff that appears in numerous Nyman works, including Out of the Ruins, String Quartet No. 3, À la folie, Carrington, the rejected score from Practical Magic, and The End of the Affair. The Claim marks Michael Nyman's last use of this musical material (as of 2008). Portions of the score appear as solo piano works on Nyman's 2005 album, The Piano Sings, which features Nyman's personal piano interpretations of music he had written for various films. ====Track listing==== #The Exchange #The First Encounter #The Hut #The Explosion #The Recollection #The Fiery House #The Betrothal #The Firework Display #The Train #The Shootout #The Death Of Elena #The Explanation #The Burning #The Snowy Death #The Closing ====Production details==== *Artists: The Michael Nyman Orchestra *Composed and conducted by Michael Nyman *Orchestration: Gary Carpenter/Michael Nyman *Programmer and music editor: Robert Worby *Auricle Operator: Chris Cozens *Engineer: Austin Ince *Assistant Engineers: Simon Changer and Ryu Kawashima *Recorded, mixed and edited at Whitfield Sterret Studios, London, September 2000 *Music published by Northlight Music Ltd.

In size it is the fourth-largest granitic island of Seychelles after Mahé, Praslin and Silhouette Island. It has a population of 2,800 people, who mostly live in the west coast villages of La Passe (linked by ferry to Praslin and Mahé) and La Réunion. There is no airport on La Digue, so to get there from a foreign country, one has to fly to Victoria and continue by ferry, usually via Praslin. It has an area of 10.08 km², which makes it relatively easy to travel around by bike or on foot. La Digue was named after a ship in the fleet of French explorer Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne, who visited the Seychelles in 1768. ==History== According to modern historians, La Digue was first sighted by the French navigator Lazare Picault in 1742, but it was not named until 1768. The first people settled on the island in 1789, when French colonists arrived with their African slaves. Most of them went back to France, but some people were left and some of today's inhabitants carry their names. Later, more French deportees arrived, followed by a large number of liberated slaves and Asian immigrants. In 1854, the first Catholic chapel was built on La Digue by Father Theophile. Most inhabitants of the island are of the Catholic faith. French colonists on La Digue manufactured coral lime, and they are believed to be responsible for the decline of the island's coral reefs. They also made copra out of coconuts, and they planted vanilla on their plantations. This tradition has been continued. ==Climate== The Seychelles in general have warm temperatures throughout the year. Thanks to their location near the equator, they get frequent and sometimes heavy rainfall. On La Digue, rainfall can be very heavy, but it usually lasts for one hour or less. The day temperature on La Digue normally stays between and and the nights do not get too much colder than that. There is most rainfall from October to March, with a monthly precipitation of in January. There is the least precipitation in July, with only of rain. ==Culture== The inhabitants of La Digue are called Diguois. The first inhabitants arrived in 1798, exiled from Bourbon for taking part in a political rebellion there. They were supposed to be sent to the East Indies, but bribed the captain to ship them to Seychelles instead where many had relatives.Reveil Seychellois by Denise Johnstone The population of La Digue is mostly Catholic and the island's feast day on 15 August is a national holiday. ==Politics== There is no separate government of La Digue, so it follows the laws and legislation set from the government in Victoria. The Seychelles have a president and the main political sides are the PP and SNP. The law system of the Seychelles is modelled on European politics. ==Government services== The administrative center on La Digue, La Passe. Being an island with a population of only 2,800 people, there are not many government buildings or services. For many services, people have to go to Praslin. La Digue has a post office which is closed on Sundays. There is a small police station that was mainly set up for tourists. There is a small hospital, although some inhabitants prefer to visit the hospitals in Praslin and Victoria. Women usually go to Victoria to give birth. ==Tourism== Aerial of La Digue, Seychelles Today, the island's main industry is tourism, and it is known for its beaches, especially Anse Source d'Argent and Grand Anse. La Digue went through a major tourist increase in the previous century, which heavily impacted the economy of the Seychelles. In former times, copra and vanilla production were mainstays of the local economy, which is commemorated in the island's museum. Veuve Nature Reserve, in the island's interior, is home to the rare black paradise flycatcher, of which there are only about 100 in existence. La Digue's tallest peak, Belle Vue (Eagle's Nest Mountain), is in the central part of the island, with a summit more than above sea level. La Digue is also visited for its wide variety of underwater creatures like fish, sharks and rays. The island has plenty of accommodation and activities to offer tourists. There are at least twenty guesthouses and hotels, a few restaurants and a dive centre. One can go on a boat trip or a diving trip around La Digue for one day or half a day. Furthermore, the Veuve reserve offers tourists a hiking trip with a guide who can show them the beauty of La Digue. The beach and surrounding rocks at Anse Source d'Argent in the late afternoon. ==Transport== Once, one was not allowed to own a car at La Digue. This has recently changed, but the main means of transportation is still the bicycle. Tourists are requested to adapt to this lifestyle; it is possible to rent bicycles right near the pier. There are a few personally owned vehicles, but most cars and buses belong to hotel companies. Driving a large car or even a bus can turn out to be a quite hard task, because the roads were originally designed for bicycles. Two cars going against each other must slide off the road with two wheels in the sand. The people who own a car on La Digue usually have many seats built in so that it can accommodate their whole family. Another method of transport on La Digue is using an ox-cart which has a slow pace suited to the island. ==Cuisine== Since La Digue is an island inhabited by many ethnic groups, the cuisine is a specific mix of world cuisines. With the abundance of fish, the Seychellois people have learned how to make hundreds of recipes out of this simple ingredient. One can have fish curry, fish fillets, raw fish with lemon, grilled fish, steamed fish, cooked fish and so on. The inhabitants of La Digue also make fried octopus, lobster with garlic and their biggest speciality – bat curry. An ingredient used to a very large degree is ginger, which is put in many meals. The most popular alcoholic drink on La Digue is palm wine, which most Seychellois people like to make themselves by fermenting the inside of a coconut. ==Wildlife== The giant tortoise of Aldabra The rare Seychelles paradise flycatcher La Digue is the home to the critically endangered paradise flycatcher. However, there are more rare and endangered animals that live on this island. Since the Seychelles are detached from the rest of Africa, many of the species are endemic to La Digue. There is a significant population of giant tortoises that come from the island Aldabra. The subspecies that lived on La Digue is extinct. From the arthropod group there is, for example, the Seychelles coconut crab which likes to dig holes in the backyards of the Seychellois people. Among others, there are fodys, sunbirds, terns, fruitbats, sheath-tailed bats, and geckos. The reefs and lagoons of La Digue offer a large amount of flora and fauna. Green sea turtles live on the very edges of the coral reefs, and they sometimes venture closer to the island. There are butterflyfish, eagle ray, moray eel and many other species of fish. Divers and snorkellers may be lucky enough to see blacktip reef sharks or even whale sharks, which come mainly in the winter but can be seen all year round. Sadly, the animals that have traditionally lived on La Digue are threatened by animals that were brought there by the first inhabitants: rats, dogs, cats etc. The rat population was probably the first animal that was brought to the Seychelles. It quickly made many birds become extinct by eating their eggs and threatening their nests. The dog and cat population is not nearly as much of a threat, but it still is something that the original species of Seychelles are not used to. ==Gallery== File:Traumhafte Kulisse auf La Digue, Seychellen (25745814908).jpgLa Digue, Seychelles File:Anse Source d'Argent Luftbild La Digue Seychellen (24748770127).jpgAerial of Beach Anse Source d'Argent La Digue File:Traumstrand Anse Source d'Argent La Digue Seychellen (39616996591).jpgDer Strand Anse Source d'Argent auf La Digue File:Strand Petite Anse auf der Insel La Digue, Seychellen (25731869178).jpgBeach Petite Anse La Digue File:Grand L' Anse Strand Insel La Digue, Seychellen (39616875951).jpgBeach Grand L' Anse La Digue File:Rock Pools at Petite Anse Cocos La Digue Seychelles (39602455121).jpgBeach Petite Anse Cocos La Digue File:Strand Anse Patates Cocos auf der Insel La Digue, Seychellen (25745760198).jpgBeach Patates Cocos La Digue File:La_Passe_town_centre_on_La_Digue.JPGThe La Passe village centre File:La_Digue_Coconut_Plantation_2015.JPGCoconut plantation File:Grand Anse La Digue 2015.JPGGrande Anse beach File:La digue church.jpgNotre-Dame de l’Assomption Church File:Anse_Source_dArgent_on_La_Digue_2015.JPGAnse Source d'Argent File:Se-map.gifMap 1 File:Seychelles large map.jpgMap 2 File:La_Digue_roheline.pngMap 3 File:Grand_Anse-La_Digue-Seychellen.jpgThe spectacular beach of Grand Anse File:Anse_Source_d%27Argent_3-La_Digue.jpgthe spectacular beach of Anse Source d'Argent File:Anse_Marron-La_Digue- Seychelles.jpgThe lovely beach of Anse Marron File:Grann_Kaz_La_Digue.JPGHistorical house of families Rassool / Hossen on the L'Union Estate Farm File:Seychelles_Paradise-flycatcher.jpgSeychelles paradise flycatcher File:La_Digue_Union_cemetery.JPGCemetery File:Anse_Cocos- La_Digue-Seychelles.jpgAnse Cocos ==See also== * Cocos Island, Seychelles * List of lighthouses in Seychelles == References == == External links == * Official La Digue Island Guide * National Bureau of Statistics * Map * The Islands of the Seychelles Category:Somali Sea Category:Islands of La Digue and Inner Islands Category:Important Bird Areas of Seychelles Category:Lighthouses in Seychelles ","title":"La Digue"},{"id":"2585235","text":"David Arthur Allen (29 October 1935 – 24 May 2014) was an English cricketer who played first-class cricket for Gloucestershire between 1953 and 1972. He also played 39 Test matches for England. ==Life and career== Allen was first selected for England in 1959 and in 1960 was selected as the Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketer of the Year. Allen toured all the then-current Test- playing nations. He was a decent bat, his Test average higher than the all- rounders Fred Titmus and Ray Illingworth, and in the 1963 Lord's Test against the West Indies, he notably played out the final two balls of Wes Hall's last over for a draw. Allen had protected Colin Cowdrey at the other end, who was pressed in to bat with his broken arm in plaster. In the 1965–66 Ashes series Allen made 50 not out in the Third Test at Sydney, adding 93 for the last two wickets and took 4/47 as England won by an innings and 93 runs. Allen was also famous for being taken off against Australia. In the decisive Fourth Test at Old Trafford in 1961 he took three quick wickets to have Australia nine wickets down, but Alan Davidson hit him for 20 runs in an over and Peter May took him off. Davidson added 98 for the last wicket and Australia won by 54 runs. Nevertheless, in six winters, Allen completed the set of playing against all the other Test playing nations of the time. In India and Pakistan in 1961–62, he bowled 482 overs in the Test series alone. A right-arm off-break bowler, using a very short run, Allen came close to developing into an all- rounder on the level of Fred Titmus. Playing fairly regularly for England throughout the first half of the 1960s, after 1966 he found it increasingly difficult to score enough runs or get enough bowling at county level as trends changed. Gloucestershire used three spin bowlers from the 1950s onwards but by the end of the 1960s Mike Bissex and Allen were effectively doing the work of one bowler. Though Bissex lost form, the advent of Sadiq Mohammad, a useful leg spinner, saw Allen fade away from the county side in 1972. Cricket commentator Colin Bateman noted that \\"towards the end of his 20 summers at Bristol his relationship with skipper Tony Brown, with whom he had grown up on a cricket field, became strained. Allen even found himself left out of his own benefit match\\". In later years, Allen was a member of the Gloucestershire County Cricket Club committee, and was elected club president in 2011. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1935 births Category:2014 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:England Test cricketers Category:English cricketers of 1946 to 1968 Category:Gloucestershire cricketers Category:Combined Services cricketers Category:Commonwealth XI cricketers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:Players cricketers Category:Sportspeople from Bristol Category:International Cavaliers cricketers Category:T.

A nature reserve, it is leased and managed by the Island Conservation Society of Seychelles.Island Conservation Society ==History== The name ‘Aride’ first appears on nautical charts after French voyages of exploration in 1770 and 1771. The first written account was in 1787 by Jean-Baptiste Malavois, French commandant of Seychelles, who described it as being “…no more than a pile of rocks covered with a few bushes.” Between 1817 and 1829 Aride was possibly an unofficial leper colony. In 1868, the Irishman Perceval Wright, who gave his name to Aride's unique gardenia and one of its endemic lizards, visited Aride. In 1883, the British artist Marianne North painted a scene on the island, reporting just one large tree, beneath which the island staff sheltered from the sun. Coconut palms were planted over much of Aride and copra production became important economically. Dogs, pigs, cats and chickens were introduced, though fortunately rats never arrived. The wooden plantation house on Aride, overlooking the small settlement, is one of the last buildings of its type to survive in Seychelles. For almost a century sooty tern eggs were cropped with up to 220,000 being removed each season. Not surprisingly the number of nesting seabirds declined and all endemic land birds were wiped out. However, in 1967, the island's owner, Paul Chenard, ceased egg collection and declared the island a reserve. In 1973, Mr. Christopher Cadbury purchased Aride for the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves (now Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts). In 1979 it was declared a Special Reserve under Seychelles law, to include a marine zone of 200m around the island, with penalties including imprisonment for killing or disturbance of its wildlife. In 2003, management was transferred to Island Conservation Society. In 2006, the freehold was transferred to the UK Registered Charity Island Conservation Society UK and in 2008, the island was leased back to Island Conservation Society of Seychelles. ==Geography== The island is part of the district of Grand'Anse, located 10 km north of Praslin island and is 68 hectares in area.Official Aride Island Guide Granite rock in the cliff of Gros la Tête – Aride Island. The thin (1-3 cms. wide) brighter layers are quartz veins, formed during the late stages of crystallization of granitic magmas. They are also sometimes called “hydrothermal veins” ==Demographics== The only human inhabitants are the reserve's staff; currently four Seychellois rangers, two expatriate Conservation Officers and two volunteers. They live in the main village of the island, La Cour,map on the south side of the island. ==Government services== Being an island with a small population, there are not any government buildings or services. For many services, people have to go to Praslin. ==Tourism== Today, the island is dedicated to conservation supported by ecotourism. It is known for huge seabird colonies, with more breeding species than any other single Seychelles island plus large numbers of non-breeding frigatebirds. The density of lizards is also one of the greatest on earth. There is only one beach, which faces south, making access difficult when the southeast trade winds are at their height (June to September) Photo gallery There is no overnight accommodation other than for the resident staff of the island but one can visit for the day by boat trip from neighbouring Praslin, 8 kilometres to the south. ==Transport== The only form of transportation is by foot. ==Cuisine== Fish is the staple diet supplemented by fruit and vegetables grown on the island and other foodstuffs brought by the island boat from Praslin. ==Flora and fauna== Over 1.25 million seabirds regularly breed on Aride including the world's largest colony of lesser noddy, the largest Seychelles population of roseate tern and the world's largest colony of tropical shearwater. There is also an enormous roost of non-breeding frigatebirds.Aride Island Nature Reserve There are five species endemic to Seychelles resident on Aride. The Seychelles warbler was introduced from Cousin Island to Aride in 1988 and its population is now the largest in the world with over 2,000 pairs. The Seychelles fody was also introduced from Cousin in 2002, as well the Seychelles magpie robin from Fregate Island. The Seychelles blue pigeon and the Seychelles sunbird have re-colonised Aride naturally. Reptilian fauna includes several species of skink, three species of gecko and three species of non-poisonous snakes. Green turtles and hawksbill turtles are regular visitors to the beaches of Aride. Aride is the only place in the world where the flowering shrub Wright's gardenia Rothmannia annae is endemic. ==Image gallery== File:Seychelles large map.jpgMap 1 File:Aride_roheline.pngMap 2 File:Aride-55.66828E_4.21153S.pngSatellite view File:Ile_Aride_(1).JPGThe Lodge, La Cour, Aride File:Ile_Aride_(3).JPGBeach File:Ile_Aride_-_Arbre_(2).JPGTree with lianas on Aride File:Ile_Aride_(4).JPGMemorial Plaque of Christopher Cadbury == References == Category:Islands of Grand'Anse Praslin Category:Important Bird Areas of Seychelles ","title":"Aride Island"},{"id":"2585258","text":"Cousin Island is a small () granitic island of the Seychelles, lying west of Praslin.Official site It is a nature reserve protected under Seychelles law as a Special Reserve. It is managed by Nature Seychelles, a national nonprofit organization and Partner of BirdLife International, by which it has been identified as an Important Bird Area. ==Description== A plateau covered with indigenous woodland extends over most of the island, which is almost encircled by a long sandy beach. The southern coast is rocky. A hill occupies the centre of the island's southern half. There is an area of mangroves and three small, freshwater swamps.Info A marine reserve, protecting coral reefs, extends into the sea from the shoreline. ==History== The island was formerly a coconut plantation that had been stripped of much of its native vegetation. The endemic Seychelles warbler had become almost extinct, with a population of only 26 birds. In 1968 BirdLife International, at the time known as the International Council for Bird Preservation (ICBP), bought the island and removed young coconut trees, thus allowing the native vegetation to regenerate and native fauna to recover. It was declared a special reserve in 1975. ==Flora and fauna== Aldabra giant tortoise The island's woodland is dominated by Pisonia grandis, Morinda citrifolia and Ochrosia oppositifolia trees. Casuarina equisetifolia trees and Coconut palms fringe the coast. The rocky southern part of the island is characterised by Pandanus balfourii, Ficus reflexa, Ficus lutea and Euphorbia pyrifolia shrubs, with tall herbs and ferns. There are several species of endemic Seychelles lizards on the island, the skinks Mabuya wrightii, M. seychellensis and Pamelascincus gardineri and the geckos Phelsuma astriata and Ailuronyx sechellensis, as well as a freshwater turtle Pelusios subniger and 12 Aldabra giant tortoises. It is an important nesting site for hawksbill turtles and, occasionally, green turtles. The island is free of rats. Indian hares have been introduced but are not considered harmful to the vegetation. ===Birds=== Seychelles magpie-robin The island was the last refuge of the Seychelles warbler, with only 26–29 individual birds left in 1959. Following conservation efforts the population began to recover and birds were translocated to other islands. In 1999, the population on Cousin was with territories. The total warbler population has since grown to some . The island is one of only four that host the Seychelles fody, with an estimated 800–1,200 birds in 1997. A small breeding population of Seychelles magpie-robin was established in 1995, with three pairs translocated from Frégate; in 1997, the population had increased to 25 birds in four occupied territories. Other landbirds present include the endemic Seychelles sunbird and Seychelles blue pigeon as well as the Malagasy turtle dove.Bird info The island hosts over 300,000 nesting seabirds of seven species. A large colony, dominated by lesser noddies, but including about 1300 pairs of brown noddies, is present from May to September during the south-east monsoon. During the north-west monsoon, the hill supports a breeding colony of wedge-tailed shearwaters. Year-round breeders include white and bridled terns, white-tailed tropicbirds and some 1000–1,500 pairs of Audubon's shearwaters. Several hundred great and lesser frigatebirds use the island for roosting and can be seen soaring over it. Some waders are present throughout the year, the commonest being the ruddy turnstone. Common moorhens and striated herons also breed on the island. ==Conservation== The island is known as a site for good practice in environmental management and has been the focus of many case studies.Official site It is used by international research organisations and universities as a research base. It is a Demonstration Site for the International Coral Reef Action Network (ICRAN). Its ecotourism program has won several prizes including the Condé Nast ecotourism award and a Tourism for Tomorrow award. It is linked to other privately owned islands that contain endemic biodiversity through the Island Conservation Centre on Praslin island, funded by a World Bank/Global Environment Facility project. The Centre aims to increase awareness of conservation efforts on Cousin and elsewhere through displays, educational programs and work with grass roots groups. ==Access== The island is accessible by sea from Praslin, or the neighbouring resort island of Cousine. It is open to visitors every morning, Monday to Friday, but is closed at weekends and on public holidays. ==Image gallery== File:Cousin island.jpgCousin Island File:cousine+cousine seychelles.jpgCousine Island and Cousin (right), seen from Praslin File:Seychelles large map.jpgMap 1 File:Cousin_Seychellen.JPGCousin Island File:Cousin_Island_Seychelles.jpgimage File:Cousin.svgMap 2 == References == ==External links== *Radio programme about the conservation efforts on Cousin Island Category:Islands of Grand'Anse Praslin Category:Important Bird Areas of Seychelles Category:Nature conservation in Seychelles ","title":"Cousin Island"},{"id":"2585268","text":"For the community near Tampa, see Westchase, Florida.

Smith, a Houston oilman and philanthropist well known for creating the Houston Colt .45s baseball team. In 1969, Friendswood Development Company purchased a section of Smith's land to form what is now Woodlake, a residential subdivision at the intersection of Westheimer and Gessner. In 1973, Westchase Corporation, the predecessor to the modern management district, purchased of Smith's land and began preparing land parcels for corporate development. Chevron and Western Geophysical were some of the first companies to establish operations in the district. Construction on Beltway 8 (the Sam Houston Tollway) through the area began in 1985 and was completed in 1988. Financing for this section of the tollway was particularly challenging, as the Texas Department of Transportation's right-of-way acquisition program coincided with the rapid development of Westchase and Sharpstown, induced by the 1970s energy crisis. In order to ensure that the highway would be built, landowners and developers in Westchase and Sharpstown formed the Beltway 8 Group, which coordinated with TxDOT to lock in property values at rates the state could afford.

Though there are differing claims and no written accounts have been found to favor one over another, it is generally accepted that the Apostle Thomas arrived in what is now the state of Kerala and established a number of churches, converting mainly Brahmin families. He then traveled to what is now the modern state of Tamil Nadu and on to China, establishing small works along the way. After returning to Tamil Nadu, he was killed by some locals. Though he was buried in India, his body was taken, in the fourth or fifth century, to Edessa, in modern-day Turkey. ==Families in India== The name, Kalloor, also refers to a number of prominent families, in Hindu, Christian and Muslim communities. In Hindu communities, the Kalloor family is one of the few families that are part of the priestly Namboodhiri Brahmin caste. In Muslim communities also, the Kalloor family is large and prominent. There are \\"suburbs\\" around a number of the larger cities of Kerala, like Kochi, that bear this name. Many of these suburbs have large Muslim populations. In Christian communities, there are a number of theories for the origin of this family name. One is that early converts to Christianity (Jewish people ) took this name in remembrance of accepting Jesus (Yeshua) as their \\" messiah\\" from Apostle Thomas, at a place named Kalloor, in Tamil Nadu. Another is that they are converts from the Hindu Kalloor family, reportedly converting in the seventh century. Members of this family are prominent in a number of the Christian traditions, including in Syriac groups such as the Indian Orthodox Church, Western groups such as the Roman Catholic Church, and Reform groups such as the Indian Brethren and Pentecostal churches. Listed among the more prominent Christians are Bishop Yoohanon Chrysostom Kalloor of the Catholic Church, from the Kalloor family in Pathanamthitta and the initial catalyst for the Pentecostal movement in Kerala, the late Kalloor Chacko, from the Kalloor family in Thrikkannamangal. The Kallor Family in Kanjiralli to Pala route is also now divided into Catholics and Protestants. It is believed that Devasia Kalloor broke from the Catholic chusch along with 5 other families and started the Kalaketty CSI Church. It is suspected but not proven whether the two Kalloor families of Pathanamthitta and Thrikkannamangal are related. Because family names can be modified or even discarded by each generation that establishes a new home, and are often not used as last names for people in South India, the tracing of genealogies is very difficult, if not impossible, without written family trees. Many in the Kalloor family of Pathanamthitta remain in the Roman Catholic Church and some have risen to leadership within that tradition, like Bishop Yoohanon. The Kalloor family of Thrikkannamangal had nominally remained within the Syrian tradition even during the Portuguese blockade of the 16th and 17th centuries. This blockade prevented the Syriac Orthodox Church and the Assyrian Church of the East from communicating with their branches in India and forced the majority of the Syrian churches in India to join the Roman Catholic Church in order to preserve Apostolic succession. Some, however, made a public vow, known as the Coonen Cross Oath, to never succumb to the leadership of the Western Church. Later, many from Thrikkannamangal joined the Reformation movement within the Syrian Church in the 19th century which resulted in the establishment of the Mar Thoma Church. Members of this family were also prominent in the establishment of the Brethren churches in South India. It was while Chacko was in the Brethren church that he became acquainted with the American missionary Robert F. Cook, the Father of Indian Pentecostalism.

Since the 1970s it has been a flora and fauna reserve. From 1915 until the 1960s, the island was abandoned until its purchase by Brendon Grimshaw, a former newspaper editor, originally from Dewsbury in Yorkshire, England.

His wife Vera Georges and him had lived on the island in the early years and later moved to Mahe where they lived in the property known as Fairview. A view on the island and a beach were named after Vera who spent her days on the property while her husband Phillip worked on Mahe during the day. Phillip sold the island to Brendon Grimshaw after he had dinner with Phillip and Vera who were very hospitable and invited him to supper when he approached them to buy their island an agreement had been reached between them after an extended dinner. Brendon Grimshaw purchased the island for £8,000 in 1962 and set about making the island habitable. He did this with the help of one other man, Rene Antoine Lafortune. They operated the island as a nature reserve, charging visitors €12 to come ashore, roam the island, dine at the \\"Jolly Roger\\" restaurant and relax on the beach. Grimshaw and his friend planted sixteen thousand trees, built of nature paths, and brought and bred giant tortoises, intending to create an island of incredible beauty. Apart from a wide variety of plant and bird life, the island is home to around 120 giant tortoises. The eldest, Desmond, is 76 years old, according to Grimshaw in 2012. He named the tortoise after his godson. After 20 years of persistence, Grimshaw and his assistant Lafortune achieved their goal of making Moyenne Island a National Park in its own right, separate to that of the Ste. Anne marine park. Now known as the Moyenne Island National Park, it harbours more species per square foot than any other part of the world. The island is away from the main island of Mahe. Grimshaw died in Victoria, Mahe, in July 2012.

With Worcester R. Warner he co-founded the Warner & Swasey Company. ==Life and work== Swasey was born near Exeter, New Hampshire , p. 13 to Nathaniel and Abigail Swasey. He apprenticed as a machinist at the Exeter Machine Works and was afterwards employed at Pratt & Whitney. As his career progressed he became a foreman in the gear-cutting section. He developed a new technique for making gear-tooth cutters. In 1880 he and Warner formed their eponymous firm,, p. 19. which quickly moved to Cleveland, Ohio. Swasey would perform the engineering and machine development at this company. The close friends Warner and Swasey built their homes next to each other on Euclid Avenue in Cleveland, a street that was known as \\"Millionaire's Row\\". In addition to army ordnance contracts, the firm of Warner & Swasey became notable for their work on astronomical observatories and equipment. The founders were interested in astronomy as an avocation, and in the field's quest for better optical telescopes, which was burgeoning at the time. They also realized that obtaining contracts to build large astronomical observatories would provide publicity for their company. Swasey Observatory at Denison University In 1885 Swasey completed work at McCormick Observatory on the 45-foot dome, which was the largest in the world, and had a unique, 3 shutter design. In 1887 Swasey built the mount for the 36-inch refracting telescope at Lick Observatory. In 1898 he manufactured a dividing engine for the U.S. Naval Observatory that was used to make the meridian circles. Both the building and dome of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory were made by Warner and Swasey Co. Other observatory telescopes and components were built by the company at the Kenwood Observatory, Yerkes Observatory, Argentine National Observatory, the Swasey Observatory at Denison University, and the Case School of Applied Science Observatory. From 1904 until 1905 he was the president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. ==Legacy== Swasey Chapel at Denison University Swasey Hall in front of the statue of Sun Yat-sen at Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. Both Warner and Swasey were amateur astronomers. In 1920 they made a joint donation to the Case School of Applied Science to fund the construction of an observatory. This was named the Warner and Swasey Observatory in their honor, and the observatory was used for research by the Case astronomy department. The observatory maintained by the department today is still known by this name today. Swasey Hall (1917, \\"懷士堂\\"), a red brick hall, is the landmark of Sun Yat-sen University, one of the top colleges in China. It was named after Swasey for his USD$25000 donation to the then university Christian YMCA society hall. Now it serves as a conference hall. Other donations made by Swasey include the Swasey Chapel at Denison University in Granville, Ohio (1924), a bandstand in Exeter by architect Henry Bacon (1916), a library building to Colgate Rochester Divinity School and the endowment of a chair for a professor of physics at the Case School of Applied Sciences. The chimes in the chapel were included as a memorial to his wife, Lavinia Marston Swasey. Swasey died in Exeter and is buried in the Exeter Cemetery. The Warner & Swasey Company he cofounded would continue until 1980, when it was acquired by Bendix Corporation. ==Awards and honors== * The crater Swasey on the Moon is named after him, as is the asteroid 992 Swasey. * At CWRU, the chair of \\"Ambrose Swasey Professor of Physics\\" was named for his endowment.

In the words of historian Abbas Milani: \\"more than once in the tone of a jeremiad he reminded the nation of the dangers of clerical despotism, and of how the fascism of the mullahs would be darker than any military junta\\". He and his secretary were murdered in his home in Suresnes, near Paris by agents of the Islamic Republic. ==Early life== Bakhtiar was born on 26 June 1914 in southwestern Iran into a family of Iranian tribal nobility, the family of the paramount chieftains of the then powerful Bakhtiari tribe. His father was Mohammad Reza Khan (Sardar-e-Fateh), his mother Naz-Baygom, both Lurs and Bakhtiaris. Bakhtiar's maternal grandfather, Najaf-Gholi Khan Samsam ol- Saltaneh, had been appointed prime minister twice, in 1912 and 1918. Bakhtiar's mother died when he was seven years old. His father was executed by Reza Shah in 1934 while Shapour was studying in Paris. ==Education== He attended elementary school in Shahr-e Kord and then secondary school, first in Isfahan and later in Beirut, where he received his high school diploma from a French school. He attended Beirut University for two years. He and his cousin, Teymour Bakhtiar, then went to Paris for additional university education. There, he attended the College of Political Science. Being a firm opponent of totalitarian rule, he was active in the Spanish Civil War for the Second Spanish Republic against General Francisco Franco's fascism. In 1940, he volunteered for the French army– rather than the French Foreign Legion– and fought in the 30th Artillerie Regiment of Orléans. According to MEED, Bakhtiar did 18 months' military service. While living in Saint-Nicolas-du-Pélem, he fought with the French Resistance against the German occupation.Wolfgang Saxon (9 August 1991) \\"Shahpur Bakhtiar: Foe of Shah Hunted by Khomeini's Followers\\" New York Times, retrieved 6 July 2015 In 1945, he received his PhD in political science as well as degrees in law and philosophy from the Sorbonne. ==Political career== Shapour Bakhtiar Bakhtiar returned to Iran in 1946 and joined the social democratic Iran Party in 1949 and led its youth organization. In 1951 he was appointed director of the labor department in the Province of Isfahan by the ministry of labor. He later held the same position in Khuzestan, center of the oil industry. In 1951 Mohammad Mosaddeq had come to power in Iran. Under his premiership Bakhtiar was appointed deputy minister of labor in 1953. After the Shah was reinstated by a British-American sponsored coup d'état, Bakhtiar remained a critic of his rule. Shapour Bakhtiar and Mosaddegh cartoon in Ettelaat newspaper 22 January 1978 In the mid-1950s he was involved in underground activity against the Shah's regime, calling for the 1954 Majlis elections to be free and fair and attempting to revive the nationalist movement. In 1960, the Second National Front was formed and Bakhtiar played a crucial role in the new organization's activities as the head of the student activist body of the Front. He and his colleagues differed from most other government opponents in that they were very moderate, restricting their activity to peaceful protest and calling only for the restoration of democratic rights within the framework of a constitutional monarchy. The Shah refused to co-operate and outlawed the Front and imprisoned the most prominent liberals. From 1964 to 1977, the imperial regime refused to permit any form of opposition activity, even from moderate liberals like Bakhtiar. In the following years Bakhtiar was imprisoned repeatedly, a total of six years, for his opposition to the Shah. He was also one of the prominent members of central council of the illegal Fourth National Front in late 1977, when the group was reconstituted as the Union of National Front Forces with Bakhtiar as head of the Iran Party (the largest group in the Front). At the end of 1978 (as the Shah's power was crumbling), Bakhtiar was chosen to help in the creation of a civilian government to replace the existing military one. He was appointed to the position of Prime Minister by the Shah, as a concession to his opponents, especially the followers of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Although that caused him to be expelled from the National Front, he accepted the appointment, as he feared a revolution in which communists and mullahs would take over the country, which he thought would ruin Iran. In his 36 days as premier of Iran, Bakhtiar ordered all political prisoners to be freed, lifted censorship of newspapers (whose staff had until then been on strike), relaxed martial law, ordered the dissolving of SAVAK (the regime's secret police) and requested for the opposition to give him three months to hold elections for a constituent assembly that would decide the fate of the monarchy and determine the future form of government for Iran. Despite the conciliatory gestures, Khomeini refused to collaborate with Bakhtiar, denouncing the premier as a traitor for siding with the Shah, labeling his government \\"illegitimate\\" and \\"illegal\\" and calling for the overthrow of the monarchy. Bakhtiar was accused by some of making mistakes during his premiership such as allowing Khomeini to re-enter Iran. In the end, he failed to rally even his own former colleagues of the National Front. His government was overwhelmingly rejected by the masses except for a very small number of pro-Shah loyalists and a handful of moderate pro-democratic elements. The opposition was not willing to compromise. The Shah was forced to leave the country in January 1979; Bakhtiar left Iran again for France in April of the same year. ==French exile and series of assassination attempts== IRTV's Ali Limonadi interviews Shapour Bakhtiar in Paris 1984. Shortly after the revolution, Ayatollah Sadegh Khalkhali, a religious judge and later chairman of the Revolutionary Court, announced to the press that the death sentence had been passed on members of the Pahlavi family and former Shah officials, including Bakhtiar. In July 1979, Bakhtiar emerged in Paris. He was given political asylum there. From his base in Paris, he led the National Movement of Iranian Resistance, which fought the Islamic Republic from within the country. Between 9 and 10 July 1980, Bakhtiar helped organize a coup attempt known as the Nojeh coup plot, prompting the Islamic Republic to issue a death sentence on him. On 18 July 1980, he escaped an assassination attempt by a group of three attackers in his home in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris, in which a policeman and a neighbor were killed. The five-man assassination team led by Anis Naccache, a Lebanese, was captured. They were given life sentences, but French President François Mitterrand pardoned them in July 1990. They were sent to Tehran. ==Assassination== Tomb of Shapour Bakhtiar in France On 6 August 1991, Bakhtiar was murdered along with his secretary, Soroush Katibeh, by three assassins in his home in the Parisian suburb of Suresnes.

A serrated blade is a type of blade used on saws and on some knives or scissors. It is also known as a dentated, sawtooth, or toothed blade. A serrated blade has a cutting edge. By having less contact area than a smooth blade, the applied pressure at each point of contact is relatively greater and the points of contact are at a sharper angle to the material being cut. This causes a cutting action that involves many small splits in the surface of the material being cut, which cumulatively serve to cut the material along the line of the blade. Cuts made with a serrated blade are typically less smooth and precise than cuts made with a smooth blade. Serrated blades can be more difficult to sharpen using a whetstone or rotary sharpener than a non-serrated, however, they can be easily sharpened with a diamond. Serrated blades tend to stay sharper longer than a similar straight edged blade. A serrated blade has a faster cut but a plain edge has a cleaner cut. Some prefer a serrated blade on a pocket knife. ==References== Category:Cutting tools ","title":"Serrated blade"},{"id":"2585328","text":" The United States Coast Guard cutter Morgenthau (WHEC 722), was the eighth of twelve 378-foot dual-powered turbine/diesel high endurance cutters (WHECs) built by Avondale Shipyards in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Coast Guard commissioned the Morgenthau on March 10, 1969. After 48 years of continuous distinguished service the U.S. Coast Guard decommissioned the Morgenthau on April 18, 2017, and the ship was sold to Vietnam. On 27 May 2017 the Vietnam Coast Guard commissioned the former cutter as patrol craft CSB-8020. In the 1960s-1970s the \\"jet-powered\\" Hamilton-class cutters were state-of-the-art, technologically innovative, and the pride of the Coast Guard. In 2011 the Coast Guard acknowledged its Hamilton class cutters have far exceeded service life and proceeded with a planned phase-out the cutters and to replace them with National Security Cutters. In the 1960s the most distinctive aspect of these Hamilton-class cutters were the twin turbine engines capable of propelling the cutter from 0 to 30+ knots in 60 seconds (and with its large variable-pitch propellers, coming to a full stop equally fast). Moreover, due to the Cold War, Hamilton-class cutters were configured for anti-submarine warfare (ASW): including the ability to detect, track, and destroy submarines. Each 378' cutter had a helicopter flight deck, and retractable hangar within which to store a helicopter for missions. Other features noteworthy at the time included a variable-pitch propeller and bow thruster, allowing the ship to berth horizontally to a dock. As modern ships the cutters had comfortable crew and officer quarters, and the capability to stay at sea for 45 days. Over its distinguished 48-year career (1969-2017) Morgenthau received numerous awards, commendations, and unit citations, including a Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation in 1971 during the Vietnam War, Combat Action Ribbon to the 1971 Captain and crew, and multiple Battle \\"E\\" (Battle Effectiveness Award) for the ship's demonstrated excellence and superior achievement during certification and qualification competitions. The Morgenthau had two crests and unit motto (commonly referred to as \\"unit patches\\"). When commissioned, Morgenthau had a shield style crest, with the motto \\"Efficiency and Honor is Our Destiny.\\" When in 1977 Morgenthau moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and homeported in Alameda, the crest changed to a circular style with the Latin motto ' (although the Latin word ' can have different meanings, the US Coast Guard translates the motto as \\"Pride of the Pacific\\"). ==Historical Summary== When commissioned in 1969, Morgenthau homeported at Governors Island, New York. From 1970 to 1971 the Morgenthau served in Vietnam, a participant in the U.S. Navy's Operation Market Time. In 1977 Morgenthau moved to the Pacific side of the United States and homeported at Integrated Support Command Alameda, Coast Guard Island, Alameda, California. The cutter homeported in Alameda until December 2012. In January 2013 Morgenthau sailed to her new homeport in Honolulu, Hawaii after a December 13, 2012, hull swap with the crew of the , Jarvis slated for decommissioning and transfer to a foreign navy. (In naval terminology a \\"hull swap\\" is an operation where the entire crew of a ship transfers from one ship to another similar ship.) In 2016 the U.S. Coast Guard announced that on April 18, 2017, the Morgenthau would be decommissioned from its home port in Honolulu, Hawaii. On April 18, 2017, USCGC Morgenthau was decommissioned at the Coast Guard Station, Sand Island, Honolulu, Hawaii. Post decommissioning: After removal of classified equipment and specified weaponry the Morgenthau was designated for purchase by Vietnam. The United States transferred the Morgenthau to the Vietnam Coast Guard on 28 May 2017, pursuant to the Excess Defense Articles program. Vietnam has commissioned the ship as CSB 8020. == Replacement by National Security Cutters; Transfer to Foreign Navies== Hamilton-class cutters underwent Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (\\"FRAM\\") through the early 1990s. Consistent with long-term planning, the Morgenthau and her 11 sister Hamilton-class cutters are gradually being replaced by the 418-foot Legend-class National Security Cutter (nine total). The Coast Guard stated the National Security Cutters are better equipped, have a reduced radar signature, and are more durable, safer, and efficient than the 1960s Hamilton-class ships. Compare Morgenthau with , a National Security Cutter homeported in Alameda, California. At the end of 2016 five National Security Cutters are in active service, and an additional four NSCs are under construction at Ingalls Shipbuilding (NSCs Hamilton, James, and Munro). In June 2013 the US Coast Guard awarded an option contract to procure materials for construction of the Coast Guard's seventh National Security Cutter, the NSC Kimball. Under the Foreign Military Sales, Foreign Assistance Act, or other programs, decommissioned Hamilton-class cutters are made available for purchase or transfer to foreign navies. As of February 2017 various cutters have been decommissioned with subsequent transfer to foreign navies: to Nigerian Navy as NNS Thunder (F90); to Nigerian Navy as NNS Okpabana (F93); to Philippine Navy as ; to Bangladesh Navy as ; to Philippine Navy as .;; to Philippine Navy as ; to Bangladesh Navy as BNS Somudra Avijan (F-29); and the USCGC Morgenthau (WHEC-722) to the Vietnam Coast Guard as the CSB 8020. Once acquired, some navies have designated the cutter a flagship; some receive significant rearmament, including missiles, radar guided cannons, radar, sonar, and ASW weaponry. For example, see the list of ships of the Bangladesh Navy: the BNS Somudra Joy will be armed with modern C-802A anti- ship-missiles, FM-90N SAM, torpedoes, and an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter. Also see discussion regarding the Philippine Navy's Hamilton-class acquisitions, of which the nation in 2017 has three Hamilton-class cutters. == Operational Highlights: 1970-71 (Vietnam War) == Soon after its commissioning in 1970 the Morgenthau sailed to Vietnam for service in the US Navy's Operation Market Time. Morgenthau was extremely active in the Vietnam War: the Cutter's duties included boarding and inspection of North Vietnamese and Viet Cong ships and boats suspected of running guns, ammunition and supplies, naval gunfire support missions to the U.S. Army and U.S. Marines, the Cutter's crew providing medical care to Vietnamese villagers (MEDCAPS - civic action program), ferrying (Navy SEALs) on missions, and general 24/7 patrol duties. When on Operation Market Time patrol in Vietnam waters close to shore, on powering up to full speed the Morgenthau struck an uncharted pinnacle. The Cutter suffered significant damage, mainly to its large-bladed propellers that struck the pinnacle with such force that two several-ton propeller blades ripped off their mounts, flew 30 feet into the air, and then crashed into the water. Thinking they were under attack, Captain Lloyd Logan quickly ordered general quarters sounded. Dead in the water, concerned about ambush, and that his ship was a \\"sitting duck,\\" Captain Logan had his crew look busy on decks conducting maintenance and operations, to make it appear as if the ship anchored in the water was planned. Captain Logan further ordered the ship's guns manned at all times, and the ship's two heavily armed small boats to be at the ready for launching. U.S. Navy gunboat USS Antelope patrolled around the Morgenthau to provide additional firepower in the event the cutter was ambushed. After a few days a seagoing U.S. Navy tug towed the disabled Morgenthau to the large U.S. Navy shipyard and base located at Subic Bay, Philippines. The cutter underwent a month in drydock for repairs, after which the Morgenthau returned to duty in Vietnam. From records compiled by then- Lieutenant Eugene N. Tulich, Commander, US Coast Guard (Ret), Morgenthaus Vietnam numbers included: Miles cruised - ; Percentage time underway - 72.8%; Junks/sampans detected/inspected/boarded - 2383/627/63; Enemy confirmed killed in action (KIA) 14; Structures destroyed/damaged - 32/37; Bunkers destroyed/damaged - 12/3; Waterborne craft destroyed/damaged - 7/3; Naval Gunfire Support Missions (NGFS) - 19; MEDCAPS (Medical Civic Action Program) - 25; Patients treated - 2676. For exceptionally valorous action in combat, Morgenthau received a number of awards and commendations, including a Navy Unit Commendation when Morgenthau distinguished itself with outstanding heroism in action against the enemy. Morgenthau's actions included its multi- day stealth tracking of a 160 foot enemy ship U.S. intelligence services identified as a disguised as fishing vessel (SL-8 trawler) attempting to resupply North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong waiting on shore; and for the April 11, 1971, total destruction of that enemy ship when Morgenthau and other U.S. Navy forces engaged in a two-hour battle against the ship, ending when SL-8 trawler suffered a massive explosion that killed all enemy combatants and resulted in the ship disappearing from Morganthau's radar screens. For this and other Vietnam service, the Morgenthau and its crew were awarded the Navy Combat Action Ribbon; Navy Unit Commendation; Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation; Vietnam Service Medal; Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm device; Vietnam Civil Actions Unit Citation; Vietnam Campaign Medal; and other awards. Morgenthau served in Vietnam until relieved from Vietnam service in August 1971 by the , a 311-foot . == Operational Highlights: 1972 to 2017 == In 1977, Morgenthau became the first Coast Guard cutter to have women permanently assigned, followed shortly thereafter by . Morgenthaus Pacific coast activities have included drug interdiction and seizures, foreign and domestic fisheries enforcement, search and rescue, and alien migrant interdiction. In 1989, Morgenthau was decommissioned to undergo a major mid-life renovation under the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM). The cutter's FRAM included updating berthing and living spaces, rejuvenating engineering systems, and updating/modernizing major weapons and sensors. Upon recommissioning in 1991, Morgenthau resumed missions in the Pacific Ocean. In the fall of 1996, Morgenthau was the first US Coast Guard Cutter to deploy to the Persian Gulf. Participating in Operation Vigilant Sentinel, Morgenthau enforced Iraq's compliance with United Nations sanctions. After returning from the Persian Gulf, Morgenthau continued her Pacific duties, often deploying to the Maritime Boundary Line in the Bering Straits to monitor Alaska's valuable fisheries and environmental resources, as well as continued alien migrant and drug interdiction efforts off the coasts of Guam and Central and South America. In early 2001 while on drug interdiction patrol off the coast of Mexico, Morgenthau seized $32 million worth of cocaine. Also in 2001, during a fisheries patrol, Morgenthau's deployed helicopter discovered a Russian vessel fishing in US waters. When the vessel refused to heave to and allow a Coast Guard law enforcement team aboard, Morgenthau pursued the vessel across the Bering Sea and up to Russian territorial seas. This resulted in a joint US- Russian law enforcement action, which further cemented cooperative law enforcement actions between the two nations. Morgenthau in May 2007 sailing out to sea under the Golden Gate Bridge Later in 2001, during an extensive dry-dock period, Morgenthau was the first 378-foot cutter to install a stern flap, improving fuel efficiency and ride quality. Because of the increased fuel efficiency, Morgenthau has never since been able to complete full-power trials on turbines, as she reaches her maximum speed at a shaft horsepower significantly lower than other ships in her class. After the terrorist attacks on September 11th, Morgenthau participated in Operation Noble Eagle to safeguard America's prominent port cities through closer scrutiny of maritime traffic. In 2002, Morgenthau traveled to Southeast Asia to assist, train, and teach law enforcement techniques to naval forces of several nations in the East Asian littoral. In November 2010, Morgenthau provided an emergency escort along with medical and security assistance to passengers stranded aboard the cruise ship Carnival Splendor, which was rendered inoperable in the Pacific Ocean by an engine fire. In January 2013 Morgenthau arrived in its new home port in Honolulu, Hawaii. Morgenthau replaced Hamilton-class cutter , the Jarvis having been decommissioned from the U.S. fleet, and transferred to the Bangladesh Navy under the Foreign Military Sales program. In February 2015 \\"Morgenthau\\" entered dry-dock in Alameda, CA at Bay Ship & Yacht Co. for repairs On April 18, 2017, the Morgenthau was decommissioned at its home port in Honolulu, Hawaii. The Coast Guard announced the Morgenthau will be acquired by Vietnam. The Coast Guard transferred Morgenthau to the Viet Nam Coast Guard in a ceremony held in Honolulu on May 25, 2017. Viet Nam commissioned the ship as patrol craft CSB-8020.

The impulse for the day came from the Latin American Federation of Associations for Relatives of Detained-Disappeared (Federación Latinoamericana de Asociaciones de Familiares de Detenidos-Desaparecidos, or FEDEFAM), a non- governmental organization founded in 1981 in Costa Rica as an association of local and regional groups actively working against secret imprisonment, forced disappearances and abduction in a number of Latin-American countries. Work on secret imprisonment is an important part of the activities for a number of international bodies and organizations in the fields of human rights activism and humanitarian aid, including for example Amnesty International (AI), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The International Day of the Disappeared is an opportunity to highlight these institutions' work, increase public awareness, and to call for donations and volunteers. Of those agencies, the ICRC has additional privileges due to its special status as a non-governmental sovereign entity and its strict policy of neutrality. In some cases, the ICRC is the only institution granted access to specific groups of prisoners, thereby enabling a minimum level of contact and inspection of their treatment. For affected families, messages transmitted by the ICRC are often the only hint about the fate of these prisoners. Visiting those detained in relation to conflicts and enabling them to restore and maintain contact with their families, is a very important part of the ICRC's mandate. But the definition of the Missing or the Disappeared goes far beyond the victims of enforced disappearance. It includes all those whose families have lost contact as the result of conflicts, natural disasters or other tragedies. These missing may be detained, stranded in foreign countries, hospitalized or dead. Through its tracing services and working with the 189 national Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world, the ICRC seeks to obtain information about their fate on behalf of their families. It reminds governments and other groups of their obligations to respect the families' right to know the fate of their loved ones. It also works with families of the missing to help them address their particular psychological, social legal and financial needs.Families of missing people need better support Imprisonment under secret or uncertain circumstances is a grave violation of some conceptions of human rights as well as, in the case of an armed conflict, of International Humanitarian Law. The General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance as resolution 47/133 on December 18, 1992. It is estimated that secret imprisonment is practiced in about 30 countries. The OHCHR Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has registered about 46,000 cases of people who disappeared under unknown circumstances. On August 30, 2007, hundreds of Philippine relatives and supporters of desaparecidos, mostly activists, missing after being abducted or killed by Philippine security forces protested against the government to mark International Day of the Disappeared. Edita Burgos remembered her missing son, Jonas, a member of the Peasants' Movement of the Philippines. ITH, Hundreds protest in Philippines against abductions On August 30, 2008 the International Coalition against Enforced Disappearances, which gathers family member organizations and human rights organizations from around the world, joined hands for a global campaign event to promote the ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. ==External links== * Missing persons and international humanitarian law, ICRC * AFAD Asian Federation Against Involuntary Disappearances * AFAD Asian Federation Against Involuntary Disappearances Blog * International Coalition against Enforced Disappearances * OHCHR – Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances * Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance * International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) * The missing – A major ICRC initiative * FEDEFAM – Fighting Against Forced Disappearances in Latin America * Amnesty International - Work on Enforced Disappearances ==References== Category:Civil awareness days Category:August observances Category:Human rights Category:Forced disappearance ","title":"International Day of the Disappeared"},{"id":"2585355","text":"__NOTOC__ Abraham \\"Abba\\" Ptachya Lerner (also Abba Psachia Lerner;The London Gazette (8 November 1935)New York Passenger Lists 28 October 1903 – 27 October 1982) was a Russian-born British economist.

Lerner grew up in a Jewish family, which emigrated to Great Britain when Lerner was three years old. Lerner grew up in London's East End and from age 16 worked as a machinist, a teacher in Hebrew schools, and as an entrepreneur. In 1929, Lerner entered the London School of Economics, where he studied under Friedrich Hayek. A six-month stay at Cambridge in 1934–1935 brought him into contact with John Maynard Keynes. In 1937, Lerner emigrated to the United States. Lerner never stayed at one institution long, serving on the faculties of nearly a dozen universities and accepting over 20 visiting appointments. Lerner was 62 when he was given a professorship at the University of California, Berkeley in 1965 and left after reaching mandatory retirement age six years later. During his time there, Lerner criticized the unrest caused by the student Free Speech Movement as a threat to academic freedom. Although Lerner never received the Sveriges Riksbank's Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, he has been recognized as one of the greatest economists of his era. Fundamental economic \\"concepts, theorems and rules\\" were derived and/or furthered by Lerner's work throughout his academic career. == Activities == * Lerner developed a model of market socialism which featured decentralised market pricing proportional to marginal social costAbba P.

Thus, the vision that monetary and fiscal policy should be used as a balance wheel, which forms a key element in the textbook policy revolution, deserves to be called Lernerian rather than Keynesian.\\" * The Lerner symmetry theorem states that an import tariff can have the same effects as an export tax.Abba P.

He also played 28 Test matches for England. He was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1967. An outstanding schoolboy cricketer at Ruthin School, Barber initially struggled to gain a place whilst at Cambridge after making his debut in 1955. Scoring 1000 runs for the first time in 1959, Barber was made captain of Lancashire. Hampered by an intrusive committee and hostile crowd,WISDEN 1960-2 Barber was perceived as not making the best of his own abilities, particularly as a leg spinner, though in a team boasting Test leg spinner Tommy Greenhough and useful allrounders in Grieves and Booth, both of whom were wrist spinners, Barber found it difficult to earn a place. He was replaced by Joe Blackledge in 1962, who met with no greater success as the county endured a difficult season. Joining Warwickshire, Barber was encouraged to play his shots and began to play regularly for England as an opening batsman. His greatest innings, and his only Test century, was made in the Third Test against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1965–66. He made 185 off 255 balls and added 234 in even time with Geoff Boycott for the first wicket. It remains the highest score by an Englishman on the opening day of an Ashes Test. E.W.

In common with the crumhorn and cornamuse, it is a wooden double-reed instrument with the reed enclosed in a windcap. The player blows into a slot in the top of the windcap to produce the sound. This instrument, for reasons given below, should be more correctly referred to as \\"Schreierpfeife.\\" ==Description== Rauschpfeifes (Schreierpfeiffen) differ from cornamusen mainly in the shape of the bore, which, like the shawm, is conical. This bore profile combined with the unrestricted vibration of the reed within the windcap produced an instrument that was exceedingly loud, which made it useful for outdoor performances. The word Rauschpfeife (German for \\"rush (or reed) pipe\\" from the Old German \\"rusch\\" for 'rush', as in grass), is found in the description of two windcapped instruments depicted in one of the 16th-century woodcut illustrations of Triumphal Procession, commissioned by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. The 20th century music historian Curt Sachs believed these were the same as the capped shawms found in several European museums although their appearance is somewhat different from the extant examples. However, the instruments in the woodcut could just as easily be cylindrical bore capped douçaine-like instruments, especially considering the array of other soft instruments (viola da gamba, harp, viola da braccio, two lutes, pipe and tabor) in the picture. It seems most likely that the term \\"rauschpfeife\\" was used to denote woodwind instruments in general: for example, an order placed for instruments by the Nuremberg town council in 1538 indicated a need for 'rauschpfeiffen', but when the order was filled, it included recorders, cornetts, shawms and other instruments, but none specifically named 'rauschpfeife'.* Barra Boydell. \\"Rauschpfeife\\", Grove Music Online, ed. L. Macy (accessed February 8, 2006), grovemusic.com (subscription access). The names associated in the period with the extant museum capped shawms are variants of the word \\"Schreierpfeife\\" (German for \\"shrieking pipe\\".) Michael Praetorius in Syntagma musicum II (1619) gives \\"Schreyerpfeiffen\\" as the German word for Schryari, which, judging by his description, ranges and illustration, were cylindrical bore instruments something akin to loud cornamusen. It would appear then that the term \\"Schreierpfeife\\" may have been used variously for the two types of loud capped reed instruments. Consorts of rauschpfeiffen (schreierpfeiffen) are found in museum instrument collections in Berlin and Prague. A complete set of original instruments, ranging from sopranino to bass, from the second half of the 17th century is part of the so- called Naumburg wind instrument collection, which is on display in the Berlin Music Instrument Museum. Another solitary example is found in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. A similar instrument, the hautbois de poitou, is depicted and described by Marin Mersenne in his \\"Harmonie universelle\\" (1636.) As with many instruments of this period and genre, the rauschpfeife or schreierpfeife has undergone something of a revival in recent decades. Examples are currently being made and played by early music enthusiasts worldwide. German Heinrich Moeck company produced two instruments in sopranino and soprano which visually refer to the Naumburg pipes. Because for quite some time, Moeck was the only manufacturer in Germany to produce rauschpfeifes in large numbers, the look of the rauschpfeifes in the 1970s was characterized by this manufacturer. The rauschpfeifes in Berlin are technically almost twice as large as they need to be. The tone holes of the instruments cover only half of the body. Because of this, Moeck's instruments have a large number of holes on the back, which serve solely to shorten and stabilize the air column inside the instrument. After Moeck discontinued the production of rauschpfeifen, manufacturers based their instruments on the chanters of German bagpipes. The vast majority of the instruments are built in open, German recorder fingering system, and have a tonal range of a ninth. Their appearance is also similar to the chanter of the contemporary German bagpipe. As a result, many newly built rauschpfeifes have significantly larger bells than their historical ancestors. In addition, although having the same musical range, they are not quite half as long as the extant instruments of the Naumburg collection. A further technical aspect is that modern instruments mainly use standard reeds from various kinds of bagpipes. The alto instruments in G/a are often played with Scottish reeds, the instruments based on French bagpipes often with plastic reeds for the Cornemuse du Centre, and the soprano rauschpfeifes in C/d often with reeds similar to those of the Spanish gaita.*Nicolai Semmler:\\"Rauschpfeife\\" at the Folkfriends Online Glossary (accessed Jan.31st, 2017) en.folkfriends.com Sopranino and soprano rauschpfeifes Sopranino rauschpfeife with windcap removed ==References== ==External links== * City of Lincoln Waites (The Mayor of Lincoln's own Band of Musick) Category:Double-reed instruments Category:Renaissance music Category:Early musical instruments ","title":"Rauschpfeife"},{"id":"2585385","text":"Homologous temperature expresses the thermodynamic temperature of a material as a fraction of the thermodynamic temperature of its melting point (e.g. using the Kelvin scale): T_H = \\\\frac{T (\\\\text{K})}{T_{mp} (\\\\text{K})} For example, the homologous temperature of lead at room temperature (25 °C) is approximately 0.50 (TH = T/Tmp = 298 K/601 K = 0.50). == Significance of the homologous temperature == The homologous temperature of a substance is useful for determining the rate of steady state creep (diffusion dependent deformation). A higher homologous temperature results in an exponentially higher rate of diffusion dependent deformation. Additionally, for a given fixed homologous temperature, two materials with different melting points would have similar diffusion-dependent deformation behaviour. For example, solder (Tmp = 456 K) at 115 °C would have comparable mechanical properties to copper (Tmp = 1358 K) at 881 °C, because they would both be at 0.85Tmp despite being at different absolute temperatures. In electronics applications, where circuits typically operate over a −55 °C to +125 °C range, eutectic tin-lead (Sn63) solder is working at 0.48Tmp to 0.87Tmp. The upper temperature is high relative to the melting point; from this we can deduce that solder will have limited mechanical strength (as a bulk material) and significant creep under stress. This is borne out by its comparatively low values for tensile strength, shear strength and modulus of elasticity. Copper, on the other hand, has a much higher melting point, so foils are working at only 0.16Tmp to 0.29Tmp and their properties are little affected by temperature. ==References== Category:Units of temperature ","title":"Homologous temperature"},{"id":"2585389","text":"The name Bryza is associated with: * Matthew Bryza - a United States diplomat * PZL M28B Bryza - a Polish STOL light maritime patrol, cargo and passenger plane ","title":"Bryza"},{"id":"2585397","text":"Arthur Zborzil (15 July 1885 - 15 October 1937) was a male tennis player from Austria.

The Upper Valais was loosely allied with the Swiss, especially with Bern. The Lower Valais (the western, lowlands of the valley) were inhabited by French speakers under the power of the Dukes of Savoy. During the early and mid 15th century conflicts between the Upper Valais and Lower Valais often led to fighting. In 1446 Bern and Savoy signed a peace treaty, though border conflicts over the following decades damaged the agreement. In 1473 Duchess Yolande of Savoy embargoed Bern. ==The battle== In 1475 Bern invaded Vaud, a Savoy province, and signed an alliance with the Upper Valais on 7 September 1475. With Bernese support the Upper Valais prepared for war. Led by the Bishop of Sion Walter Supersaxo the Upper Valais forces began attacking Savoy holdings. A Savoy counterattack in early November threatened the city of Sion. On 13 November the Bishop's forces together with unexpected reinforcements from Saanen, the Simmental, Fribourg, and Solothurn defeated the Savoy counterattack near Conthey to the west of Sion. ==Aftermath== Following the Savoy defeat at the battle, the bishop's army marched west conquering the Lower Valais as far as Saint-Maurice and capturing a total of 17 Savoyard castles. The towns of Conthey and Saint-Maurice were garrisoned by Bern and Fribourg and Savoy was cut off from Italy. In 1477, the bishop annexed much of the Lower Valais, though it was not accepted by Savoy until 1528.

It is now part of Amtrak's high-speed Northeast Corridor. ==History== Prior to the building of the NYP&B;, travelers between New York City and Boston had to pass around Point Judith, Rhode Island and its rough waters to reach the Boston and Providence Railroad in Providence. The B&P; was completed in 1835 and began operating the steamer Lexington between Providence and New York, adding the Massachusetts in 1836.George W. Hilton, The Night Boat, p. 65. Berkeley, Calif.: Howell-North Books, 1968. The New York and Stonington Railroad was chartered in Connecticut in May 1832 and the New York, Providence and Boston Railroad in Rhode Island in June of that year to fix the problem. On July 1, 1833 they consolidated to form a new New York, Providence and Boston Railroad. Ground was broken by the subsidiary Providence and Stonington RailroadHilton, p. 65. at Stonington, Connecticut on August 14, 1833. On November 17, 1837 the line opened between Stonington and a pier at South Providence, about 1 mile downriver from the city center. At Stonington docks connected to steamboats to New York City through Long Island Sound, and later to the Long Island Rail Road at Greenport, New York, opened July 29, 1844. At Providence, a short car float across the Providence River led to the docks of the Boston and Providence Railroad at India Point in Providence, where travelers could continue on to Boston. Steamboat service from New York to Stonington commenced in November 1837 under the Boston and New York Transportation company, which was soon succeeded by the New Jersey Steam Navigation Company. On January 13, 1840, the latter company's steamer Lexington burned and sank with a loss of 140 lives; there were only four survivors.Hilton, p. 65. On May 1, 1848, the NYP&B; opened an alignment to the new Union Station in Providence, where it connected directly to both the newly opened Providence and Worcester Railroad and the new main line for the Boston and Providence Railroad. This provided direct connections from Stonington to both Boston and Worcester and locations in between. The B&P;'s old alignment was kept as a branch to transport passengers and freight to and from the pier at India Point in Providence for transfer to and from the steam boats to New York City and other points as far south as Galveston, TX. Trade in raw cotton moving north to New England textile mills, and finished goods moving south from New England factories remained strong until the Great Depression. On November 1, 1859 the NYP&B; leased the New Haven, New London and Stonington Railroad, less than a year after its completion, giving it a line from Providence to New Haven, Connecticut, though with two ferries - across the Thames River at New London and across the Connecticut River. The terminal for steamboats connecting to the Long Island Rail Road was moved to Groton, on the east shore of the Thames River. In 1864, the NYP&B; purchased the NHNL&S; line east of Groton; the remainder was leased by the New York and New Haven Railroad in 1870. During the 1860s, service between New York and Stonington was provided by the Merchants' Steamship Company. This concern suspended service after suffering heavy losses in three disasters: the burning of the steamer Commonwealth on December 29, 1865; the grounding, and recovery at great expense, of the steamer Plymouth Rock in January 1866; and the wreck of the steamer Commodore on December 27, 1866.Hilton, p. 66. In 1868 the Stonington Line revived the New York-Stonington steamship operation by organizing the subsidiary Stonington Steamship Company, which placed in service the steamers Stonington and Narragansett. A third vessel, the Rhode Island, was built in 1873.Hilton, p. 66. The Stonington Steamship Company merged in 1875 with the Providence and New York Steamship Company, primarily a freight carrier between the two named ports, to form the Providence and Stonington Steamship Company. The Rhode Island was assigned to the New York-Providence route, joined in 1877 by a new steamer, the Massachusetts. On June 11, 1880, the Narragansett and Stonington collided in heavy fog, causing the Narragansett to catch fire and burn with a loss of 30 lives. Also in 1880, the Rhode Island was wrecked, but her engine was salvaged and was installed in a new steamer of the same name, built in 1882.Hilton, p. 66. In 1889 a bridge was built across the Thames River, connecting the two segments and completing the all-rail Shore Line. The steamship operation was augmented in 1889 with the construction of the steamer Connecticut for the Providence route. All the foregoing steamers had been paddlers, but in 1892 the propellers Maine and New Hampshire were built for the Stonington route.Hilton, pp. 66-67. During 1892 the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad acquired the NYP&B;, merging it on February 13, 1893. The New Haven discontinued the New York-Stonington steamship route in 1900, ending the existence of the Providence and Stonington Steamship Company. A New Haven subsidiary, the New England Steamship Company, continued the New York- Providence route with various steamers until May 1937.Hilton, p. 67. In 1969 Penn Central absorbed the NYNH&H.; Penn Central went bankrupt in June 1970, and was merged into Conrail in 1976, but the old NYP&B; main line was sold to Amtrak (in Connecticut) and the state of Rhode Island. It now hosts Amtrak's Acela Express high-speed trains and Northeast Regional conventional service. The MBTA's Providence/Stoughton Line was extended in 2010 over the old NYP&B; past Providence to a new station at T. F. Green Airport in Warwick, Rhode Island; the line was further extended in 2012 to its current southern terminus at Wickford Junction in North Kingstown. There is a proposal to extend the line once more to the current Amtrak station in Kingston. ==Branches== ;Groton When the bridge over the Thames River to New London, Connecticut opened in 1889, the old line to the docks was kept as a branch. ;Westerly Granite Quarry The Westerly Granite Quarry Proprietor's Railroad, a short branch in Westerly, Rhode Island, was operated by the NYP&B.; ;Wood River The Wood River Branch Railroad, a branch from Richmond Switch north to Hope Valley, opened in 1874 and was operated by the NYP&B.; ;Narragansett Pier The Narragansett Pier Railroad opened in 1876 from Kingston east to Narragansett Pier, and was independently owned and operated by the Hazard Family to service their textile mills. ;Wickford The Newport and Wickford Railroad and Steamboat Company was a branch from Wickford Junction east to Wickford, Rhode Island, where a connecting steamship service crossed the Narragansett Bay to Newport.

It provided a branch from Auburn, Rhode Island southwest to Pontiac. The Pawtuxet Valley Railroad opened in 1874 as a leased branch of the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad from River Point northwest to Hope. In 1884 the lease was transferred to the NYP&B; and a connection was built between the Pontiac Branch at Pontiac and River Point. ;Warwick The Warwick Railroad opened in 1875 as a branch from Auburn southeast into Warwick. It became the Rhode Island Central Railroad in 1879, and later became part of a street railway. The line was purchased by the Providence and Worcester in 1982 and shut down permanently a few years later when a trucking company which was the last remaining customer ended operations. ;South Providence The old main line to the docks south of downtown Providence, Rhode Island was kept when the new alignment to downtown opened in 1848. This line is currently owned and operated by the Providence and Worcester. Several times a month, 80 car unit trains transport ethanol from producers in the Midwest to the Motiva Enterprises facility on the Providence waterfront for local use as well as for transfer to ocean-going tankers. It has also been used in recent years for the movement of imported coal from the Port of Providence to various power plants in New England and even Upstate New York. ==See also== * List of New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad precursors ==References== *George W.

As the city continued to grow, so too did the need for terminal space, ultimately resulting in the paving over of the remnants of the city's inland bay in 1890.

Grandson belonged to Charles' ally Jacques de Savoie, and the place had been brutally taken by the Swiss the previous year. Charles brought a large mercenary army with him together with many heavy cannon, and the Swiss garrison soon feared, after the effectiveness of the bombardment was demonstrated, that they would be killed when their fortress was stormed. The Swiss, under heavy pressure from the canton of Bern, organized an army to come to the garrison's relief. A boat approached the garrison with the news that an army was coming to its relief, but the vessel was unable to approach the fortress closely for fear that it would be hit by Burgundian cannons. The men in the boat gestured to the defenders in the fortress to inform them that help was on the way, but their gestures were misunderstood, and the garrison decided to surrender. == Execution of the garrison of Grandson == Swiss sources are unanimous in stating that the men only gave up when Charles assured them they would be spared. The historian Panigarola, who was with Charles, claimed that the garrison had thrown themselves on the mercy of the duke, and it was up to his discretion what to do with them. He ordered all 412 men of the garrison to be executed. In a scene Panigarola described as \\"shocking and horrible\\" and sure to fill the Swiss with dread, all the victims were led past the tent of Charles on 28 February 1476 and hanged from trees, or drowned in the lake, in an execution that lasted four hours. == Battle of Grandson == Illustration of the Battle of Grandson by Diebold Schilling the Younger (1513) Pillage of the Burgundian camp after the Battle of Grandson, illustration by Diebold Schilling the Elder (1483) The booty of Grandson put on display in Lucerne, illustration by Diebold Schilling the Younger (1513) The Swiss had no news of the fate of the garrison and assembled their forces in the hope of lifting the siege. This army numbered a little over 20,000 men without artillery and probably slightly outnumbered the Burgundians. On 2 March 1476 the Swiss army approached the forces of Charles near the town of Concise. The Swiss advanced in three heavy columns, echeloned to the left rear, moving directly into combat without deploying, in typical Swiss fashion. Poor reconnaissance left Charles uninformed as to the size and deployment of the Swiss, and he believed that the Swiss vanguard was the entire force sent against him. The vanguard, consisting mainly of men from Schwyz, Bern, and Solothurn, realized they would soon be in battle and knelt to pray. When they said three Our Fathers and three Hail Marys, some of the Burgundian army reportedly mistook their actions as a sign of submission. In their zeal, they rode forward shouting, \\"You will get no mercy; you must all die.\\" The Burgundian knights soon surrounded the Swiss vanguard, but then Charles made a serious mistake. After brief skirmishing, Charles ordered his cavalry to pull back so the artillery could reduce the Swiss forces before the attacks were renewed. At this time, the main body of the Swiss emerged from a forest which had hitherto obscured their approach. The Burgundian army, already pulling back, soon became confused when the second, and larger, body of Swiss troops appeared. The speed of the Swiss advance did not give the Burgundians time to make much use of their artillery and missile units. Charles attempted a double envelopment of the leading Swiss column before the other two arrived, but as his troops were caught shifting to make this attack, they caught sight of the other Swiss columns and retreated in panic. The withdrawal soon turned into a rout when the Burgundian army broke ranks and ran. For a time, Charles rode among them shouting orders for them to stop and hitting fleeing soldiers with the flat of his sword. But once started the rout was unstoppable, and Charles was forced to flee as well. Few casualties were suffered on either side: the Swiss did not have the cavalry necessary to chase the Burgundians far. At insignificant cost to themselves, the Swiss had humiliated the greatest duke in Europe, defeated one of the most feared armies, and taken a most impressive amount of treasure. Charles had the habit of travelling to battles with an array of priceless artifacts as talismans, from carpets belonging to Alexander the Great, to the 55-carat Sancy diamond, and the Three Brothers jewel. All these were looted from his tent by the confederate army, together with his silver bath and ducal seal. The Swiss initially had little idea of the value of their loot. A small surviving part of this fantastic booty is on display in various Swiss museums today, while a few remaining artillery pieces can be seen in the museum of La Neuveville, near Neuchâtel, Switzerland.Florens Deuchler, Die Burgunderbeute, q.v. == Aftermath == After the battle, the Swiss troops came upon the bodies of their countrymen still hanging from trees. An eyewitness, Peterman Etterlin, described the scene: Charles had attempted to break the will of the Swiss by killing any of their countrymen he could apprehend.

Along with nearby Chef Menteur Pass, the Rigolets connects Lake Pontchartrain and Lake St. Catherine in Louisiana to Lake Borgne, and then to the Gulf of Mexico. It forms the boundary between New Orleans (Orleans Parish) and St. Tammany Parish. ==Tidal pass== As a deepwater tidal pass, the Rigolets helps supply salt water from the Gulf to Lake Pontchartrain. Tidal scouring has produced a deep pit in the lake at the western mouth of the strait. Since the Rigolets is a channel through which Gulf storm surges can approach the New Orleans area, there have been proposals to construct floodgates to try to protect the city, especially since the destructiveness of hurricanes in the early 21st century. ==Fort Pike== Fort Pike Citadel. The United States constructed Fort Pike following the War of 1812 to protect passage on the Rigolets. The fort was abandoned in 1890 when it was no longer considered necessary. ==Bridges== The Rigolets is spanned by two bridges. The western terminus of the U.S. Route 90 Rigolets Bridge is located immediately north of Fort Pike. It was damaged by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, and required major repairs. Farther south, the CSX Railroad crosses the Rigolets on a 1,388-meter (4,555-ft) railroad bridge.

A trough is an elongated (extended) region of relatively low atmospheric pressure, often associated with fronts.F. J. Monkhouse. A Dictionary of Geography. London: Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd., 1978 Troughs may be at the surface, or aloft, or both under various conditions. Most troughs bring clouds, showers, and a wind shift, particularly following the passage of the trough. This results from convergence or \\"squeezing\\" which forces lifting of moist air behind the trough line. Unlike fronts, there is not a universal symbol for a trough on a weather chart. The weather charts in some countries or regions mark troughs by a line. In the United States, a trough may be marked as a dashed line or bold line. In the UK, Hong KongThe Hong Kong Observatory, Weather Map at 08 HKT and Fiji, it is represented by a bold line extended from a low pressure center or between two low pressure centers; in MacauWeather Chart and Australia, it is a dashed line. If they are not marked, troughs may still be identified as an extension of isobars away from a low pressure center. == Description == A very large trough (about 8000 km or more) crosses the North Atlantic Ocean from north east to south west. The elongated cloud is surrounded by two big areas of higher atmospheric pressure, clearly shown with no clouds at all. A trough is not in a general terms a boundary, but an elongated area of lower air pressure. There are changes in wind direction across a trough but there is no change in air mass. While not specifically a surface boundary, troughs reflect the change in atmospheric conditions in the upper atmosphere. As such, troughs can be areas where showers and thunderstorms can form. If a trough forms in the mid-latitudes, a temperature difference at some distance between the two sides of the trough usually exists and the trough might become a weather front at some point. However such a weather front is usually less convective than a trough in the tropics or subtropics (such as a tropical wave). Inversely, sometimes collapsed frontal systems will degenerate into troughs. Sometimes the region between two high pressure centers may also assume the character of a trough when there is a detectable wind shift noted at the surface. In the absence of a wind shift, the region is designated a col, akin to a geographic saddle between two mountain peaks. == Formation == A trough is the result of the movements of the air in the atmosphere. In regions where there is upward movement near the ground and divergence at altitude, there is a loss of mass. The pressure becomes lower at this point. At upper levels of the atmosphere, this occurs when there is a meeting of a mass of cold air and another hot one along a thin ribbon called a frontal baroclinic zone. We then have the creation of a jet stream that plunges the cold air towards the equator and hot air towards the poles, creating a ripple in the circulation that is called a Rossby wave. These undulations give the hollows and peaks of altitude. In general, absolute vorticity advection is positive between these two features, but closer to the ridge, whereas it is negative just behind a trough. At the surface, lifting air under positive vorticity advection is reflected by the formation of depressions and troughs. There will therefore be a slope between the barometric high altitude and that on the ground, this slope going towards the mass of cold air at high altitude (generally towards the Pole). === Positively/negatively tilted === Troughs have an orientation relative to the poles which is rarely North-South. In the Northern Hemisphere, positively tilted troughs will extend from the lowest pressure northeast to southwest while negatively tilted troughs have a northwest to southeast orientation. In the Southern Hemisphere, the positive tilt will be southeast to northwest and the negative one southwest to northeast. A trough will usually begin with a positive tilt as cold air moves toward the Equator. The trough will become neutral (North-South) and then negatively tilted as the energy carried by the cold air races east though the atmospheric circulation and distorts its shape. The positive tilt is thus the building phase of the trough and the negative tilt is the dissipation of its energy. Therefore, the clouds and precipitation will develop in the positive phase and the most severe weather will be in the negative phase. == Types of trough== In addition to standard troughs, some may be described further with a qualifying term indicating a specific or a set of characteristics. ===Inverted trough=== An inverted trough is an atmospheric trough which is oriented opposite to most troughs of the mid-latitudes. Most (but not all) inverted troughs are tropical waves (also commonly called easterly waves). Most troughs of low pressure in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere are characterized by decreasing atmospheric pressure from south to north while inverted troughs are characterized by decreasing pressure from north to south. The situation is opposite in the Southern Hemisphere. Inverted troughs in both hemispheres move to the west from the east, while mid-latitude troughs generally move with the westerlies toward the east. ===Lee trough=== A lee trough, also known as a dynamic trough, is \\"A pressure trough formed on the lee side of a mountain range in situations where the wind is blowing with a substantial component across the mountain ridge; often seen on United States weather maps east of the Rocky Mountains, and sometimes east of the Appalachians, where it is less pronounced.\\" It can be formed either as a result of the adiabatic compression of sinking air on the lee side of a mountain range, or through cyclogenesis resulting from \\"the horizontal convergence associated with vertical stretching of air columns passing over the ridge and descending the lee slope.\\" ==Weather associated== Convective cells may develop in the vicinity of troughs and give birth to a tropical cyclone. Some tropical or subtropical regions such as the Philippines or south China are greatly affected by convection cells along a trough. In the mid- latitude westerlies, upper level troughs and ridges often alternate in a high- amplitude pattern. For a trough in the westerlies, the region just west of the trough axis is typically an area of convergent winds and descending air – and hence high pressure –, while the region just east of the trough axis is an area of fast, divergent winds and low pressure. Tropical waves are a type of trough in easterly currents, a cyclonic northward deflection of the trade winds. ==See also== * Geopotential height * Surface weather analysis ==References== Category:Atmospheric dynamics Category:Atmospheric circulation Category:Synoptic meteorology and weather fi:Matalan sola ","title":"Trough (meteorology)"},{"id":"2585509","text":"Thomas Mann Randolph Jr. (October 1, 1768 – June 20, 1828) was an American planter, soldier, and politician from Virginia. He served as a member of both houses of the Virginia General Assembly, a Representative in the U.S. Congress, and as the 21st Governor of Virginia, from 1819–1822. He married Martha Jefferson, the oldest daughter of Thomas Jefferson, third President of the United States. They had eleven children who survived childhood. As an adult, Randolph developed alcoholism, and he and his wife separated for some time before his death. ==Early life and education== Thomas Mann Randolph Jr. was born on October 1, 1768, at Tuckahoe Plantation in the Colony of Virginia. Thomas was the first son of Thomas Mann Randolph Sr. (1741–1793) and Anne Cary Randolph (1745–1789). His siblings included older sisters: Mary Randolph (1762–1828), author of The Virginia House-Wife (1824); Cary (\\"Nancy\\") Randolph (1774–1837) wife of Gouverneur Morris, and younger sister, Virginia Randolph Cary (1786–1852), author of Letters on Female Character (1828). He was the grandson of Archibald Cary (1721–1787) and 2 times 2nd great-grandson of William Randolph (c.1650–1711) Richard Randolph and Thomas Randolph of Tuckahoe. The Randolphs were among the First Families of Virginia. Randolph was a lineal descendant of Pocahontas through his mother. Randolph received his early education from his mother and private tutors, as was customary in many planter families. He attended the College of William and Mary, in Williamsburg, Virginia, and the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, 1785–1788. Though he did not graduate, he continued to study on his own and became a respected botanist. At the end of 1790, their widower father Thomas Randolph Sr., at the age of 50, married Gabriella Harvie, who was seventeen and the daughter of a neighboring planter. They had two children, a daughter who died in infancy, and a son they named Thomas Mann Randolph, as if \\"erasing his first son from his prior marriage.\\"Annette Gordon-Reed, The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family, New York: W.W. Norton & Co., 2008, p. 427 ==Political and military career== ===Elected office=== Randolph served in the Virginia State Senate in 1793 and 1794; and was elected as a Republican to the Eighth and Ninth US Congresses (March 4, 1803 – March 3, 1807). During the War of 1812, he was a colonel of the Twentieth Infantry. He was elected a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, in 1819, 1820, and 1823–1825. He was elected and served as Governor of Virginia, 1819–1822. He was the first son- in-law of a Virginia Governor to be elected governor in his own right. As governor, he was fairly progressive, supporting canals, education, and more political representation for the ordinary people of the state; he also proposed an emancipation proposal that would have freed Virginia's slaves, but this was defeated. His political career in Virginia ended in 1825, when, running for reelection to the House of Delegates from Albemarle County, Randolph finished third among as many candidates, with only the top two candidates earning election. Randolph's colleague in the previous session, William F. Gordon, received the most votes, while Charlottesville attorney Rice W. Woods finished second, garnering 215 votes to Randolph's 79.Gaines, William H. Jr. Thomas Mann Randolph: Jefferson's Son-in-Law. Baton Rouge, LA.: Louisiana State University Press, 1966, p. 155. ===After office=== Desperate for work in late 1826, Randolph applied to and obtained employment from Secretary of War James Barbour, a former governor of Virginia, as the federal member of a commission to settle a boundary dispute between Georgia and the territory of Florida.Gaines, Thomas Mann Randolph, pp. 166–67. The Georgia government suddenly terminated the survey on April 18, 1827,Gaines, Thomas Mann Randolph, pp. 173, 173n. and though Barbour and President John Quincy Adams considered appointing Randolph as a federal agent to deal with the Creeks,Gaines, Thomas Mann Randolph, pp. 173–74. such talk, and Randolph's political career, ended when Randolph virulently criticized the indifferent handling of the boundary expedition by Barbour and Secretary of State Henry Clay in Virginia newspapers.Gaines, Thomas Mann Randolph, pp. 175–76. ===Sale of Edgehill=== Randolph and his wife became estranged toward the end of his life, in part because of the stress created by their tenuous financial situation. After inheriting his father's debts upon his death, Randolph had struggled to provide for his younger siblings in addition to his own growing family. The Virginian economic situation suffered several blows, and by the end of his life Randolph's lands were worth far less than they had been when he inherited them. In 1825, in desperation, the Randolphs had to sell their main property, Edgehill, along with its crops, buildings, animals, and slaves, and even this was not enough money to pay back all the family's creditors. Opposed to slavery on principle, the Randolphs attempted to keep their slaves' families together, but facing the prospect of having to disperse the community that lived on their land, Martha wrote that \\"The discomfort of slavery I have borne all my life, but it's sorrows in all their bitterness I had never before conceived.\\" Portrait of Martha Jefferson Randolph. The loss of his property was humiliating for Randolph, since in Virginian society at that time men had to own a certain amount of land before being allowed to hold office or even to vote. Randolph, who had always had a temper, became increasingly angry toward his wife's father, his sons, and Martha herself, feeling that they did not do enough to save Edgehill but focused on saving Thomas Jefferson's estate, Monticello, instead. Monticello was also in danger of being sold due to debts and the poor economy, but most members of the family believed that it would provide a better chance for them than would the more heavily encumbered Edgehill property. At times Randolph became irrational, and his angry outbursts caused all his adult children to distance themselves from him. He left Martha and their younger children at Monticello with her father, Thomas Jefferson, and lived alone for several years. After Jefferson's death, Martha Randolph moved with her two youngest children to Boston to gain distance from her husband, and to spend time with her older daughter. Randolph and his wife were reconciled shortly before his death, and he was cared for at Monticello. Randolph died there and was interred in the Jefferson family burial ground. ==Personal life== In 1790, Randolph married Martha Washington Jefferson (1772–1836), daughter of Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826) and his wife Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson (1748–1782). They were parents to twelve children, eleven of whom survived to adulthood: Anne Cary Randolph, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, Ellen Wayles Randolph (named after a deceased older girl), Cornelia Jefferson Randolph, Virginia Jefferson Randolph, Mary Jefferson Randolph, James Madison Randolph, Benjamin Franklin Randolph, Meriwether Lewis Randolph, Septimia Anne Randolph, and George Wythe Randolph.

The siege, led by Charles the Bold against the Imperial City of Neuss, was unsuccessful. Charles was compelled by the approach of a powerful Imperial army to raise the siege. == Prelude == Under Charles's father, Philip the Good, the Burgundy had allied itself to the cause of the newly-elected Archbishop of Cologne, Ruprecht. Ruprecht proved immensely unpopular, and by 1471 several major towns in the archbishopric, as well as the Kölners themselves, were on the verge of revolt. Attempts by the Emperor Frederick III to mediate the conflict failed, and in 1474 Charles the Bold signed a treaty with Ruprecht which stipulated that Charles would subdue the rebels and serve as Ruprecht's lifelong protector in return for 200,000 florins a year. To secure his western border, Charles concluded a treaty with Louis XI of France and then prepared to march into the Rhine valley; contemporaries suspected his real motive was the eventual reconquest of all of Alsace. == The siege == Charles's route towards Cologne led him past Neuss, one of the centers of resistance against Ruprecht. Fearing the threat Neuss would pose to his exposed rear if left uninvested, Charles prepared to lay siege to the city, and the investment began on 29 July 1474. The Neussers, though they had had only a short time to prepare, laid in enough provisions to last until Christmas. They were led by Hermann, Landgrave of Hesse, and had the support of many nearby towns and cities. Charles's army set up siege lines to the North and West of the city; the South and East were guarded by the rivers Krur and Rhine, respectively. Two large islands lay in the Rhine, however, and Charles decided to capture them, reasoning that he would then control passage along the Rhine (and thus prevent the city from being resupplied) and the water supply to the city's moat. Several assaults in early and mid-August eventually captured the islands, though with heavy losses; soon thereafter a bridge to one of the islands collapsed, drowning many of Charles' Italian soldiers. The Burgundians were also harried by hostile peasants. In September Charles's Italians and English archers launched a 3,000-strong attack on one of Neuss' gates, which was repulsed. The next night, Kölners floated a fire-boat down the Rhine to destroy Charles' pontoon bridges, but the Burgundian river-fleet diverted it successfully. Shortly thereafter Charles' English archers, upset by the arrears of pay, began to cause trouble, and as Charles tried to calm them they opened fire. Charles was unharmed, but a rumor spread that the English had killed him, and enraged Burgundians began to slaughter the English until Charles presented himself to his army. Throughout the siege he worked tirelessly to keep up morale and to prosecute the siege, and it was a common belief that he slept fully armored for only a few hours a night. The Neussers, bolstered by Hermann's Hessian troops and the support of Kölners, who skirmished with the Burgundians and smuggled provisions into the city while disguised as Italians, held out resolutely. Charles' men captured a German trying to swim the Rhine with a message that declared that Emperor Frederick was approaching with a huge army, and Charles redoubled his efforts, to no avail. By May, Frederick was on the move, his army slowed by drunken brawls between soldiers from different regions of the Empire and by the need to recapture other cities from the Burgundians. But by the end of May he had arrived, and the Burgundians, after signing a provisional treaty, began to dismantle their siege works. At first, Burgundians, Imperials, and Kölners fraternized, but soon the Germans began to harass the Burgundians (the Kölners stole five Burgundian ships loaded with cannon), precipitating a sudden and violent assault on the unsuspecting Germans. Sporadic fighting continued until the papal legate present at the siege threatened to excommunicate both Charles and Frederick unless they ended the fighting; this threat, probably an idle one, enabled the two monarchs to conclude hostilities without losing face. The siege was finally terminated on 27 June 1475.Pat McGill, Armand Pacou, and Rod Erskine Riddel,The Burgundian Army of Charles the Bold: The Ordonnance Companies and their Captains( Lincoln: Freezywater Publications, 2001), 8–15.

He is regarded in Lithuania as a National Hero. Kudirka used pen names V. Kapsas, Paežerių Vincas, Vincas Kapsas, P.Vincas, Varpas, Q.D, K., V.K, Perkūnas. Kudirka was born in Paežeriai, in the Augustów Governorate of Congress Poland (present-day Lithuania). He began studying history and philosophy in Warsaw in 1881, but changed his major and began studying medicine the following year. During his studies, he was arrested as a subversive for having a copy of Das Kapital in his possession, and was expelled from the University of Warsaw, but later re- admitted. He graduated in 1889, and worked as a country doctor in Šakiai and Naumiestis. Kudirka began writing poetry in 1888. Simultaneously he became more active in the Lithuanian national rebirth movement. Together with other Lithuanian students in Warsaw, he founded the secret society Lietuva (\\"Lithuania\\"). The following year the society began publishing the clandestine newspaper Varpas (\\"The Bell\\"), which Kudirka edited and contributed to for the next ten years. In issue number 6 of Varpas, in September 1898, he published the text of Tautiška Giesmė, which would officially become in 1918, the Lithuanian National Anthem, set to music written by Kudirka himself. Kudirka gave much to Lithuanian culture, and also published a collection of Lithuanian popular songs. He was also a noted writer of satire. He died of tuberculosis at Naumiestis, on 16 November 1899, at age 40. The second half of Tautiška Giesmė was engraved on his gravestone. On 5 July 2009, a statue of Vincas Kudirka was unveiled beside the Gediminas Avenue, the main street of the capital Vilnius. The unveiling, by dignitaries, including the Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus, coincided with festivities marking the 1000th anniversary of the first time Lithuania was mentioned in official chronicles. == References == Category:1858 births Category:1899 deaths Category:People from Vilkaviškis District Municipality Category:People from Augustów Governorate Category:Lithuanian poets Category:Lithuanian writers Category:Lithuanian physicians Category:Lithuanian classical composers Category:National anthem writers Category:Male classical composers Category:19th-century classical composers Category:19th-century poets Category:19th-century male musicians Category:19th-century deaths from tuberculosis ","title":"Vincas Kudirka"},{"id":"2585558","text":"Geneviève Jeanson (born August 29, 1981) is a former professional bicycle racer from Quebec, Canada. She won the world junior road and time trial championships in 1999 and the Tour de Snowy in 2000. Later that year she won La Flèche Wallonne World Cup race. She joined the Canadian Olympic team that year. She acknowledged in a documentary on Radio-Canada (the French-language CBC) on September 20, 2007, that she had been administered EPO more or less continuously since she was 16 years old. After residing in Phoenix, Arizona and San Diego, California (where she studied sociology and psychology), Jeanson came back to Lachine, Quebec in 2012 to live with her once estranged parents and complete her college-level education at the Saint-Anne Collégial International. In autumn 2014, she attended Concordia University, in Montreal, where she studied neuroscience. Jeanson currently lives with her common law husband and works in the fitness industry. ==2000 Olympic selection== Controversy dogged Jeanson throughout her career. Before the Olympics in 2000, she was accused of seeking special treatment by wanting an exemption from Olympic selection rules adopted by the Canadian Cycling Association. She said the procedure considered cumulative results for 1999 and 2000 but that she had raced as a junior in 1999 and could not achieve the results needed for selection. She and the Canadian Cycling Federation agreed that she would qualify for the Olympic selection race if she could finish in the top eight of two of five selected races. This she did by winning the Tour de Snowy and La Flèche Wallonne Féminine. Then, in July 2000, she qualified by finishing ahead of the other candidates in the Canadian Road Cycling Championship. ==2000 Olympics== Controversy followed her to the Olympics. Towards the end of the road race, her teammate Lyne Bessette was in a break. Jeanson's detractors maintain that, on instructions from her coach, André Aubut, Jeanson helped chase the break and denied her teammate an opportunity to win a medal. Jeanson's defenders said she had ridden near the front as expected of a teammate trying to break the chase, and moved forward only to close a small gap when the break was almost caught. ==2001 Racing== In 2001, she won four of five stages at the Redlands Bicycle Classic, winning overall by nearly 10 minutes, an unprecedented margin. Then, at the Tour of the Gila in early May, she won four of five stages and the overall victory, this time by an unprecedented 15 minutes. On some stages she broke away early and rode alone the rest of the way. In early June, she won the Montreal World Cup, lapping most of the field and winning by more than seven minutes. ==Doping== Geneviève Jeanson with her coach André Aubut In late 2003, while with the national team preparing for the world championships in Hamilton, Ontario, Jeanson had a hematocrit level (a measure of red cells in the blood) above the limit and was not allowed to race for two weeks. She missed the championships. Jeanson blamed the finding on an altitude tent used as part of her training. Subsequent doping tests were negative. On 25 July 2005, at the Tour de 'Toona stage race in Pennsylvania, Jeanson had an out-of-competition test. Jeanson said months later that she tested positive for EPO, a banned substance. She denied taking a banned substance but in January 2006 she announced her retirement. On November 28, 2006, the United States Anti-Doping Agency said she had accepted a two-year suspension from 25 July 2005, the day her sample was taken. In an interview on Cyclingnews.com on 20 December 2006, Jeanson said that although she could race again from mid-July 2007, she \\"won't race ever again.\\" She said she had \\"changed so much this past year that I have a hard time imagining who I was before.\\" She finally admitted to doping to a French CBC journalist. Her coach André Aubut and doctor Maurice Duquette were banned for life by the Canadian Center for Ethics in Sport in 2009. ==2014 Movie== The Little Queen (La Petite reine), a movie inspired by her life, was released in 2014. Jeanson’s character is renamed Julie Arseneau (played by Laurence Leboeuf). ==Major results== ;1998 :3rd Time Trial, UCI Junior Road World Championships :National Junior Road Championships ::1st 20px Road Race ::1st 20px Time Trial ;1999 :UCI Junior Road World Championships ::1st 20px Road Race ::1st 20px Time Trial :National Junior Road Championships ::1st 20px Road Race ::1st 20px Time Trial ;2000 :1st 20px Overall Tour de Snowy :1st La Flèche Wallonne :2nd Time Trial, National Road CHampionships ;2001 :1st 20px Overall Redlands Bicycle Classic ::1st Stages 1, 3, 4 & 6 :1st 20px Overall Tour of the Gila ::1st Stages 1, 2, 3 & 5 :1st 20px Overall Tour de Toona ::1st Prologue & Stage 4 :1st La Coupe du Monde Cycliste Féminine de Montréal :National Road Championships ::2nd Time Trial ::3rd Road Race ;2002 :1st 20px Time Trial, National Road CHampionships :1st 20px Overall Women's Challenge ::1st Stage 5 :1st Prologue Le Tour du Grand Montréal :2nd Overall Redlands Bicycle Classic :1st Stage 1 :2nd Overall Tour of the Gila ::1st Stages 1, 2, 3 & 5 :3rd La Coupe du Monde Cycliste Féminine de Montréal ;2003 :National Road Championships ::1st 20px Road Race ::2nd Time Trial :1st 20px Overall Pomona Valley Stage Race ::1st Stages 1 & 2 :1st 20px Overall Redlands Bicycle Classic ::1st Stages 2, 3 & 5 :1st 20px Overall Sea Otter Classic ::1st Stages 1 & 2 :1st 20px Overall Tour of the Gila ::1st Stages 1, 2 & 3 :1st La Coupe du Monde Cycliste Féminine de Montréal :1st Prologue Le Tour du Grand Montréal :2nd Overall Tour de Toona ::1st Stages 1 & 4 ;2004 :1st La Coupe du Monde Cycliste Féminine de Montréal :1st Stage 4 Tour de Toona :2nd Overall Redlands Bicycle Classic ::1st Prologue & Stage 1 ;2005 :National Road Championships ::1st 20px Road Race ::2nd Time Trial :1st 20px Overall Tour de Toona :1st La Coupe du Monde Cycliste Féminine de Montréal :2nd Overall Tour of the Gila ::1st Stage 1 :3rd Overall Valley of the Sun Stage Race ==See also== * List of doping cases in cycling *List of sportspeople sanctioned for doping offences ==References== ==External links== * A fan site in French. *Terse biography on Canoe *Interview on Cycling News *Toronto Star article on Jeanson lifetime suspension *La Presse article on Jeanson's lifetime suspension (in French) *USADA announces 2-year suspension November 28, 2006 * *Cyclingnews article by Matthew Hansen where Jeanson announces she will never return to cycling *2017 Interview with Anne-Marije Rook from Ella Cycling - Geneviève describes making peace with her tainted and troubled past Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian female cyclists Category:Canadian expatriate sportspeople in the United States Category:Cyclists from Quebec Category:Cyclists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Doping cases in cycling Category:French Quebecers Category:Olympic cyclists of Canada Category:People from Saint-Hyacinthe ","title":"Geneviève Jeanson"},{"id":"2585561","text":"The Impossible Man and other Stories is a 1966 collection of science fiction short stories by J.

Craig at the Social Security Death Index was an American comic book artist notable for his work with the EC Comics line of the 1950s. He sometimes used the pseudonyms Jay Taycee and F. C. Aljohn. ==Biography== ===Early life and career=== Born in Pleasantville, New York,Hill, Roger. EC Archives: The Vault of Horror, Russ Cochran, Publisher/Gemstone, 2007, p. 42. Craig studied at the Art Students League of New York.Johnny Craig at the Lambiek Comiclopedia While attending classes, he began working in 1940 as an assistant of Harry Lampert, co-creator of All-American Comics' Golden Age superhero the Flash. The following year, after Lampert was drafted to serve to World War II, All- American editor Sheldon Mayer kept Craig on as an art department assistant, giving him progressively more responsible art duties. Between 1943 and 1945, Craig served in the Merchant Marines and the U.S. Army. ===EC Comics=== Returning to comics after his discharge, he began drawing for EC Comics, beginning with the penciling and inking the cover of Moon Girl and the Prince #1 (cover-dated Fall 1947). He did additional work on the following issue of that science fiction / superhero series, now titled simply Moon Girl, and went on to draw stories for the EC Western comics Saddle Justice and Gunfighter and the crime comic Crime Patrol; he later expanded into romance comics with EC's Modern Love Craig additionally did a small amount of early work for Magazine Enterprises, American Comics Group and, tentatively identified through the pen name \\"Jay\\", possibly for Eastern Color's New Heroic Comics.Johnny Craig at the Grand Comics Database When he teamed with Al Feldstein, they used the pseudonym F. C. Aljohn. Johnny Craig's \\"Any Sport in a Storm\\", The Vault of Horror #38 (Sept. 1954). Craig later brought a clean, crisp, naturalistic approach to EC's legendary horror series--The Crypt of Terror, The Vault of Horror and The Haunt of Fear -- plus Crime SuspenStories and Two-Fisted Tales. Wally Wood once said Craig drew \\"the cleanest horror stories you ever saw\\". His first EC horror work came with the cover art for The Crypt of Terror #17 (May 1950) and both the art and script for that issue's seven-page story \\"Curse of the Full Moon\\". In being a writer as well as an artist, Craig differed from the majority of EC artists. He was responsible for the stories hosted by the Vault-Keeper, and he also drew that horror host in the framing sequences of stories by other EC illustrators. He eventually concentrated on The Vault of Horror and Crime SuspenStories, doing the lead story in each of these bimonthly titles. Craig became the editor of The Vault of Horror early in 1954, giving up his work for Crime SuspenStories at that time. Later that year, he created the Vault Keeper's attractive assistant, Drusilla. After the EC horror books came to an end, Craig edited EC's Extra! in 1955, writing and drawing two stories in each bimonthly issue. Craig's story \\"... And All Through the House\\" in Vault of Horror #35 (March 1954) was adapted for the Joan Collins segment of the 1972 omnibus film Tales from the Crypt. Crime SuspenStories #22 (May 1954), cover art by Craig, was displayed at the United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency hearings. Craig's many covers included that of the infamous Crime SuspenStories #22, shown during the 1950s Senate hearings on juvenile delinquency. U.S. Senator Estes Kefauver asked EC publisher Bill Gaines whether he thought the cover, depicting an ax- wielding man holding a woman's severed head, was in good taste. Gaines responded, \\"Yes, sir, I do, for the cover of a horror comic\\"—a remark that became an oft-quoted example of comic books' alleged depravity. Ironically, Craig was one of the more wholesome EC artists, frequently choosing to show the reactions of characters rather than the horrific event itself. One critic wrote of his work: ===Later career=== After EC's collapse in the wake of the United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency hearings, Craig worked briefly for Atlas Comics, the 1950s predecessor of Marvel Comics, then spent several successful years at an advertising agency in Pennsylvania, though he lamented that his responsibilities there prevented him from drawing much.Geissman, p. 63 He returned to comics in the 1960s with art for ACG's Unknown Worlds and other titles. His resurfacing prompted Warren Publishing editor Archie Goodwin to have Craig draw for Warren's magazines from 1966 to 1968, during which time Craig (who still worked in advertising) used the pseudonym Jay Taycee, a phonetic pronunciation of his four initials. Of his attempts to work for DC Comics and Marvel Comics, however, comics historian Mark Evanier wrote, Evanier wrote that Goodwin, by now writing for Marvel, said that, \\"Every so often, we'd try having him pencil an Iron Man or something, but it never worked out. He couldn't draw superheroes the way they wanted, and he couldn't hit the deadlines of a monthly book\\". After penciling and inking Iron Man #2 and a supernatural story in Tower of Shadows #1, heavily retouched by John Romita Sr., Craig became primarily an inker. He did however complete Iron Man #2-4, 14, 24 and 25, the latter inked by Sam Grainger. Example of EC Archives' digital coloring by Jamison Services on a Johnny Craig page: \\"Terror on the Moors!\\" in EC Archives: The Vault of Horror (2007), originally in The Vault of Horror 17 (February–March 1951). By the early 1980s, Craig stopped drawing for comics and was semi-retired until his death in 2001. He did do many paintings of the Vault-Keeper, Drusilla and other E.C. horror themes, for private commissions, E.C. fanzines and other publications, and these works showed excellent technique in oils. His last known residences were Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, and Shiremanstown, Pennsylvania. ==Awards== Craig was posthumously inducted into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame on July 15, 2005, at Comic-Con International. ==References== ==External links== *The Comic Treadmill: \\"The Brave and the Bold 70-71, 73 (1967)\\" *Fred Hembeck on The Vault of Horror #35 Category:1926 births Category:2001 deaths Category:American illustrators Category:American comics artists Category:American sailors Category:People from Pleasantville, New York Category:Silver Age comics creators Category:Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame inductees Category:Marvel Comics people Category:EC Comics ","title":"Johnny Craig"},{"id":"2585610","text":"Mr. Nilsson (Swedish Herr Nilsson) is Pippi Longstocking's monkey in the fictional books by Astrid Lindgren, and subsequent films and television episodes. \\"Herr Nilsson\\" is also the name of a pop group from Bergen, Norway.

Population figures: ==History== Pravdinsk was founded in 1312 at a ford across the Lava River after the local Natangian tribe in Prussia was subdued by the Teutonic Knights, and received town privileges in 1335 under Grand Master Luther von Braunschweig. Now known by its German language name Friedland (\\"peaceful land\\"), the town was devastated during the Thirteen Years' War between the Teutonic Order and the Prussian Confederation. Friedland became a part of the Duchy of Prussia after the secularization of the State of the Teutonic Order in 1525. Under the ruling Hohenzollern dynasty, Friedland became a part of Brandenburg-Prussia in 1618, and was again damaged by Swedish troops in the course of the Second Northern War 1655-1660. Friedland belonged to the Kingdom of Prussia from 1701, and during the Napoleonic Wars on June 14, 1807, Napoleon's French army won the nearby Battle of Friedland against a combined Russian-Prussian army. The town became part of the German Empire in 1871, during the Prussian-led unification of Germany. During World War II, Friedland was conquered by the Red Army on January 31, 1945 as part of the Soviet invasion of Germany. At the time Friedland belonged to Landkreis Bartenstein in the province of East Prussia, which was transferred from Nazi Germany to the Soviet Union according to the 1945 Potsdam Agreement. The German population fled or was expelled, and East Prussia was divided between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Poland, with Friedland belonging to the portion organized into Kaliningrad Oblast of the Russian SFSR. The town was made the administrative center of Fridlyandsky District under the name Fridlyand, but were renamed Pravdinsk and Pravdinsky District in 1946. ==Administrative and municipal status== Within the framework of administrative divisions, Pravdinsk serves as the administrative center of Pravdinsky District.Resolution #640 As an administrative division, it is, together with thirty-two rural localities, incorporated within Pravdinsky District as the town of district significance of Pravdinsk. Within the framework of municipal divisions, since May 5, 2015, the territories of the town of district significance of Pravdinsk, the urban- type settlement of district significance of Zheleznodorozhny, and of two rural okrugs of Pravdinsky District are incorporated as Pravdinsky Urban Okrug.Law #418 Before that, the town of district significance was incorporated within Pravdinsky Municipal District as Pravdinskoye Urban Settlement. ==Religion== The St. George Church in Pravdinsk The Late Gothic church of St. George in the town center is well preserved and today used by the Moscow Patriarchate. Pravdinsk is identified in some historical accounts with Romuva, said to be the center of Baltic paganism. The Lithuanian name for Pravdinsk is Romuva, and this was most likely its name in Old Prussian as well. Whether Romuva was in fact associated with Baltic paganism is disputed, however, as it has been suggested that this belief started when early Christian chroniclers were confused by the similarity between \\"Romuva\\" and \\"Rome\\", and by their own unwarranted assumption that Baltic paganism should resemble Roman paganism in being focused around a particular geographical center. ==Notable people== * Otto Saro (1818–1888) a Prussian lawyer and chief state prosecutor in Königsberg * Florian Essenfelder (1855–1929) made pianos in Germany and Brazil * Artyom Danilenko (born 1990) a Russian professional football player * Sergey Kiselyov (born 1990) an association football defender ==International relations== Pravdinsk is part of the Friedliches Land (Peaceful Land) municipal association with: * Frýdlant, Czech Republic * Frýdlant nad Ostravicí, Czech Republic * Friedland, Brandenburg, Germany * Friedland, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany * Friedland, Lower Saxony, Germany * Korfantów (Friedland in Oberschlesien), Poland * Mieroszów (Friedland in Niederschlesien), Poland ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== * * * Category:Cities and towns in Kaliningrad Oblast ","title":"Pravdinsk"},{"id":"2585653","text":"Belluton is a village in Somerset, England.

Riedel migrated to Sweden at the age of four and attended school in Stockholm, including the Adolf Fredrik's Music School. The best known recording featuring Riedel is probably Jan Johansson's Jazz på svenska (\\"Jazz in Swedish\\"), a minimalist-jazz compilation of folk songs recorded in 1962–1963, though Riedel has recorded with other leading Swedish musicians including trumpeter Jan Allan and Arne Domnérus. Riedel's profile as a composer derives almost exclusively from writing music for Astrid Lindgren movies, including the main theme from the Emil i Lönneberga (\\"Emil of Maple Hills\\") movies. He also composed the music for several films by Arne Mattsson in the 1960s as well as for film adaptions of novels by Stig Dagerman.

She appeared in several films during the 1960s. Her best-known appearance was the role of Bond girl, Patricia Fearing or Pat, a nurse who takes care of James Bond (Sean Connery) while he is on holiday at her health clinic in Thunderball (1965). Peters was the first Bond girl to be seen taking her clothes off on screen in the Bond series. Peters appeared in Playboy, in the November 1965 issue. Her appearance was as part of a pictorial essay titled \\"James Bond's Girls\\", by Richard Maibaum. According to the special edition DVD of Thunderball, Peters' short film career was the result of a disagreement between her and her agent, the specifics of which were not revealed. According to Peters, her agent at the time of Thunderball held her to her contract agreement of representation due to the mega-successful box-office hit of the fourth James Bond film in 1965. Not until many years later, when the fame, the glamour and the chaos had faded from the release of Thunderball, her contractual agreement had ended and so had any modelling and/or film prospects. ==Personal life== When she was young, she gave birth to a daughter, whom she gave up for adoption. Peters later married and lived with her husband in Ipswich, Suffolk. She and her husband had a son, who has since died.

The western end is near the intersection of State Route 18 and I-90 in Snoqualmie, Washington, and runs southeast about or by trail. It is the highest and easternmost of the Issaquah Alps (although Cedar Butte in the gap between Rattlesnake Mountain and the Cascade front at Mount Washington is considered by Harvey Manning to be a quasi-Alp). A maze of abandoned logging roads and constructed trails have been strung together to provide a footpath from the Snoqualmie Point trailhead at Exit 27 on I-90 all the way to the Rattlesnake Lake trailhead near Exit 32. Rattlesnake Ledge is a rock outcropping and viewpoint 1160 feet above Rattlesnake Lake. Rattlesnake Ledge is a very popular hike destination. The Rattlesnake Ledge Trail makes up the eastern 2 mile segment of the Rattlesnake Ridge or Rattlesnake Mountain Trail. Several recreational opportunities exist, including hiking and rock- climbing. == Legal status == Most of the mountain is owned by the state of Washington or King County, and is protected as Rattlesnake Mountain Scenic Area, managed jointly by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources and King County Park and Recreation Department. The eastern section of the mountain, including the ledges, is owned by Seattle Public Utilities, while large sections in the western part of the ridge are owned by Weyerhaeuser Corporation, which conducts substantial logging operations there. == Deadly incidents == On May 30, 2009, a 28-year-old man fell one hundred feet to his death from a ledge on Rattlesnake Ridge. Officials say Ruben Maldonado, 28, of Snohomish County, fell from the popular hiking area above Rattlesnake Lake around 12:15 p.m. On March 9, 2012, a 32-year-old man fell about 300 feet from a ridge. He was found dead by another hiker who saw the fall. On February 9, 2013, a Redmond man missing near Rattlesnake Ridge was found dead at about 10 a.m. Bove said King County Search and Rescue found the body of Ira Thomas Clodfelter, 28, about three-quarters of a mile from the main trail, and it appeared to be a suicide. The King County Medical Examiner said February 11 that Clodfelter died from a gunshot wound to the head, and ruled it a suicide. On August 29, 2013, a man in his 20s fell to his death while hiking in the Rattlesnake Ridge area of Snoqualmie near Rattlesnake Lake. King County Sheriffs deputies received a 911 call around 10:55 a.m. from a woman who said someone had fallen off Rattlesnake Ridge. When rescue personnel arrived, a friend of the victim told them she and the man had hiked to the top of the ridge. She was taking pictures of the man, who was near the ledge, when he slipped and fell as he was trying to jump to a rock. Medics found the man's body and determined he had fallen about 150 feet to his death. On March 3, 2018, a 16-year-old boy died after falling off of Rattlesnake Ridge. He was attempting to take a picture and slipped due to icy conditions at the top of the mountain. Search and Rescue was called at 8:40 a.m. and the body was located at 9:15 a.m. == Climate == Rattlesnake Ridge is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. == References == * * ==Gallery== Image:Rattlesnake Ridge.JPGRattlesnake Ridge Image:RattlesnakeRidge.JPGAs viewed from above File:Rattlesnake Ledge weekend crowds.jpgRattlesnake Ledge weekend crowds Category:Landforms of King County, Washington Category:Ridges of Washington (state) Category:Washington Natural Areas Program Category:Protected areas of King County, Washington ","title":"Rattlesnake Ridge"},{"id":"2585763","text":"Cover of Flashing Swords! #1, 1973 Flashing Swords! is a series of fantasy anthologies published by Dell Books from 1973 to 1981 under the editorship of Lin Carter. It showcased the heroic fantasy work of the members of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America (SAGA), a somewhat informal literary group active from the 1960s to the 1980s, of which Carter was the guiding force. Most of the important sword and sorcery writers at the time of the group’s founding were members; later, membership was extended to other fantasy authors. The Flashing Swords! series provides a cross-section of the heroic fantasy of the period. Carter and SAGA also sponsored The Gandalf Award from 1974-1981. With the collapse of Carter’s health in the 1980s the anthology series, the Gandalf award, and likely SAGA itself all went into abeyance. A revival of the series edited by Carter's literary executor Robert M. Price was projected, with the first volume, Lin Carter's Flashing Swords! #6 published (briefly) by Pulp Hero Press in July, 2020. Due to an introduction found objectionable by some of the authors whose works were included, the publisher delisted the book a few days after publication.Johnston, Rich. \\"Publisher Delists Flashing Swords #6 After Authors Object to Foreword.\\" On https://bleedingcool.com/ bleedingcool.com], 31 July, 2020. ==Contents== In all, twenty-three stories by fifteen authors were published in the original five-volume series, all of them for the first time. These included two \\"Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser\\" stories by Fritz Leiber (in #1 and #3), two \\"Dying Earth\\" stories by Jack Vance (in #1 and #4), the first two parts of the novel The Merman's Children by Poul Anderson (also in #1 and #4), two \\"Amalric the Mangod\\" stories by Lin Carter (in #1 and #3), a \\"Pusad\\" tale and the first part of the novel The Incorporated Knight by L. Sprague de Camp (in #2 and #3, respectively), two \\"Elric of Melniboné\\" stories by Michael Moorcock (in #2 and #4), two \\"Witch World\\" stories by Andre Norton (in #2 and #3), two \\"Brak the Barbarian\\" stories by John Jakes (in #2 and #4), one story by Avram Davidson (in #3), a \\"Deryni\\" story by Katherine Kurtz (in #4), a \\"Dilvish\\" story by Roger Zelazny (in #5), a story by C. J. Cherryh (in #5), a story by Diane Duane (in #5), an \\"Ebenezum\\" story by Craig Shaw Gardner (in #5), and a story by Tanith Lee (in #5). The much later Flashing Swords! #6 contained twelve additional stories by eleven authors, including \\"The Island of Shadows\\" by Paul R. McNamee, \\"Godkiller\\" by Cliff Biggers, \\"Varla and the Mad Magician\\" by Glen Usher and Steve Lines, \\"Blood Games in the Temple of the Toad\\" by Frank Schildiner, \\"The Bloody Crooked One\\" by Charles R.

Blute (born January 28, 1956) is a former American Republican member of the United States House of Representatives. He served two terms, between January 3, 1993 and January 3, 1997, representing the Third District of Massachusetts. As of 2020, Blute and colleague Peter G. Torkildsen remain the last Republicans elected to serve in the United States House delegation from Massachusetts. ==Early life and career== Blute was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, one of 11 siblings. He grew up and currently lives in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, where he attended St. John's High School. He earned his B.A. at Boston College in 1978. He was the owner of a sports promotion and marketing firm, and then a marketing representative for The Burdett School. Blute was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1986 and served until 1993 when he was elected as a Republican to the 103rd Congress and then reelected to the 104th Congress. A Republican, he defeated 9-term incumbent Joseph Early, who is also a St. John's High School alumnus, in 1992 to become the first Republican to represent this district since 1947. After two terms in the House, Blute was defeated by current Congressman James P. McGovern in 1996 in a reelection bid for the 105th Congress. Since Blute's defeat, no other Massachusetts Republican has been elected to the House. ==After Congress== From 1997 to 1999, Blute served as Executive Director of the Massachusetts Port Authority (MassPort). His tenure at MassPort came to an end following revelations of a workday \\"booze cruise\\", originally paid for with Massport funds and billed as a \\"survey\\" of Boston Harbor, during which a female passenger, actress Gidget Churchill, aboard the vessel with Blute exposed her breasts to a Boston Herald photographer. Questions remain as to why Churchill exposed herself and who notified the local media as to the time and date of the cruise. Blute was then a radio talk show host for WRKO Boston from 5:30 to 9 AM, co-hosting with Andy Moes from 1999 to 2001, John Osterlind from 2001 to 2003, and Scott Allen Miller from 2003 until he left WRKO on October 3, 2005. He moved on to AM 830 WCRN Worcester in early 2006, and hosted the station's 6 to 9AM drive-time program until leaving WCRN on May 27, 2011.http://www.worcesterwired.com/2011/05/27/blutte-says-goodbye-to-wcrn-and- radio/ On December 21, 2011 Blute was named deputy chairman of the Massachusetts Republican Party. ==Family== Blute is the son of Dr. Robert Blute and Ann-Marie Blute, a Dame of Malta.

He came to New Spain in 1749, and accompanied explorers Francisco Palóu and Junípero Serra. In 1767 he went to the Baja California Peninsula and was placed in charge of the Misión La Purísima Concepción de Cadegomó. In 1769, Crespí joined the expedition led by Gaspar de Portolá and Junípero Serra (see Timeline of the Portolá expedition). He traveled in the vanguard of the land expedition to San Diego, led by Captain Fernando Rivera y Moncada, where a presidio and mission were established. Crespí then continued north with Portolá and Rivera to identify the port of Monterey. Because he was the only one of the Franciscans to make the entire journey by land, Crespí became the first official diarist for the missions. He was one of three diarists to document the first exploration by Europeans of interior areas of Alta California. After reaching Monterey in October 1769, Crespí continued with the expedition that explored as far north as present-day San Francisco, and became one of the first Europeans to see San Francisco Bay. All told, the expedition traveled in the future state of California through the present-day coastal counties of San Diego, Orange, Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterey, Santa Cruz, San Mateo, and San Francisco. In 1772, Crespí accompanied Captain Pedro Fages on an exploration of areas to the east of San Francisco Bay. The Fages expedition members were the first Europeans to see the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin Valley. In 1774, Crespí was chaplain of the expedition to the North Pacific conducted by Juan José Pérez Hernández. His diaries, first published in H. E.

He was raised in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, where his parents, Emmanuel and Lilli (Fischl) Schlesinger, owned a cleaning supplies shop. After Czechoslovakia was occupied by Germany in 1938, he and his younger brother, Ernest, were sent to England by his parents as part of the kindertransport, organized by Nicholas Winton, that rescued 669 Jewish children. His parents were later killed in the Holocaust. Schlesinger appears in and narrates the 2011 documentary Nicky's Family about Winton and the kindertransport. Schlesinger pursued a journalism career after the war, first working at the Prague bureau of the Associated Press in 1948 as a translator. He fled Czechoslovakia after its Communist government began arresting journalists, crossing the border into Austria. In 1950, he immigrated to Canada. He arrived at Pier 21 in Halifax and travelled across the country to Vancouver to join his brother, who had immigrated to Canada earlier under the Canadian Jewish War Orphans Project. After studying at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and editing the student newspaper, he reported for the city's afternoon newspaper, The Province, before moving to the Toronto Daily Star. He then left Canada and edited for UPI in London and the International Herald Tribune in Paris. ==Career with the CBC== Schlesinger returned to Canada in 1966 and joined the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as executive producer of The National but soon returned to reporting and served as the CBC's foreign correspondent variously in Hong Kong, Paris, Washington and Berlin, reporting on the Vietnam War, the Cultural Revolution and Ping-pong diplomacy in China, the Iranian Revolution, guerrilla wars in Nicaragua and El Salvador, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and ultimately the fall of the Iron Curtain including the Velvet Revolution in his homeland of Czechoslovakia. In 1990, he wrote his autobiography, Time Zones: a Journalist in the World, which became a bestseller. Schlesinger described his early career in an interview with Czech public radio Radio Prague, aired on March 21, 2005.Radio Prague interview (in English) In the early 1990s Schlesinger was promoted to managing editor of CBC News, producing commentaries and documentaries for the short-lived CBC Prime Time News. He retired from full-time employment in 1994, but continued to produce essays and special reports for CBC News. In the last half of the 1990s he became host of a few foreign news magazine programs on CBC Newsworld, including Foreign Assignment (shared with Ian Hanomansing), and Schlesinger. He continued to produce occasional documentaries for the CBC and write commentaries for the CBC News website into his eighties. ==Honours== He was made a Member of the Order of Canada in 1994. He was nominated for 18 Gemini Awards, winning three, for \\"Best Reportage\\" (1987 and 1992) and \\"Best News Magazine Segment\\" (2004). He was also awarded the John Drainie Award (1997) and \\"Best Performance by a Broadcast Journalist (Gordon Sinclair Award)\\" (1987). On June 7, 2010, he received an honorary doctorate of laws from Queen's University in Kingston, and delivered the convocation speech to part of the graduating class of 2010 from Queens' Faculty of Arts and Sciences. On June 8, 2011, he received an honorary doctorate of letters from the University of Alberta in Edmonton for his long and distinguished career, and also delivered a speech to part of the U of A's 2011 graduating class of the Faculty of Arts. He also held honorary doctorates from the University of British Columbia, the Royal Military College of Canada, Dalhousie University and Carleton University. In 2016, he was inducted to the CBC News Hall of Fame, the second CBC news personality to be inducted after Knowlton Nash in 2015. ==Death== Schlesinger died after a prolonged illness on February 11, 2019 at the age of 90. ==References== Category:1928 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Austrian emigrants to Canada Category:Austrian Jews Category:Canadian Jews Category:Canadian people of Slovak descent Category:Canadian television reporters and correspondents Category:CBC Television people Category:Canadian Screen Award winning people Category:Jewish emigrants from Austria after the Anschluss Category:Kindertransport refugees Category:Members of the Order of Canada Category:University of British Columbia alumni Category:Austrian emigrants to Czechoslovakia Category:Applicants for refugee status in Canada Category:20th- century Canadian journalists Category:21st-century Canadian journalists ","title":"Joe Schlesinger"},{"id":"2585809","text":"Ebbor Gorge is a limestone gorge in Somerset, England, designated and notified in 1952 as a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in the Mendip Hills. It was donated to the National Trust in 1967 and is now managed by Natural England as a national nature reserve. The gorge was cut mostly into the Clifton Down Limestone, part of the Lower Carboniferous Pembroke Group], by water. The site was occupied by humans in the Neolithic Era and their tools and flint arrow heads have been discovered, along with pottery from the Bronze Age. There are also fossils of small mammals from the Late Devensian. The nature reserve provides a habitat for a variety of flora and fauna, including flowers, butterflies and bats. ==Geology== Ebbor Gorge lies on the southwest- facing slope of the Mendip Hills and consists of a steep-sided ravine cut into 350-million-year-old Carboniferous Limestone of the Dinantian. The gorge was cut into Clifton Down Limestone by meltwater in the Pleistocene Epoch. The lowest part of the gorge is formed in the Namurian Quartzitic Sandstone Group and the South Wales Lower Coal Measures, over which younger limestones have been thrust to the north-east, as demonstrated by the BGS maps (1:50,000 sheet 280, Wells). An example of the rare mineral mendipite was found at the head of the gorge. A stream issuing to the west of the site runs down the tributary valley of Hope Wood before joining the main gorge. The original watercourse which may have cut the gorge into the limestone became diverted underground and now emerges at Wookey Hole Caves to form the River Axe. ==History== Various caves within the gorge were inhabited by neolithic people from which flint tools are held in the Wells and Mendip Museum. One particularly fine flint flake can be seen in the museum at King John's Hunting Lodge in Axbridge. Human and animal bones from the Neolithic were recovered from Outlook Cave in 1907. Bones from the Palaeolithic have been found at Savory's Hole. Several caves occur within the Gorge, of which Bridged Pot and Gully Cave provide some of the best Late Devensian small-mammal assemblages known from Britain. Most of the deposits remain in situ and include steppe pika, Arctic lemming, Norway lemming, various voles, red deer and reindeer. Bronze Age finds include pottery from the Beaker culture, a stone axe and flint knife. ==Current use== Plaque at Ebbor Gorge commemorating the donation of the land A area of the gorge is owned by the National Trust, and managed by Natural England as a national nature reserve. The land was donated to the National Trust by Mrs G.W. Hodgkinson, in 1967, in memory of Winston Churchill. The site was purchased in 1931 by Wookey Hole Caves Ltd. The site is close to Wookey Hole village and caves and offers views across the Somerset Levels to Glastonbury Tor and beyond. There are three marked trails of varying lengths around the steeply wooded gorge, the longest being long, the shortest of which is suitable for wheelchair users. ==Biology and ecology== The path into the gorge Because of the ecology of the area was designated as a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1952. The ground flora is indicative of the calcareous nature of the site, with dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis) being locally dominant. Many of the associated species are characteristic of ancient woodland. Wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and common bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta) are both locally abundant. The valley of the main gorge is humid and provides ideal conditions for fungi and ferns. It contains a substantial assemblage of bryophytes with over 120 species recorded including the nationally rare Bryum canariense and the very rare Amblystegiella confervoides. The varied age and canopy structure of woodland encourages a high diversity of butterflies, nationally scarce species including the white-letter hairstreak (Strymonidia walbum) and high brown fritillary (Fabriciana adippe), while species such as the chalkhill blue (Lysandra coridon) and brown argus (Aricia agestis) occur on the limestone grassland. Greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and lesser horseshoes (Rhinolophus hipposideros) regularly use sites in the Gorge as hibernacular roosts. The site also supports birds of prey and a few red deer. ==References== ==External links== *Natural England website for the Ebbor Gorge NNR Category:Mendip Hills Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Somerset Category:National Trust properties in Somerset Category:National nature reserves in Somerset Category:Canyons and gorges of England Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest notified in 1952 ","title":"Ebbor Gorge"},{"id":"2585813","text":"Serena Harriet Scott Thomas (born 21 September 1961) is an English actress.

Various individuals and political ideologies have speculated on what would define such a world. According to some classical Marxist and some social evolutionary theories, post-capitalist societies may come about as a result of spontaneous evolution as capitalism becomes obsolete. Others propose models to intentionally replace capitalism. The most notable among them are socialism and anarchism. ==History== In 1993, Peter Drucker outlined a possible evolution of capitalistic society in his book Post-Capitalist Society. In 1993, Peter Drucker outlined a possible evolution of capitalistic society in his book Post-Capitalist Society. The book stated that knowledge, rather than capital, land, or labor, is the new basis of wealth. The classes of a fully post-capitalist society are expected to be divided into knowledge workers or service workers, in contrast to the capitalists and proletarians of a capitalist society. In the book, Drucker estimated the transformation to post-capitalism would be completed in 2010–2020. Drucker also argued for rethinking the concept of intellectual property by creating a universal licensing system. Consumers would subscribe for a cost and producers would assume that everything is reproduced and freely distributed through social networks. In 2015, according to Paul Mason the rise of income inequality, repeating cycles of boom and bust and capitalism’s contributions to climate change has led economists, political thinkers and philosophers to begin to seriously consider how a post-capitalistic society would look and function. Post-capitalism is expected to be made possible with further advances in automation and information technology – both of which are effectively causing production costs to trend towards zero. Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams identify a crisis in capitalism's ability and willingness to employ all members of society, arguing that \\"there is a growing population of people that are situated outside formal, waged work, making do with minimal welfare benefits, informal subsistence work, or by illegal means\\"Srnicek, Nick; Williams, Alex. Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work. Verso Books. pp. 103–104. ==Variations== ===Anarchism=== *Anarchist communism, a hybrid of communism and anarchism advocating (among other things) decision making by direct and/or consensus democracy, abolition of the state and abolition of private ownership of the means of production. *Post-scarcity anarchism, an economic system based on social ecology, libertarian municipalism and an abundance of fundamental resources. *Anarcho-syndicalism, an ideology centred on self-management of labour, socialism and direct democracy. === Heritage check system === Robert Heinlein Heritage check system, a socioeconomic plan that retains a market economy, but removes fractional reserve lending power from banks and limits government printing of money to offset deflation with money printed being used to buy materials to back the currency, pay for government programs in lieu of taxes, with the remainder to be split evenly among all citizens to stimulate the economy (termed a \\"heritage check\\" for which the system is named). As presented by the original author of the idea, Robert Heinlein, in his book For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs, the system would be self-reinforcing and eventually result in a regular heritage checks able to provide a modest living for most citizens. ===Economic democracy=== *Economic democracy, a socioeconomic philosophy that establishes democratic control of firms by their workers and social control of investment by a network of public banks. === Participatory economy === In his book Of the People, By the People: The Case for a Participatory Economy, Robin Hahnel describes a post-capitalist economy called the participatory economy. The book ends with the proposal of the Green New Deal, a package of policies that address climate change and financial crises. The participatory economy focuses on the participation of all citizens through the creation of worker councils and consumer councils. Hahnel emphasizes the direct participation of worker and consumers rather than appointing representatives. The councils are concerned with large-scale issues of production and consumption and are broken into various bodies tasked with researching future development projects. In a participatory economy, economic rewards would be offered according to need, the amount of which would be determined democratically by the workers council. Hahnel also calls for \\"economic justice\\" by rewarding people for their effort and diligence rather than accomplishments or prior ownership. A worker’s effort is to be determined by their co-workers. Consumption rights are then rewarded according to the effort ratings. The worker has the choice to decide what they consume using their consumption rights. Hahnel does not address the idea of money, currency, or how consumption rights would be tracked. Planning in a participatory economy is done through the councils. The process is horizontal across the committees as opposed to vertical. All council members, the workers and consumers, participate directly in planning unlike in Soviet-type economies and other democratic planning proposals in which planning is done by representatives. Planning is an iterative procedure, always being changed and improved upon, that is accomplished at the level of either work or consumption. All information and proposals are freely available to everyone, those inside and outside of the council, so that the social cost of each proposal can be determined and voted on. Long-term plans such as structuring public transportation, residential zones and recreational areas, are to be proposed by delegates and approved by direct democracy (i.e. voting by the population). Hahnel argues that a participatory economy will return empathy to our purchasing choices. Capitalism removes the knowledge of how and by whom a product was made: \\"When we eat a salad the market systematically deletes information about the migrant workers who picked it\\". By removing the human element from goods, consumers only consider their own satisfaction and need when consuming products. Introducing worker and consumer councils would reintroduce the knowledge of where, how and by whom products were manufactured. A participatory economy is expected to also introduce more socially oriented goods, such as parks, clean air, and public health care, through the interaction of the two councils. For those that call the participatory economy utopian, Albert and Hahnel counter: === Socialism === Paul Mason Michael Albert Helpful definitions surrounding socialism: *Socialism, an economic system based on public or cooperative ownership of the means of production where production is carried out to directly produce use- value, that includes a moneyless form of accounting such as physical resource accounting or labor-time and based on the direct production of utility rather than on the capitalist laws of accumulation and value. Some models of socialism imply economic planning for the allocation of the factors of production in place of capital markets, while other models of socialism retain market-based allocation of capital goods. Some Marxists believe socialism would eventually in turn evolve into communism. *Planned socialism, a type of socialism where some form of economic planning substitutes markets for allocating the factors of production and for coordinating the economy. There are various types of planning, including central planning and decentralized planning; material balance planning, input-output planning and computerized planning. *Market socialism, a type of socialism based on socialization and public or cooperative ownership of the means of production, but retains monetary calculation and market competition and utilizes markets as the primary way of allocating the factors of production. *Communalism, a political theory based on the writings of Murray Bookchin. Bookchin developed Communalism after he broke with anarchism believing it to be individualist and lifestylist. It is based on libertarian municipalism, confederalism and social ecology. This school of thought has also given rise to democratic confederalism. Socialism often implies common ownership of companies and a planned economy, though as an inherently pluralistic ideology, it is argued whether either are essential features.Wright, Tony (1986) Socialisms: theories and practices. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. . In his book PostCapitalism: A Guide to our Future, Paul Mason argues that centralized planning, even with the advanced technology of today, is unachievable. Rejecting central planning as both technically unachievable and undesirable, Michael Albert and Robin Hahnel argue that democratic planning provides a viable basis for creating a participatory economy. In UK politics, strands of Corbynism and the Labour party have adopted this ‘postcapitalist’ tendency.Pitts, F. and Dinerstein, A. (2017). Corbynism’s conveyor belt of ideas: Postcapitalism and the politics of social reproduction. Capital & Class, 41(3), pp.423-434. == Technology as a driver of post-capitalism == Much of the speculation surrounding the proposed fate of the capitalist system stems from predictions about the future integration of technology into economics. The evolution and increasing sophistication of both automation and information technology is said to threaten jobs and highlight internal contradictions in Capitalism which will allegedly ultimately lead to its collapse. === Automation === David Graeber Technological change which has driven unemployment has historically been as a result of ‘mechanical-muscle’ machines which have reduced the need for human labour. Just as horses were once employed but were gradually made obsolete by the invention of the automobile, humans' jobs have also been affected throughout history. A modern example of this technological unemployment is the replacement of retail cashiers by self-service checkouts. The invention and development of ‘mechanical-mind’ processes or “brain labour” is thought to threaten jobs at an unprecedented scale, with Oxford Professors Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne estimating that 47 percent of US jobs are at risk of automation. If this leads to a world where human labour is no longer needed then our current market system models, which rely on scarcity, may have to adapt or fail. It is argued that this has been a factor in the creation of many of what David Graeber calls 'bullshit jobs', where, in large bureaucracies, production of anything is not the goal, but exist solely for reasons such as providing sociological benefit to the manager employing them. === Information technology === Post-capitalism is said to be possible due to major changes information technology has brought about in recent years. It has blurred the edges between work and free time and loosened the relationship between work and wages. Significantly, information is corroding the market’s ability to form prices correctly. Information is abundant and information goods are freely replicable. Goods such as music, software or databases do have a production cost, but once made can be copied/pasted infinitely. If the normal price mechanism of capitalism prevails, then the price of any good which has essentially no cost of reproduction will fall towards zero. This lack of scarcity is a problem for our models, which try to counter by developing monopolies in the form of giant tech companies to keep information scarce and commercial. But many significant commodities in the digital economy are now free and open-source, such as Linux, Firefox, and Wikipedia. ==See also== * Anti-capitalism * Commons-based peer production * Critique of capitalism * Distributism * Economic history of the world * Eco-communalism * Evolutionary economics * Late capitalism * P2P economic system * Post-democracy * Post- scarcity economy * Post-work society * Resource-based economy * Sharing economy * Socialist calculation debate * Social evolution * * The Venus Project * The Zeitgeist Movement * Historical materialism ==References== ==Further reading== * Albert, Michael.

While attending music school in 1996, Michael asked Christopher to record solos for his new melodic death metal project Arch Enemy. The Black Earth album was released in Japan in 1996, and received regular airplay on Japanese MTV. The band were invited to play Japan in 1997, and it was there that Christopher secured a deal for his Armageddon side project. The project began as a melodic death metal band, similar in style to Arch Enemy. Armageddon released their first album Crossing the Rubicon on W.A.R. records in 1997. The album featured Peter Wildoer and Martin Bengtsson, who would also go on to record Stigmata with Arch Enemy in 1998. The Stigmata album was again a success in Japan, and was the first Arch Enemy album to be released in the USA, on Century Media records. With Arch Enemy gaining ground worldwide, Amott would go on to release Burning Bridges and Burning Japan Live 1999, both in 1999, then take a break until the latter part of 2000, when Armageddon released their second album Embrace the Mystery on Toy's Factory records in Japan. This time featuring a \\"melodic\\" singer, and more of an overall power metal feel, the album was a drastic shift from the straight ahead melodic death metal of Crossing the Rubicon, and marked Christopher's desire to branch out of the \\"extreme metal\\" genre. Also in 2000, he played a guitar solo on \\"Suburban Me\\" on the album Clayman with In Flames. In 2001, Arch Enemy were joined by singer Angela Gossow, and released Wages of Sin. After completing an extensive world tour with Arch Enemy, Amott returned to his Armageddon project, and released Three in 2002 on Toy's Factory records in Japan. This time featuring Christopher on lead vocals, the album was almost purely a power metal effort, focusing on the melodic singing and guitar work of Amott. Arch Enemy released Anthems of Rebellion in 2003, and again embarked on a world tour. In 2005, the band entered the studio to record Doomsday Machine, but immediately after the recording, Amott left Arch Enemy. He spent the next two years teaching music in Sweden, as well as attending a university. In March 2007, he announced his return to Arch Enemy as a permanent member. He re- joined the band near the end of the songwriting process for Rise of the Tyrant. In an interview in January 2010, Amott said that he would be releasing a solo album early in the year entitled \\"Follow Your Heart\\". On 5 March 2012 Amott once again quit Arch Enemy. He cited his desire to pursue his solo career further as the main reason. He was replaced with Arsis guitarist Nick Cordle. In April 2012, he moved to New York City, United States. After obtaining a green card in the beginning of 2013, he stated that he intended to record a new Armageddon record, which was planned to be released by summer 2013. Amott also collaborated with Japanese pop/metal band Babymetal, providing guitars for an alternate version of their major label debut single, \\"Ijime, Dame, Zettai\\" nicknamed the \\"Nemesis\\" version (possibly named after the Arch Enemy song of the same name). In 2014, Amott began recording for the new Armageddon album with a new lineup consisting of himself, vocalist Matt Hallquist, guitarist Joey Concepcion, bassist Sara Claudius, and drummer Márton Veress. Their new album, entitled \\"Captivity & Devourment\\", is set to be released in January 2015 on Listenable Records. Now enlisted Meridian Dawn/ex-Nightrage vocalist Antony Hämäläinen as their replacement for the recently departed Matt Hallquist. During Arch Enemy's North American tour in support of their album War Eternal, guitarist Nick Cordle reportedly left the band. Amott temporarily re-joined the band for the remainder of the tour, while famed guitarist Jeff Loomis (formerly of Nevermore) was announced as the official replacement and joined the band for their European tour with Kreator and subsequent events. On 10 October 2015 as part of Japan's Loud Park Festival, Arch Enemy vocalist Alissa White-Gluz invited special guests Amott and Johan Liiva to the stage, reuniting the Burning Bridges lineup. They would go on to perform \\"Bury Me an Angel\\" and \\"The Immortal\\", before being joined by White-Gluz and Jeff Loomis to perform \\"Fields of Desolation\\" together. While Armageddon and Arch Enemy were touring together in Mexico 2016. Amott made a guest appearance on Arch Enemy and performed two songs, \\"Revolution Begins\\" and \\"Blood On Your Hands\\". Starting 23 May 2016 Amott along with the original Arch Enemy lineup reunited as Project Black Earth and made a special tour in Japan. The band performed the Black Earth album in its entirety. Songs from Stigmata and Burning Bridges were also played. The tour lasted for about a week. In 2017 Amott joined Dark Tranquillity temporarily to help out the band with their European tour, and continued to tour with them throughout 2018 in Europe and North America. As of March 30th, 2020 Amott joined Dark Tranquility, replacing original guitarist Niklas Sundin. ==Discography== ===Arch Enemy=== * Black Earth (1996) * Stigmata (1998) * Burning Bridges (1999) * Burning Japan Live 1999 (1999) * Wages of Sin (2001) * Burning Angel (2002) * Anthems of Rebellion (2003) * Dead Eyes See No Future (2004, EP) * Doomsday Machine (2005) * Live Apocalypse (2006, 2-disc DVD) * Rise of the Tyrant (2007) * Tyrants of the Rising Sun (2008) * The Root of All Evil (2009) *Khaos Legions (2011) ===Armageddon=== * Crossing the Rubicon (1997) * Embrace the Mystery (2000) * Three (2002) * Captivity & Devourment (2015) * Crossing the Rubicon (Revisited) (2016) ===Solo=== * Follow Your Heart (2010) * Impulses (2012) ==References== * ==External links== * Official artist page on Facebook * Caparison Dellinger CA Pro.

It opened in 1961 and is a part of the Tacoma Public School District. The school's mascot is the Thunderbird. ==History== Mount Tahoma opened its doors in the South Tacoma neighborhood in 1961. It is named after the Native American name for Mount Rainier. The school was built by a California contractor in the 1960s and wasn't very accommodating for its Washington students. The original school layout consisted of three open air courtyards, with a college style open campus. Frequently, students carried parkas or umbrellas from class to class. 2004 was the last year that students would be in the original Mount Tahoma building. Students and staff moved to the new building, which fit more with the Pacific Northwest weather. ==New Building== Built in 1961, the setting of Mount Tahoma High School drastically changed in September 2004. The school is located on 74th Street and overlooks Mount Rainier (which is the namesake for Mt. Tahoma.) The new campus features 93 teaching spaces, including 81 classrooms, eight technology labs, wireless networking throughout the building, a 600-seat performance arts theatre, two gymnasiums, a pool, weight room, aerobics room, athletic fields and a 3,500 seat stadium. The offices are located in the front of the main entrance and are connected to the large 900-seat commons. There are 9 science classrooms with a 90-foot greenhouse and nursery. Mount Tahoma's counseling center is the hub of career activities, which enable students to access college information and career opportunities.http://www.tacoma.k12.wa.us/perf/MtTahoma2005-06.pdf

Named to honor the Chickasaw Indian Nation, who were relocated to the area from the Southeastern United States during the 1830s (and who later sold the original of land for the park to the Federal government), the park's springs, streams, and lakes provide opportunities for swimming, boating, fishing, picnicking, camping, and hiking, among other activities. As part of the Chickasaw tribe's arrangement with the U.S. government, the park does not charge an admission fee. ==History== CCC stone work at Hillside Spring. When the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes were forced to move from their former lands in the southeastern United States, they found an area within the new Chickasaw nation that contained a number of natural fresh and mineral springs that they believed had healing powers. Fearing that developers would turn the springs into a private resort, as had happened earlier at Hot Springs, Arkansas, the Chickasaw sold a 640-acre parcel to the U. S.

A narrow road circles the district, passing by parking areas, camp and picnic grounds, the Travertine Nature Center, swimming holes, springs, and a bison pasture. Travertine Creek, joined by Rock Creek, flows through the district, rising in Antelope Springs and Buffalo Springs at the eastern end of the park. The springs produce 5 million gallons per day (20 million liters) of cool, crystal clear-water and form Travertine Creek which is joined by Rock Creek about 2 miles from its source. A number of other fresh water and mineral springs contribute to Travertine and Rock Creek as they flow through Travertine District, dropping in small waterfalls over several ledges. Several miles of walking and biking trails wind through the heavily forested creek bottomland. Very popular and often crowded in summer, the Travertine district has been described as an oasis in the Oklahoma prairie.\\"Chickasaw National Recreation Area\\" Visitors Guide, National Park Service.

The scenic lake is a principal water supply reservoir for the city of Ardmore, some 30 mi (48 km) to the southwest. Lake of the Arbuckles was built by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1966 by impounding Rock Creek. Water quality and clarity are excellent. The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation has rated the lake as the best for bass fishing in the state.http://www.travelok.com/listings/view.profile/id.4362 accessed on 6-28-2010 The lake features 36 miles of shoreline. Fishing is permitted year- round for crappie, catfish, largemouth bass, white bass and bluegill. Facilities include three campgrounds for tents and RVs, picnic areas, public restrooms, boat docks and ramps, and several miles of multi-use trails. Hunting is also allowed, and typically hunted species are quail, turkey, squirrel, rabbit, dove, ducks, geese, and deer. However, due to heavy hunting pressure and small area size, game is declining and trapping is prohibited. Hunting regulations and certain special rules (such as not killing male deer), are designed to regulate the hunt. ==See also== *List of National Historic Landmarks in Oklahoma *National Register of Historic Places listings in Murray County, Oklahoma ==References== * The National Parks: Index 2001-2003.

He was appointed to the Privy Council in 1960. Amery was created a life peer upon his retirement from the House of Commons in 1992. For three decades, he was a leading figure in the Conservative Monday Club and the son-in-law of Conservative prime minister Harold Macmillan. His brother, John, was hanged for high treason for supporting Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy during the Second World War. ==Early and family life== Amery was born in Chelsea, London. His father was Leo Amery, a British statesman and Conservative politician. He was educated at Eaton House, Summer Fields School, Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford. While an undergraduate, he had a brief romance with the novelist Barbara Pym, who was six years his senior. ==Military service== Before the Second World War started, Amery was a war correspondent in the Spanish Civil War and later an attaché for the British Foreign Office in Belgrade. After the war began, he joined the RAF as a sergeant in 1940 then was commissioned and transferred to the British Army on the General List in 1941, reaching the rank of Captain. He spent 1941–42 in the eastern Mediterranean (the Middle East, Malta, Yugoslavia) and served as Liaison Officer to the Albanian Resistance Movement in 1943–44 (\\"The Musketeers\\": Captain Julian Amery, Major David Smiley and Lieutenant-Colonel Neil McLean). The following year, Amery went to China to work with General Carton de Wiart, then Prime Minister's Personal Representative to Generalissimo Chiang Kai- shek. Amery became a close friend of King Zog of Albania and described him as \\"the cleverest man I have ever met\\".Amery, Julian, Approach March: a Venture in Autobiography. Hutchinson, 1973 ==Political career== Amery won a Parliamentary seat in the first general election held after he returned to civilian life, in 1950. He was elected as Conservative MP for Preston North, going on to hold a number of government offices, all in governments led by his father-in-law, now the Prime Minister. He began with two Under-Secretaryships of State: for War (1957–58) and for the Colonies (1958–60). He was promoted to Secretary of State for Air (1960–62), followed by a promotion to the post of Minister of Aviation (1962–64). In this role, Amery played a major role in developing the supersonic passenger service known as Concorde. Amery lost his seat in 1966, but was elected again in 1969 for Brighton Pavilion, a seat he would hold until 1992 when he retired. On 8 July 1992, he was created a life peer as Baron Amery of Lustleigh, of Preston in the County of Lancashire and of Brighton in the County of East Sussex. Under the Heath administration, Amery held three ministerial posts: Minister for Public Works (1970), Minister for Housing and Construction (1970–72) and Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (1972–74). ===Monday Club=== For 30 years, Julian Amery was an active member and later a Patron of the Conservative Monday Club, where he became friendly with General Sir Walter Walker, subsequently writing the foreword for Walker's anti-Soviet book, The Next Domino. He was Guest of Honour at the Club's Annual Dinner at the Cutlers' Hall in 1963. In 1965, he wrote the foreword for Club activist Geoffrey Stewart-Smith's book, No Vision Here. On May Day 1970, he was one of the Club's principal speakers at their 'Law and Liberty' rally in Trafalgar Square, held in answer to the 'Stop the Seventy Tour' campaign, designed to stop the South African cricket tour. Julian Amery was the Monday Club's Guest-of-Honour at their Annual Dinner held at the Savoy Hotel, London, in January 1974 and again at the dinner at the end of the Club's two-day Conference in Birmingham in March 1975. ===Political views=== Amery was in favour of entry to the European Common Market and also of the nuclear deterrent. Both caused some discord between himself and his old friend Enoch Powell. But for many, he was seen as an archetypal \\"God and Empire\\" Conservative. In late 1962 Amery made these comments after Egypt sent troops to Yemen to prevent an insurrection: > \\"The prosperity of our people rests really on the oil in the Persian Gulf, > the rubber and tin of Malaya, and the gold, copper and precious metals of > South- and Central Africa. As long as we have access to these; as long as we > can realize the investments we have there; as long as we trade with this > part of the world, we shall be prosperous. If the communists [or anyone > else] were to take them over, we would lose the lot. Governments like > Colonel Nasser's in Egypt are just as dangerous.\\" In 1963, Amery took charge of Quintin Hogg's campaign for leadership of the Conservative Party.cf.Heffer, 189; 324 In early 1975, he took part in a House of Commons debate on the Trades Unions Congress's invitation to Alexander Shelepin, the former Soviet KGB Chief, to visit Britain. He stated that \\"more and more people are beginning to look upon the TUC as a Communist-penetrated show and this invitation must strengthen that view.\\" According to Margaret Thatcher's 1995 memoir, The Path to Power, when Harold Wilson's Labour government proposed devolution for Scotland in 1976, \\"Julian Amery and Maurice Macmillan proved effective leaders of the anti-devolution Tory camp.\\" Although he was Harold Macmillan's son-in-law, he failed to defend him when Count Nikolai Tolstoy published The Minister and the Massacres in 1986, focusing the ultimate burden of blame sharply on Macmillan for the 1945 Bleiburg repatriations and the Cossack repatriations. Amery stated that the repatriations were \\"one of the few blots on Harold that I can think of\\". ==Personal life== On 26 January 1950, he married Catherine Macmillan (19 November 1926 - 27 May 1991), daughter of Harold Macmillan. The couple had one son and three daughters. ==Death== Amery died on 3 September 1996 in Westminster, London. He is buried with his wife (who predeceased him) at the Church of St John the Baptist in Lustleigh, Devon. ==Notes== ;Citations ;Bibliography * Copping, Robert, The Story of The Monday Club – The First Decade, April 1972 (P/B); and The Monday Club – Crisis and After (Foreword by John Biggs-Davison, M.P.), May 1975, (P/B), pps:12 & 24, published by the Current Affairs Information Service. * Amery, Julian, M.P., et al., Rhodesia and the Threat to the West Monday Club, London, 1976 (P/B). * Gash, Norman, with Donald Southgate, David Dilks, and John Ramsden; introduction by Lord Butler, K.G.,P.C., The Conservatives – A History of their Origins to 1965 London, 1977, pps:268-9. * Amery, Julian, PC, MP, The Next Four Years, in the Primrose League Gazette, vol.87, no.4, October 1983, London. * Amery, Julian, MP, The Rt.

Reportedly, Armstrong looked so much like Harrison Ford that the crewmembers on the films were constantly mistaking him for Ford. This proved useful when Ford injured his back and had to sit out for filming crucial action sequences in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Armstrong filled in for him. The stunt where he jumps from a horse onto a German tank in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was voted one of the Top Ten film stunts of all time by a panel of experts and Sky Movies viewers in the UK in 2002. On a private photograph taken on the film set, Ford wrote to Armstrong, \\"If you learn to talk I'm in deep trouble!\\"Vicarmstrong.com Armstrong was unable to work on the fourth Indiana Jones film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull due to commitments to The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. However, he had discussed possible action sequences with Steven Spielberg during production of War of the Worlds. Armstrong is a famed stunt coordinator and action unit director, notable for (amongst others) the action sequences of several James Bond films, War of the Worlds, and I Am Legend. Armstrong was also the opening scene director on Terminator 2: Judgment Day. In 1993, Armstrong's made his directorial debut with action film Joshua Tree (a.k.a. Army of One) starring Dolph Lundgren, George Segal, Kristian Alfonso and Ken Foree. In the film, is about Wellman Anthony Santee (Lundgren), a former racecar driver who has turned to hauling exotic stolen cars with his friend Eddie Turner (Foree). One day he is framed by police officer Frank Severance (Segal) for the murder of a highway patrolman, also killing his friend Eddie. Santee is sent to prison after recovering in a prison hospital, but escapes during transfer and takes a female hostage named Rita Marrick (Alfonso) at a gas station, not suspecting that she's a cop. On the run from the law, involving exotic cars and desert scenery, Santee must prove his innocence and prove Severance guilty of being involved in the car ring and for murder. Much of the film was filmed in the Alabama Hills of the Sierra Nevada and the desert of the Joshua Tree National Park of southeast California. In 2012, Armstrong was Second Unit Director for The Amazing Spider-Man. In 2013, he signed on to direct Left Behind, a remake of the series that got released in 2014. His next directorial effort was the true story A Sunday Horse. == Awards == In 2001 he received a Technical Achievement Academy Award for \\"the Fan Descender for accurately and safely arresting the descent of stunt persons in high freefalls\\".http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1438457680822https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000003/2001 In 2002 he received the BAFTA Michael Balcon Award.https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000123/2002 == Personal == Armstrong is the brother of Andy Armstrong and husband of stuntwoman Wendy Leech who is the daughter of fellow James Bond stunt performer George Leech.

In 2000 she was declared a saint by the Catholic Church. ==Early life== She was born around 1869 in Darfur (now in western Sudan) in the village of Olgossa, west of Nyala and close to Mount Agilerei.Dagnino, p.10. The map of Sudan here shows the village of Olgossa (Algozney in the Daju tongue) \\"slightly west\\" of the 3,042 m (9,980 feet) Jebel Marrah and of the 785 m Jebel Agilerei. Although, on p. 37, she seems to place Olgossa about 40 km north-east of Nyala. She was of the Daju people;Dagnino, pp. 23-25. her respected and reasonably prosperous father was brother of the village chief. She was surrounded by a loving family of three brothers and three sisters; as she says in her autobiography: \\"I lived a very happy and carefree life, without knowing what suffering (was)\\".Bakhita in Dagnino, p. 37 In 1877, when she was 7–8 years old, she was seized by Arab slave traders, who had abducted her elder sister two years earlier. She was forced to walk barefoot about to El-Obeid and was sold and bought twice before she arrived there. Over the course of twelve years (1877–1889) she was sold three more times and then given away. Bakhita was not the name she received from her parents at birth. It is said that the trauma of her abduction caused her to forget her own name; she took one given to her by the slavers, bakhita, Arabic for 'lucky' or 'fortunate'.O'Malley, p. 32.Dagnino, pp. 29-32. Every slave was always given a new name. Bakhita herself never mentions this incident. She was also forcibly converted to Islam.Murchison, p. 7 ==Life as a slave== In El-Obeid, Bakhita was bought by a rich Arab who used her as a maid for his two daughters. They liked her and treated her well. But after offending one of her owner's sons, possibly by breaking a vase, the son lashed and kicked her so severely that she spent more than a month unable to move from her straw bed. Her fourth owner was a Turkish general, and she had to serve his mother-in-law and his wife, who were cruel to their slaves. Bakhita says: \\"During all the years I stayed in that house, I do not recall a day that passed without some wound or other. When a wound from the whip began to heal, other blows would pour down on me.\\"Bakhita in Dagnino, p. 49. She says that the most terrifying of all of her memories there was when she (along with other slaves) was marked by a process resembling both scarification and tattooing, which was a traditional practice throughout Sudan.Burns and Butler, p. 53. As her mistress was watching her with a whip in her hand, a dish of white flour, a dish of salt and a razor were brought by a woman. She used the flour to draw patterns on her skin and then she cut deeply along the lines before filling the wounds with salt to ensure permanent scarring. A total of 114 intricate patterns were cut into her breasts, belly and into her right arm.Dagnino, pp. 52-53 By the end of 1882, El-Obeid came under the threat of an attack of Mahdist revolutionaries.Mahdist Revolution (1881-1898), was an Islamic revolt against the Ottoman-Egyptian rule of Sudan, begun by Islamic fundamentalist cleric Muhammad Ahmad. El-Obeid fell on 19 January 1883, Khartoum on 26 January 1885. The Mahdi Ahmad himself died on 1885 June 22. The Turkish general began making preparations to return to his homeland and sold his slaves. In 1883 Bakhita was bought in Khartoum by the Italian Vice Consul Callisto Legnani, who treated her kindly and did not beat or punish her. Two years later, when Legnani himself had to return to Italy, Bakhita begged to go with him. At the end of 1884 they escaped from besieged Khartoum with a friend, Augusto Michieli. They travelled a risky trip on camel back to Suakin, which was the largest port of Sudan. In March 1885 they left Suakin for Italy and arrived at the port of Genoa in April. They were met there by Augusto Michieli's wife Signora Maria Turina Michieli. Callisto Legnani gave ownership of Bakhita to Turina Michieli. Bakhita's new owners took her to their family villa at Zianigo, near Mirano, Veneto, about west of Venice. She lived there for three years and became nanny to the Michieli's daughter Alice, known as Mimmina, born in February 1886. The Michielis brought Bakhita with them to the Sudan where they stayed for nine months before returning to Italy. ==Conversion to Catholicism and freedom== Suakin on the Red Sea was besieged but remained in Anglo-Egyptian hands. Augusto Michieli acquired a large hotel there and decided to sell his property in Italy and to move his family to Sudan permanently. Selling his house and lands took longer than expected. By the end of 1888, Signora Turina Michieli wanted to see her husband in Sudan even though land transactions were not finished. Since the villa in Zianigo was already sold, Bakhita and Mimmina needed a temporary place to stay while Turina went to Sudan without them. On the advice of their business agent Illuminato Cecchini, on 29 November 1888, Turina Michieli left them in the care of the Canossian Sisters in Venice. There, cared for and instructed by the Sisters, Bakhita encountered Christianity for the first time. Grateful to her teachers, she recalled, \\"Those holy mothers instructed me with heroic patience and introduced me to that God who from childhood I had felt in my heart without knowing who He was.\\"Zanini, Roberto Italo (2013). Bakhita: From Slave to Saint, p. 81. . Ignatius Press, San Francisco. When Mrs. Michieli returned to take her daughter and maid back to Suakin, Bakhita firmly refused to leave. For three days Mrs. Michieli tried to force the issue, finally appealing to the king's attorney general; while the superior of the Institute for baptismal candidates (catechumenate) that Bakhita attended contacted the cardinal of Venice about her protegée's problem. On 29 November 1889 an Italian court ruled that because the British had induced Sudan to outlaw slavery before Bakhita's birth and because Italian law did not recognize slavery, Bakhita had never legally been a slave.Wikipedia Italiana For the first time in her life, Bakhita found herself in control of her own destiny. She chose to remain with the Canossians.O'Malley, pp. 33-34. On 9 January 1890 Bakhita was baptized with the names of Josephine Margaret and Fortunata (which is the Latin translation for the Arabic Bakhita). On the same day she was also confirmed and received Holy Communion from Archbishop Giuseppe Sarto, the Cardinal Patriarch of Venice, the future Pope Pius X. ==Canossian Sister== Church of the Holy Family, Schio On 7 December 1893 Josephine Bakhita entered the novitiate of the Canossian Sisters and on 8 December 1896 she took her vows, welcomed by Cardinal Sarto. In 1902 she was assigned to the Canossian convent at Schio, in the northern Italian province of Vicenza, where she spent the rest of her life. Her only extended time away was between 1935 and 1939, when she stayed at the Missionary Novitiate in Vimercate (Milan); mostly visiting other Canossian communities in Italy, talking about her experiences and helping to prepare young sisters for work in Africa.Burns and Butler, p. 54. A strong missionary drive animated her throughout her entire life - \\"her mind was always on God, and her heart in Africa\\".Dagnino, p. 99 During her 42 years in Schio, Bakhita was employed as the cook, sacristan and portress (door keeper) and was in frequent contact with the local community. Her gentleness, calming voice, and ever-present smile became well known and Vicenzans still refer to her as Sor Moretta (\\"little brown sister\\") or Madre Moretta (\\"black mother\\"). Her special charisma and reputation for sanctity were noticed by her order; the first publication of her story (Storia Meravigliosa by Ida Zanolini) in 1931, made her famous throughout Italy.Davis, Cyprian (1986).\\"Black Catholic Theology: A Historical Perspective\\", Theological Studies 61 (2000), pp. 656–671.O'Malley, p. 34. During the Second World War (1939–1945) she shared the fears and hopes of the town people, who considered her a saint and felt protected by her mere presence. Bombs did not spare Schio, but the war passed without a single casualty. Her last years were marked by pain and sickness. She used a wheelchair but she retained her cheerfulness, and if asked how she was, she would always smile and answer: \\"As the Master desires.\\" In the extremity of her last hours her mind was driven back to the years of her slavery and she cried out: \\"The chains are too tight, loosen them a little, please!\\" After a while she came round again. Someone asked her, \\"How are you? Today is Saturday,\\" probably hoping that this would cheer her because Saturday is the day of the week dedicated to Mary, mother of Jesus. Bakhita replied, \\"Yes, I am so happy: Our Lady ... Our Lady!\\" These were her last audible words.Dagnino, p. 104 Bakhita died at 8:10 PM on 8 February 1947. For three days her body lay on display while thousands of people arrived to pay their respects. Her remains were transferred to the Church of the Holy Family of the Canossian convent of Schio in 1969. ==Legacy and canonization== A young student once asked Bakhita: \\"What would you do, if you were to meet your captors?\\" Without hesitation she responded: \\"If I were to meet those who kidnapped me, and even those who tortured me, I would kneel and kiss their hands. For, if these things had not happened, I would not have been a Christian and a religious today\\".Dagnino, p. 113. The petitions for her canonization began immediately, and the process officially commenced by Pope John XXIII in 1959, only twelve years after her death. On 1 December 1978, Pope John Paul II declared Josephine Venerable, the first step towards canonization. On 17 May 1992, she was declared Blessed and given February 8 as her feast day. On 1 October 2000, she was canonized as Saint Josephine Bakhita. She is venerated as a modern African saint, and as a statement against the brutal history of slavery. She has been adopted as the patron saint of Sudan and human trafficking survivors. Bakhita's legacy is that transformation is possible through suffering. Her story of deliverance from physical slavery also symbolises all those who find meaning and inspiration in her life for their own deliverance from spiritual slavery. In May 1992 news of her beatification was banned by Khartoum which Pope John Paul II then personally visited only nine months later.Hutchison, p. 7 On 10 February 1993, he solemnly honoured Bakhita on her own soil. \\"Rejoice, all of Africa! Bakhita has come back to you. The daughter of Sudan sold into slavery as a living piece of merchandise and yet still free. Free with the freedom of the saints.\\"John Paul II, Homily at the Eucharistic Concelebration in honour of Josephine Bakhita, Khartoum, 10 February 1993. Pope Benedict XVI, on 30 November 2007, in the beginning of his second encyclical letter Spe Salvi (In Hope We Were Saved), relates her entire life story as an outstanding example of the Christian hope.Benedict XVI, Encyclical \\"Spe salvi\\", November 30, 2007 ==Citations== == Bibliography == * African Online News (2000).

The word is a portmanteau of the words mass and prestige and has been described as \\"prestige for the masses\\". The term was popularized by Michael Silverstein and Neil Fiske in their book Trading Up and Harvard Business Review article \\"Luxury for the Masses\\". Masstige products are defined as \\"premium but attainable\\", and there are two key tenets: (1) They are considered luxury or premium products and (2) They have price points that fill the gap between mid-market and super premium. Silverstein and Fiske cite several examples: * Bath and Body Works Lotion that sells for $1.13 per ounce versus $0.30 per ounce. * Pottery Barn housewares that are considered premium but are widely available at attainable price points well below super premium brands. * Kendall-Jackson Wines that entered the market at $5 per bottle versus the standard $2 per bottle. * Porsche Boxster Several other examples of masstige brand positioning have been proposed by Truon, McColl, and Kitchen include: * BMW 1 Series for $19,000 vs. traditional BMW sedans for $50,000 * Armani Jeans for $100 vs. Armani Haute Couture for $900 * Tag Heuer Formula 1 for $550 vs. Tag Heuer Link for $4,000 ==History== According to the Oxford Dictionary Online, the term originated during the 1990s. It was then popularized in 2003 by Michael Silverstein and Neil Fiske in their book Trading Up and Harvard Business Review article \\"Luxury for the Masses\\". Masstige' movement gains steam\\" by Moly Prior characterizes the product trends for the health and beauty care industries with the term. Since 2003, the marketing strategy of masstige has been used by numerous consumer goods industries that include premium level products. ==Masstige market positioning== Kitchen, a reasonable equilibrium between perceived prestige and price premium is critical to an effective masstige strategy. That is to say that masstige brand positioning for the consumer is to develop the brand as a premium, or reasonable level of perceived prestige yet whose price point is similar to middle-range brands as outlined in the diagram below. New luxury brands are closer to traditional brands in terms of prestige, however in terms of price they are closer to middle range brands. Established brands command a premium at 3.1 times more expensive than new luxury brands (masstige positioning), and new luxury brands only sold for 2.2 times more than middle range brands. In terms of perceived prestige, the ratio of traditional luxury brands and new luxury brands was 1.14, while the ratio of new luxury brands and middle-range brands was 1.74. Those brands that employed masstige positioning strategy effectively differentiated themselves from middle range brands in terms of perceived prestige, and yet maintained a reasonable price premium to target middle range customers. ==Brand dilution== It has been suggested that luxury marketers thinking about developing their own masstige strategies should be aware of the possibility for brand dilution. To avoid this, it is suggested that adequate price premiums are maintained and access is limited to middle class consumers as brand dilution tends to occur when purchases from middle class consumers becomes frequent or habitual. The more available a product is the less prestigious its perception. Luxury marketers should also focus on developing a prestigious environment around the brand by advertising in glamorous magazines and prestigious stores, and holding seasonal fashion shows so that the brand appeals to consumers as an \\"aspirational\\" brand. ==References== Category:Brand management ","title":"Masstige"},{"id":"2585883","text":"Knees with very little taper A bald cypress exhibiting tapered knees A cypress knee is a distinctive structure forming above the roots of a cypress tree of any of various species of the subfamily Taxodioideae. Their function is unknown, but they are generally seen on trees growing in swamps. Some current hypotheses state that they might help to aerate the tree's roots, create a barrier to catch sediment and reduce erosion, assist in anchoring the tree in the soft and muddy soil, or any combination thereof. Knees are woody projections sent above the normal water level, roughly vertically from the roots, with a near-right-angle bend taking them vertically upward through water. One early assumption of their function was that they provided oxygen to the roots that grow in the low dissolved oxygen (DO) waters typical of a swamp, acting as pneumatophores: mangroves have similar adaptations. There is little actual evidence for this assertion; in fact, swamp-dwelling specimens whose knees are removed continue to thrive, and laboratory tests demonstrate that the knees are not effective at depleting oxygen in a sealed chamber. Even though there is no expert consensus on their role, the supposition that they are pneumatophores is repeated without comment in several introductory botany textbooks. Another more likely function is that of structural buttressed support and stabilization. Lowland or swamp-grown cypresses found in flooded or flood-prone areas tend to be buttressed and \\"kneed,\\" as opposed to cypresses grown on higher ground, which may grow with very little taper.

It was released on August 29, 2005, by Def Jam Recordings. Prior to signing with Def Jam, Rihanna was discovered by record producer Evan Rogers in Barbados, who helped Rihanna record demo tapes to send out to several record labels. Jay-Z, the former chief executive officer (CEO) and president of Def Jam, was given Rihanna's demo by Jay Brown, his A&R; at Def Jam, and invited her to audition for the label after hearing what turned out to be her first single, \\"Pon de Replay\\". She auditioned for Jay-Z and L.A. Reid, the former CEO and president of record label group The Island Def Jam Music Group, and was signed on the spot to prevent her from signing with another record label. After Rihanna was signed by Jay-Z, she continued to work with Rogers and his production partner Carl Sturken, as well as other music producers such as Poke and Tone, D. \\"Supa Dups\\" Chin-quee and Stargate. Music of the Sun features vocals from Canadian rapper Kardinal Offishall, music group J-Status, and Jamaican singer Vybz Kartel. Its music incorporates Caribbean music such as dancehall and reggae, as well as dance-pop and R&B; ballads. Music of the Sun received generally mixed reviews from music critics, some of whom complimented its dancehall and Caribbean-inspired songs, while others criticized some of the production. Commercially, the album was a modest success, debuting at number ten on the US Billboard 200 and number six on the US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums. In addition, it peaked within the top 40 of album charts in Germany, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It produced two singles - \\"Pon de Replay\\" and \\"If It's Lovin' that You Want\\" - the former of which peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the US Dance Club Songs. Music of the Sun was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Rihanna promoted the album along with her next release with her debut concert tour, Rihanna: Live in Concert. ==Background== Def Jam, Rihanna performed a cover of Whitney Houston's \\"For the Love of You\\" for then Def Jam chairman Jay-Z. Before signing to Def Jam Recordings, Rihanna was discovered in her home country Barbados by American record producer Evan Rogers. The two met in December 2003 through mutual friends of Rihanna's and Rogers' wife, while the couple was on vacation in Barbados. After meeting for the first time, Rogers asked Rihanna to come to his hotel room, where she performed renditions of Destiny's Child's \\"Emotion\\" and Mariah Carey's \\"Hero\\". Rihanna's renditions impressed Rogers, who then took her to New York City, where she was accompanied by her mother to record some demo tapes which could be sent to record labels. She recorded the demo over the next year intermittently, due to Rihanna only being able to record during school holidays. At the age of 16, Rihanna was signed to Rogers' and Carl Sturken's production company, Syndicated Rhythm Productions, who assigned her a lawyer and manager, before the completed demo tape was distributed to various record labels around the world in late 2004. The first to respond to the demo tape was Jay-Z, who had recently been appointed as president and CEO of Def Jam Recordings. Rihanna auditioned for him and music mogul L.A. Reid in his office. Looking back on the audition and meeting Jay-Z, Rihanna explained in an interview how she felt before walking into the room, saying: \\"That's when I really got nervous..... I was like: 'Oh God, he's right there, I can't look, I can't look, I can't look!' I remember being extremely quiet. I was very shy. I was cold the entire time. I had butterflies. I'm sitting across from Jay-Z. Like, Jay-Zee. I was star-struck.\\" During the audition, Rihanna performed Whitney Houston's cover of \\"For the Love of You\\", as well as \\"Pon de Replay\\" and \\"The Last Time\\", which were written and produced by Rogers and Sturken and would be included on her debut album Music of the Sun. Jay-Z was initially skeptical about signing Rihanna after he felt \\"Pon de Replay\\" was too big for her, saying \\"when a song is that big, it's hard [for a new artist] to come back from. I don't sign songs, I sign artists\\". The audition resulted in Rihanna signing a six-album record deal with Def Jam Recordings in February 2005, on the same day of the audition, with Jay-Z saying \\"There's only two ways out. Out the door after you sign this deal. Or through this window ...\\", meaning that he was not going to let her leave without signing a record deal. After signing to Def Jam Recordings, Rihanna cancelled other meetings with record labels and relocated from Barbados to New York City to live with Rogers and his wife. Rihanna explained the concept behind the title of the album to Kidzworld, saying that the sun is representative of her native Caribbean culture as well as herself and that the album consists of music from her heritage. ==Recording== Rihanna worked with various producers for Music of the Sun and continued to work with Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers, who had previously written and produced \\"Pon de Replay\\" and \\"The Last Time\\" for Rihanna's demo tape. Although Rihanna stated that when she first heard \\"Pon de Replay\\", she did not want to record it, expressing that she felt the song was \\"sing-songy\\", but grew to like the song at the end of the recording process. In an interview with Kidzworld, Rihanna learned how the pair helped her develop her song-writing abilities, talking about Rogers and Sturken, who had worked with recording artists including Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Kelly Clarkson. ==Music and lyrics== Music of the Sun is a Caribbean- influenced, \\"urban\\" dance-pop album. Its dance-pop songs are complemented by contentional R&B; ballads. The lead single \\"Pon de Replay\\" was written by Rogers, Sturken and Vada Nobles, and was produced by the first two. \\"Pon de Replay\\" is a simple dance-pop song with dancehall beats and reggae vocal cadence. Lyrically, the song has its protagonist asking the DJ to play her favorite song, as well as the fulfillment of dancing in a club. \\"The Last Time\\", written and produced by Rogers and Sturken, is an acoustic guitar driven ballad, while \\"Now That I Know\\" is a stripped down string driven song. In addition to working with Rogers and Sturken for the majority of the album, Rihanna worked with production teams Poke and Tone of Trackmasters and Stargate. The former wrote and produced the second single released from the album, \\"If It's Lovin' that You Want\\", which Rihanna described as a \\"fun song\\". A R&B; song, \\"If It's Lovin' that You Want\\" is a song about a girl telling a boy that he should make her his girl, because she has what the boy wants. A remix of the song, entitled \\"If It's Lovin' That You Want – Part 2\\", which features rap by Cory Gunz, was included as a bonus track on Rihanna's sophomore studio album, A Girl like Me (2006). Alongside Rogers and Sturken, Stargate co-wrote and co-produced \\"Let Me\\", which appears as the ninth song on the album. Music of the Sun also contains a remake of Jamaican singer Dawn Penn \\"You Don't Love Me (No, No, No)\\", and features dancehall recording artist Vybz Kartel. ==Singles== \\"Pon de Replay\\" was released as the album's lead single on May 24, 2005. The song peaked at number one on the New Zealand Singles Chart and at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. An accompanying music video was directed by Little X and features Rihanna in a nightclub setting. Rihanna performed \\"Pon de Replay\\" complete with Barbados flags and colorful carnival attire at the MTV Video Music Awards pre-show in Miami, Florida on August 28, 2005.. Rihanna also performed the song at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in November 2005. \\"If It's Lovin' that You Want\\" was released as the second and final single from Music of the Sun on December 2, 2005. The song failed to replicate the chart success that \\"Pon de Replay\\" experienced, though managed to peak at number 36 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and inside the top 40 of multiple other record charts. An accompanying music video was directed by Marcus Raboy and features Rihanna in an island setting. ==Critical reception== Music of the Sun received generally mixed reviews from music critics. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times viewed that the album's combination of dancehall and pop resulted in \\"[\\"Pon de Replay\\" being] one [of] the summer's biggest and most seductive club tracks\\", but felt that Rihanna sounded \\"stranded\\" without a beat to sing along to. Barry Walters of Rolling Stone found it lacking in replay value, ingenuity, and rhythm, with \\"generic vocal hiccups and frills\\" of US R&B; inflecting upon her \\"Caribbean charm\\". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the album a \\"glut of teen R&B; chanteuses\\" and described the lead single \\"Pon de Replay\\" as \\"a dancehall-pop mixture that owes plenty of its sweat and shimmy to Beyoncé's \\"Baby Boy\\". Evan Serpick of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Rihanna's \\"vibrant vocals lift tracks like \\"That La, La, La\\" and \\"Let Me,\\" but this bland reggae/R&B; debut is filled with chintzy production and maudlin arrangements that block out the Music of the Sun.\\" Robert Christgau of The Village Voice rated the album a \\"dud\\", indicating \\"a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought.\\" In a positive review, Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic commented that the album presents Rihanna as \\"winsome rather than [a] wannabe,\\" as well as how she managed to set herself apart from other urban dance-pop artists such as Ashanti, Beyoncé, and Ciara. Birchmeier further explained that \\"[...] Music of the Sun descends into faceless slow jams after a while, overall consistency not being among its attributes, but thankfully it picks up the pace toward the end..... the result is one of the more engaging urban dance-pop albums of the year.\\" Chantal Jenoure of The Jamaica Observer complimented the dancehall and hip hop composition on several of the songs, including \\"Pon de Replay\\", \\"Rush\\", \\"Let Me\\", \\"Music of the Sun\\" and \\"That La, La, La\\", writing that they make the listener feel \\"happy\\" and \\"carefree\\". ==Commercial performance== In the United States, Music of the Sun sold 69,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number ten on the Billboard 200 in the chart issue dated September 17, 2005. The album spent a total of thirty-five weeks on the chart.

He was Member of Parliament for Hornchurch from 1979 until 1997 when he lost the seat to John Cryer. Squire was born and raised in South West London. After qualifying as an accountant he was employed by a finance company while being a Conservative Party activist. He became a member of Sutton Borough Council in 1968 and the Member of Parliament for Hornchurch in 1979. During the Thatcher years (1979 to 1990) Squire was considered to be a prominent \\"wet\\", opposed to the Conservative government's economic and employment policies. After Mrs Thatcher left office in 1990, Squire's political position strengthened and he held junior ministerial positions until the Conservative government fell in 1997. Squire was described in The Guardian as \\"a user-friendly Tory wet\\"The Guardian, 9 June 1993 and in The Times as \\"a minister who wears pebble glasses and always looks as though he lives in a bedsit.\\"Times, 18 June 1992 After losing his seat in the 1997 general election, Squire struggled initially to find a new career. His difficulties in this regard were widely reported on in the media. Since 2002, he has been the Trust Secretary/Chief Executive for the Veolia ES Cleanaway Trusts, based in Rainham, a group of several environmental charities operating in Havering and in Basildon and Castle Point, Essex. ==Early career== Squire was educated at Tiffin Grammar School, Kingston upon Thames and then qualified as a Chartered Accountant while working in a small City practice. He joined the accounting department of Lombard Banking in 1968 (a finance company that became a member of the National Westminster Bank group in 1970) and was promoted to the position of Deputy Chief Accountant at Lombard North Central in 1972. He held this post until he was elected to Parliament in 1979. During this period he was a Conservative activist. Notably, he held various positions in the Greater London Young Conservatives including that of chairman in 1973. He was elected a member of Sutton Borough Council in 1968. Squire was the Conservative candidate for Hornchurch in the October 1974 general election although he lost the election by a 7,000 vote margin.October 1974 General Election results :see Hornchurch In 1976 he became the Leader of Sutton Council. At an early stage, he demonstrated a political position on the left of the Conservative Party. At the Conservative Party Conference in 1973 he was booed when he opposed a motion calling on the Government to recognise the white minority regime in Rhodesia.The Times, 12 October 1973 At the Conservative Local Government Conference in 1977 Squire was one of five council leaders who spoke against plans advanced by Keith Speed (then Conservative local government spokesman) to abolish the domestic rating system. Squire warned that abolition of the rating system without a widely accepted alternative to put in its place might be highly damaging.The Times, 28 February 1977 During the period 1970 to 1979, both Conservative and Labour administrations promoted the move to comprehensive education. As Leader of Sutton Council, Squire advocated a move to comprehensive education in the Borough that would be phased in by 1984. However, in 1978 Labour Education Secretary Shirley Williams pressed for an end to selective education in the Borough by 1980. This resulted in a stand- off and Squire threatened legal action against the government to prevent an earlier move to comprehensives.The Times, 2 May 1978 The advent of a new Conservative government in May 1979 allowed Sutton to remain as an isolated pocket of selective education and grammar schools. After the Liberal Democrats took control of the Council in 1986 selective education was retained. Squire was elected to Parliament as the member for Hornchurch on 3 May 1979. Labour- held Hornchurch had not been a marginal seat and Squire had not expected to win it. However, he was elected with a 769-vote majority on a \\"freak\\" 8.5% swing.The Guardian, 3 May 1999 At this point, he stood down as leader of Sutton Borough Council and gave up his Council seat in 1982. Squire married Susan Fey, a Labour Party activist, in 1981. Questioned about the marriage, Fey stated that she was on the right wing of the Labour Party and her husband was on the left of the Conservative Party. As such, she considered that there was no great political difference between them.The Wallington and Carshalton Advertiser, 4 June 1982 The couple had two children (one son and one daughter) by Fey's previous marriage and divorced in 2007. ==Parliamentary career== Upon entering Parliament, Squire was soon established as one of the \\"wet\\" group of Conservative MPs who opposed many aspects of the economic, employment and social policies of the Thatcher government. For example, in 1981 Squire was one of 18 Conservative rebels who opposed referendum provisions for local council rate increases. In 1987 he opposed the introduction of the community charge (or 'poll tax') and in 1988 he was one of 20 Conservative rebels to vote against the freezing of child benefits. During the 1980s, he sponsored a successful 'freedom of information' private members bill and participated in cross-party pressure groups involved with homeless people.The Guardian, 15 April 1992 In 1988 Squire was the only Conservative MP to vote against \\"Section 28\\", legislation which sought to prevent local authorities from promoting awareness of gay issues.Daily Telegraph, 2 July 2009 Cheers ring out as David Cameron lays Tory history of homophobia to rest He became particularly well known for his regular contributions to Capital Radio's \\"Party Pieces\\" programme and he was described in the Times diary as being \\"pleasingly unsycophantic\\".The Times, 1 July 1983 He appeared to be comfortable as a member of the 'Parliamentary club'. He was reported to be a prominent and popular member of the Guy Fawkes club – a dining club composed of Conservative MPs first elected in 1979. Other members of the Guy Fawkes club included John Major and Brian Mawhinney.The Sunday Times, 15 April 1992 He was rated as a highly capable member of the House of Commons bridge team and acquitted himself well in tournaments. Squire consistently expressed misgivings over the personal leadership style of Margaret Thatcher, describing her as \\"a good wartime leader, but ....\\" This, combined with his status as a \\"dripping\\" or \\"oceanic\\" wet meant that promotion was slow in coming. The only significant office he held during the Thatcher governments was that of Parliamentary Private Secretary to Transport Secretary Linda Chalker between 1983 and 1985. In 1980 he was ousted from the Secretaryship of the Conservative backbench European Committee by a Eurosceptic.The Times, 9 December 1990 However, his prospects suddenly improved when John Major became Prime Minister in 1990 and early in 1991, he became PPS to Chris Patten MP, the Chairman of the Conservative Party. ==Ministerial career== On 14 April 1992, in the immediate aftermath of the 1992 United Kingdom general election, Squire was appointed Under Secretary of State for the Environment. In this capacity he was variously described as the \\"inner cities minister\\" or the \\"local government minister\\". His background as a Council leader made him an obvious choice for this role and he appeared to work harmoniously with Michael Howard, the then Secretary of State for the Environment. However, on 28 May 1993 he was moved to the post of Under Secretary of State for Education, serving under Secretary of State John Patten and later Gillian Shephard. In this capacity he was generally known as the \\"schools minister\\" and occasionally as the \\"school discipline minister\\". He held this post until the Conservative government fell in May 1997. The official reason given for the move was that one of the other education ministers (Baroness Blatch) sat in the House of Lords and it was felt that an experienced House of Commons operator like Squire was needed to front government policy on schools. During his 4 years as Schools Minister, Squire was involved in many high-profile issues. These included the introduction of the OFSTED schools inspection regime, published league tables for school performance, the ability of state sector schools to opt out of local authority control as \\"grant-maintained\\" schools, nursery education vouchers and the introduction of the first state funded Muslim schools. Many of these reforms survived the change of government in 1997 and became features of Labour education policy. He is reported to have \\"barked down\\" some of the more extreme proposals to deal with the threat of school shootings after the Dunblane massacre in 1996. This incident occurred when a crazed individual with a gun entered a primary school and shot a number of pupils and teachers. During the final months of the Major government, Squire was identified with the \\"Conservative Mainstream\\" group of MPs. This group was composed of centrist, one-nation members who sided with John Major in his confrontations with Eurosceptics and right-wingers.The Independent, 12 December 1996 In the 1997 United Kingdom general election, Squire was defending a 9,165 majority in his constituency at Hornchurch. His personal popularity plus his prominence as a Minister led him to believe that he would hold the seat, \\"This was the one time when I thought my seat was safe...\\" but he lost the seat to Labour's John Cryer with a 16% swing and a 5,680 Labour majority.The Guardian, 3 May 1997 ==After Parliament== Around 150 Conservative MPs lost their seats in the 1997 general election. Many of them struggled to find gainful employment and a new role in life for themselves. This was particularly difficult for former ministers who had become accustomed to the status, emoluments and perks that went with their old jobs. Squire initially considered a return to accountancy but he had difficulty in this regard because he had not updated his skills since leaving the profession in 1979. For example, he was initially unable to use a computer spreadsheet or a scientific calculator – essential tools for an accountant by 1997. He applied for the post of general manager of the Dolphin Square residential complex in Pimlico, London at a salary of £30,000 but was turned down, albeit as the runner-up for the post.The Times, 28 April 1998 He applied for the position of bursar at several independent schools but was rejected by all of them. \\"His only independent income in the first four months of his enforced leisure came when he won 20 pounds on a Sunday Times brain-teaser competition\\"Guardian, 3 May 1999 He eventually \\"signed on\\" for the Job Seeker's Allowance. He was given counselling and directed to courses on interview technique, assertiveness and IT skills. Squire gradually developed a portfolio of part- time appointments. In 1999 he served for a short period as a National Lottery Commissioner (salary £6,200) and he was later appointed as a schools adjudicator by the Department of Education. It is believed that he took up a number of other such posts in the voluntary and NGO sectors. He also acted, until March 2000, as a Parliamentary lobbyist.PR Week, 12/1999 Squire quits from Lottery body to stand as MP Squire stood against John Cryer at Hornchurch in the 2001 general election but lost again by a significant majority.

As of 2020, Torkildsen and colleague Peter I. Blute remain the last Republicans elected to serve in the United States House delegation from Massachusetts. ==Life and career== Torkildsen was born into a Roman Catholic family with ten children in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on January 28, 1958. He attended high school at St. John's Preparatory School in Danvers, Massachusetts and then college at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and then went on to the prestigious John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Before entering politics, he was a service coordinator for the Visiting Nurse Association of Boston. Torkildsen served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1985 to 1991. From 1991 to 1992, Torklidsen was the state's Commissioner of Labor and Industries. He then went on to represent as a Republican for two terms, from 1993 until 1997. He had a conservative record on fiscal and social issues during his terms in the Massachusetts House and challenged then State Senator Paul Cellucci for the GOP nomination for Lt. Governor of Massachusetts in 1990 as a pro-life candidate. In Congress, he was conservative on defense spending and fiscal restraint, but was pro-choice, in particular voting against the 1996 Partial Birth Abortion Ban. During his campaign for Chairman of the Massachusetts Republican Party in 2007, he claimed that he had a problem with the wording of the bill as it excluded an exception for saving the mother's life, and had he been re-elected would have supported a similar bill with the exception. He also supported the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act. He was narrowly defeated in the Presidential-year elections of 1996 by Democrat John F. Tierney in a state that voted overwhelmingly for Democratic President Bill Clinton in that year's Presidential election. Tierney was part of a net eight seat Democratic gain in the House elections that year. Torkildsen challenged Tierney to a rematch in the United States House election, 1998, but Tierney won that contest as well, 55%–43%. Since his departure from Congress in 1997, there have been no Republicans elected to the House of Representatives from Massachusetts. Since leaving the House, Torklidsen has returned to working in labor and workforce related areas. From 2001 to 2003, he served as a Commissioner on the Massachusetts Labor Relations Commission. In 2003, he was the Director of Federal, State and Local Workforce Relations for the Massachusetts Department of Workforce Development. Since 2004, he has been the Executive Director of the Massachusetts Workforce Investment Board. Desiring to lead the repair of a Massachusetts Republican Party, Torkildsen announced in December 2006 that he would run in the January 2007 election for State Party Chairman. Torkildsen left the Massachusetts Workforce Investment Board with Gov. Deval Patrick's inauguration. On January 17, 2007, Torkildsen defeated five opponents in his first ballot election to be chair of the Massachusetts Republican State Committee. Torkildsen received 58% of the vote. In January, 2009, Torkildsen chose not to run for re-election as Chair. ==References== * Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Milwaukee Category:American Roman Catholics Category:Massachusetts Republicans Category:John F.

Main Street of Puerto Baquerizo Moreno. Airport. View of the island from the sea. León Dormido (in English : Kicker Rock). San Cristóbal (Chatham) is the easternmost island in the Galápagos archipelago, as well as one of the oldest geologically. It is administratively part of San Cristóbal Canton, Ecuador. Its Spanish (and official Ecuadorian) name \\"San Cristóbal\\" comes from the patron saint of seafarers, St. Christopher. English speakers increasingly use that name in preference to the traditional English name of Chatham Island, derived from William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. ==History== San Cristobal Island is composed of three or four fused volcanoes, all extinct. It is home to the oldest permanent settlement of the islands and is the island where Darwin first went ashore in 1835. A small lake called El Junco is the only source of fresh water in the islands. The availability of fresh water is what led to the early settlement of San Cristobal. A penal colony was built on San Cristóbal Island in 1880 for prisoners from mainland Ecuador. This later turned into a military base for Ecuador and export center for the island's products including sugar, coffee, cassava, cattle, fish and lime. In April 1888 , a Navy-manned research vessel assigned to the United States Fish Commission, made landfall at an abandoned settlement on Charles Island. ==Geography== San Cristóbal has an area of and its highest point rises to . The population is approximately 6000. San Cristóbal is the most fertile island of the archipelago and is the second most populated after Santa Cruz. The capital of the archipelago, Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, lies at the south-western tip of the island. ==Air transport== The island is served by San Cristóbal Airport, with daily flights from Quito and Guayaquil. ==Ecology== This island hosts frigatebirds, Galápagos sea lions, Galápagos tortoises, blue and red footed boobies, tropicbirds, marine iguanas, dolphins and swallow-tailed gulls. Its vegetation includes Calandrinia galapagosa, Lecocarpus darwinii, trees such as Lignum vitae, Matazarna. In the waters nearby are sharks, rays, and lobsters. The largest fresh water lake in the archipelago, Laguna El Junco, is located in a crater in the highlands of San Cristóbal, in the southern half of the island. The lake harbors a large population of birdlife, but reaching the lake requires a short uphill walk. Nearby, La Galapaguera is a breeding station and sanctuary for giant tortoises. ==Economy== Most inhabitants of San Cristóbal Island make their living in government, tourism, and fishing. The majority of the residents of San Cristóbal live in the port city of Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, which is the capital of Ecuador′s Galápagos Province. Island tourism sites nearer the town of Puerto Baquerizo Moreno include the Cerro Tijeretas, a nesting colony for frigate birds, and a statue of Charles Darwin, marking the original site where he first disembarked in the Galápagos Islands during the second voyage of HMS Beagle on 16 September 1835.Keynes, R. D. ed. 2001, Charles Darwin's Beagle Diary, p. 351. La Loberia, a colony of sea lions, lies about ten minutes by bus from the town. Local boat tours also take visitors to two popular nearby dive sites. \\"Kicker Rock\\" (the Spanish name is \\"León Dormido\\") is the remains of a lava cone, now split in two. Isla Lobos (\\"Sea Lion Island\\") is also a nesting site for blue- footed boobies. ==Fauna== Paisaje en Cerro Brujo, isla de San Cristóbal, islas Galápagos, Ecuador, 2015-07-24, DD 115.JPGBeach in Cerro Brujo, San Cristóbal Island.

He was the first of the nine children of Gabriele Capone, a barber, and Teresa Raiola, a seamstress. In 1895 with his family, including his brother Ralph, he emigrated in the United States, settling in downtown Brooklyn. He went by the Americanized form of his first name, James, and during his early years in America were born his siblings Frank, Al, Ermina, John, Albert, Matthew Capone and Mafalda Maritote. ==Career== Capone left home at age 16 then fled New York City, joined a circus as a roustabout and eventually adopted the last name of his idol, William S. Hart, the foremost star of Western silent films in the 1920s. He also adopted the actor’s persona as much as possible, \\"even earning the 'Two-Gun' moniker long attached to the motion picture star\\". He worked to lose his Brooklyn accent and tried to disguise his Italian ancestry. He enlisted in the United States Army during World War I, served in France, and earned a commission as a lieutenant. After the war, Capone legally changed his name to Richard James Hart, partly in honor of his favorite cowboy film star, William S. Hart. He married in 1919 Kathleen Winch, and they had three sons: Richard, Sherman and Harry Hart. He soon became a federal prohibition agent, making his home in Homer, Nebraska. Following a series of successful raids against bootleggers, he gained the nickname of \\"Two-Gun\\" Hart. In 1926, Hart became a special agent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. He was assigned to the Cheyenne River Indian reservation in South Dakota. While there he once had the duty of protecting President Calvin Coolidge and his family on their visit to the Black Hills. He was later transferred to the Spokane Indian Reservation in Washington. He was credited with the arrest of at least 20 wanted killers while in that area, besides pursuing Indian law breakers and hunting down moonshiners and busting their stills. He spent some time as a law enforcement officer on the Coeur d'Alene Reservation in Plummer, Idaho. He learned of his siblings' life of crime from newspapers, when their exploits became national news. ==Later years== He returned to Homer as a prohibition agent, in 1931. With the repeal of Prohibition two years later, he became a justice of the peace. In the early 1950s, newspaper reporters learned of his kinship to the Chicago gangster. He died in Homer, Nebraska, in 1952, of a heart attack at the age of 60. ==In popular culture== His life and career were fictionalized in the 1990 TNT TV- movie The Lost Capone, in which he is portrayed by Adrian Pasdar. ==References* Category:1892 births Category:1952 deaths Category:Al Capone Category:American people of Campanian descent Category:Burials in Nebraska Category:Italian emigrants to the United States Category:People from Brooklyn Category:People from Dakota County, Nebraska Category:People from the Province of Salerno ","title":"James Vincenzo Capone"},{"id":"2585978","text":"The benandanti (\\"Good Walkers\\") were members of an agrarian visionary tradition in the Friuli district of Northeastern Italy during the 16th and 17th centuries. The claimed to travel out of their bodies while asleep to struggle against malevolent witches (malandanti) in order to ensure good crops for the season to come. Between 1575 and 1675, in the midst of the Early Modern witch trials, a number of were accused of being heretics or witches under the Roman Inquisition. According to Early Modern records, were believed to have been born with a caul on their head, which gave them the ability to take part in nocturnal visionary traditions that occurred on specific Thursdays during the year. During these visions, it was believed that their spirits rode upon various animals into the sky and off to places in the countryside. Here they would take part in various games and other activities with other , and battle malevolent witches who threatened both their crops and their communities using sticks of sorghum. When not taking part in these visionary journeys, were also believed to have magical powers that could be used for healing. In 1575, the first came to the attention of the Friulian Church authorities when a village priest, Don Bartolomeo Sgabarizza, began investigating the claims made by the Paolo Gasparotto. Although Sgabarizza soon abandoned his investigations, in 1580 the case was reopened by the inquisitor Fra' Felice de Montefalco, who interrogated not only Gasparotto but also a variety of other local and spirit mediums, ultimately condemning some of them for the crime of heresy. Under pressure by the Inquisition, these nocturnal spirit travels (which often included sleep paralysis) were assimilated to the diabolised stereotype of the witches' Sabbath, leading to the extinction of the cult. The Inquisition's denunciation of the visionary tradition led to the term \\"\\" becoming synonymous with the term \\"stregha\\" (meaning \\"witch\\") in Friulian folklore right through to the 20th century. The first historian to study the tradition was the Italian Carlo Ginzburg, who began an examination of the surviving trial records from the period in the early 1960s, culminating in the publication of his book The Night Battles: Witchcraft and Agrarian Cults in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (1966, English translation 1983). In Ginzburg's interpretation of the evidence, the was a \\"fertility cult\\" whose members were \\"defenders of harvests and the fertility of fields\\". He furthermore argued that it was only one surviving part of a much wider European tradition of visionary experiences that had its origins in the pre-Christian period, identifying similarities with Livonian werewolf beliefs.Ginzburg 1983. p. xx. Various historians have alternately built on or challenged aspects of Ginzburg's interpretation. ==Members== Location of the historical region Friuli in Italy. The - a term meaning \\"good walkers\\" - were members of a folk tradition in the Friuli region. The , who included both males and females, were individuals who believed that they ensured the protection of their community and its crops. The reported leaving their bodies in the shape of mice, cats, rabbits, or butterflies. The men mostly reported flying into the clouds battling against witches to secure fertility for their community; the women more often reported attending great feasts. Across Europe, popular culture viewed magical abilities as either innate or learned; in Friulian folk custom, the were seen as having innate powers marked out at birth. Specifically, it was a widely held belief that those who in later life became were born with a caul, or amniotic sac, wrapped around their heads.Klaniczay 1990. p. 131. In the folklore of Friuli at the time, cauls were imbued with magical properties, being associated with the ability to protect soldiers from harm, to cause an enemy to withdraw, and to help lawyers win their legal cases. In subsequent centuries, a related folkloric tradition found across much of Italy held to the belief that witches had been born with a caul. From surviving records, it is apparent that members of the first learned about its traditions during infancy, usually from their mothers. For this reason, historian Norman Cohn asserted that the tradition highlights how \\"not only the waking thoughts but the trance experiences of individuals can be deeply conditioned by the generally accepted beliefs of the society in which they live\\". ==Visionary journeys== Although these were described by as spirit journeys, they nevertheless stressed the reality of such experiences, believing that they were real occurrences. On Thursdays between the Ember days, periods of fasting for the Catholic Church, the claimed their spirits would leave their bodies at night in the form of small animals. The spirits of the men would go to the fields to fight evil witches (malandantiGinzburg 1983. p. 41.). The men fought with fennel stalks, while the witches were armed with sorghum stalks (sorghum was used for witches' brooms, and the \\"brooms' sorghum\\" was one of the most current type of sorghum). If the men prevailed, the harvest would be plentiful.Klaniczay 1990. pp.129-130. The female performed other sacred tasks. When they left their bodies they traveled to a great feast, where they danced, ate and drank with a procession of spirits, animals and faeries, and learned who amongst the villagers would die in the next year. In one account, this feast was presided over by a woman, \\"the abbess\\", who sat in splendour on the edge of a well. Carlo Ginzburg has compared these spirit assemblies with others reported by similar groups elsewhere in Italy and Sicily, which were also presided over by a goddess-figure who taught magic and divination. The earliest accounts of the journeys, dating from 1575, did not contain any of the elements then associated with the diabolic witches' sabbath; there was no worshipping of the Devil (a figure who was not even present), no renunciation of Christianity, no trampling of crucifixes and no defilement of sacraments.Ginzburg 1983. p. 4. ===Relationship with witches=== Ginzburg noted that whether the were themselves witches or not was an area of confusion in the earliest records. Whilst they combated the malevolent witches and helped heal those who were believed to have been harmed through witchcraft, they also joined the witches on their nocturnal journeys, and the miller Pietro Rotaro was recorded as referring to them as \\"benandanti witches\\"; for this reason the priest Don Bartolomeo Sgabarizza, who recorded Rotaro's testimony, believed that while the were witches, they were 'good' witches who tried to protect their communities from the bad witches who would harm children. Ginzburg remarked that it was this contradiction in the relationship between the and the malevolent witches that ultimately heavily influenced their persecution at the hands of the Inquisition. ==Inquisition and persecution== The nocturnal visionary tradition of the led the Roman Inquisition to accuse them of being witches, malevolent Satanists depicted in this 1508 woodcut. ===Sgabarizza's investigation: 1575=== In early 1575, Paolo Gasparotto, a male who lived in the village of Iassico (modern spelling: Giassìcco), gave a charm to a miller from Brazzano named Pietro Rotaro, in the hope of healing his son, who had fallen sick from some unknown illness. This event came to the attention of the local priest, Don Bartolomeo Sgabarizza, who was intrigued by the use of such folk magic, and called Gasparotto to him to learn more. The told the priest that the sick child had \\"been possessed by witches\\" but that he had been saved from certain death by the , or \\"vagabonds\\" as they were also known.Ginzburg 1983. p. 1. He went on to reveal more about his brethren, relating that \\"on Thursdays during the Ember Days of the year [they] were forced to go with these witches to many places, such as Cormons, in front of the church at Giassìcco, and even into the countryside around Verona,\\" where they \\"fought, played, leaped about, and rode various animals\\", as well as taking part in an activity during which \\"the women beat the men who were with them with sorghum stalks, while the men had only bunches of fennel.\\"Ginzburg 1983. p. 1. Don Sgabarizza was concerned with such talk of witchcraft, and on 21 March 1575, he appeared as a witness before both the vicar general, Monsignor Jacopo Maracco, and the Inquisitor Fra Giulio d'Assis, a member of the Order of the Minor Conventuals, at the monastery of San Francesco of Cividale del Friuli, in the hope that they could offer him guidance in how to proceed in this situation. He brought Gasparotto with him, who readily furnished more information in front of the Inquisitor, relating that after taking part in their games, \\"the witches, warlocks and vagabonds\\" would pass in front of people's houses, looking for \\"clean, clear water\\" that they would then drink. According to Gasparotto, if the witches could not find any clean water to drink, they would \\"go into the cellars and overturn all the wine\\".Ginzburg 1983. pp. 1-2. Sgabarizza did not initially believe Gasparotto's claim that these events had actually occurred. In response to the priest's disbelief, Gasparotto invited both him and the Inquisitor to join the on their next journey, although refused to provide the names of any other members of the \\"fraternity\\", stating that he would be \\"badly beaten by the witches\\" should he do so.Ginzburg 1983. p. 2. Not long after, on the Monday following Easter, Sgabarizza visited Giassìcco in order to say Mass to the assembled congregation, and following the ritual stayed among the locals for a feast held in his honour.Ginzburg 1983. pp. 2-3. During and after the meal, Sgabarizza once more discussed the journeys of the with both Gasparotto and the miller Pietro Rotaro, and later learned of another self-professed , the public crier Battista Moduco of Cividale, who offered more information on what occurred during their nocturnal visions. Ultimately, Sgabarizza and the inquisitor Giulio d'Assisi decided to abandon their investigations into the , something the later historian Carlo Ginzburg believed was probably because they came to believe that their stories of nocturnal flights and battling witches were \\"tall tales and nothing more\\".Ginzburg 1983. pp. 2-3. ===Montefalco's investigation: 1580-1582=== ====Gasparotto and Moduco==== Five years after Sgabarizza's original investigation, on 27 June 1580, the inquisitor Fra Felice da Montefalco decided to revive the case of the . To do so he ordered Gasparotto to be brought in for questioning; under interrogation, Gasparotto repeatedly denied having ever been a and asserted that involvement in such things were against God, contradicting the former claims that he had made to Sgabarizza several years before. The questioning over, Gasparotto was imprisoned. That same day, the public crier of Cividale, Battista Moduco, who was also known locally to be a , was rounded up and interrogated at Cividale, but unlike Gasparotto, he openly admitted to Montefalco that he was a , and went on to describe his visionary journeys, in which he battled witches in order to protect the community's crops. Vehemently denouncing the actions of the witches, he claimed that the were fighting \\"in service of Christ\\", and ultimately Montefalco decided to let him go.Ginzburg 1983. pp. 6-8. On 28 June, Gasparotto was brought in for interrogation again. This time he admitted to being a , claiming that he had been too scared to do so in the previous interrogation lest the witches beat him in punishment. Gasparotto went on to accuse two individuals, one from Gorizia and the other from Chiana, of being witches, and was subsequently released by Montefalco on the proviso that he return for further questioning at a later date.Ginzburg 1983. pp. 8-9. This eventually came about on 26 September, taking place at the monastery of San Francesco in Udine. This time, Gasparotto added an extra element to his tale, claiming that an angel had summoned him to join the . For Montefalco, the introduction of this element led him to suspect that the actions of Gasparotto were themselves heretical and satanic, and his method of interrogation became openly suggestive, putting forward the idea that the angel was actually a demon in disguise.Ginzburg 1983. pp. 10-11. As historian Carlo Ginzburg related, Montefalco had begun to warp Gasparotto's testimony of the journey to fit the established clerical image of the diabolical witches' sabbat, while under the stress of interrogation and imprisonment, Gasparotto himself was losing his self-assurance and beginning to question \\"the reality of his beliefs\\".Ginzburg 1983. p. 11. Several days later, Gasparotto openly told Montefalco that he believed that \\"the apparition of that angel was really the devil tempting me, since you have told me he can transform himself into an angel\\". When Moduco was also summoned to Montefalco, on 2 October 1580, he went on to announce the same thing, proclaiming that the Devil must have deceived him into going on the nocturnal journey which he believed was performed for good.Ginzburg 1983. p. 12. Having both confessed to Montefalco that their nocturnal journeying had been caused by the devil, both Gasparotto and Moduco were released, pending sentencing for their crime at a later date.Ginzburg 1983. p. 14. Due to a jurisdictional conflict between the Cividale commissioner and the patriarch's vicar, the pronouncement of Gasparotto and Moduco's punishment was postponed until 26 November 1581. Both denounced as heretics, they were spared from excommunication but condemned to six months' imprisonment, and furthermore ordered to offer prayers and penances to God on certain days of the year, including the Ember Days, in order that He might forgive their sins. However, their penalties were soon remitted, on the condition that they remain within the city of Cividale for a fortnight. ====Anna la Rossa, Donna Aquilina and Caterina la Guercia==== Gasparotto and Moduco would not be the only victims of Montefalco's investigations, however, for during late 1581 he had heard of a widow living in Udine named Anna la Rossa (the Red one). While she did not claim to be a , she did claim that she could see and communicate with the spirits of the dead, and so Montefalco had her brought in for questioning on 1 January 1582. Initially denying that she had such an ability to the inquisitor, she eventually relented and told him of how she believed that she could see the dead, and how she sold their messages to members of the local community willing to pay, using the money in order to alleviate the poverty of her family. Although Montefalco intended to interrogate her again at a later date, the trial ultimately remained permanently unfinished.Ginzburg 1983. pp. 33-36. That year, Montefalco also took an interest in the claims regarding the wife of a tailor living in Udine who allegedly had the power to see the dead and to cure diseases with the use of spells and potions. Known among locals as Donna Aquilina, she was said to have become relatively rich through offering her services as a professional healer, but when she learned that she was under suspicion from the Holy Inquisition, she fled the city, and Montefalco did not initially set out to locate her. Later, on 26 August 1583, Montefalco traveled to Aquilina's home in order to interrogate her, but she fled and hid in a neighbouring house. She was finally brought in for interrogation on 27 October, in which she defended her practices, but claimed that she was neither a nor a witch.Ginzburg 1983. pp. 37-38. In 1582, Montefalco had also begun investigating a Cividale widow named Caterina la Guercia (the One-eyed one), whom he had accused of practicing \\"various maleficent arts\\". Under interrogation on 14 September, she admitted that she knew several charms which she used to cure children's sicknesses, but that she was not a . She added however that her deceased husband, Andrea of Orsaria, near Premariacco, had been a , and that he used to enter trances in which his spirit would leave his body and go with the \\"processions of the dead\\".Ginzburg 1983. pp. 38-39. ===Subsequent depositions and denunciations: 1583-1629=== In 1583, an anonymous individual denounced a herdsman, Toffolo di Buri of Pieris, to the Holy Office at Udine. The village of Pieris was near Monfalcone, across the Isonzo river and therefore outside of Friuli; it was nevertheless within the diocese of Aquileia. The anonymous source claimed that Toffolo openly admitted to being a , and that he went out at night on his visionary journeys to battle the witches. The source also asserted that Toffolo regularly attended confession, recognising that his activities as a were contrary to the teachings of the Catholic Church, but that he was unable to stop the journeying. Having heard this testimony, the members of the Holy Office of Udine met on 18 March to discuss the situation; they requested that the Mayor of Monfalcone, Antonia Zorzi, arrest Toffolo and send him to Udine. While Zorzi did orchestrate the arrest, he had no men spare to transfer the prisoner, and so let him go. In November 1586, the inquisitor of Aquileia decided to reinvestigate the matter, and travelled to Monfalcone, but discovered that Toffolo had moved away from the area over a year before. On 1 October 1587, a priest known as Don Vincenzo Amorosi of Cesana denounced a midwife named Caterina Domenatta to the inquisitor of Aquileia and Concordia, Fra Giambattista da Perugia. Lambasting Domenatta as a \\"guilty sorceress\\", he claimed that she had encouraged mothers to put their newborn children on a spit in order to prevent them from becoming either or witches. Agreeing to investigate, the inquisitor travelled to Monfalcone in January 1588 to gain depositions against the midwife. When he came to interrogating Domenatta, she openly admitted to the practice, and was condemned to public penance and an abjuration. In 1600, a woman named Maddalena Busetto of Valvasone made two depositions regarding the of Moruzzo village to Fra Francesco Cummo of Vicenza, the commissioner of the Inquisition in the dioceses of Aquileia and Concordia. Claiming that she wanted to unburden her conscience, Busetto informed the commissioner that she had visited the village, where she met a friend whose child was injured. Seeking out the perpetrator of the injury, she talked to the old woman she believed to be guilty, Pascutta Agrigolante, who claimed that she was a and knew witches. Busetto did not know what the were, so enquired further, to which Agrigolante obliged by providing her an account of the nocturnal journeys. Agrigolante also named several other who lived locally, including the village priest and a woman named Narda Peresut. Busetto proceeded to seek out Peresut, who admitted to being a but who stated that she performed her healing magic in Gao to avoid prosecution from the Inquisition. Busetto would inform the commissioner that she did not believe any of these claims, but while he agreed to investigate further, there is no evidence that he ever did. That same year, a self-professed named Bastian Petricci of Percoto was also denounced to the Holy Office, although it is not recorded that they took any action on the issue. In 1606, Giambattista Valento, an artisan from Palmanova, went to the superintendent general of the Patria del Friuli Since 1420 part of the Republic of Venice.Andrea Garzoni, and informed him of his belief that his wife had been bewitched. Garzoni was concerned, and sent the inquisitor general, Fra Gerolamo Asteo, to Palmanova to investigate. Asteo found that the villagers widely concurred that Valento's wife had been the victim of witchcraft, and a was implicated, an 18-year-old shop assistant named Gasparo. Talking to Gasparo, Asteo heard the stories of the nocturnal journeys, but the young was insistent that they served God rather than the devil. Gasparo proceeded to name some of the villagers as witches, but the inquisitor did not believe him, and brought the case to a close. In 1609 this was followed by the denunciation of another , a peasant named Bernardo of Santa Maria la Longa, to the religious authorities. In 1614, a woman named Franceschina of Frattuzze arrived at the monastery of San Francesco in Portogruaro in order to denounce a folk magician named Marietta Trevisana of Giai as a witch. Although not described as a , Trevisana's work in claiming to combat witchcraft might have indicated that she would have considered herself to be of the . In 1618, a woman from Latisana, Maria Panzona, was arrested for theft. While imprisoned, it was revealed that she described herself as a and worked as a professional healer and anti-witch. She proceeded to accuse a number of local women of being witches, but when questioned further in January 1619 admitted that she had paid homage to the devil, but only to gain powers which she used to help people. She was subsequently moved to Venice, there to be tried for heresy in front of the Holy Office, and two women whom she accused of witchcraft were also summoned. Here, Panzona denied ever honouring the devil, insisting that she and other served Jesus Christ. The members of the Holy Office did not believe that the stories she related ever took place, allowing the two accused witches to go free, and condemning Panzona to a three-year prison sentence for heresy. In 1621, a wealthy man named Alessandro Marchetto of Udine submitted a memorandum to the Holy Office accusing both a fourteen-year-old boy and a local shepherd named Giovanni of being , each of whom he had previously tried to employ to cure his own cousin, whom it was believed had been bewitched by sorcery. Ginzburg suggests that by the 1620s, the were becoming bolder in their public accusations against alleged witches. In February 1622 the inquisitor of Aquileia, Fra Domenico Vico of Osimo was informed that a beggar and named Lunardo Badou had been accusing various individuals of being witches in the area of Gagliano, Cividale del Friuli, and Rualis. Badou had become unpopular locally as a result, with the inquisitor not taking his claims seriously and proceeding to ignore the situation. In 1623 and again in 1628-29 a series of depositions were made against Gerolamo Cut, a peasant and from Percoto, who had been healing individuals who were believed to have been afflicted by witchcraft; he had proceeded to accuse various local individuals of being witches, but his accusations led nowhere. In May 1629 Francesco Brandis, an official at Cividale, sent a letter to the inquisitor of Aquileia informing him that a twenty-year-old had been arrested for theft and was thus due to be transferred to Venice. ==Legacy== ===Folk terminology=== In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Italian folklorists - such as G. Marcotti, E. Fabris Bellavitis, V. Ostermann, A. Lazzarini and G. Vidossi - who were engaged in the study of Friulian oral traditions, noted that the term had become synonymous with the term \\"witch\\", a result of the original Church persecutions of the .Ginzburg 1983. p. xxi. ===Historical investigation and interpretation=== During the 1960s, the Italian historian Carlo Ginzburg was searching through the Archepiscopal Archives of Udine when he came across the 16th and 17th century trial records which documented the interrogation of several and other folk magicians.Martin 1992. pp. 613-614. Historian John Martin of Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas would later characterize this lucky find as the sort of \\"discovery most historians only dream of\\". Since 1970, the trend for interpreting elements of Early Modern witchcraft belief as having ancient origins proved popular among scholars operating in continental Europe, but far less so than in the Anglophone world of Great Britain and the United States, where scholars were far more interested in understanding these witchcraft beliefs in their contemporary contexts, such as their connection to gender and class relations. Various scholars were critical of Ginzburg's interpretation. In Europe's Inner Demons (1975), English historian Norman Cohn asserted that there was \\"nothing whatsoever\\" in the source material to justify the idea that the were the \\"survival of an age-old fertility cult\\". The German anthropologist Hans Peter Duerr briefly discussed the in his book Dreamtime: Concerning the Boundary between Wilderness and Civilization (1978, English translation 1985). Like Ginzburg before him, he compared them to the Perchtenlaufen and the Livonian werewolf, arguing that they all represented a clash between the forces of order and chaos.Duerr 1985. pp. 32-39. Gábor Klaniczay argued that the were part of a wider survival of pre-Christian rites, and points to the survival of broadly similar practices (differing in both names and minor details) in the Balkans, Hungary and Romania during the same period.Klaniczay 1990. pp.132-147. ===Popular culture=== * The Benandanti are a major force in Elizabeth Hand's urban fantasy Waking the Moon (1994). * The Benandanti are referenced in Kelley Armstrong's paranormal fantasy Waking the Witch (2010) in her Women of the Otherworld series. Two of the main characters are also Benandanti in The Calling (2012) from her Darkest Powers series. * A concept very similar to the Benandanti, and based upon them, appears in Guy Gavriel Kay's historic fantasy Tigana (1990).Bright Weavings – The Worlds of Guy Gavriel Kay * Hector Plasm is a comic book character published occasionally through Image Comics (first appearing in 2003) who is a modern portrayal of a Benandanti. * The Benandanti are a secret society of individuals in the old World of Darkness, part of the Wraith: The Oblivion (1994–1996) game line, who cross the wall between the lands of the living and the dead while in trances. * There is a similar \\"Hound of God\\" character in Neil Gaiman's fantasy novel The Graveyard Book (2008). * The Benandanti are also featured in a haunted attraction in Mesa, Arizona, called Shadowlands. * The \\"Nightwalkers\\" chapter of the 5th Edition Ars Magica supplement Hedge Magic Revised Edition (2008) details the Benedanti and related traditions as playable magic traditions. * The Benandanti appear in Majgull Axelsson's novel April Witch (1997). * The Benandanti are a major part of the backstory of the manga Pilgrim Jäger (2002–2006). * The Benandanti are the subject of Nicole Maggi's young adult Twin Willows trilogy (2014–2016).Nicole Maggi websiteWinter Falls on Amazon.com * \\"The Amazing Benandanti\\" was a short story by Anita Marie Moscoso featuring a female American sideshow escape artist of the same name.\\"The Amazing Benandanti\\", Soul Food Cafe *The Benandanti play an important role in the Netflix series Luna Nera ==Connections and origins== ===A pre-Christian shamanistic survival?=== In The Night Battles, Ginzburg argues that the tradition was connected to \\"a larger complex of traditions\\" that were spread \\"from Alsace to Hesse and from Bavaria to Switzerland\\", all of which revolved around \\"the myth of nocturnal gatherings\\" presided over by a goddess figure, varyingly known as Perchta, Holda, Abundia, Satia, Herodias, Venus or Diana. He also noted that \\"almost identical\\" beliefs could be found in Livonia (modern Latvia and Estonia), and that because of this geographic spread \\"it may not be too daring to suggest that in antiquity these beliefs may once have covered much of central Europe\\". Romanian historian of religion Mircea Eliade agreed with Ginzburg's theory, describing the as \\"a popular and archaic secret cult of fertility\\". Other historians were sceptical of Ginzburg's theories. In 1975, English historian Norman Cohn asserted that there was \\"nothing whatsoever\\" in the source material to justify the idea that the were the \\"survival of an age-old fertility cult\\". Echoing these views in 1999 was English historian Ronald Hutton, who stated that Ginzburg's claim that the visionary traditions were a survival from pre-Christian practices was an idea resting on \\"imperfect material and conceptual foundations\\". Explaining his reasoning, Hutton remarked that \\"dreams do not self-evidently constitute rituals, and shared dream-imagery does not constitute a 'cult',\\" before noting that Ginzburg's \\"assumption\\" that \\"what was being dreamed about in the sixteenth century had in fact been acted out in religious ceremonies\\" dating to \\"pagan times\\" was entirely \\"an inference of his own\\". He thought that this approach was a \\"striking late application\\" of \\"the ritual theory of myth\\", a discredited anthropological idea associated particularly with Jane Ellen Harrison's 'Cambridge group' and Sir James Frazer. ===Related traditions=== The themes associated with the (leaving the body in spirit, possibly in the form of an animal; fighting for the fertility of the land; banqueting with a queen or goddess; drinking from and soiling wine casks in cellars) are found repeatedly in other testimonies: from the of the Pyrenees, from the followers of Signora Oriente in 14th century Milan and the followers of Richella and \\"the wise Sibillia\\" in 15th century Northern Italy, and much further afield, from Livonian werewolves, Dalmatian kresniki, Serbian zduhaćs, Hungarian táltos, Romanian căluşari and Ossetian burkudzauta. Historian Carlo Ginzburg posits a relationship between the cult and the shamanism of the Baltic and Slavic cultures, a result of diffusion from a central Eurasian origin, possibly 6,000 years ago. This explains, in his opinion, the similarities between the Italian cult and a distant case in Livonia concerning a benevolent werewolf. In 1692 in Jürgensburg, Livonia, an area near the Baltic Sea, an old man named Theiss was tried for being a werewolf. His defense was that his spirit (and that of others) transformed into werewolves in order to fight demons and prevent them from stealing grain from the village. Ginzburg has shown that his arguments, and his denial of belonging to a Satanic cult, corresponded to those used by the . On 10 October 1692, Theiss was sentenced to ten whip strikes on charges of superstition and idolatry. ==References== ===Footnotes=== ===Bibliography=== : : : : : : : : : : : : : : ==External links== *The American Historical Review *The Burning Times Encyclopedia *Mediterranean Food History Category:Fertility Category:Witchcraft Category:Witchcraft in Italy Category:16th century in Italy Category:17th century in Italy http://themysticalspiral.com ","title":"Benandanti"},{"id":"2585984","text":"Coherence in linguistics is what makes a text semantically meaningful. It is especially dealt with in text linguistics. Coherence is achieved through syntactical features such as the use of deictic, anaphoric and cataphoric elements or a logical tense structure, as well as presuppositions and implications connected to general world knowledge. The purely linguistic elements that make a text coherent are subsumed under the term cohesion. However, those text-based features which provide cohesion in a text do not necessarily help achieve coherence, that is, they do not always contribute to the meaningfulness of a text, be it written or spoken. It has been stated that a text coheres only if the world around is also coherent. Robert De Beaugrande and Wolfgang U. Dressler define coherence as a “continuity of senses” and “the mutual access and relevance within a configuration of concepts and relations”.De Beaugrande, Robert /Dressler, Wolfgang: Introduction to Text Linguistics. New York, 1996. P. 84 – 112. Thereby a textual world is created that does not have to comply to the real world. But within this textual world the arguments also have to be connected logically so that the reader/hearer can produce coherence. \\"Continuity of senses\\" implies a link between cohesion and the theory of Schemata initially proposed by F.

It can thus be assumed that a text is not always one because the existence of coherence is not always a given.

If the pair (\\\\langle x\\\\rangle,\\\\langle p\\\\rangle) were to satisfy Newton's second law, the right-hand side of the second equation would have to be :-V'\\\\left(\\\\left\\\\langle x\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\right), which is typically not the same as :-\\\\left\\\\langle V'(x)\\\\right\\\\rangle. If for example, the potential V(x) is cubic, (i.e. proportional to x^3), then V' is quadratic (proportional to x^2). This means, in the case of Newton's second law, the right side would be in the form of \\\\langle x\\\\rangle^2, while in the Ehrenfest theorem it is in the form of \\\\langle x^2\\\\rangle. The difference between these two quantities is the square of the uncertainty in x and is therefore nonzero. An exception occurs in case when the classical equations of motion are linear, that is, when V is quadratic and V' is linear. In that special case, V'\\\\left(\\\\left\\\\langle x\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\right) and \\\\left\\\\langle V'(x)\\\\right\\\\rangle do agree. Thus, for the case of a quantum harmonic oscillator, the expected position and expected momentum do exactly follow the classical trajectories. For general systems, if the wave function is highly concentrated around a point x_0, then V'\\\\left(\\\\left\\\\langle x\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\right) and \\\\left\\\\langle V'(x)\\\\right\\\\rangle will be almost the same, since both will be approximately equal to V'(x_0). In that case, the expected position and expected momentum will approximately follow the classical trajectories, at least for as long as the wave function remains localized in position. p. 78 The Ehrenfest theorem is a special case of a more general relation between the expectation of any quantum mechanical operator and the expectation of the commutator of that operator with the Hamiltonian of the system where is some quantum mechanical operator and is its expectation value. This more general theorem was not actually derived by Ehrenfest (it is due to Werner Heisenberg). It is most apparent in the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics, where it is just the expectation value of the Heisenberg equation of motion. It provides mathematical support to the correspondence principle. The reason is that Ehrenfest's theorem is closely related to Liouville's theorem of Hamiltonian mechanics, which involves the Poisson bracket instead of a commutator. Dirac's rule of thumb suggests that statements in quantum mechanics which contain a commutator correspond to statements in classical mechanics where the commutator is supplanted by a Poisson bracket multiplied by . This makes the operator expectation values obey corresponding classical equations of motion, provided the Hamiltonian is at most quadratic in the coordinates and momenta. Otherwise, the evolution equations still may hold approximately, provided fluctuations are small. == Derivation in the Schrödinger picture == Suppose some system is presently in a quantum state . If we want to know the instantaneous time derivative of the expectation value of , that is, by definition :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}\\\\langle A\\\\rangle &= \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}\\\\int \\\\Phi^* A \\\\Phi\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}^3x \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\int \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi^*}{\\\\partial t} \\\\right) A\\\\Phi\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}^3x + \\\\int \\\\Phi^* \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial A}{\\\\partial t}\\\\right) \\\\Phi\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}^3x +\\\\int \\\\Phi^* A \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial t} \\\\right)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}^3x \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\int \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi^*}{\\\\partial t} \\\\right) A\\\\Phi\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}^3x + \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial A}{\\\\partial t}\\\\right\\\\rangle + \\\\int \\\\Phi^* A \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial t} \\\\right)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}^3x \\\\end{align} where we are integrating over all of space. If we apply the Schrödinger equation, we find that :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\frac{1}{i\\\\hbar}H\\\\Phi By taking the complex conjugate we find :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi^*}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\frac{1}{i\\\\hbar}\\\\Phi^*H^* = -\\\\frac{1}{i\\\\hbar}\\\\Phi^*H. In bra–ket notation, \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}\\\\langle \\\\phi x\\\\rangle =\\\\frac{-1}{i\\\\hbar}\\\\langle \\\\phi \\\\hat{H}x\\\\rangle =\\\\frac{-1}{i\\\\hbar}\\\\langle \\\\phi x \\\\rangle H=\\\\frac{-1}{i\\\\hbar}\\\\Phi^*H, where \\\\hat{H} is the Hamiltonian operator, and is the Hamiltonian represented in coordinate space (as is the case in the derivation above). In other words, we applied the adjoint operation to the entire Schrödinger equation, which flipped the order of operations for and . Note , because the Hamiltonian is Hermitian. Placing this into the above equation we have :\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\langle A\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{i\\\\hbar}\\\\int \\\\Phi^* (AH-HA) \\\\Phi~d^3x + \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial A}{\\\\partial t}\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{i\\\\hbar}\\\\langle [A,H]\\\\rangle + \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial A}{\\\\partial t}\\\\right\\\\rangle. Often (but not always) the operator is time-independent so that its derivative is zero and we can ignore the last term. == Derivation in the Heisenberg picture == In the Heisenberg picture, the derivation is trivial. The Heisenberg picture moves the time dependence of the system to operators instead of state vectors. Starting with the Heisenberg equation of motion :\\\\frac{d}{dt}A(t) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial A(t)}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{1}{i \\\\hbar}[A(t),H], we can derive Ehrenfest's theorem simply by projecting the Heisenberg equation onto \\\\Psi\\\\rangle from the right and \\\\langle\\\\Psi from the left, or taking the expectation value, so :\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\Psi\\\\left\\\\frac{d}{dt}A(t)\\\\right\\\\Psi\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\Psi\\\\left\\\\frac{\\\\partial A(t)}{\\\\partial t}\\\\right\\\\Psi\\\\right\\\\rangle + \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\Psi\\\\left\\\\frac{1}{i \\\\hbar}[A(t),H]\\\\right\\\\Psi\\\\right\\\\rangle, We can pull the out of the first term since the state vectors are no longer time dependent in the Heisenberg Picture. Therefore, :\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\langle A(t)\\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\frac{\\\\partial A(t)}{\\\\partial t}\\\\right\\\\rangle + \\\\frac{1}{i \\\\hbar}\\\\left\\\\langle[A(t),H]\\\\right\\\\rangle == General example == The expectation values of the theorem, however, are the very same in the Schrödinger picture as well. For the very general example of a massive particle moving in a potential, the Hamiltonian is simply : H(x,p,t) = \\\\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x,t) where is the position of the particle. Suppose we wanted to know the instantaneous change in the expectation of the momentum . Using Ehrenfest's theorem, we have : \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\langle p\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{i\\\\hbar}\\\\langle [p,H]\\\\rangle + \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial t}\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{i\\\\hbar}\\\\langle [p,V(x,t)]\\\\rangle, since the operator commutes with itself and has no time dependence.Although the expectation value of the momentum , which is a real-number-valued function of time, will have time dependence, the momentum operator itself, does not, in this picture: Rather, the momentum operator is a constant linear operator on the Hilbert space of the system. The time dependence of the expectation value, in this picture, is due to the time evolution of the wavefunction for which the expectation value is calculated. An Ad hoc example of an operator which does have time dependence is , where is the ordinary position operator and is just the (non-operator) time, a parameter. By expanding the right-hand-side, replacing by , we get :\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\langle p\\\\rangle = \\\\int \\\\Phi^* V(x,t)\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}\\\\Phi~dx - \\\\int \\\\Phi^* \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} (V(x,t)\\\\Phi)~dx ~. After applying the product rule on the second term, we have : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\langle p\\\\rangle &= \\\\int \\\\Phi^* V(x,t) \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}\\\\Phi~dx - \\\\int \\\\Phi^* \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} V(x,t)\\\\right)\\\\Phi ~dx - \\\\int \\\\Phi^* V(x,t) \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}\\\\Phi~dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= - \\\\int \\\\Phi^* \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} V(x,t)\\\\right)\\\\Phi ~dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left\\\\langle - \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} V(x,t)\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\langle F \\\\rangle. \\\\end{align} As explained in the introduction, this result does not say that the pair (\\\\langle X\\\\rangle,\\\\langle P\\\\rangle) satisfies Newton's second law, because the right-hand side of the formula is \\\\langle F(x,t)\\\\rangle, rather than F(\\\\langle X\\\\rangle,t). Nevertheless, as explained in the introduction, for states that are highly localized in space, the expected position and momentum will approximately follow classical trajectories, which may be understood as an instance of the correspondence principle. Similarly, we can obtain the instantaneous change in the position expectation value. :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\langle x\\\\rangle &= \\\\frac{1}{i\\\\hbar}\\\\langle [x,H]\\\\rangle + \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial t}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{i\\\\hbar} \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\left [x,\\\\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x,t) \\\\right ] \\\\right \\\\rangle + 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{i\\\\hbar} \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\left [x,\\\\frac{p^2}{2m} \\\\right] \\\\right \\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{i\\\\hbar 2 m} \\\\left \\\\langle [x,p] \\\\frac{d}{dp} p^2 \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{i\\\\hbar 2 m}\\\\langle i \\\\hbar 2 p\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\langle p\\\\rangle \\\\end{align} This result is actually in exact accord with the classical equation. == Derivation of the Schrödinger equation from the Ehrenfest theorems == It was established above that the Ehrenfest theorems are consequences of the Schrödinger equation. However, the converse is also true: the Schrödinger equation can be inferred from the Ehrenfest theorems. We begin from :\\\\begin{align} m\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\Psi(t) \\\\right  \\\\hat{x} \\\\left  \\\\Psi(t) \\\\right \\\\rangle &= \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\Psi(t) \\\\right  \\\\hat{p} \\\\left  \\\\Psi(t) \\\\right \\\\rangle, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\Psi(t) \\\\right  \\\\hat{p} \\\\left  \\\\Psi(t) \\\\right \\\\rangle &= \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\Psi(t) \\\\right  -V'(\\\\hat{x}) \\\\left  \\\\Psi(t) \\\\right \\\\rangle. \\\\end{align} Application of the product rule leads to :\\\\begin{align} \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\frac{d\\\\Psi}{dt} \\\\Big  \\\\hat{x} \\\\Big  \\\\Psi \\\\right \\\\rangle + \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\Psi \\\\Big  \\\\hat{x} \\\\Big  \\\\frac{d\\\\Psi}{dt} \\\\right \\\\rangle &= \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\Psi \\\\Big  \\\\frac{\\\\hat{p}}{m} \\\\Big  \\\\Psi \\\\right \\\\rangle, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\frac{d\\\\Psi}{dt} \\\\Big  \\\\hat{p} \\\\Big  \\\\Psi \\\\right \\\\rangle + \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\Psi \\\\Big  \\\\hat{p} \\\\Big  \\\\frac{d\\\\Psi}{dt} \\\\right \\\\rangle &= \\\\langle \\\\Psi  -V'(\\\\hat{x})  \\\\Psi \\\\rangle, \\\\end{align} Here, apply Stone's theorem, using to denote the quantum generator of time translation. The next step is to show that this is the same as the Hamiltonian operator used in quantum mechanics. Stone's theorem implies :i\\\\hbar \\\\left  \\\\frac{d\\\\Psi}{dt} \\\\right \\\\rangle = \\\\hat{H}  \\\\Psi(t) \\\\rangle ~, where was introduced as a normalization constant to the balance dimensionality. Since these identities must be valid for any initial state, the averaging can be dropped and the system of commutator equations for are derived: :im [\\\\hat{H}, \\\\hat{x}] = \\\\hbar \\\\hat{p}, \\\\qquad i [\\\\hat{H}, \\\\hat{p}] = -\\\\hbar V'(\\\\hat{x}). Assuming that observables of the coordinate and momentum obey the canonical commutation relation . Setting \\\\hat{H} = H(\\\\hat{x}, \\\\hat{p}), the commutator equations can be converted into the differential equations :m \\\\frac{\\\\partial H (x,p)}{\\\\partial p} = p, \\\\qquad \\\\frac{\\\\partial H(x,p)}{\\\\partial x} = V'(x), whose solution is the familiar quantum Hamiltonian :\\\\hat{H} = \\\\frac{\\\\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(\\\\hat{x}). Whence, the Schrödinger equation was derived from the Ehrenfest theorems by assuming the canonical commutation relation between the coordinate and momentum. If one assumes that the coordinate and momentum commute, the same computational method leads to the Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics, which is the Hilbert space formulation of classical mechanics. Therefore, this derivation as well as the derivation of the Koopman–von Neumann mechanics, shows that the essential difference between quantum and classical mechanics reduces to the value of the commutator . The implications of the Ehrenfest theorem for systems with classically chaotic dynamics are discussed at Scholarpedia article Ehrenfest time and chaos. Due to exponential instability of classical trajectories the Ehrenfest time, on which there is a complete correspondence between quantum and classical evolution, is shown to be logarithmically short being proportional to a logarithm of typical quantum number. For the case of integrable dynamics this time scale is much larger being proportional to a certain power of quantum number. == Notes == ==References== * Category: Quantum mechanics Category:Theorems in quantum mechanics Category: Mathematical physics ","title":"Ehrenfest theorem"},{"id":"2585996","text":"Mid-South may refer to: * Mid-South (region), a region of the United States including portions of Tennessee, Mississippi, Kentucky, and Missouri * East South Central States, a region of the United States * Memphis metropolitan area, Tennessee, United States * Mid-South Bible College, now Victory University, a Christian liberal-arts college in Memphis Tennessee * Mid-South Coliseum, a multi-purpose arena in Memphis, Tennessee * Mid-South Community College, a public community college in West Memphis, Arkansas * Mid-South Conference, an American college athletics conference * Mid South Conference (MHSAA), an American high school athletics conference in Michigan * Mid-South District (LCMS) in the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod * Mid-South District of the Unitarian Universalist Association * Mid-South Fair, a fair formerly held in Memphis, Tennessee * Mid-South Management Company, an American newspaper company * Mid-South Pride, a LGBT non-profit association in Memphis, Tennessee * MidSouth Rail Corporation, now part of the Kansas City Southern Railway * Mid-South Wrestling, an American former professional wrestling promotion * Midsouth FC, former name of Belizean football club Nizhee Corozal ","title":"Mid-South"},{"id":"2586001","text":"Niels Jonsson Stromberg af Clastorp (March 25, 1646 – August 16, 1723) was a Swedish soldier and Governor-General of Swedish Estonia from 1706 to 1709.

Lesage was the deputy Minister of Public Works. All around the Parliament building are 24 statues of historical figures. They originally included founders (Jacques Cartier, Samuel de Champlain and de Maisonneuve), clerics (de Laval, de Brébeuf, Marquette and Olier), military men (de Frontenac, Wolfe, de Montcalm and de Levis), Amerindians, French governors (D'Argenson, de Tracy, de Callières, de Montmagny, d'Aillesbout, de Vaudreuil) and, in the words of Taché, \\"some English governors the most sympathetic to our nationality\\" (Murray, Dorchester, Prevost and Bagot) and Lord Elgin, who was given a special place for he was seen as an important player in obtaining \\"responsible government\\". Taché purposely left blank spaces to allow future generations to add their own statues. His contemporaries, however, did not have any trouble interpreting its meaning. The first interpretations that can be cited are those of historian Thomas Chapais and civil servant Ernest Gagnon. Chapais, during a speech given for the occasion of the unveiling of a bronze statue honouring de Lévis, on June 24, 1895, said: \\"the province of Quebec has a motto of which she is proud and which she likes enough to carve it on her monuments and palaces. This motto has only three words: ; but these three words, in their simple economy of expression, are worth more than the most eloquent speeches. Yes, we remember. We remember the past and its lessons, the past and its misfortunes, the past and its glories.\\"\\"\\" In 1896, Gagnon wrote that the motto \\"admirably sums up the of Champlain and Maisonneuve's Canada as a distinct province in the confederation.\\"\\"\\" - Ernest Gagnon. \\"\\" in , Documents de la session, 1896, 1, doc. 7, p. 115-116. In 1919, seven years after Taché's death, the historian Pierre-Georges Roy underlined the symbolic character of the three-word motto: \\"which says so eloquently in three words, the past as well as the present and the future of the only French province of the confederation.\\"\\"\\" - Pierre-Georges Roy (1919). , Lévis, 1919, p. 285. This sentence would be cited or paraphrased several times afterwards. Various scholars have attempted to discover the source of Taché's words. The ethnologist Conrad Laforte has suggested that they might derive from the song , or possibly Victor Hugo's poem . Writer André Duval thought the answer was simpler and closer at hand: In the hall of the Parliament building in which the motto is carved above the door, are the arms of the Marquess of Lorne whose motto was (\\"do not forget\\"). Consequently, Duval believed \\"the motto of Quebec to be at the same time the translation of the Marquess of Lorne's motto and the answer of a French-Canadian subject of Her Majesty to the said motto.\\" Research published in English before 1978 led to the same conclusions regarding the motto's origin, the number of words it has and its interpretation. A 1934 biographical notice about Taché reads: \\"M. Taché is also the author of the beautiful poetic and patriotic motto which accompanies the official coat of arms of the Province of Quebec — — the full significance of which cannot perhaps be readily expressed in English words but which may be paraphrased as conveying the meaning 'We do not forget, and will never forget, our ancient lineage, traditions and memories of all the past'.\\" Encyclopedias and quotation dictionaries, including those of Wallace, Hamilton, Colombo or Hamilton and Shields, all provide the same information as the French-language sources. In 1955, the historian Mason Wade added his opinion by writing: \\"When the French Canadian says , he not only remembers the days of New France but also the fact that he belongs to a conquered people.\\"Mason Wade, The French Canadians, 1760–1945, Toronto, 1955, p. 47. == Controversy and \\"second motto\\" == Since 1978, the Quebec licence plate has featured the phrase \\"Je me souviens\\" In 1978, replaced the tourist-oriented motto on Quebec's vehicle registration plate. According to the historian Gaston Deschênes, this event marks the start of a new period of attempts to reinterpret the meaning of the motto in the mainstream media of Canada. On February 4, 1978, Robert Goyette signed an article entitled \\"Car owners argue over motto\\" in The Montreal Star. This article attracted the attention of a reader, Hélène Pâquet, a granddaughter of Taché who replied on February 15 in an open letter entitled \\". It reads in part: The lily refers to France while the rose refers to England, both relating to the floral emblems of the nations. The idea that the motto had a lesser known second part spread widely. This new piece of information had a long life in the media before it was investigated by Deschênes in 1992. When Deschênes contacted Hélène Pâquet in 1992, she was unable to specify the origin of text she quoted in her letter. Her statements were not conformable to those of her father, Lieutenant-Colonel Étienne- Théodore Pâquet Jr.,Son of Étienne-Théodore Pâquet, a provincial MLA. who on March 3, 1939, wrote in a letter to John Samuel Bourque, Tâché's son-in-law, and Minister of Public Works, that \\"the one who synthesized in three words the history and traditions of our race deserves to be recognized\\" as much as Routhier and Lavallée who composed the \\"O Canada\\". The origin of the second part is today known to be a second motto, created by the same Eugène-Étienne Taché, many years after the first one, and originally destined to be used on a monument honouring the Canadian nation, but which was never built. The monument was to be a statue of a young and graceful adolescent girl, an allegoric figure of the Canadian nation, bearing the motto: \\"Née dans les lis, je grandis dans les roses / Born in the lilies, I grow in the roses\\". While the project was never realized, the idea was \\"recycled\\" in a commemorative medal for the 300th anniversary of the foundation of Quebec City, created by Taché, on which is written (\\"Born under the lilies, God helping, Champlain's work has grown under the roses\\")., 1608-1908, Québec, 1911, p. 22-23. == Other uses == is also the motto of the Royal 22e Régiment, a Francophone regiment of the Canadian Forces.Royal 22e Régiment Traditions ==See also== * , documentary film * List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols * , 1842 song by Antoine Gérin-Lajoie that includes == Notes == == References == ; English * Deschênes, Gaston. \\"Je me souviens\\", in HistoryWire, March 26, 2009 * Deschenes, Gaston. \\"Gaston Deschenes on the motto mystery: deciphering the true meaning of Quebec's famous slogan, Je me souviens\\", in The Beaver: Exploring Canada's History, February 1, 2008 excerpt ; French * Deschênes, Gaston. \\"La devise québécoise « Je me souviens »\\", in , February 1, 2011 * Deschênes, Gaston. \\"La devise « Je me souviens »\\", in , online since September 14, 2001, updated on May 20, 2006 * Gouvernement du Québec. \\"La devise du Québec\\", in the site of the Government of Quebec, updated January 14, 2008 * Albert, Madeleine and Gaston Deschênes. \\"Une devise centenaire : Je me souviens\\", in , 14, 2 (April 1984), p. 21-30.

It is situated east of Liverpool Lime Street. Electrically powered trains have been operating through the station since March 2015, using Class 319 EMUs. ==History== The oldest passenger station in the world was Crown Street railway station on the Liverpool and Manchester passenger railway opening on 17 September 1830. The trains set out on the first day at the Liverpool end. The second station on the line was the original Edge Hill railway station, the third was Broad Green station. In 1836 Crown Street station was demolished and Edge Hill decommissioned. A new Edge Hill station opened to the north of the original station in the grounds of the Edge Hill junction. This leaves Broad Green station as the oldest used railway station in the world. The current station buildings are not originalhttp://www.8dassociation.btck.co.uk/Stations/TheLM dating from 1972. About to the east of the station the abandoned North Liverpool Extension Line passes under the lines, which is currently part of the Trans Pennine Trail.OpenStreetMap ==Facilities== The ticket office is located on the Liverpool-bound platform (platform 1) and like most Merseytravel-sponsored stations is manned throughout the hours of service, seven days per week. A waiting shelter is provided on platform 2 and there are digital display screens and customer help points provided on both sides. The platforms are linked by a subway with steps, but level access is available to both sides via nearby streets.Broad Green station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 11 January 2017 Merseytravel announced in April 2019 that they had been successful in a bid for funding lifts being installed at the station under the Department for Transport's ‘Access for All’ programme. The lifts are expected to be installed at some point over the following five years. The station is located very close to junction 4 of the M62 motorway however it is not a 'parkway' or an 'interchange' station. It has recently introduced a 'Park and Ride' scheme, with a large car park situated on the south side of the station. Broadgreen Hospital is a little under half a mile away. ==Services== The station is operated by Northern Trains, being served by trains from Liverpool Lime Street to Wigan North Western, Manchester Victoria and Warrington Bank Quay. Trains to and from Liverpool Lime Street are approximately every 15 minutes through most of the day. The normal eastbound off-peak service is of two trains per hour to Wigan North Western, one to Manchester Piccadilly and thence to and one to Warrington Bank Quay. Westbound, there are four trains per hour to Liverpool Lime Street. A more frequent service operates at peak times, including a few trains to and from Manchester Victoria. On Sundays, there is an hourly service from Lime Street to Blackpool North via Wigan North Western and Preston and a second train each hour to Wigan only. In addition services run hourly from Lime Street to via Manchester Piccadilly and the Airport calling at all stations en route to Piccadilly. There is no service to Warrington Bank Quay on a Sunday.

A letter written by Sam Houston to President Andrew Jackson on Pryor's behalf noted that Pryor was a first cousin to John Floyd, governor of Virginia. His family moved to Kentucky when he was eleven. Nathaniel was the son of John Pryor who was deceased by 1791 when Nathaniel and his brother Robert were recorded as orphans in Jefferson County court records. He was married in 1798 to Peggy Patton. == Lewis and Clark Expedition == He joined the expedition on October 20, 1803, in Clarksville, Indiana; he was one of the \\"nine young men from Kentucky\\" who joined the Corps. Pryor was made sergeant in 1804, and led the First Squad of six privates. William Clark later wrote, \\"Capt. Pryor served with me, on an expedition to the Pacific ocean in 1803, 4, 5, and 6 in the capacity of 1st Sergeant.\\" Lewis and Clark considered Pryor \\"a man of character and ability.\\" In June, 1804 he presided over a court martial of privates John Collins and Hugh Hall, accused of theft of whiskey and drinking on duty; the men were found guilty and sentenced to a flogging. == After the Expedition == In 1807 he was put in charge of an expedition to return Mandan chief Sheheke to his tribe, but he was forced to turn back when attacked by Arikaras. An 1838 California marriage at Mission San Gabriel is archived in the online collection of mission records at The Huntington Library. It reveals that a man named Nathaniel Pryor (aka Miguel Pryor) born about 1806 in Kentucky claimed Nathaniel Pryor of Louisville and Mary Davis as his parents. This information indicates that the subject possibly returned to Kentucky, fathering a son, after his journey westward. He resigned from the army in 1810 and was involved in the fur trade on the Mississippi. == War of 1812 == He rejoined the army during the War of 1812 and, with help from Clark and Lewis, was commissioned a Captain, serving in the Battle of New Orleans. Pryor's death was erroneously reported in national newspapers in 1812: \\"Gen. Wm.

It was designed by Willem van der Poel of the Netherlands Post, Telegraph and Telephone, and first delivered in 1958. The production run consisted of fifty-five machines, manufactured and marketed by the British company Standard Telephones and Cables, Ltd. The ZEBRA was a binary, two-address machine with a 33-bit word length. Storage was provided by a magnetic drum memory holding 8K words; accumulators were also implemented as recirculating drum tracks in a manner similar to that used in the Bendix G-15. Peripherals included paper tape reader and punch, and a teleprinter. In 1967, six Zebra computers were in use in UK universities and technical colleges. == Programming == The ZEBRA instruction word consists of a 13-bit drum address, a five-bit register (or I/O) address, and a 15-bit operation field. Each bit of the operation field had a distinct meaning and could be used in nearly any combination, leading to many elegant tricks that today might be considered the domain of microprogramming. Some bits made an instruction conditional on the accumulator state, as with the Zuse Z22 or Electrologica X1. Multiplication, division, square root, as well as all floating-point operations, were performed by subroutines, using the underlying serial computer ALU primitives add, subtract, shift right, shift left, and increment. Programming aids included the Normal Code (assembler), trace utility, a floating-point interpretive system, the Simple Code, the Matrix Interpretive Scheme, and an Algol compiler.

In a poorly written program, the average wait time could be half the drum rotation time, but there were ways to reduce this.

Born in Pisa to an old Sephardi family, he was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal for Military Valour, Italy's highest honor for heroism. Eugenio Calò was an Italian partisan, second in command of the Pio Borri partisan division that fought the Germans in the Casentino mountains in Tuscany. As a Jewish victim of fascist Italy during the Second World War, Calò had lost his workshop, his home, and his family. Finally, at the age of 38, he was captured, tortured and murdered by the Germans. ==German occupation== deported first to a concentration camp in Fossoli, and then on to Auschwitz. After the German invasion in 1943, the anti-Semitic persecutions increased. The Fascists and the Germans began arresting the Jews and sending them to concentration camps. When Calò had learned about the capture of his family and the fact that they had been kept in Florence's Le Murate prison, he tried to organize their escape. His efforts were in vain. In May 1944 they were all deported to a concentration camp in Fossoli, and on the 16th of that month were sent on a transport to Auschwitz. His wife Carolina Lombroso gave birth to their fourth son while on the train. His family was killed by the Germans immediately upon arriving at Auschwitz. Two months later, Calò and his fellow partisans captured a group of some thirty German soldiers. Acting on his moral authority as commander and as a human being, Calò opposed his fellow partisans who asked for a summary trial and execution of the prisoners. Instead, he insisted on treating the German soldiers as prisoners of war. He volunteered to take the prisoners across German lines, and extradite them to the hands of the allied forces. The Germans soldiers were notorious for their revenge and reprisal massacres of the civilian population. It was quite obvious to the partisans that if captured with German prisoners, they would be tortured and killed along with some innocent villagers. On July 2, 1944, the prisoners were transferred by Calò and other partisans - among them, Angelo Recapito and Luigi Valentini – to the Allied Headquarters in Cortona across the frontline. General Mark Clark, commander of the US Fifth Army, asked for two volunteers who would take messages back to the partisans in order to coordinate their activities towards the liberation of the city of Arezzo which was planned for July 14. Calò and Angelo Recapito volunteered to go back and deliver the message. They succeeded in their mission and rejoined their friends, but were captured on July 14 along with a group of civilians and other partisans at Molin dei Falchi, where they had intended to spend the night with some more German prisoners. One of the German prisoners had managed to escape and informed the German Army and some Italian fascist collaborators of the camp's existence. The Germans attacked and there was a fierce battle in which many partisans died. The survivors were transferred to the village of San Polo di Arezzo where all the men of the village were collected as well for the reprisal action. The captured partisans were brutally tortured and murdered. ==San Polo massacre== After September 8, 1943, the German invasion army was ordered by the highest authorities not to obey the Geneva Convention nor normal rules of war, and to show no mercy towards the civilian population. The high German command promised to give complete protection against all accusations of brutality. A specific order was issued to torture and kill everyone found with weapons and to terrorize the unarmed civilian population. For every German killed, ten Italian civilians were to be killed. As per these commands, all the men of San Polo were gathered and brought to Villa Mancini where the German officers were quartered. There, the partisans were brutally beaten with rubber hoses and tortured. Eugenio Calò and Angelo Recapito, who both had information pertaining to the Allied forces' military plans, maintained their silence. At the end of the day, the partisans, wounded and barely alive, along with the captured men of the village — forty-eight in all — were taken to a nearby field on the backyard of Villa Gigliosi that the German soldiers had requisitioned. The civilians were made to dig three pit graves and were then thrown in still alive. The partisans were placed in the pits with their heads above ground and with explosive charges attached to their bodies. They were then blown apart. The Germans did not allow anyone to bury the dead. Certificate of the Gold Medal for Military Valour awarded to Eugenio Calò. ==Gold medal for military valour== Calò had spared the lives of some thirty captured German soldiers and insisted on acting in a humane way, even though his own family (his wife Carolina Lombroso, daughter Elena and sons Renzo and Albertino) had been captured and sent to Auschwitz only a couple of months earlier. For his military activities against the Germans as a member of the Italian resistance movement, for his contribution as second in command of the Pio Borri partisan division that patrolled the Casentino mountains in Tuscany, for his bravery, and for his humanity, Eugenio Calò was awarded in 1947 the highest honor for military heroism in Italy, the \\"Gold Medal for Military Valour\\". Eugenio had paid with his life for his heroism. He was tortured and finally murdered by German soldiers. ==Remembering Eugenio Calò== The San Polo massacre is commemorated every year, as is the liberation of Arezzo on July 16, 1944. The local religious, civilian and military authorities participate in the ceremony. There are streets in Arezzo and Florence bearing the names of Eugenio Calò and Angelo Recapito and in the town of Quarata, near Arezzo, there is a school named after him. == San Polo trials == Former NSDAP member Herbert Handsk, who took part in the San Polo massacre, was released from prison in 2007 by the Italian justice. Aged 87, he was the only survivor of the perpetrators of the massacre. Klaus Konrad had died on August 15, 2006. He had also been indicted by the magistrates in the same trial. Konrad, who became after the war a deputy of the Bundestag from 1969 to 1980 as a member of Willy Brandt's SPD, had already been indicted by the Italian justice in 1967 and 1972, but the complaints had been classified AGI, La strage nazista di San Polo - il tribunale militare di la spezia assolve Handsk, 27 February 2007 == Footnotes == == See also == *Military history of Italy during World War II *History of the Jews in Italy *The British Eighth Army who liberated Arezzo on July 16, 1944 *The US Fifth Army that coordinated with the partisans at Cortona *de:Klaus Konrad ==References and bibliography== * Original research by Eugenio Calo's nephew Tullio Sonnino and Shmulik Suhami. *Fuochi sui Monti dell'Appennino Toscano:Antonio Curina ; D.

It was created by Philip Martin and starred Maurice Colbourne as John Kline, a former SAS officer recruited by law enforcement to become an undercover agent in Birmingham. == Production == Produced at the BBC's Pebble Mill Studios in Birmingham by David Rose, Gangsters began its television life as an edition of Play for Today in 1975, followed by two series transmitted in 1976 and 1978. The series, set in the multi-cultural criminal community of Birmingham, has remained a cult favourite, memorable for its strong violence, multi-ethnic cast (and realistic – and now rather shocking – depiction of the racism of the time) and highly stylised, post-modern approach to storytelling. Gangsters featured references to film noir, gangster films, westerns, Bollywood and kung fu movies, as well as increasingly surreal end-of-episode cliffhangers and a bizarre final scene where the characters not only \\"break the fourth wall\\" but walk off the set. The two series had quite different tones. The first was a gritty thriller whilst the second was more surreal, with more emphasis on the post-modern elements although it wasn't well received at the time. The theme music was an instrumental composed and performed by Dave Greenslade. It was released as a single with a character theme from the series, \\"Rubber Face, Lonely Eyes\\", on the B-side; the single was credited to Dave Greenslade's band Greenslade, even though the only performers on both tracks are Dave Greenslade and a session drummer. Greenslade recorded their own version of the song for their album Time and Tide. At David Rose's request, for the last series Dave Greenslade adapted it into a version with lyrics sung by Chris Farlowe. ==Cast== * John Kline (Maurice Colbourne) – a tough, shady former SAS soldier recently released from prison who becomes embroiled in the intrigues of the local underworld while attempting to go straight. * Khan (Ahmed Khalil) – Pakistani police detective who uses Kline as a pawn in his bid to nail the organised crime syndicates of Birmingham. * Anne Darracott (Elizabeth Cassidy) – a young woman and former heroin addict who becomes Kline's live-in lover. * Aslam Rafiq (Saeed Jaffrey) – the charismatic boss of a racket trafficking illegal immigrants. * Sarah Gant (Alibe Parsons) – glamorous undercover CIA agent out to nail the drug trade in the city, with a private mission to avenge the murder of her sister. * Kuldip (Paul Satvendar) – Rafiq's murderous henchman. * Malleson (Paul Barber) – a former thug who takes over his boss’s underworld empire after he is killed and proves to be a formidable adversary of Kline and Khan. * Shen Tang (Robert Lee) – the leader of a local Chinese Triad gang. * Lily Li Tang (Chai Lee) – the daughter of Shen Tang, who assists her father in the running of the Triad. * Rolf Day (Rolf Day) – The racist night club comedian who appears in the Rum Runner night club. * The series's writer, Philip Martin, also appeared in multiple roles, playing the gangland boss Rawlinson in the original play, the hired assassin 'The White Devil' at the end of season two (though Martin was credited as Larson E Whipsnide, a reference to his WC Fields inspired performance as the character), and as himself, dictating the script to a typist, in cutaways throughout season two. ==DVD release== The complete series of Gangsters was released on DVD (Region 2, UK) through 2 Entertain/Cinema Club in April 2006. ==ReferencesAction TV * Newton's Laws Of Television: Gangsters * British Film Institute Screen Online * Gangsters article at The Anorak Zone Category:1975 British television series debuts Category:1978 British television series endings Category:1970s British drama television series Category:BBC television dramas Category:1970s British crime television series Category:Television shows set in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Play for Today Category:English-language television shows ","title":"Gangsters (TV series)"},{"id":"2586041","text":"Homes bordering Point Defiance Park Neighborhood at Stack Hill, above Point Ruston North Tacoma (also called the North End) is a neighborhood in Tacoma, Washington, in the United States. The area is most known for waterfront parks and restaurants, the Point Defiance Park, the University of Puget Sound, Stadium High School, and the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. == Background == The North End of Tacoma has informal and formal boundaries. Informally, the generally accepted boundaries of the North End are 6th Avenue and Division Avenue to the south and Puget Sound to the north, west, and east. Although the independent city of Ruston is not legally a part of the city of Tacoma, most residents of Ruston self-identify as being from Tacoma. Formally, the city has designations for each of the eight neighborhoods which are represented by neighborhood councils. These designations are not generally known, but they are marked on city streets by special signs. For the North End, 6th Ave forms the boundary on the south and southeast to 4th St., Puget Sound which runs NE to North, 46th St. on the North to Huson, and back down to 6th on the South. While much of the West End and some the Central District (such as the Stadium District) are identified with the informal boundaries of the North End, the City of Tacoma identifies these area as separate for purposes of representation and planning. The main commercial areas are along Sixth Ave and in the Proctor District and Old Town. The Sixth Ave corridor, Old Town and the Proctor District, have a variety of independent restaurants and shops. Although the area has a traditional heritage of lower middle class residents such as fisherman and ASARCO plant workers (before it was demolished in 1993), the community has a small town feel. Most north end residents still work in Tacoma as evidenced by commute time figures from the 2000 Census. The waterfront, specifically around Old Tacoma has undergone redevelopment in recent years. North Tacoma votes heavily Democratic on federal, state, and local areas, with all precincts giving sizable victories to John Kerry in the 2004 Presidential election, Barack Obama in 2008, and U.S. Senator Patty Murray in 2010. ==Neighborhoods== *Buckley Addition *College Park National Historic District *North Slope *Old Tacoma *Proctor District *Prospect Hill *Ruston (independent town) *Ruston Way *Skyline *Stadium District *Yakima Hill ==Parks== *Baltimore Park *Commencement Park *Cummings Park *Dickman Mill Park *Garfield Park *Hamilton Park *Jack Hyde Park *Jane Clark Playfield *Jefferson Park *Kandle Park *Les Davis Pier/Marine Park *North Slope Historic Park *Old Town Dock *Old Town Park *Optimist Park *Point Defiance Park *Proctor Community Garden *Puget Gardens Park *Puget Park *Ruston Way Park *Titlow Park *Ursich Gulch *Vassault Playfield *War Memorial Park == Education == ===Public elementary schools=== *Downing Elementary School *Grant Elementary School *Jefferson Elementary School *Lowell Elementary School *Point Defiance Elementary School *Sherman Elementary School *Skyline Elementary School *Washington-Hoyt Elementary School ===Public middle schools=== *Jason Lee Middle School *Mason Middle School *Truman Middle School ===Public high schools=== *Stadium High School *Wilson High School ===Private schools=== *Annie Wright School *Saint Patrick Catholic School ===Universities=== *University of Puget Sound ==Other landmarks== *Blue Mouse Theatre *Commencement Bay *Cushman Substation & Towers *Engine House No. 9 *Fire Station 13 *Fort Nisqually *Old Woman's Gulch *Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium *Puget Creek *Tacoma Narrows Bridge *Washington School *College Park National Historic District Category:North Tacoma, Washington Category:Neighborhoods in Tacoma, Washington ","title":"North Tacoma, Tacoma, Washington"},{"id":"2586043","text":"Open container may refer to: * United States open-container laws, laws regarding the use of open alcohol containers in the United States of America * Open Container Initiative, a Free and Open Source project and specification for Linux containers * Open container an album by The Expendables ","title":"Open container"},{"id":"2586048","text":"LeRon Terrell McCoy (born January 24, 1982) is a former American football wide receiver.

It established in April 2000 by Murilo Bustamante, Ricardo Libório, Mário Sperry and Luis Roberto Duarte, former members of the Carlson Gracie Academy, to develop and create new training techniques for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, submission grappling and mixed martial arts. ==Rivalry with Chute Boxe== BTT maintains an intense rivalry with Brazilian mixed martial arts stable Chute Boxe, which is descended from a Muay Thai lineage. BTT traces its lineage to the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu of Carlson Gracie. The most storied chapter of this rivalry was reached at the apex of each team's success in PRIDE FC. Chute Boxe was comprised, at the time, of such fighters as Wanderlei Silva and Shogun Rua, and former UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva. BTT consisted of top fighters such as Ricardo Arona, former UFC Middleweight Championship holder Murilo Bustamante, the Nogueira Brothers, Vitor Belfort, Allan Goes, Mario Sperry, and former WEC Middleweight Champion Paulo Filho. Competition between the two teams was not limited to Pride FC matches. Bouts between fighters of the two camps took place in Brazil, Portugal, the U.S., and other parts of the world on a regular basis. ==Locations== In April 2000 BTT inaugurated a new center in Brazil for training professional fighters in mixed martial arts. It provides teachers of Muay Thai, boxing, wrestling, mixed martial arts and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

He played college football for the University of Texas, and was recognized as a consensus All-American. Davis was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals with the second pick overall of the 2001 NFL Draft, and also played professionally for the Arizona Cardinals, Dallas Cowboys, Detroit Lions and San Francisco 49ers of the NFL. ==Early years== Leonard grew up in Wortham, Texas. He is the only child of L.A. and Sammie Lee Davis, but has 21 half-brothers and half-sisters (L.A. had 11 children from a previous marriage, while Sammie Lee had 10 children from a previous marriage). He attended Wortham High School, where he led his Bulldogs basketball team to the state championship in 1997. In football, he received All-American honors playing defense and offense for a school with fewer than 150 students. He also lettered in track. ==College career== Davis received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Texas at Austin, arriving in John Mackovic's final season, with the intention of playing at defensive tackle and even starting three games. He was moved to the offensive line after Mack Brown was named the new head coach. He played left tackle in his last two years. During his career, he blocked for Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams and Hodges Mitchell. Following his senior season in 2000, he was a first-team All-Big 12 selection, and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American.2011 NCAA Football Records Book, Award Winners, National Collegiate Athletic Association, Indianapolis, Indiana, p. 11 (2011). Retrieved June 24, 2012. He was also a finalist for the Outland Trophy in two separate occasions. ==Professional career== ===Arizona Cardinals=== Davis was selected second overall in the 2001 NFL Draft by the Arizona Cardinals, and was named the starter at right guard as a rookie. The next year injuries on the offensive line forced the team to move him to right tackle. He was moved back to guard in 2003. In 2004, after Dennis Green was named the new head coach, he was moved to left tackle where he would remain for three seasons, even though he struggled at the position and was one of the highest penalized players in the league. On February 17, 2007, the Cardinals told Davis that they would not name him a franchise or transition player, clearing him to become an unrestricted free agent. ===Dallas Cowboys=== On March 4, 2007, Davis signed with the Dallas Cowboys for a seven-year, $49.6 million contract with $18.75 million guaranteed, who were looking to replace the retired Marco Rivera.Cowboys add Davis to offensive line At the time, the contract was criticized in the media, for the amount of salary cap space being assigned to a player that would play guard and that had an average performance in previous years. According to Forbes, Davis was the highest-paid NFL player and 19th overall athlete in the 12-month period ending in June 2007, earning $25.4 million.Forbes-In Pictures: The World's 25 Top-Earning Athletes He was named the starter at right guard and would flourish in Dallas by going to the Pro Bowl in his first three seasons. He had an exceptional year in 2007, as he received Pro Bowl and All-Pro honors for the first time in his career. The Cowboys finished 13-3 and won the NFC East division, but suffered a disappointing first round playoff loss against the New York Giants (who would go on to win the Super Bowl). In 2009, the Cowboys again won the division and also their first playoff game in 13 seasons. He was released on July 28, 2011, due to declining play and the team's lack of salary cap room. ===Detroit Lions=== On November 7, 2011, he signed a one-year deal with the Detroit Lions. After joining the team midway through the season, he was declared inactive for every game with the Lions. ===San Francisco 49ers=== On July 26, 2012, Davis signed a one-year deal with the San Francisco 49ers as a free agent. He was a backup and was a part of the team that reached Super Bowl XLVII. In the game, he contributed on special teams, but the 49ers fell to the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 34–31. ==Personal life== Davis is the bassist in the heavy metal band Free Reign with former Cowboys' teammates Marc Colombo and Cory Procter with guitarist Justin Chapman. His older half-brother Charlie Davis played defensive tackle in the NFL and the USFL. ==See also== *List of Texas Longhorns football All-Americans *List of Arizona Cardinals first-round draft picks ==References== ==External links== * Detroit Lions bio * Texas Longhorns football bio Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:All-American college football players Category:American football offensive guards Category:American football offensive tackles Category:Arizona Cardinals players Category:Dallas Cowboys players Category:Detroit Lions players Category:National Conference Pro Bowl players Category:San Francisco 49ers players Category:Texas Longhorns football players ","title":"Leonard Davis (American football)"},{"id":"2586095","text":"Amos Moore Lyle (October 8, 1866 - April 1943) was a politician in the Canadian provinceof Manitoba.

They remained popular during the 19th century, when they ran through many editions. They were illustrated by artists including John Leech, George Cruikshank, John Tenniel, and Arthur Rackham (1898 edition).Raphael Samuel, Theatres of Memory Vol 1 (London 1994) p. 447 As a priest of the Chapel Royal, with a private income,Ian Ousby ed., The Cambridge Guide to Literature In English (London 1995) p. 57 Barham was not troubled with strenuous duties and he had ample time to read and compose stories. Although based on real legends and mythology, chiefly Kentish,Raphael Samuel, Theatres of Memory Vol 1 (London 1994) p. 44 such as the \\"hand of glory\\", they are mostly deliberately humorous parodies or pastiches of medieval folklore and poetry. The best-known poem of the collection is the \\"Jackdaw of Rheims\\", about a jackdaw, who steals a cardinal's ring, and is made a saint. The village pub of Denton was renamed \\"The Jackdaw Inn\\" in 1963, after the story. The collection also contains one of the earliest transcriptions of the song \\"A Franklyn's Dogge\\", an early version of the modern children's song \\"Bingo\\". Barham introduced the collection with the grandiose statement that \\"The World, according to the best geographers, is divided into Europe, Asia, Africa, America and Romney Marsh\\".Quoted in Raphael Samuel, Theatres of Memory Vol 1 (London 1994) p. 443 ==List of chapters== A Saint, from the \\"Jackdaw of Rheims\\", by Briton Rivière, 1868 The chapters include:Ingloldsby contents == Allusions and references in other works == * In Patrick Leigh Fermor's A Time of Gifts, Chapter 11 \\"The Marches of Hungary\\", p. 312, on seeing a remarkably dressed old Hungarian soldier or official in a coach near the Danube in 1934, complete with brown fur and gold chain around his shoulders, a medal around his neck, and a scimitar across one knee: \\"('Twould have made you crazy' – the lines suddenly surfaced after years of oblivion – 'to see Esterhazy / with jools from his jasey / to his diamond boots.' Yes, indeed.)\\" [A jasey is a wig, the word possibly deriving from the garment a jersey.] * In H. Rider Haggard's 1885 novel King Solomon's Mines, Allan Quatermain describes himself as non-literary, claiming to have read regularly only the Bible and the Ingoldsby Legends. Later in the novel he quotes a poem that he attributes incorrectly to The Ingoldsby Legends, its actual source being Sir Walter Scott's epic poem Marmion. * In Henry James's 1888 essay \\"From London\\", his stay at Morley's Hotel (and the recollection of the four-poster bed) brings to mind \\"The Ingoldsby Legends\\", he 'scarce knows why'. * The narrator in the short story The Red Room (Wells) by H. G. Wells (1894) refers to making up rhymes about the legend 'Ingoldsby fashion' to calm himself. * In Sarah Grand's 1897 novel The Beth Book, the narrator and main character, Beth, mentions the Ingoldsby Legends as a favourite of her childhood and recites a passage from \\"The Execution\\" that appears in the collection. * In E. Nesbit's The Phoenix and the Carpet (1904), the children consult the Ingoldsby Legends when they want to improvise a magic ritual. * Rudyard Kipling's 1914 short story \\"The Dog Hervey\\", collected in A Diversity of Creatures (1917), references the dog Little Byngo from \\"A Lay of St Gengulphus\\". * In Dorothy L. Sayers's The Nine Tailors, Lord Peter Wimsey quotes from The Ingoldsby Legends, as he also does in her Five Red Herrings. * In Anthony Powell's 1968 The Military Philosophers, Nick Jenkins mentions reading The Ingoldsby Legends when he needs relaxation from Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time. * In Chapter 7 of Half Magic by Edward Eager, Katherine reads from The Ingoldsby Legends. * Edmund Wilson referenced the Ingoldsby Legends in Memoirs of Hecate County when he states that his friend, \\"staggered in tonight like the jackdaw of Rheims, cursed by bell and book, —\\". The two main characters then discuss the Ingoldsby Legends. * Kentish folk band Los Salvadores song Smugglers' Leap is based on the story of the same name featured in the Ingoldsby Legends. * P.G. Wodehouse refers to The Ingoldsby Legends in his novel A Prefect's Uncle (1903), comparing his title character to the lady in the earlier work \\"who didn't mind death, but who couldn't stand pinching\\". * Ngaio Marsh refers to The Ingoldsby Legends in Death in a White Tie. Troy tells about coming across Lord Tomnoddy and the hanging and the 'extraordinary impression' it had on her. She also makes references in Surfeit of Lampreys, the second time (Chapter 19 Part 4) with reference to The Hand of Glory. * It has been discussed at length that the oldest documented usage of the phrase \\"two shakes of a lamb's tail\\" can be found within this compilation of Barham's works. Evidences of this are found within the chapters The Babes In The Wood; Or, The Norfolk Tragedy (p. 344), A Row In An Omnibus (Box): A Legend Of The Haymarket (p. 359), and The Lay Of St Aloys: A Legend Of Blois (p. 380). (See external links below for full text download.) This phrase has been attributed more modern-day importance since nuclear scientists during WWII coined a new unit of measure termed a \\"shake\\", a very short unit of time, originally related to the Manhattan Project. * In Angela Thirkell's novel Miss Bunting (1946) the Ingoldsby Legends are referred to repeatedly (along with Butler, Byron and W. S. Gilbert) for comic effect as the Mixo-Slavian maid must study them very seriously in her cultural classes as examples of English humour. ==See also== ==References== == External links == * A Guide to Supernatural Fiction * The Ingoldsby Legends Online reading and multiple ebook formats at Ex-classics * The Jackdaw of Rheims Category:1837 short story collections Category:1840 short story collections Category:Horror short story collections Category:British short story collections Category:Books illustrated by Arthur Rackham Category:Books illustrated by George Cruikshank Category:Books illustrated by John Leech Category:Books illustrated by John Tenniel Category:Works originally published in Bentley's Miscellany Category:Works originally published in The New Monthly Magazine Category:J.

Old Town was originally a separate community from what is now downtown Tacoma, which was at first called \\"New Tacoma\\" before the two communities merged into one. Today the area features an historical park and a range of restaurants and shops. It is also home to two buildings on the National Historic Registry: St. Peter's Church, the first church built in Tacoma and now Tacoma's oldest existing building,http://www.oldstpeters.org/ and Slavonian Hall. The area is sometimes called Ruston Way, although the Ruston Way waterside walk spans far beyond the accepted bounds of Old Tacoma. ==References== ==External links== *Old Town Business District *Tacoma Public Library *History Link *The News Tribune Category:North Tacoma, Washington Category:Neighborhoods in Tacoma, Washington ","title":"Old Tacoma, Tacoma, Washington"},{"id":"2586152","text":"Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected is a collection of sixteen short stories written by British author Roald Dahl and first published in 1979.

Tifosi () is a group of supporters of a sports team, especially those that make up a tifo. ==Etymology== In Italian, literally means 'those infected by typhus', in the sense of someone acting in a fevered manner. Tifosi is used for a mixed gender or an all-male group; masculine singular is tifoso, feminine singular tifosa, feminine plural tifose. ==Football== The word is mainly used to describe fans of clubs in football. Apart from the many local fan clubs in Italy whose main role is (for example) to provide a meeting place for fans and friends and organize away trips, since the late 1960s many Italian fans rely on organized stadium groups known as Ultras. The main goal is to choreograph fan support with flags, banners, coloured smoke screens, flares, drums, and chanting in unison. For most teams city rivalries, colours, coat of arms, symbols, and the overall iconography have roots in the Middle Ages and early Renaissance. ==Formula One== The Tifosi at the 2003 Italian Grand Prix, Monza It has become common to use the word Tifosi to refer to the supporters of Scuderia Ferrari in Formula One. Italian motor racing fans are well known for their love of Ferrari, though they have also been staunch supporters of other Italian cars such as Maserati, Lancia and Alfa Romeo. The Tifosi provide Formula One with a sea of red filling the grandstands at the Italian Grand Prix. A similar sight could be observed in former years during the San Marino race which was held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari near the town of Imola, only 80 km (49.7 mi) east of the Ferrari factory in Maranello. One of the most common Tifosi sights is the display of an enormous Ferrari flag in the grandstands during Formula One weekends at every race circuit, with especially large contingents showing up in Ferrari livery at home and nearby European tracks. It has not been uncommon for the Tifosi in Italy to actually cheer for a non-Italian driver in a Ferrari passing an Italian driver in another make of car for the lead of a race. At the 1983 San Marino Grand Prix, the crowd at Imola cheered long and loud when Riccardo Patrese crashed his Brabham out of the lead of the race only 6 laps from home, handing Frenchman Patrick Tambay the win in his Ferrari. Patrese himself had only passed Tambay for the lead half a lap earlier. The recent increase in their ranks can be directly traced to the rise of Michael Schumacher, who drove for Ferrari from 1996 to 2006, leading the team to the Constructors' Championship from 1999–2004. One driver who never actually drove for the Prancing Horse, but will forever hold a special place in the hearts of the Tifosi is Frenchman Jean-Louis Schlesser. He drove for the Williams team at the 1988 Italian Grand Prix at Monza substituting for an ill Nigel Mansell. On lap 49 of the 51 lap race, Schlesser was unwittingly involved in the incident at the Variante del Rettifilo chicane that took out the leading McLaren-Honda of Ayrton Senna, fittingly handing Ferrari's Gerhard Berger and Michele Alboreto an emotional 1–2 Italian Grand Prix result only a month after the death of Enzo Ferrari. Berger's win handed McLaren their only loss of the 16-race season. ==Cycling== The word is commonly used to describe fans along the roadside at professional road cycling races in Italy such as Tirreno–Adriatico, Milan–San Remo, the Giro d'Italia, and the Giro di Lombardia. Passionate supporters of Italian cycling teams & cyclists are called 'the tifosi'. ==See also== * Curva * Ultras ==References== Category:Association football supporters Category:Football in Italy Category:Sports spectators Category:Cycle racing in Italy Category:Ferrari Category:Formula One Category:Italian words and phrases ","title":"Tifosi"},{"id":"2586195","text":"Jurislav \\"Jura\\" Stublić (born 19 December 1953) is a Croatian singer- songwriter. ==References== Category:1950s births Category:Singers from Sarajevo Category:Living people Category:Croatian rock musicians Category:Croatian male singers Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina rock singers Category:Yugoslav male singers Category:Croatian songwriters ","title":"Jura Stublić"},{"id":"2586203","text":"Robert William Duncan (born July 5, 1948) is an American Anglican bishop. He was the first primate and archbishop of the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA) from June 2009 to June 2014.Anglican Church in North America biography of Robert Duncan. Accessed April 15, 2010. In 1997, he was elected bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh. In 2008, a majority of the diocesan convention voted to leave the diocese and the Episcopal Church and, in October 2009, named their new church the Anglican Diocese of Pittsburgh. (The Episcopal Church continued to maintain its Diocese of Pittsburgh under new leadership.) Duncan served as bishop for the new Anglican diocese until 10 September 2016 upon the installation of his successor, Jim Hobby. Duncan served as moderator of the Anglican Communion Network from 2003 to 2009 and chairman of the Common Cause Partnership from 2004 until the creation of the Anglican Church in North America. He has honorary doctorates from General Theological Seminary (1996) and Nashotah House (2006). At the time of Duncan's departure from the Episcopal Church, he was described as \\"probably the top conservative Episcopal bishop in America\\". ==Early life and ministry== Duncan was born in Bordentown, New Jersey, in 1948. His mother suffered from mental illness and he found refuge from the tumult of his family life in prayer and meditation at Christ Episcopal Church in Bordentown. Duncan attended Bordentown Military Institute where he graduated valedictorian. He then entered Trinity College (A.B. cum laude) in Hartford, Connecticut. After graduating from Trinity in 1970, he enrolled at the General Theological Seminary of the Episcopal Church (MDiv., DD honoris causa) in New York. During his time at seminary, he also studied Scottish history at Edinburgh University. Duncan was ordained as a deacon on April 22, 1972, and as a priest on October 28, 1973, the feast of Saints Simon and Jude. His first assignments were at the Chapel of the Intercession in New York City; at Grace Church in Merchantville, New Jersey; and a short period at Christ Church in Edinburgh. From 1974 to 1978, he served as assistant dean at the General Seminary. He spent the next four years in campus ministries at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, serving as assistant rector for campus ministries at the Chapel of the Cross in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. In 1982, he was called to be rector of St. Thomas' parish in Newark, Delaware, where he served for 10 years. ==Election as bishop== Duncan was a candidate for Bishop of Colorado in 1990. In 1992, Alden M. Hathaway, then Bishop of Pittsburgh and a noted theological conservative, named Duncan his canon to the ordinary. He also served . In 1995 Duncan was elected as bishop coadjutor of the diocese of Pittsburgh and succeeded Hathaway upon his retirement in 1997. Duncan was not among the nominating committee's candidates, but instead nominated from the floor of the convention, however, and was eventually elected. The Diocese of Pittsburgh was at that time considered by many in the Episcopal Church to be one of the most conservative and evangelical dioceses in the Episcopal Church. Duncan served on the program committee of the Network for Anglicans in Mission and Evangelism, an agency created at the 1998 Lambeth Conference. ==Conservative leadership== Duncan quickly became the head of a group of Episcopal leaders hoping to maintain conservatism within the denomination. When openly gay priest Gene Robinson was elected Bishop of New Hampshire, Duncan voiced strong opposition to the election. After Robinson's election was confirmed by the church's general convention on August 5, 2003, Duncan acted as spokesman for a group of conservative bishops and lay leaders at a press conference expressing disappointment at Robinson's election. Duncan denounced the election claiming that the Episcopal Church had \\"departed from the historic faith and order of the Church of Jesus Christ\\". Duncan and Robinson were members of the same GTS class, both having taken their MDiv degrees in 1973. In January 2004, Duncan became the leader of the newly formed Network of Anglican Communion Dioceses and Parishes, a conservative action group whose stated mission was to allow \\"Episcopalians to remain in communion with the vast majority of the worldwide Anglican Communion who have declared either impaired or broken communion with the Episcopal Church (United States).\\" At the March 17, 2005, meeting of Episcopal Church's House of Bishops, Duncan read a speech in which he admitted that the rift between the two sides may be \\"irreconcilable\\".http://www.anglicancommunionnetwork.org/news/dspnews.cfm?id=126 In a possible sign of schism, St. Brendan's, a liberal parish in Franklin Park, Pennsylvania, announced in February 2005 that it no longer wished to be under Duncan's oversight.pittsburghlive.com In July 2007, Duncan made remarks criticizing Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, for inadequately supporting \\"orthodox\\" breakaways from ECUSA, declaring, \\"The cost is his office... To lose that historic office is a cost of such magnitude that God must be doing a new thing.\\" The statement critical of the Anglican Communion's worldwide leader led the Ephraim Radner to resign from the Anglican Communion Network, which he had assisted in founding, out of the concern that \\"Bishop Duncan has, in the end, decided to start a new church.\\"Jan Nunley, \\"Network delegates seek end to property litigation\\", Episcopal News Service, August 1, 2007 Radner explained, \\"Bishop Duncan has now declared the See of Canterbury and the Lambeth Conference -- two of the four Instruments of Communion within our tradition -- to be 'lost'.\\"E. Radner, \\"Resignation from ACN.\\" At the request of Rowan Williams, Duncan attended the 2007 Primates' Meeting in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. ==Deposition in the Episcopal Church== On January 15, 2008, the Title IV Review Committee of the Episcopal Church certified that, in its opinion, Duncan had \\"abandoned the Communion of this Church\\".http://www.episcopal-life.org/documents/PBLetterToDuncan.pdf Presiding Bishop's letter to Bishop Duncan Pending completion of this process, the three most senior bishops in the Episcopal Church had the option to inhibit Duncan from ministry but chose not to. In her letter to Duncan, the Presiding Bishop stated that she \\"would welcome a statement by you within the next two months providing evidence that you once more consider yourself fully subject to the doctrine, discipline and worship of this Church.\\" Duncan replied by letter on March 14, 2008.http://www.pitanglican.org/news/local/filesforposting/schoriresponse.pdf Bishop Duncan's reply to the Presiding Bishop, pdf In his response he denied all charges levelled against him. On September 18, 2008, the House of Bishops voted that Duncan be deposed from ordained ministry on charges of \\"abandoning the communion of the Episcopal Church\\". Immediately following the vote, Duncan was named a bishop-at-large of the Anglican Province of the Southern Cone. Following the vote in ECUSA's House of Bishops the Presiding Bishop, Katharine Jefferts Schori, formally deposed Duncan. In the sentence Jefferts Schori declared that \\"from and after 12:01 a.m., Saturday, 20 September 2008, Bishop Duncan shall be deprived of the right to exercise the gifts and spiritual authority of God's word and sacraments conferred at ordination in this Church and further declare[s] that all ecclesiastical and related secular offices held by Bishop Duncan shall be terminated and vacated at that time.\\"http://www.episcopalchurch.org/78650_100988_ENG_HTM.htm/ The legal validity of the decree of deposition was questioned by Duncan's attorney.http://www.virtueonline.org/portal/modules/news/article.php?storyid=8994/ Letter of Duncan's Attorney Says Presiding Bishop Violates Canons to \\"Remove\\" Duncan Duncan was elected the bishop of the now Anglican Diocese of Pittsburgh 50 days after his deposition by the Episcopal Church. ==Primate of the Anglican Church in North America== Duncan at Nashotah House in 2014 On June 21, 2009, the bishops of the Anglican Church in North America elected Duncan as the first archbishop and primate of North America. He was installed on June 25, 2009, at Christ Church in Plano, Texas. At the ceremony, conservative Anglicans in the developing world were represented by Benjamin Nzimbi, the archbishop of the African Anglican Province of Kenya. Kenya was one of nine provinces of the Anglican Communion that sent representatives to the ACNA conference. Duncan stated that his role as archbishop was to \\"reunite a significant portion of our Anglican Church family here in North America\\" and indicated that he intended to serve for five years before stepping down. In October 2009, Duncan reacted to the Roman Catholic Church's proposed creation of personal ordinariates for disaffected traditionalist Anglicans by saying that although he felt that this provision would probably not be utilized by the great majority of ACNA's affiliated laity and clergy, he would happily bless those who were drawn to participate in this historic offer.Anglican Church in North America responds to Vatican offer At the Provincial Council of the ACNA, held at Long Beach, California, on 21 June 2011, Duncan made a positive balance of the first two years of the church: \\"According to the data submitted in the Annual Parochial Reports there were, in the year 2010, 987 baptisms of adults over thirty, 424 baptisms of young people aged sixteen to thirty, and 1647 baptisms of children in the ACNA dioceses, not including the congregations of our Ministry Partners. What is so stunning about this data is that the number of baptisms of those 16 and older is almost equal to the number of children baptized. What this says is that we are reaching adolescents and adults who have never known Christ, never been part of a church. This is to reach North America with the transforming love of Jesus Christ, one sign among many that something quite extraordinary is unfolding.\\"Archbishop Robert Duncan State of the Church Address, Provincial Council, 21 June 2011 Duncan was one of the signatories of the statement of the Christian Associates of Southwest Pennsylvania, an organization representing 26 denominations, on April 13, 2012, expressly supporting the Roman Catholic Church in its opposition to the HHS mandate that would force Roman Catholic hospitals in the United States to pay for birth control methods not in accordance with the doctrine of the church.Statement of the Christian Associates of Southwest Pennsylvania on the HHS mandate, 13 April 2012 With Bishop Ray Sutton, Duncan attended a public audience in the Vatican at the invitation of Pope Benedict XVI, on 28 November 2012, whom they met and greeted afterwards on behalf of the Anglican Church in North America and the Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans.Archbishop Duncan attends Papal Audience in Rome, ACNA official website.

It was aimed at the electronic music and rave crowd and was responsible for exposing many electronica acts to the mainstream. When co-creator Todd Mueller (who had worked on this with V. Owen Bush, Amy Finnerty and show co-creator Burle Avant) left the show in 1998, it was redubbed Amp 2.0. The show aired some 46 episodes in total over its 6-year run. In its final two years, reruns were usually shown from earlier years. Amp's time slot was moved around quite a bit, but the show usually aired late at night or in the early morning hours on the weekend. Because of this late night time slot, the show developed a small but cult like following. A few online groups formed after the show's demise to ask MTV to bring the show back and air it during normal hours, but MTV never responded to the requests. ==Format== The show was possibly inspired by the underground public access show TV w/ Ray Cathode (later named Dizzy TV) that started airing on Manhattan Neighborhood Network public access TV in 1993 and ran from 1993–1999. TV w/ Ray Cathode was an underground experimental television show created by Beau Tardy that aired abstract video imagery with electronic music soundtracks by FAX +49-69/450464, Thomas Fehlmann, Sun Electric, The Orb, Aphex Twin, Warp Records and many others. TV w/ Ray Cathode show producer Beau Tardy also worked at MTV and was a colleague of Todd Mueller but never contributed to Amp. The format of the show strongly resembled the original MTV model of broadcasting primarily music videos, but without VJs to host. The show started with an intro and logo, some basic information about that week's show contents via onscreen text, then an hour of electronic music was played before the show's conclusion. Most of the video clips were created specifically for Amp. Nick Philip, a San-Francisco based multi-media artist created the first video for Amp, \\"Meccano\\" by Sun Electric.Darren Keast: Computer World. East Bay Express, August 29, 2001 Occasionally, non-electronic but still classic music videos were aired for the sake of nostalgia within the electronic genre, such as Ofra Haza's music video for \\"Im Nin'Alu,\\" which was sampled by several electronic artists in the early 1990s. ==Compilations== The show was popular enough that MTV produced two compilations of songs by artists featured on Amp. MTV's Amp was released in 1997 and MTV's Amp 2 came out a year later in 1998. Both albums were released by Caroline Records. ==Artists commonly featured on the show== *1.8.7 *Aphex Twin *Astral Projection *Atari Teenage Riot *Autechre *Aux 88 *Banco de Gaia *Brian Eno *Chemical Brothers *Coldcut *Crystal Method *Dr. Octagon *Faithless *Fluke *The Future Sound of London *Moby *Emergency Broadcast Network *Ken Ishii *Kraftwerk *Josh Wink *Goldie *GusGus *Juno Reactor *Orbital *The Orb *The Prodigy *Roni Size *Speedy J *Tipsy *Tranquility Bass *Tricky *Underworld ==References== ==External links== *Complete episode guide to videos played on Amp; includes partial guide to Amp 2.0 Category:1990s American music television series Category:2000s American music television series Category:MTV original programming Category:Dance television shows Category:1996 American television series debuts Category:2001 American television series endings ","title":"Amp (TV series)"},{"id":"2586224","text":"Headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, the Wolf River Conservancy (WRC) is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization whose stated purpose is \\"conserving and enhancing the Wolf River and its environs as a natural resource for public education and low-impact recreational activities.\\" It has approximately 1,500 members from throughout West Tennessee, led by an active Board of Directors and staff and advised by the Wolf River Conservancy Trustees.

Only later did the group become a land trust organization by holding land or conservation easements in its own name. ===Ghost River campaign=== The change occurred when WRC, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, and local conservationists W.S. \\"Babe\\" Howard and Lucius Burch merged their collective resources to satisfy the public's outcry for the protection of the Ghost River section of the Wolf near LaGrange, Tennessee. During 1995, 4,500 acres (18 km²) -- including the Ghost River—were saved from a land and timber company auction. This area was ultimately brought into public ownership as the Wolf River Wildlife Management Area and the Ghost River State Natural Area. ===Present day=== With a dramatic increase in concern for the Wolf River by an increasingly more environmentally sensitive public, the Wolf River Conservancy continues to advance in new arenas, like the City of Memphis' Wolf River Greenway Master Plan, the Army Corps of Engineers/Shelby County Wolf River Restoration project in Collierville, recreational facilities at the river's source in the Holly Springs National Forest, as well as continued efforts to conserve and enhance the river's bottomland forests in Fayette and Benton counties. ==History of the Wolf River itself== * 10,000 BCE Wolf River formed by runoff from melting glacier shelf. * 800-1500 CE Mississippian culture rises and declines in this area, evidenced by mound sites and accounts by Hernando de Soto. * 1300-1700 CE Chickasaw nation settles northern Mississippi, western Tennessee, and eastern Arkansas. * 1682 French explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle claims the region near the mouth of the Wolf River. The French alternately called the river Riviere de Mayot (or Margot), Blackbird River, and Riviere de Loup. :The original Loup was rumored to be a Delaware Indian guide who disappeared along the river while guiding the French. The Delawares were also known as Les Loups or \\"The Wolves.\\" According to one account, both the English and Chickasaw afterwards called the river \\"Loup\\" in their respective languages: \\"Wolf\\" and \\"Nashoba.\\" * 1740 Non-local Native American scouts working for the French at Fort Assumption (Memphis) survey the Wolf as a possible military supply route from which to destroy Ackia, a Chickasaw stronghold near Tupelo that weathered an attack four years earlier. The group turned back near present-day Germantown, Tennessee, a town that briefly adopted the name \\"Neshoba\\" out of anti-German sentiment during the United States' involvement in World War I. * Early 19th century The Wolf River is declared navigable, from Memphis to LaGrange, by the Tennessee General Assembly, which appropriated funds to remove obstructions for keel boat travel. * 1825 British-born Frances Wright establishes the Nashoba Commune on the Wolf River at the present-day site of Germantown, Tennessee. The commune's purpose was to educate and emancipate slaves using proceeds from the sale of crops grown there. * 1888 Memphis stops using Wolf River as its principal source of drinking water, switching to artesian wells, which are still used and which are recharged by the Wolf's watershed. *1960 Because of its foul odor the Wolf is dammed near its mouth and diverted into the Mississippi north of Mud Island. The section of the Wolf downstream of this channel diversion became a slackwater harbor of the Mississippi known today as Wolf River Harbor, which separates Mud Island from the Memphis \\"mainland\\". * Mid-1960s Completion of channelization of the Wolf from the Mississippi upstream to Gray's Creek, east of Germantown, Tennessee resulting in a lowered riverbed and diminished wetland habitat. * 1970 Surface drainage, sewage, and industrial pollution caused a group of scientists and environmentalists to pronounce the river \\"dead\\" around Memphis.The Wolf River's watershed (everything above the red dotted line), as surveyed in 1740 by Ignace Francois Broutin, chief engineer of French Louisiana. The French had named the Wolf \\"Riviere a Margot\\" * 1977 Mary Winslow Chapman publishes I Remember Raleigh, which including vivid descriptions of a pre-channelized Wolf River (early-to-middle 20th century). * 1985 Wolf River Conservancy founded by an alliance of conservation-minded real estate executives and local environmental advocates. * 1995 \\"Ghost River\\" section of the Wolf saved from timber auction by a coordinated effort of the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, local conservation activists Lucius Burch and W.S. \\"Babe\\" Howard, and the WRC. * 1997 American Singer-Songwriter Jeff Buckley drowns during an evening swim in Wolf River Harbor. * 1998 First recorded full descent of the Wolf River completed by members of the Wolf River Conservancy. * 2004 City of Memphis' Wolf River Greenway, 22 mile (35 km) trail, master plan completed and then shelved (pending approval) * 2005 Commencement of the Wolf River Restoration Project by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Memphis Office to stop rapid erosion known as \\"headcutting\\" at Collierville, Tennessee. * 2006 Loop trail completed by the U.S. Forest Service in the Holly Springs National Forest (Mississippi) near Baker's Pond, the source of the Wolf River. * 2007 \\"Middle Wolf\\" Campaign - attempted sprawl-proofing of the western Fayette County section. * 2007-2012 Completion of the Collierville-Arlington Parkway segment of Tenn-385 and I-269 outer loop expressway, including two (and potentially five) interchanges poised to become major drivers of suburban growth into forested sections of the Wolf River's floodplain and the surface-exposed sections of the Memphis Sands aquifer. ==See also== *Wolf River (Tennessee) *Land trust *Wetlands *Shelby Farms ==References== ==External links== * Wolf River Conservancy site * Tennessee Sportsman article on the Wolf River Wildlife Management Area * Shelby Farms Park Alliance * Greening Greater Memphis * Wolf River Conservancy's Flickr group, gallery of photographs of the Wolf River and its environs, taken by WRC members and supporters.

It belongs to the choanoflagellate class. As a colony-forming choanoflagellate, Proterospongia is of interest to scientists studying the mechanisms of intercellular signaling and adhesion present before animals appeared.King, N.

A receptor tyrosine kinase from choanoflagellates: molecular insights into early animal evolution. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 98:15032-7. ==Physical Characteristics== Members of Proterospongia have the typical choanoflagellate cell structure characterized by a cell body 5-10μm in diameter with a 20-30μm apical flagellum surrounded by a collar of 15-25 actin-filled microvilli.Leadbeater, B.S.C.; Thomsen H.A. Order Choanoflagellida. The Illustrated Guide to the Protozoa, second edition, (2000) pp. 14-37.Leadbeater, B.S.C. Life-History and Ultrastructure of a New Marine Species of Proterospongia (choanoflagellida). J. mar. biol. Ass. U.K. (1983) 135-160 The flagellum propels swimming cells through the water column and creates water currents through the microvilli, which trap foodstuff such as bacteria and detritus. The arrangement of organelles in Proterospongia appears consistent with other choanoflagellates and is characterized by an anterior dictyosome under the flagellar base, a central nucleus, peripheral mitochondria and a posterior food vacuole. As a member of the Codonosigidae family, Proterospongia have only a fine investment that is indistinct by light microscopy or completely lack an outer-covering. Proterospongia species are distinguished by colony morphology, which vary from simple chains of cells to striking astral assemblages.Kent, W.S. Manual of the Infusoria (1880-1882) Colonies having extra cellular jelly or mucilage have been described by Kent, Lackey, and Leadbeater; however the composition of this substance is unknown.Lackey, J.B. Morphology and Biology of a Species of Proterospongia. Trans. Amer. Micro. Soc. (1959) pp. 202-206. Kent also described a Proterospongia species containing two types of cells embedded in mucilage; however, this is the only account of such a species and it has been suggested that the observed amoeboid cells were actually posterior tentacles that are present on some choanoflagellates. ==Life History== Although several Proterospongia species have been described, only P. choanojuncta has a described life history. Based on this description, Proterospongia alternates between colonial and swimming and adherent solitary states. Leadbeater’s 1983 description resulted in the consolidation of Choanocea perplexea and Proterospongia choanojuncta species into Proterospongia choanojuncta. Additional studies of solitary and colonial species may result in further species consolidation. ==Classification== Proterospongia is a taxonomic classification of colonial Codonosigidae choanoflagellates based on the physical appearance of individual cells and the morphology of the colony. First described by Kent in Manual of the Infusoria (1880-1882), there are six described species of Proterospongia and the colony structure varies between species. The members of Proterospongia genus remain to be classified in a phylogenetic framework. ==See also== *Animal Evolution ==Citations== ==Additional References== # # James, T. Y., F. Kauff, C. L.

He was one of the founders of the Republican Party and Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. ==Early life== Read John was born on Chestnut Street across the street from Independence Hall, the eldest son of lawyer John Read and Martha Meredith Read. Both of his grandfathers (George Read and Samuel Meredith) had served in the Continental Congress. After an education at home, Read graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, then read law, and was admitted to the bar in 1818. He started a law practice in Philadelphia. ==Political career== Read began his political career when he was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1822. He served until 1824 while remaining in the private practice of law. After this he served on the Philadelphia City Council, and for several years was the city's solicitor. Although his family had been Federalists, he became an ardent supporter of the Free Soil wing of the Democratic Party. From 1837 to 1841, Read was the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In 1845, President John Tyler nominated him to the Supreme Court of the United States; but, his earlier stance against the expansion of slavery into the territories caused the southern Democratic Senators to oppose his nomination and it was withdrawn. From June until December 1845 he served as the Attorney General of Pennsylvania. Read became an early supporter and organizer for the Republican Party. When they won in their first statewide races in 1858, Read was elected to the state supreme court. He then served until December 2, 1872, the last year as chief justice. When the Republicans held their first national convention at Philadelphia in 1856, Read was a convention organizer and delivered the convention keynote address. At the 1860 Republican Convention in Chicago, he received one vote on the first ballot for presidential nominee; still, he supported Lincoln as the nominee. ==Family== Read was married twice, first to Priscilla Marshall in 1828.

A fast or fast-medium bowler renowned for his accurate bowling and particular hostility on uncovered wickets, he played county cricket for Derbyshire from 1947 to 1963, and was regularly at, or near the top of, the English bowling averages. He played in only two Test matches for England, one in 1949 and a second in 1961. Jackson's absence from Test cricket was largely because his batting was so underdeveloped: his highest first-class score was 39 not out, and he reached 30 on only two other occasions. Between July 1949 and August 1950, Jackson indeed played fifty-one innings without reaching double figures,Webber, Roy; The Playfair Book of Cricket Records; p. 317. Published 1951 by Playfair Books. a number known to be exceeded only by Jem Shaw, Nobby Clark, Eric Hollies (twice), Brian Boshier and Mark Robinson. His leading competitors like Trueman, Tyson, and even teammate Gladwin were far better batsmen. Cricket writer, Colin Bateman, noted, \\"it is one of cricket’s great crimes that Les Jackson, a most respected fast bowler on the circuit throughout the 1950s, played only twice for England. It is said that his slingy, hostile action and his blunt opinions did not please the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) but in an era when Alec Bedser carried England‘s attack on his own, Jackson’s omission was a scandalous loss\\". Bateman added that Jackson, \\"...was as feared as Truemen and Tyson in county cricket\\". ==Life and career== Jackson was born in the mining village of Whitwell in Derbyshire, the youngest of thirteen children. His eldest brother had been killed in World War I; another brother was one of eighty who perished in the Creswell colliery disaster in 1950. He was educated at Whitwell Church of England School, and became a miner at the age of 16. His father was a cricketer, and Jackson began his cricket career at Whitwell Cricket Club, where, until his demise, he could still be found on the occasional Saturday watching them play. Jackson was genuinely quick from a slingy action, and remarkably accurate and economical.Les Jackson CricInfo profile He was able to swing the ball both ways and move off the seam, and his six-foot height enabled him to make the ball lift awkwardly from just short of a length. He bowled from a short run-up, which enabled him to continue bowling for lengthy periods, and was particularly difficult to play on the uncovered wickets used in county cricket. After many delays, including the outbreak of World War II, Jackson became a professional with Worksop in 1947, playing in the Bassetlaw League and joined Derbyshire later in the 1947 season, making his first-class debut against Kent on 5 July 1947. He formed formidable bowling partnerships with Cliff Gladwin, and then with Harold Rhodes, both also England Test players. In the 1949 season, his second full season after joining Derbyshire, he took 120 wickets at a bowling average of 20.41. After a successful Test trial taking six fof 37, Jackson was selected in 1949 for the third Test against New Zealand at Old Trafford.Test no. 316: England v New Zealand at Old Trafford, 1949 He made his Test debut alongside Brian Close, opening the bowling with Trevor Bailey while the first choice fast bowler, Alec Bedser, was rested. Jackson met with some success, taking 2 for 47 and 1 for 25, but the match was drawn and he was replaced by Bedser for the fourth and deciding Test. He was not chosen to tour Australia in 1950–51, losing out to John Warr whose sole Test wicket came at a cost of 284 runs, but toured to India instead with a Commonwealth side, only to return home early with an elbow injury. Jackson played in another Test trial in 1950, but was unable to make much of an impression: on a soft wicket Jim Laker took 8 wickets for 2 runs, Bob Berry did the bulk of the bowling for \\"The Rest\\"England v The Rest in 1950 and Jackson's bowling was described as \\"mediocre\\". Nonetheless, Jackson averaged under twenty runs a wicket in every season from 1951 to 1962, and took 100 or more in every season except 1951, 1955 and 1961 when he was severely handicapped by injuries. In the 1958 season, he took 143 wickets at an average of 10.99 runs per wicket, an average not equalled by any regular first-class bowler since and not previously seen since the days of Tom Richardson.Preston, Norman (editor); Wisden Cricketers' Almanac, Ninety-Sixth Edition (1959); pp. 57-60 This feat was all the more extraordinary because owing to a serious groin strain Jackson bowled at only medium pace for most of the season. Jackson was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1959, then took a further 140 wickets in 1959 (being the first to reach 100Preston, Norman (editor); Wisden Cricketers' Almanac, Ninety-Seventh Edition (1960); pp. 250, 342), and then 160 at 13.61 in 1960. In all, he passed 100 wickets in ten domestic seasons. Fred Trueman described Jackson as \\"The best six-days-a-week bowler in county cricket\\". Jackson had to wait twelve years to play his second Test, allegedly and almost certainly due to upper class prejudice by the England captain Freddie Brown in early years, and of England selector Gubby Allen later. He was finally selected for the third Test against the 1961 Australians at Headingley, when he was 40 years old.Test no. 509: England v Australia at Headingley, Leeds Again, he was chosen to replace the first- choice fast bowler, Brian Statham, who had a side strain, and again he provided able support, this time to Trueman, taking 2 for 57 and 2 for 26, as England won by eight wickets. Statham came back for the final two Tests, and Jack Flavell was picked ahead of Jackson. He never played Test cricket again. The 12-year gap between his appearances is the longest of any England Test player with only two caps. Jackson retired from Derbyshire at the end of the 1963 season, having taken more wickets for Derbyshire than any other bowler, a record that still stands (1,733 first-class wickets at 17.36 apiece). He then played for Enfield in the Lancashire League in 1964, and for Undercliffe in the Bradford League from 1965 to 1970. Jackson, along with Derbyshire namesake Brian and longtime partner Gladwin (who was then fifty-four), played his last game at the age of 49 for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Derbyshire on 5 July 1970, a 40-overs match commemorating the centenary of Derbyshire's first match at Lord's in 1870.Derbyshire v Marylebone Cricket Club in 1970 Jackson was elected President of the Derbyshire Players' Association in 1995. He continued mining in the winter through much of his cricketing career, later becoming a chauffeur for the National Coal Board until 1982. His death, in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, after a short illness was announced on Test Match Special on 25 April 2007, less than three weeks after his 86th birthday. He married his wife, Norma, in 1942; she died in 1991. He was survived by their daughter. ==References== ==External links== * Derbyshire legend Les Jackson dies, Cricinfo, 25 April 2007 * Obituary, The Daily Telegraph, 30 April 2007 * Obituary, The Independent, 2 May 2007 * Obituary, The Sunday Times, 3 May 2007 * Obituary, The Guardian, 11 May 2007 Category:1921 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Derbyshire cricketers Category:England Test cricketers Category:Commonwealth XI cricketers Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:English miners Category:People from Whitwell Category:English cricketers Category:Players cricketers Category:North v South cricketers Category:A.

Dog showmanship is not a competition in itself but a qualification of the handler to present a dog to its best advantage. Skills are technical as well as artistic. A handler must groom and display the dog for a judge in specific ways but a true showman can accentuate the best features of the dog and even mask any faults. Many professional handlers train and condition the dogs they accept into their program as they see fit. This means that dogs owned by others are away from home with their handlers for months at a time. Professional showman may handle dogs as a sole source of income. Most often referring to handling for dog conformation competition, showmanship can also refer to hunting dog competition, racing dogs, and tracking dogs. It also refers to the sportsmanship of competitors; able to lose with grace, win with humility and unflappable in the face of unforeseen circumstances. A related competition is Junior Showmanship during which young dog handlers are judged on their showmanship skills regardless of the quality of the dog they use for the competition. They are scored on the grooming and handling of the dog as well as how the dog responds to them during the judging. ==Equipment== In order to limit the distraction a leash and collar may be to a judge of dogs, showmanship includes use of specialized equipment, such as the show lead leash, which is quite thin and held out of view as much as possible. Many showman actually drop the leash while posing the dog and barely hold on to it while parading the dog around the ring to show off the dog's vitality and gait. A dog must be well trained to take full advantage of the show lead. Some dog handlers use trade secrets to trim and style a dog for the show ring. Forced air blow dryers, shampoo recipes, hair tonics and training to show a dog at his or her best are tricks of the trade used to advantage in competition. ==See also== Junior Showmanship Category:Dog shows and showing ","title":"Dog showmanship"},{"id":"2586283","text":"Jason Lee Middle School, formerly known as West Intermediate School, was the first and largest of six intermediate schools funded in 1923.

It had an animation division called Impossible TV, founded in 1997. ==History== Bob Geldof and Tony Boland (television producer) founded Planet Pictures which merged with 24 Hour Productions, headed by Charlie Parsons and Waheed, later Lord Alli. The company was bought by Carlton Communications in March 1999 for £15 million and eventually merged with Carlton Productions, of which Lord Alli became managing director. ITV Studios now own Planet 24, and the company has virtually closed as all Planet 24 productions, have ceased. ===Creation of Survivor=== Planet 24 also developed the original concept for Survivor, which was initially called Castaway. Geldof and Parsons met with the BBC to pitch the programme as a reality competition show. However, the BBC, which was intrigued by the concept, instead developed its own competing documentary-style show, Castaway 2000. As a result, Planet 24 had to change the title, and the show was originally produced as Expedition Robinson in Sweden in 1997 before its U.S. success in 2000. When Geldof, Parsons and Lord Alli sold Planet 24 to Carlton, they retained the rights to this program by transferring them to a new company named Castaway Television Productions.

In recent years, she has worked in television. She is the author of several books including Building A Win-Win World, Beyond Globalization, Planetary Citizenship (with Daisaku Ikeda), and Ethical Markets: Growing the Green Economy. == Career == Henderson is now, a television producer for the public television series Ethical Markets. She has been Regent's Lecturer at the University of California (Santa Barbara) and held the Horace Albright Chair in Conservation at the University of California (Berkeley). She has also been a traveling lecturer and panelist. Recently, she has served on the boards of such publications as Futures Research Quarterly, The State of the Future Report, and E/The Environmental Magazine (US), Resurgence, Foresight and Futures (UK). She advised the US Office of Technology Assessment and the National Science Foundation from 1974 to 1980. Listed in Who's Who in the World, Who's Who in Science and Technology, and in Who's Who in Business and Finance. Henderson has been in good part concerned with finding the unexplored areas in standard economics and the \\"blind spots\\" of conventional economists. Most of her work relates to the creation of an interdisciplinary economic and political theory with a focus on environmental and social concerns. For instance, she has delved into the area of the \\"value\\" of such unquantifiables as clean air and clean water, needed in tremendous abundance by humans and other living organisms. This work led to the development, with Calvert Group, of the Calvert-Henderson Quality of Life Indicators. Author Fritjof Capra credits Henderson with being a major influence on his thinking on ecological issues. In 2005, Henderson started Ethical Markets Media, LLC, to disseminate information on green investing, socially responsible investing, green business, green energy, business ethics news, environmentally friendly technology, good corporate citizenship and sustainable development by making available reports, articles, newsletters and video gathered from around the world. In 2007, Henderson started EthicalMarkets.TV to showcase video of people and organizations around the world with socially responsible endeavors. Practicing what she preaches, Henderson sought out highly efficient technology to stream the video, MIPBSCast which uses significantly less energy than most other video platforms. == Ontology == Henderson has been one of the critics who point out that the definitions of reality devised by natural and social scientists often pertain to the realities they are paid to study — raising questions including: *Who has funded these investigators and theoreticians, and why? *Who deems certain research grants to be worthy of funding? *Which questions crop up in the first place? Henderson believes that the various threats to peace, community security, and good environment have led into a new era in which people are obliged to look for values, information, and know-how that they seemed to be able to do without until recent decades. One of her famous aphorisms compares the occidental economic model to a cake with four levels, with glass on the top: the first level is nature, the second level is the subsistence economy, the third level is the public and private economy, and the last level is finance. == Books == *Ethical Markets: Growing the Green Economy, Chelsea Green Publishing, 2006, *Daisaku Ikeda coauthor, Planetary Citizenship, Middleway Press, 2004, , 256 pgs *Hazel Henderson et al., Calvert-Henderson Quality of Life Indicators, Calvert Group, 2000, , 392 pgs *Beyond Globalization.

His early studies were of both natural history and medicine, which he studied at the newly formed Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, graduating in 1827. However, in 1838 he decided to start studying agriculture and entomology. In 1838 he began to collect and study insects for New York state. In 1854 he became the first professional entomologist of New York State Agricultural Society (commissioned by the State of New York). This made him the first occupational entomologist in the United States. His vast studies of many insects helped scientists to solve some of the problems of crop damage caused by insects. Many of his notebooks are now the property of the Smithsonian Institution. Fitch also discovered the rodent botfly Cuterebra emasculator in 1856. He died April 8, 1879 in Salem, New York.

While the album failed to chart in the UK, it did reach #197 in the US. Free are cited as one of the definitive bands of the British blues boom of the late 1960s even though this is the only album of their canon that can strictly be called blues rock. According to bass player Andy Fraser, the title effectively summed up the album. ==Recording== Free were a new band when they recorded Tons of Sobs, and they were extremely young; none of them were yet twenty and the youngest, Andy Fraser, was just sixteen years old. They had achieved a following through constant touring, and their debut album consisted for the most part of their live set-list. With the band signed to Chris Blackwell's Island Records, Guy Stevens was hired to produce the album (he later became notable for producing early albums for Mott the Hoople and The Clash's legendary album London Calling [1979]). He opted for a minimalist attitude to production, due to the extremely low budget of about £800, creating a very raw and raucous sound – although it may have been that the relative inexperience of the band was also a contributing factor to this. As such the album is a marked contrast in production terms from the band's later albums. The simple nature of the recording meant that many tracks translated well into a live setting and several songs from this album were still performed even when the band had written and recorded many more for subsequent records. The majority of the album was recorded over the course of a few days in October 1968. Originally slated for a November release, the album was delayed to early 1969 due to the late addition of their cover of \\"The Hunter\\".

Born George Washington Ochs, he legally added the surname \\"Oakes\\" in 1915 out of outrage at the sinking of the Lusitania by a German U-boat. ==Journalism career== Ochs was born to German- Jewish immigrants, Julius and Bertha Levy Ochs, in Cincinnati, Ohio. Brother of fellow journalist Adolph Ochs, George Oakes was educated at the University of Tennessee, where he graduated in 1879. Oakes began his career in journalism as a reporter for the Chattanooga Daily Times, of which he became general manager in 1896. In 1900, when The New York Times decided to issue a daily edition at the Paris Exposition, Oakes was placed in charge of the enterprise; and his work met with such favor that he was decorated by the President of the French Republic with the cross of the Legion of Honor. In 1901, when The Philadelphia Times was acquired by his brother, Oakes became vice-president and general manager of the new company, and conducted the paper until its amalgamation with the Public Ledger, when he became general manager of the consolidated publications. Oakes remained publisher until the paper was sold in 1913 to Cyrus H. K. Curtis. On the outbreak of World War I, Oakes attempted to enlist in the army, but was refused admittance due to his age. He persisted, and signed up as a private in the 9th Coast Artillery, New York National Guard, and served from 1917 until the Armistice in 1918. At this time he became the managing editor of a new New York Times-owned magazine, Current History. He also edited the Times' Mid-Week Pictorial and served on the Times Board of Directors. ==Political career== Oakes was a prominent figure in Tennessee politics. He attended the 1892 Democratic National Convention held in Chicago as an elected delegate, seconding on behalf of his state the nomination of Grover Cleveland; and in 1896 he was appointed delegate-at-large from Tennessee to the Palmer-Buckner Gold Democratic Convention held at Indianapolis in that year. In 1894 Oakes was elected mayor of Chattanooga, Tennessee, was reelected in 1896, and received a unanimous renomination in 1898, but declined it. He was elected vice-president and member of the executive board of the National Municipal League. For six years he held the presidency of the Chattanooga Library Association; for two years that of the Southern Associated Press; for three years that of the Chattanooga Board of Education; and for one year that of the Chattanooga Chamber of Commerce. ==See also== *John Bertram Oakes *List of mayors of Chattanooga, Tennessee ==Notes== ==References== * * ==External links== *Biography on Chattanooga city website Category:American newspaper reporters and correspondents Category:American newspaper publishers (people) Category:The New York Times editors Category:American people of German-Jewish descent Category:Jewish American journalists Category:1861 births Category:1931 deaths Category:University of Tennessee alumni Category:Tennessee Democrats Category:Mayors of Chattanooga, Tennessee Category:Jewish mayors of places in the United States Category:Jewish American people in Tennessee politics ","title":"George Oakes (journalist)"},{"id":"2586368","text":"The Mystkowski family – was one of several noble families using the Clan Jastrzębiec coat-of-arms during the time of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

It was broadcast on Sunday mornings on Sky Sports Premier League and Sky Sports Football, during the football season. The length of the show was 90 minutes, including commercials, although it was occasionally cut down to 60 minutes. ==History== Launched under the stewardship of Jimmy Hill, three guest football journalists sit around a table over breakfast/brunch and discuss the latest football matches, news and gossip, including a look at the football stories in the Sunday newspapers. The proposal was that it was set in Hill's actual kitchen, with fans trying to guess where his home was from the window view. But the truth came to light on several occasions in 2006 when Hill was late claiming to be stuck in traffic. The programme is the successor to the Friday night discussion show Hold the Back Page, which is still occasionally broadcast in its usual slot. ==Revamp== In 2007, Sky Sports decided not to renew Hill's 12 month contract, which coincided with the removal of his name from the title. The presenter role was given to either Bill Bradshaw and Brian Woolnough. The format and setting remained consistent set over a breakfast/brunch table, but guest football journalists increased from two to three. Woolnough later took on the permanent presenter role, with regular guests including Patrick Barclay, Oliver Holt, Martin Samuel, Paul Smith and Henry Winter. Since Woolnough's death in September 2012, Neil Ashton went on to host the programme after having initially stood in during his predecessor's illness. On 12 January 2020, Ashton presented the show for the final time. Jacqui Oatley was announced as the new presenter of the show on 14 January 2020. Beginning in 2009, a podcast of the show was made available on the Sky Sports website and iTunes. In August 2020, Sky announced the show had been cancelled for the 2020/21 season, blaming the congested fixture schedule.

By Charles Emerson Curry. p47The Mathematical Theory of Electricity and Magnetism. By Sir James Hopwood Jeans. are outdated theories that postulated one or more electrical fluids which were thought to be responsil 'fluids.' An alternate simpler theory was proposed by Benjamin Franklin, called theelectrical charge. Franklin's theory explained how charges could be dispelled (such as those in Leyden jars) and how they could be passed through a chain of people. The fluid theories of electricity eventually became updated to include the effects of magnetism, and electrons (upon their discovery). ==Fluid theories== In the 1700s many physical phenomena were thought of in terms of an aether, which was a fluid that could permeate matter. This idea had been used for centuries, and was the basis of thinking about physical phenomena, such as electricity, as liquids. Other 18th century examples of fluid models are Lavoisier's caloric and the magnetic fluids of Coulomb and Aepinus. ===Two-fluid theory=== By the 18th century, one of a few theories explaining observed electrical phenomena was the two-fluid theory. This theory is generally attributed to Charles François de Cisternay du Fay. du Fay's theory suggested that electricity was composed of two liquids, which could flow through solid bodies. One liquid carried a positive charge, and the other a negative charge. When these two liquids came into contact with one another, they would produce a neutral charge.Fowler, M. (1997). Historical Beginnings of Theories of Electricity and Magnetism. from http://galileoandeinstein.physics.virginia.edu/more_stuff/E&M;_Hist.html This theory dealt mainly with explaining electrical attraction and repulsion, rather than how an object could be charged or discharged. du Fay observed this while repeating an experiment created by Otto von Guericke, wherein a thin material, such as a feather or leaf, would repel a charged object after making contact with it. du Fay observed that the “leaf-gold is first attracted by the tube; and acquires an electricity be approaching it; and of consequence is immediately repell’d by it.” This seemed to confirm for du Fay that the leaf was being pushed as a ‘current’ of electricity flowed around and through it. Through further testing, du Fray determined that an object could hold one of two types of electricity, either vitreous or resinous electricity. He found that an object with vitreous electricity would repel another vitreous object, but would be attracted to an object with resinous electricityTricker, R. A. R. (1965). Early electrodynamics: The first law of circulation. Oxford: Pergamon Press. Another supporter of the two-fluid theory was Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein. He speculated also the electric charges were carried by vortices in these two fluids.E. Snorrason, C.G. Kratzenstein, professor physices experimentalis Petropol. et Havn. and his studies on electricity during the eighteenth century, Odense University Press (1974). . ===One-fluid theory=== In 1746 William Watson proposed a one-fluid theory. On 11 July 1747 Benjamin Franklin composed a letter in which he outlined his new theory. This is the first record of his theory.Home, R. (1972). Franklin's Electrical Atmospheres. The British Journal for the History of Science, 6 (2), 131-151. Franklin developed this theory mainly concentrating on the charging and discharging of bodies, as opposed to du Fay, who concentrated mainly on electrical attraction and repulsion. Franklin's theory stated that electricity should be thought of as the movement of a single liquid, as opposed to the interaction between two liquids. A body would show signs of electricity when it held either too much, or too little of this liquid. A neutral object was therefore thought to contain a “normal” amount of this fluid. Franklin also outlined two possible states of electrification, positive and negative. He argued that a positively charged object would contain too much fluid, while a negatively charged object would contain too little fluid. Franklin was able to apply this thinking by explaining unexplained phenomena of the time, such as the Leyden jar, a basic charge storing device similar to a capacitor. He argued that the wire and inner surface became positively charged, while the outer surface became negatively charged. This caused an imbalance in fluid, and a person touching both portions of the jar allowed the fluid to flow normally. Despite being a simpler theory, it was heavily debated whether electricity was made up of one fluid or two for a century. ==Significance of the one-fluid theory== The one- fluid theory shows a significant shift in how the scientific community thought about electricity. Prior to Franklin's theory, there were many competing theories on how electricity functioned. Franklin's theory soon became the most widely accepted at the time. Franklin's theory is also notable, because it is the first theory that viewed electricity as the accumulation of ‘charge’ from elsewhere, rather than an excitation of the matter already present in an object. Franklin's theory also provides the basis for conventional current, the thinking of electricity as being the movement of positive charges. Franklin arbitrarily thought of his electrical fluid as being of a positive charge, and therefore all thought was done in the frame of mind of a positive flow. This permeated the mindset of the scientific community to the point that electricity is still being thought of as the flow of positive charges, despite proof that electricity moving through metals (the most common conductor) is done by the electron, or negative particle. Franklin was also the first person to suggest that lightning was in fact electricity. Franklin suggested that lightning was just a larger version of the small sparks that appeared between two charged objects. He therefore predicted that lightning could be shaped and directed by using a pointed conductor. This was the basis for his famous kite experiment. ==Shortcomings of the theory== Although the one-fluid theory marked a significant advance in discussions of electricity, it did have some deficiencies. Franklin created the theory to explain discharges, an aspect which had been mostly ignored previously. While it explained this well, it was not able to fully explain electrical attraction and repulsion. It made sense that two objects with too much fluid would push away from each other, and why two objects with largely different amounts of fluid would pull towards each other. However, it didn't make sense that two objects with no fluid would repel each other. Too little fluid should not cause a repulsion. Another difficulty with this model of electricity is that it ignores the interactions between electricity and magnetism. Although this relationship was not well- studied at the time, it was known that there was some connection between the two phenomena. Franklin's model makes no reference to these forces, and makes no attempt to explain them. Although fluid theory was the predominant viewpoint for a time, it was eventually replaced by more modern theories, specifically one which used observations about attractions between current- carrying wires to describe the magnetic effects between them. ==Connections to magnetism== Neither du Fay nor Franklin described the effects of magnetism in their theories, with both concerning themselves only with electrical effects. However, theories on magnetism followed a very similar pattern as those on electricity. Charles Coulomb described magnets as containing two magnetic fluids, aural and boreal, which could combine to describe magnetic attraction and repulsion. The related one-fluid theory for magnetism was proposed by Franz Aepinus, who described magnets as containing too much or too little magnetic fluid. These theories of electricity and magnetism were thought of as two separate phenomena, until Hans Christian Ørsted noticed that a compass needle would deflect from magnetic north when placed near an electric current. This caused him to develop theories that electricity and magnetism were interrelated and could affect one another. Ørsted's work was the basis for a theory by French physicist André-Marie Ampère, which unified the relation between magnetism and electricity. ==See also== ;General * Contact tension * Hydraulic analogy * Imponderable fluid ; Histories * History of the electric charge * History of electrochemistry ==References== ==External links== * A letter from Charles-François de Cisternay Du Fay concerning electricity., Phil.

He played 4 Test matches and 12 One Day Internationals (ODI) during his international cricketing career from 1975 to 1982. He was a right-handed opening batsman and a right-handed medium pace bowler. Warnapura captained Sri Lanka's first Test match, and also faced the first delivery and scored the first run for his team. He captained Sri Lanka in all the Tests he played, although he could not lead his team to victory in any of them. However, Sri Lanka won the first ODI match he captained. He has scored one half-century in ODI cricket. ==Personal life== Bandula Warnapura was born on 1 March 1953 in Rambukkana. Malinda Warnapura, who currently plays for the Sri Lanka national cricket team, is his nephew. He is an old boy of Nalanda College Colombo. Bandula captained Nalanda College Colombo first XI cricket team in 1971. Warnapura has worked as an ICC match referee and an umpire, and is also a certified cricketing coach. He has served as the coach for the Sri Lanka national cricket team, before he was appointed Director of Coaching in 1994. He became Director of Operations of Sri Lanka Cricket in 2001. He functioned in that post for eight years before he resigned in 2008. He is now the Development Manager of the Asian Cricket Council. He has also refereed two Tests and three ODIs in 2001 ==International career== ===Test career=== Warnapura was the first Sri Lankan Test cricket cap. got the opportunity to lead the Sri Lanka national cricket team in their very first Test match, which was played against England in 1982. The five-day match started on 17 February 1982 at the Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium. Warnapura and English captain Keith Fletcher made the toss in the morning, which was won by Warnapura. He elected to bat first, and opened the batting for Sri Lanka with Sidath Wettimuny. He faced the first delivery of the match, and scored the first Test run for his country. According to a local newspaper, he was even the first Sri Lankan batsman to get hit on the chest. However, he was dismissed for only 2 runs, when he was caught by David Gower off the bowling of Bob Willis. The first player to bat in a Test match for Sri Lanka had faced 25 deliveries during the 35 minutes he batted. During the Sri Lankan second innings, Warnapura made 38 runs off 155 deliveries – the second highest score in that innings. England won the match, and Warnapura's 38 would remain as his highest Test individual score. Warnapura was unsuccessful in his second match, played against Pakistan in March 1982, scoring just 13 runs in the Sri Lankan first innings, and getting out without scoring in the second. He could not play for the second match of the series due to an injury. In the next match, also against Pakistan, he scored 7 and 26 in the first and second innings respectively. Both matches were lost by Sri Lanka Warnapura's fourth and last Test match was against India in September 1982. He was unsuccessful again, scoring just 4 in the first innings and 6 in the second, and the match ended in a draw. During his Test career, Warnapura captained the Sri Lankan side in all four matches he played. He had scored a total of 96 runs, with an average of 12.00. ===ODI career=== Warnapura was the 11th Sri Lankan ODI cricket cap. His One Day International (ODI) debut was against West Indies on 7 June 1975, in a 1975 Cricket World Cup match that was also Sri Lanka's first ODI. He was dismissed for 8 runs in that match, which Sri Lanka lost. He was given the captaincy of the team to temporarily replace Anura Tennekoon (who was injured) in his fifth match, which was played against India on 16 June 1979, as part of the 1979 Cricket World Cup. He led the team to victory, scoring 18 runs in the match and taking a wicket. It was also the only victory in the series by an Associate Member nation (Sri Lanka had not yet gained Full Member status) in the tournament. In 1982, Warnapura was appointed captain of the Sri Lankan team. He made his first and only half-century against Pakistan on 12 March the same year. He made 77 runs in that match, although it was lost by Sri Lanka. Warnapura played 12 ODI matches, accumulating a total of 180 runs at an average of 15.00. He also captured 8 wickets at an average of 39.50, as well taking 5 catches during his career. ===Arosa Sri Lanka=== Disputes had arisen among members of the Sri Lankan team and its administration only a few months after Sri Lanka's inaugural Test match. This resulted in a \\"rebel tour\\" of apartheid South Africa (which was banned from international cricket at the time). Several Sri Lankan players took part in this tour, and the team which was captained by Warnapura and named Arosa Sri Lanka, left the country in secret in September 1982. The tour was unsuccessful; Arosa Sri Lanka played 12 matches and lost 10 of them, while the other two ended in draws. As a result of this tour, the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL) imposed 25-year bans from all forms of cricket on all Sri Lankan players who participated, including Warnapura. Although the ban was revoked after nine years, Warnapura did not play international cricket again. He later claimed that not only financial issues but pressure from some members of the BCCSL forced them to undertake the tour, and expressed disappointment at the fact that no formal inquiry was held. ==After cricket== He has functioned as the coach of the Sri Lankan team, and has also served in its administration. Warnapura is now an official of the Asian Cricket Council ==Beyond cricket== Warnapura participated as a judge in the reality show Youth With Talent telecasted by Independent Television Network in 2016-17. ==References== ==See also== * Sri Lankan cricket team in Bangladesh in 1977-78 *Ananda-Nalanda Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Sri Lanka One Day International cricketers Category:Sri Lanka Test cricketers Category:Sri Lanka Test cricket captains Category:All-Ceylon cricketers Category:Cricketers at the 1975 Cricket World Cup Category:Cricketers at the 1979 Cricket World Cup Category:Sri Lankan Buddhists Category:Alumni of Nalanda College, Colombo ","title":"Bandula Warnapura"},{"id":"2586429","text":"Portrait of John Lombe from the Exeter Bridge in Derby Statue of John Lombe in Derby (Former Boots building, East Street John Lombe (1693 in Norwich - November 20, 1722 in Derby) was a silk spinner in the 18th century Derby, England. ==Biography== Lombe was born in Norwich in approximately 1693, the son of a worsted weaver. He was a younger half-brother of Thomas Lombe who, after John's death, would go on to amass a fortune as a silk merchant in Norwich and London. In the early 18th century, the centre for producing silk stockings by framework knitting had moved to the Midlands from London and the demand for spun silk was outstripping supply. Lombe had obtained employment at an abortive silk mill built in Derby by George Sorocold for the silk spinner Thomas Cotchett of Derby, built on the River Derwent. The Italians had been using power spinning since the early 15th century,Calladine, Anthony (1993). \\"Lombe's Mill: An Exercise in reconstruction\\".

Lombe was sent by his brother Thomas to investigate the Italian machines spinning organzine thread (raw silk warp threads used for weaving fine silk cloth).Organzine, Merriam Webster dictionary, accessed May 2011 William Hutton gave an account of Lombe's time in Italy, in his History of Derby. In 1718, Thomas Lombe was able to obtain a patent for silk throwing machinery, granted for fourteen years. John Lombe died suddenly, in 1722. According to legend, the King of Sardinia, having heard of the success of the Lombe’s undertaking, instructed a female assassin to travel to England to kill the brothers.

He played as a center fielder in Major League Baseball from 1925 through 1938, most notably as a member of the Philadelphia Athletics dynasty that won three consecutive American League pennants from 1929 to 1931 and, won the World Series in 1929 and 1930. ==Professional baseball career== Haas was born in Montclair, New Jersey and attended Montclair High School. He left school to play for a local semi-pro team.Schlager, Ken. \\"The Mule Who Could Run Like A Deer 80 years ago, a young outfielder from New Jersey helped Philadelphia win the World Series.\\", New Jersey Monthly, September 14, 2009. Accessed June 27, 2019. \\"Mule starred in baseball at Montclair High School and went on to play semi-pro baseball in Montclair for a team called the Clairmonts.\\" Haas was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates as an amateur free agent in 1923 and, after three seasons spent playing in the minor leagues, he made his major league debut with the Pirates on August 15, 1925 at the age of 21. He appeared in four games for the Pirates but, was not on the team's roster when the Pirates defeated the Washington Senators in the 1925 World Series. His contract was then sold to the Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association and he returned to the minor leagues for two more seasons. In 1928, Haas joined the Philadelphia Athletics and became a member of one of the most feared batting orders in the history of baseball featuring three future Baseball Hall of Fame members (Al Simmons, Jimmie Foxx, and Mickey Cochrane). He was one of six Athletics players to post batting averages above .310 during the 1929 season when he produced career-highs in batting average (.323), home runs (16) and runs batted in (82). The Athletics won the 1929 American League pennant by 18 games over the vaunted New York Yankees of Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. Haas is notable for his hitting performance during the 1929 World Series against the Chicago Cubs. In Game Four at Philadelphia, as the Athletics trailed 8–0 in the seventh inning, Haas hit a three-run inside-the-park home run as the Athletics rallied by scoring 10 runs in the inning to win, 10–8. This was the last inside-the-park home run in World Series history until Alcides Escobar did so in Game 1 of the 2015 World Series. Two days later, in what was to be the final game of the Series, Haas hit a two-run home run in the bottom of the ninth inning to tie the score, 2–2, as the Athletics later won the game on Bing Miller's RBI-double. With the onset of the Great Depression and declining attendance, Connie Mack sought to reduce expenses by selling or trading his best players. In September 1932, he sold Haas, Simmons and Jimmy Dykes to the Chicago White Sox for $100,000. After five seasons in Chicago, Haas ended his career back in Philadelphia, playing in his final major league game on September 1, 1938 at the age of 34. ==Career statistics== In a twelve-year major league career, Haas played in 1,168 games, accumulating 1,257 hits in 4,303 at bats for a .292 career batting average, along with 43 home runs, 496 runs batted in and a career on-base percentage of .359. Haas had a career fielding percentage of .983; he played at all three outfield positions and first base. ==Later life== Haas died in New Orleans, Louisiana on June 30, 1974, at the age of 70. He was buried in the Roman Catholic Immaculate Conception Cemetery in his native Montclair, New Jersey. ==References== ==External links== *Baseball Library * Category:1903 births Category:1974 deaths Category:American Roman Catholics Category:Atlanta Crackers players Category:Baseball players from New Jersey Category:Birmingham Barons players Category:Chicago White Sox coaches Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Chicago White Sox scouts Category:Hollywood Stars managers Category:Major League Baseball center fielders Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Montclair High School (New Jersey) alumni Category:Oklahoma City Indians players Category:People from Montclair, New Jersey Category:Philadelphia Athletics players Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:Pittsfield Hillies players Category:Sportspeople from Essex County, New Jersey Category:Williamsport Billies players Category:Williamsport Grays players Category:Catholics from New Jersey ","title":"Mule Haas"},{"id":"2586453","text":"The Nerl () is a river in Pereslavsky District of Yaroslavl and Kalyazinsky District of Tver Oblast in Russia, a right tributary of the Volga (at the Uglich Reservoir).

With many sharing the opinion that he was one of the greatest actors, comedians and people from the Balkans. ==Biography== Pavle Vujisić (Вујисић) was born in Belgrade to father Mišo, a police force agent and mother Radmila. He was named after his grandfather Pavle, Montenegrin jurist and brigadier. His great- grandfather was Milosav Mišnin Vujisić, famous hero from Donja Morača and commander of the guard of Prince Danilo.https://antenam.net/istorija/36512-bombaska-afera- He joined the Yugoslav Partisans and fought at the Syrmian Front. He studied law and worked as a journalist for Radio Belgrade before getting a small role in 1950 film Čudotvorni mač. After that he tried to become a professional actor, but failed to enroll in Drama Arts Academy in Belgrade. His first major role was in 1955 film Šolaja. He was never a star, but he quickly established himself as one of the most dependable and versatile character actors. In his long and prolific career he played many different roles, both dramatic and comical, and earned great respect from almost any director with whom he worked. He is arguably best known for his role in 1972 TV series Kamiondžije (Truck Drivers), where he was paired with comedian Miodrag Petrović Čkalja. One of the acting awards in Serbia (for lifetime acting achievement in movies, awarded at film festival in Niš) is named after him. Orson Welles said in interview for former Yugoslav television RTZ that he considered Pavle Vuisić as the best actor in the world.

Penclawdd, Gower, South Wales . Penclawdd () is a village which is situated in the north of the Gower Peninsula in the county of Swansea, Wales. Historically, it was part of Glamorgan. Penclawdd is most famous for its local cockle industry which goes back for many years to Roman times. It falls within the Penclawdd electoral ward. It is one of the larger villages on the Gower Peninsula. Part of the village is perched on a high location, enjoying panoramic views over the Loughor estuary and surrounding Gower countryside, while the main part of the village stretches along the edge of the estuary. Being so close to an estuary, Penclawdd is thriving with wildlife. It is plentiful in birdlife and with wild horses that roam the estuary. The built-up area had a population of 1,935. https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W37000213 ==Brief history== Up until the end of the 19th century Penclawdd was a thriving sea port. The village was renowned for coal mining and its extensive tinplate, copper and brass works. There was a time when Penclawdd had a forge, twenty grocers, three butchers, three drapers, four fish and chip shops, eleven pubs, a cinema, the still remaining three chapels and a church and a busy railway station. The original railway platform still remains today. Also, built in 1807, a now derelict Hermon Chapel was used to help ships navigate the estuary. Around 1800, John Vivian (1750–1826) of Truro, Cornwall, became managing partner in the copper works at Penclawdd and Loughor then owned by the Cheadle Brasswire Company of Staffordshire. The Vivian family eventually ran large copper mining, copper smelting and trading businesses in and around Swansea (Vivian & Sons) and, throughout the 19th century, did much to develop Swansea into a city. ==Penclawdd RFC== Penclawdd RFC, nicknamed the Donks, have a long history in rugby union. Penclawdd RFC officially formed in 1888, but rugby has been played in the village since the 1880 / 1881 season, the same year as the founding of the Welsh Rugby Union. In its formative years the club had no permanent pitch, but played on suitable available ground in various areas of the village. Haydn Tanner is one of the club's most famous players, playing for Wales and the British Lions in 1938. Willie Davies, another famous Penclawdd Welsh rugby union international went North and played rugby league for Bradford Northern in the 1930s and 1940s. He won the Lance Todd Trophy for the out standing player in the Challenge cup final at Wembley in 1947. He represented Great Britain at rugby league on the famous Indomitable's tour to Australia in 1946. The club is still thriving today, recently celebrating 125 years of rugby being played at Penclawdd and the first team is currently competing in the Division 2 South West league of the WRU, the 2nds in the Swansea and district league, and the Youth play in the osprey rugby trust leagues. ==Local delicacies== Cockle harvester and donkey in 1951 Penclawdd is most famous for its local cockle industry which goes back for many years to Roman times. This is one of the only industries to survive. These cockles are collected from the extensive sandy flats in the Burry Estuary and the cockles harvested there are sold worldwide. Samples of these famous cockles can be purchased at the stalls in Swansea Market and locally in the village itself. Up until the 1970s the cockles were gathered by women using hand-rakes and riddles (coarse sieves) with the help of donkey carts, often braving very hard conditions. Now they are harvested mostly by men, still by hand but using tractors or Land Rovers. The original small, family- owned factories in Penclawdd have been demolished and cockles are now processed in two large, modern factories in the nearby village of Crofty; the product is largely exported to continental Europe. Other local delicacies include laverbread (laver seaweed Porphyra umbilicalis washed and boiled; it is eaten dipped in oatmeal and fried in bacon fat) and salt marsh lamb. All of these and more examples of Welsh cuisine are sold at an award-winning local Penclawdd produce market. There are various industrial units in Crofty nearby, which are in various stages of decay, being very run down, especially on the New Rd, as they are in desperate need of repair.. ==People== Composer Karl Jenkins was born and raised in Penclawdd. ==Further reading== Several books have been published on the history of Penclawdd, including: * A Dark And Pagan Place - By R.

Congress authorized the Chief Justice of the United States to appoint to the temporary court three or more district and appeals court judges, each of whom was to serve on a part-time basis for an indefinite term. The court exercised the same powers as a U.S. court of appeals, and it was authorized to prescribe its own rules of practice, which it did when its three district and six circuit court judges convened for the first time in February 1972. The Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals was modeled on the Emergency Court of Appeals, which was established in 1942 to hear appeals in cases involving various wartime price control measures and which heard its last case in 1961. It was created by the Act of December 22, 1971 (, ). Although the Economic Stabilization Act expired in 1974, Congress extended the operation of the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals in the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973. The court exercised the judicial review provisions of the energy price stabilization program established by the act. The temporary court’s jurisdiction was further expanded in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 and the Emergency Natural Gas Act of 1977 (91 Stat. 4).

A street name sign is a type of traffic sign used to identify named roads, generally those that do not qualify as expressways or highways. Street name signs are most often found posted at intersections; sometimes, especially in the United States, in perpendicularly oriented pairs identifying each of the crossing streets. ==Description== Trilingual street name signs in the Serbian, Slovak, and Hungarian languages, in the village of Belo Blato, Serbia. Standard sign, New York City \\"Historic district\\" sign, New York City \\"Midtown Manhattan\\" sign, New York City Modern street name signs may be mounted in various ways, such as attached to walls or on utility poles or smaller purpose-made sign poles posted on a streetcorner, or hung over intersections from overhead supports like wires or pylons. When attached to poles, they may be stacked onto each other in alternating directions or mounted perpendicular to each other, with each sign facing the street it represents. Until around 1900 in the USA, however, street name signs were often mounted on the corners of buildings, or even chiseled into the masonry, and many of those signs still exist in older neighborhoods. They are commonly used in France and the United Kingdom. The design and style of the sign is usually common to the district in which it appears. Some street name signs also indicate the range of house numbers found nearby, and/or the name or number of the local administrative or postal district. Some street name signs also indicate an alternative name for the street, such as \\"Fashion Avenue\\" for Seventh Avenue in New York City, or \\"Avenue of the Arts\\" for Huntington Avenue in Boston, Massachusetts. Multilingual signs are common and may be required by law in some areas, such as French-speaking regions of Canada. Multiingual signs are sometimes primarily used to promote local minority languages.

Occasionally some signs are a target for vandalism, for example in areas of language controversy; and signs on unusually or famously named streets (perhaps those containing a rude word) are especially liable to street sign theft. In recent years, many US and Canadian cities have adopted the mast arm for traffic signal equipment; major intersections are marked with large signs mounted on the mast arms. This was started in the 1960s by the California Department of Transportation. Los Angeles and San Francisco started in the 1970s and recently New York City has introduced the bigger signs at its intersections. In 2013, New York City began to change street signs that have been previously used Highway Gothic font for a new one, Clearview, that include both upper and lower case letters, which is considered more readable. ==Color coding and typography== Street sign corner in Tartu, Estonia Usually, the color scheme used on the sign just reflects the local standard (for example, white letters on a green background are common throughout the US). However, in some cases, the color of a sign can provide information, as well. One example can be found in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Within its city limits, all roads designated as a snow emergency route use a blue sign, these are typically major arterial routes. Other roads have green signs. Other places sometimes use blue or white signs to indicate private roads. , the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) approved color schemes for street name signs including a green, blue, or brown background with white text, or a white background with black text. Despite the MUTCD restriction only to the aforementioned color schemes, other color schemes are used in some cities; for example, the city of Mesa, Arizona uses ruby red colored street name signs at signalized intersections in the Fiesta District in the western part of the city. The city of Houston, Texas allows for street name signs in several of its neighborhoods (usually part of a management district, where property owners assess additional fees to themselves to pay for extra services) to be of significantly different color schemes and fonts than the citywide standard. Since the MUTCD guideline was adopted, some cities have begun transitioning from noncompliant colors, such as white on black in San Jose, California. In 1952 in the UK, David Kindersley submitted a design, MoT Serif, to the British Ministry of Transport, which required new lettering to use on United Kingdom road signs. Although the Road Research Laboratory found Kindersley's design more legible, the all-capitals design with serifs was passed over in favour of that of Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert. Many of the street signs in Britain use Kindersley fonts.Richard Kindersley Studio official website ==Gallery== File:Via Dei Coronari (Straßenschild).jpgHistoric marble street sign in Rome, Italy File:Cullenstreet.JPGInternally illuminated mast-mounted street sign in California File:Bukhara Sarrofon Kochasi.jpgExample in Bukhara File:Artistic street sign at Długa Street in Gdańsk 1.jpgStreet sign at Długa Street in Gdańsk File:NIKAIA-pairoliereN22 Plaq.jpgBilingual (French/Niçois) wall- mounted street signs in Nice, France File:East Berlin street sign for Marx- Engels-Platz and television tower, 1984.jpgEast Berlin street sign for the former Marx-Engels-Platz (1984) File:Augustinergasse - Zunft zum Widder 2012-03-20 17-50-03 (P7000).jpgSign in Zurich File:Kapucínska ulica, Bratislava (Pressburg, Pozsony) - old street sign.JPGHistoric Hungarian/German street sign in Bratislava File:Cartel calle Laurel.pngSpanish street sign, Calle Laurel File:Jaffa street, Haifa (24).JPGHaifa, Israel File:Halfanim.jpgA street sign in Jaffa File:Hong Kong To Kwa Wan Tsun Fat Street Road Sign.JPGStreet sign, Hong Kong File:Calcada da barra.JPGStreet sign, Macau File:Bilingual street sign in Fredericksburg Texas.pngBilingual sign in Fredericksburg, Texas File:Bourbon Street sign in sidewalk.pngTiles in the sidewalk mark many streets in the older neighborhoods of New Orleans File:Apak.jpgA street sign in Jaffa Israel File:Place Dalida.JPGA street sign in Montmartre, Paris File:Four and a half street in Berwick PA.jpgFour and a half street in Berwick, Pennsylvania File:Street Signs in Windhoek Namibia (President´s Corner).jpg\\"President´s Corner\\" in Windhoek, Namibia File:Esquina paulista.JPGStreet sign in São Paulo, Brazil File:15-08-Strassenschild Wisconsin IMG 1043.JPGMilwaukee File:17-08-islcanus-RalfR-DSC 4719 1.jpgNew York City File:Via dolorosa street name sign in Jerusalem.jpgVia Dolorosa, Jerusalem File:Calle de Cervantes - Street name plate in Madrid.jpgMadrid File:Praha street sign.jpgStreet name sign in Prague, Czechia File:Street sign at Palermo.jpgPalermo File:Bilingual sign Chinatown London.jpgBilingual street name sign in Chinatown in Westminster, London.

He served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1711 to 1713. ==Life== Robert Benson was born in Wakefield, the son of Robert Benson of Wrenthorpe. He went to school in London before studying at Christ's College, Cambridge. He served as an alderman of the city of York and was elected Lord Mayor of York for 1707. He was elected Member of Parliament for Thetford in Norfolk from 1702 to 1705, then becoming MP for York from 1705 to 1713. In 1711, he was sworn of the Privy Council and became Chancellor of the Exchequer until 1713. He was a Director of the South Sea Company from July 1711 to February 1715. In 1713 he was ennobled as Baron Bingley, and became the British ambassador to Spain. Benson founded the stately home of Bramham Park, near Wetherby, Yorkshire. When he died in 1731 he was buried in Westminster Abbey and the title Baron Bingley became extinct, although it was later re-created for his son-in-law. He had married Elizabeth, the daughter of Hon. Heneage Finch, and had a son (who predeceased him) and two daughters (one illegitimate). It has often been suggested that Bingley was also the real father of the British soldier, dramatist and politician John Burgoyne, whose debts he cancelled in his will. The residue of his estate, including Bramham Park, went to his daughter Harriet who had married George Fox. ==Notes== ==References== * Category:1670s births Category:1731 deaths Category:Alumni of Christ's College, Cambridge Category:Lord Mayors of York Category:Barons in the Peerage of Great Britain Category:Peers of Great Britain created by Queen Anne Category:Chancellors of the Exchequer of Great Britain Category:Diplomatic peers Category:Members of the Privy Council of Great Britain Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:Treasurers of the Household Category:British MPs 1707–1708 Category:British MPs 1708–1710 Category:British MPs 1710–1713 Category:Ambassadors of Great Britain to Spain Category:English MPs 1702–1705 Category:English MPs 1705–1707 ","title":"Robert Benson, 1st Baron Bingley"},{"id":"2586586","text":"Douglas Malcolm Craig OBE, JP, BSC, FICE, FI, MUN E, FCI ARB, M CONS E (born Broughty Ferry, Dundee, Scotland) is former chairman of York City.

He enjoyed success under the guidance of manager John Ward and, later, Alan Little, York enjoyed their best period in recent years. The club won promotion to what was then the English Second Division (now League One) in 1993 before making headlines with its giant-killing cup exploits, beating Manchester United over two legs in the League Cup. The cup glory continued the following year. Craig earned national notoriety in 1994 by becoming the only chairman to refuse to sign up to the \\"Let's Kick Racism Out of Football\\" campaign. ===Latter years; sell off and results=== The following years under Craig were bleak for York, with relegation to Division Three and managers coming and going. In July 1999, Craig wrote to all York City's shareholders, asking them to approve a plan to transfer the club, and Bootham Crescent, to a new company, Bootham Crescent Holdings (BCH). Craig pointed out that he and his three fellow directors, John Quickfall, Colin Webb and the former playing hero Barry Swallow, owned 94 per cent of the shares and had already approved the plan. This sent York into serious financial turmoil, and the club went into administration shortly after Craig had sold it, minus all fixed assets, to John Batchelor for a fee rumoured to be £50. York City was later rescued by a trust, which had been set up by the club's supporters. Craig sold the ground back to the Supporter's Trust, but for a figure that was many times larger than the reputed £50,000 that he reputedly paid for the club, many years earlier. In 2002, Douglas Craig was on a 3 man FA panel that overruled The Football League’s decision that had prevented Wimbledon moving to Milton Keynes. On appeal, The Football League allowed Wimbledon to relocate to Milton Keynes in 2003. ==References== Category:Living people Category:People from Broughty Ferry Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:Conservative Party (UK) politicians Category:English football chairmen and investors Category:York City F.C. directors and chairmen Category:Politicians from Dundee Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Douglas Craig"},{"id":"2586589","text":"Edmund Taylor may refer to: *Edmund Taylor of Oxton, England, who was instrumental in obtaining the Bidston Windmill *Edmund Taylor (cricketer) (1853–1936), English cricketer *Edmund Dick Taylor (1804–1891), US political figure and financial advisor *Edmund Haynes Taylor, Jr. (born 1832), historic US distiller after whom the Old Taylor and E.

The pilot tone serves as a frequency reference for the receiver, eliminating the signal distortion that would occur with single-sideband suppressed carrier modulation when the receiver is off frequency. It offers improved effective range over standard SSB modulation while simultaneously retaining backwards compatibility with standard SSB radios. ACSB also offers reduced bandwidth and improved range for a given power level compared with narrow band FM modulation. The companding used in ACSB is a type of dynamic range reduction wherein the difference in amplitude between the louder and softer sounds is reduced prior to transmission. A corresponding expander circuit in the receiver inverts this transformation in order to restore the dynamic range. If a conventional SSB receiver is used to receive ACSB signals, some distortion may be noticed but generally the signals are quite intelligible. Similar techniques are used in audio noise reduction circuits such as those developed for Dolby. ACSB is being used by amateur radio operators, air-to-ground phones, as well as mobile-satellite services. ==External links== *Mobile and Mobile-Satellite Services *Property Rights In Radio Communication: The Key to the Reform of Telecommunications Regulation Milton Mueller The Cato Institute June 3, 1982 == References == Category:Radio modulation modes ","title":"Amplitude-companded single-sideband modulation"},{"id":"2586635","text":"Miodrag Petrović (, , 1 April 1924 – 20 October 2003), known by his stage name Čkalja (Чкаља), was a Serbian actor and one of the most popular comedians of former Yugoslavia. ==Biography== He performed in the theatre, where he displayed a talent for comedy, especially in plays by Branislav Nušić, his favourite author.

According to the chef Raymond Blanc, pot-au-feu is \\"the quintessence of French family cuisine; it is the most celebrated dish in France and considered a national dish. It honours the tables of the rich and poor alike.\\"In December 2014, a low-cost pot-au-feu for 4–6 persons made with 2kg of vegetables and 1kg of meat cost c. €10 (€1.70–2.50 per person) or US$13 ($2.15–3.25 per person). It is a typical dish served for Christmas. == Origin and history == It is difficult to know when the name pot-au-feu first appeared and when its meaning changed to describe the dish instead of the pot in which it is cooked. While pot was used to describe the rounded pot to cook on the fire at least since the 11th century (even in English),Pot: late Old English pott, probably reinforced in Middle English by Old French pot; of unknown ultimate origin (compare with late Latin potus ‘drinking cup’). From New Oxford American Dictionary. The late Old English period corresponds to the 11th century. there seems to be no written trace of pot-au-feu until 1673.Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, marquise de SÉVIGNÉ, Lettres (1646-1696), edited in 1725 (Fr). In 1600, King Henry IV of France (1553-1610) declared, \\"I want no peasant in my kingdom to be so poor that he cannot have a poule au pot on Sundays.\\"In French: \\"Je veux qu'il n'y ait si pauvre paysan en mon royaume qu'il n'ait tous les dimanches sa poule au pot\\" but other variants exist. Poule au pot literally means \\"chicken in the pot\\" and the so-called traditional recipe resembles the one of \\"pot-au-feu\\".La poule au pot farcie de \\"nouste Henric\\" du Béarn (in French) However, peasants' food was mainly based on bread (c. 500 g/day), root vegetables, in-season vegetables and soup. They rarely ate meat except salted pork, hog-grease, bacon, or other meat, whether it was during religious celebrations or when they dared to poach game from their lord's land. For people living in towns, it was easier to buy inexpensive pieces of meat, which needed long cooking times. The method of cooking all food together and for extended periods of time (the whole day sometimes) gave what was called a \\"pot-pourri\\" in French and imported into English in the early 17th century.Potpourri: early 17th cent. (denoting a stew made of different kinds of meat): from French, literally ‘rotten pot’. New Oxford American Dictionary The relation between pot-pourri and pot-au-feu was attested in 1829 in the Etymologic dictionary of the French language: \\"Pot pourri. The name our fathers gave to the pot-au- feu\\".Jean Baptiste Bonaventure de Roquefort, Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue françoise, où les mots sont classés par familles: contenant les mots du Dictionnaire de l'Académie Françoise, avec les principaux termes d'arts, de sciences et de métiers. Précédé d'une dissertation sur l'étymologie, Volume 1, 1829, p. 84 Available online on GoogleBooks. Note: adjective \\"françoise\\" () is the old spelling of \\"française\\" (). One batch of pot-au-feu was maintained as a perpetual stew in Perpignan from the 15th century until World War II. == Main ingredients == Pot-au-feu ingredients: Beefs, carrots, turnips, leeks and onions The cuts of beef and the vegetables involved vary, but a typical pot- au-feu contains: * inexpensive cuts of beef that require cooking for long periods; * some kind of cartilaginous meat, such as oxtail and marrowbone; * vegetables: mainly root vegetables like carrots, turnips, parsnips, celery, onions but also white cabbage and leeks; * spices: bouquet garni, salt, black pepper and cloves. Cooking cartilaginous meat in the stew will result in gelatin being dissolved into the broth. If the stew is allowed to cool, the broth may turn into a jelly. Allowing the stew to cool also allows the removal of excess fat, which floats on the surface and solidifies. In order to give the broth a slightly smoked taste and its typical brown color, onions are cut in half then charred in a frying pan protected by aluminum foil until the onion's surface is completely black. The cloves are driven into the onions so that both onions and cloves can be removed easily before serving. === Serving === Traditionally, the broth is served first with a bit of nutmeg and the marrow (if a marrowbone was used) spread on toasted bread. Then the meat and the vegetables are served with coarse salt and strong Dijon mustard, horseradish sauce, and sometimes also with gherkins pickled in vinegar. Pot- au-feu broth may also be used as a soup (often enriched with rice, pasta or toasted bread), as a base for sauces, or for cooking vegetables or pasta. Ready-to-use concentrated cubes are available to make what purports to be pot- au-feu broth when water is added. === Variants === Many countries have similar dishes with local ingredients. Even within France, ingredients may differ from one region to another and with the season. ==Images== File:Pot-au-feu SAM 2730.JPGPot-au-feu with many vegetables File:Vlaamse Hutsepot.jpgA Flemish pot-au-feu File:Pot-au-feu au plat de côte.jpgPot-au-feu's side dish File:Pot-au-feu SAM 2724.JPGPot-au-feu File:Pot-au-feu SAM 2723.JPGServed with sauce File:Beef steak, potato salad, pot-au-feu, and highball - Beaf Kitchen Stand, APA Hotel Akihabara shop (2017-04-15 18.24.25 by Naoki Nakashima).jpgJapanese-style Pot-au-feu ==See also== * Bigos * Bollito misto * Cazuela * Cholent * Cocido * Cozido à portuguesa * Sancochado (Peruvian) * Eintopf * Feu * Hot pot (Steamboat) * Jjigae * Kig ha farz * Lancashire hotpot * List of stews * New England boiled dinner * Oden * Olla podrida * Perpetual stew * Pho * Pot roast * Stew * Potjiekos * Tafelspitz ==References== Category:French stews Category:National dishes Category:Christmas food Category:Christmas in France Category:Chicken soups ","title":"Pot-au-feu"},{"id":"2586651","text":"Diocese of Eastern Himalaya is a diocese of the Church of North India.

Jan Provoost, or Jean Provost, or Jan Provost (1462/65 – January 1529) was a Belgian painter born in Mons. Provost was a prolific master who left his early workshop in Valenciennes to run two workshops, one in Bruges, where he was made a burgher in 1494, the other simultaneously in Antwerp, which was the economic centre of the Low Countries. Provost was also a cartographer, engineer, and architect. He met Albrecht Dürer in Antwerp in 1520, and a Dürer portrait drawing at the National Gallery, London, is conjectured to be of Provost. He married the widow of the miniaturist and painter Simon Marmion, after whose death he inherited the considerable Marmion estate. He died in Bruges, in January 1529. The styles of Gerard David and Hans Memling can be detected in Provoost's religious paintings. The Last Judgement painted for the Bruges town hall in 1525 is the only painting for which documentary evidence identifies Provost. Surprising discoveries can still be made: in 1971 an unknown and anonymous panoramic Crucifixion from the village church at Koolkerke was identified as Provost's.

The corporate laws of Liberia were promulgated over 50 years ago to provide an offshore jurisdiction for ship owners and the international financial community. LISCR (Liberian International Ship & Corporate Registry) has been appointed by the Government of Liberia as its agent, to manage the corporate registry, and to act as the sole registered agent for corporations registered in Liberia, but having their place of business elsewhere. The corporate registry is managed by LISCR located in Dulles, Virginia in the US and an office in Zurich, Switzerland. There are two income tax treaties with Sweden and Germany in force. Additionally, Liberia as a corporate jurisdiction is on OECD’s white-list of countries that have substantially implemented tax transparency and meet the internationally agreed tax standard. ==Shipping companies== The Liberian Registry – the second largest in the world – includes over 4,300 ships of more than 160 million gross tons, which accounts for 12 percent of the world's oceangoing fleet. The Liberian fleet is one of the youngest of all nations, with an average vessel age of 12 years. According to the U.S. Maritime Administration, Liberian-flagged vessels carry more than one-third of the oil imported into the United States. The Liberian Registry is administered by the Liberian International Ship & Corporate Registry (LISCR, LLC), a U.S. owned and operated company that provides the day-to-day management for the Republic of Liberia's (ROL) ship and corporate registry. In addition to its regional offices in many major maritime centers of the world, the Liberian Registry is also supported by a worldwide network with over 400 Nautical Inspectors and Auditors. The Liberian Registry is open to any ship owner in the world. In order to enter the Liberian registry a vessel must be less than 20 years of age and must meet high safety standards. Liberian flagged ships are able to trade anywhere in the world. There are no crew nationality restrictions and taxes on Liberian vessels are at conservative rates based on the net tonnage. Registration of vessels is eligible to Liberian entities or registered business entities incorporated under other jurisdictions and registered as a Liberian Foreign Maritime Entity. ==Documentation== Liberian corporations, LLCs, partnerships, and not-for- profit businesses are easily formed. No special documents are required to be submitted other than an order form confirming the details of the entity requested. They however will only accept formation instructions from a professional user of offshore corporations including ship managers, manning agents, ship owners, etc., as well as trust and company managers, lawyers, accountants, investment companies, etc. They do not accept instructions directly from individuals not engaged professionally in company management or acting as a professional advisor or lawyer. ==Subscription rights== The Articles of Incorporation should include at the minimum, the name of the corporation; the purpose of the corporation; the type of shares and total authorized share capital; the name of the incorporator and names of any subscribers of shares and the number of initial directors. Directors, shareholders and other officers do not need to be registered in Liberia and thus it is not possible to obtain from the public record any form of evidence of directors, shareholders or officers. This particular feature makes the administration of a Liberian Company particularly simple for offshore trust Companies. Unfortunately it can sometimes create difficulties if a Liberian company is to enter into a contract, since the Counter-Party must follow the paper trail to ensure they are dealing with duly elected officials of the Company. For this purpose, Liberian corporations can voluntarily file such information as needed to conduct their business. ==Accounts== Liberian companies shall keep correct and complete books and records or account and shall keep minutes of all meetings of shareholders, of actions taken on consent by shareholders, of all meetings of the board of directors, of actions taken on consent by directors and of meetings of the executive committee, if any. There is no requirement to file this information in the Public Register; instead, the Corporation is responsible for the safekeeping of its records. There is no requirement to have audited accounts for a Liberian Corporation. Any decision to audit the accounts is one for the shareholders to take. ==Fees== It costs $713.50 to register a company in Liberia, with an annual registration fee of $450.00 after that. There is no requirement that you or any company director be physically present in Liberia at any time. There are no capital investment requirements to start a Liberian company, but to maintain \\"non-resident domestic corporation\\" status at least 75% (previously 50%) of the company shares (or share subscription rights) must be owned and controlled by non-residents of Liberia. ==Bank secrecy laws== Liberia has no special bank secrecy laws like other tax havens, but this is not a deterrent as few Liberian offshore corporations actually handle their banking transactions within Liberia's territory borders. Moreover, there is no requirement that they must bank in Liberia. Certified copies of filed corporate records are available for order by the public. ==See also== *List of Liberian companies ==References== Category:Companies of Liberia Category:Ship registration ","title":"Liberian companies"},{"id":"2586744","text":"The Cann Memorial Botanical Gardens (4 hectares / 10 acres) are botanical gardens located at 1500 East Grand Avenue, Ponca City, Oklahoma, United States.

In the composer's inscription on the title page of the autograph score is stated: \\"li 31 di decembre 1782 in vienna\\". ISMN M-006-20118-1 The work was perhaps edited in 1783. This is the first of the Haydn Quartets, a set of six string quartets he wrote during his first few years in Vienna in honor of the composer Joseph Haydn, who is generally viewed as the father of the string quartet form. ==Movements== Average performances of the whole string quartet vary in length from 26 to 33 minutes. As with all later Mozart quartets, this quartet has four movements: *I. Allegro vivace assai *II. Menuetto (Trio in G minor) *III. Andante cantabile, in C major *IV. Molto allegro The first movement, in G major, contrasts fairly diatonic passages with chromatic runs. According to (Williams, 1997) \\"it must come as something of a surprise to anyone examining this quartet just how much chromaticism there is in it.\\" In contrast to the standard quartet form, which places the minuet as the 3rd movement, this quartet has the minuet as its 2nd movement (another example of this ordering is the String Quartet No. 17). It is a long minuet, written in the tonic key of G major, with its chromatic fourths set apart by note-to-note dynamics changes. Its trio is in G minor and has a suitably darker and more unsettled mood. The minuet is followed by a slow movement in the subdominant C major, whose theme explores remote key areas. The fugal theme of four whole notes in the finale points ahead to the finale of Mozart's \\"Jupiter\\" Symphony of 1788, a movement which also begins with four whole notes that are used in a fugal fashion, in the coda, and it also points back to Michael Haydn's Symphony No. 23 in which the finale is also a fugato based on a theme of four whole notes,David Wyn Jones, \\"The Origins of the Symphony\\" A Guide to the Symphony Oxford: Oxford University Press (1996): 15 which Mozart copied out the first few bars of and was mistakenly entered into Köchel's original catalog as K. 291. == Notes == ==References== * John Irving, Mozart, the \\"Haydn\\" quartets.

Compensation reservoir and Cut Centre at Cornalees, in front of Hillside Hill. Near the start of The Cut, , looking northwest towards Shielhill Farm and Dunrod Hill. Looking back along The Cut from Overton. Shaws Water Works compensation reservoir and water engineer's house at Overton. Loch Thom is a reservoir which since 1827 has provided a water supply to the town of Greenock in Inverclyde, Scotland. It is named after the civil engineer Robert Thom who designed the scheme which created the reservoir and delivered water via a long aqueduct known as The Cut. Today, as well as providing a water supply, the loch is used for sport fishing and forms part of the Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park with several attractive walks and a centre at Cornalees Bridge providing nature study facilities. The loch is about 2.4 km from north to south, curving to the east in a rough C-shape, and is at an elevation of about 195 m above sea level. From the northern arm an outlet feeds southwest a short distance to a compensation reservoir at the centre of the \\"C\\", which then connects at Cornalees Bridge to the start of The Cut. ==History== In the late 18th century Greenock was a rapidly expanding seaport with industries developing as the industrial revolution gathered pace. Its location on the north slopes of hills sweeping down to the south bank of the Firth of Clyde meant that several fast flowing streams provided supplies, and a number of wells provided clean water for domestic use. This was supplemented in 1773 by a piped water system designed by James Watt supplying some areas, but there was increasing demand for water powered mills. On the far side of the hills to the south of the town a natural dip held a freshwater lake known as Shaws Water at a level high above the town. The civil engineer Robert Thom from Rothesay prepared a scheme to turn this into a reservoir and create the aqueduct which became known as The Cut. The Shaws Water Joint Stock Company named by Sir Michael Shaw Stewart, 5th BaronetFrom Royal Stewart to Shaw Stewart: Their Story by J.S. Bolton 1989 p.49 and friends, which was incorporated on 10 June 1825 with capital of £30,000. The scheme was officially opened on 16 April 1827. On that day a grain mill, paper mill, power loom manufactory and a sugar refinery made use of the power from the water running north down to the sea for a vertical height of around 170 m, at a rate of about of water per day. In 1845 The Kelly Cut was constructed to bring more water to Loch Thom from the south. Numerous other mills were added in Greenock to make use of the supply, including what became The Merino Mills weaving woollen cloth, and a mill grinding clay for a local pottery works. A drought caused the reservoir to run dry in 1852 stopping work at the factories that relied on it. The water supply proved inadequate for growing domestic demand, and in 1872 another reservoir was created immediately to the east of Loch Thom at Gryffe Reservoir. Together with thirteen smaller reservoirs nearby they provide almost 650,000,000 cubic feet (18,000,000 m³) of water supply in total ==Greenock Cut Centre== Loch Thom forms part of Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park, a public organisation aimed at providing countryside access and education. Several nature trails are provided, and the Greenock Cut Centre adjacent to Cornalees Bridge provides educational facilities at a ranger base, along with car parking, refreshments and public toilets. Location: . ==The Cut== The Greenock Cut, with one of the small stone buildings over a sluice gate. Automatic sluice gate mechanism. From Cornalees Bridge The Cut runs west then turns northward following along the contour of Dunrod Hill which it follows round until running eastwards directly above the town of Greenock at Overton, having come a distance of . On the way it collects some of the water from streams that cross its path, and a series of sluice gates incorporated an ingenious automatic way of releasing surplus water. As shown in the picture of a restored mechanism, when the aqueduct is over full, water flows down the pipe in the foreground and fills the bucket, which then pulls the chain down over the pulley wheel and lifts the counterweight and the lever opening the sluice gate. Small holes in the bucket allow the water to drain slowly out, so when the inflow stops the counterweight eventually pulls the sluice gate lever down and lifts the empty bucket. The cut provided a water flow to a series of falls running through water wheels powering various industrial processes, including a papermill, woollen and cotton mills, ropeworks, several sugar refineries, an iron foundry and shipbuilding works including production of steam engines and boilers. From its opening, the nearly level footpath formed on the embankment to the downhill side of the aqueduct proved a great attraction, and \\"walking the Cut\\" continues to be popular. ==Literature== The poet W. S. Graham's later work powerfully evokes his childhood in and around Greenock.

The community moved in 1918, leaving behind the \\"ghost\\" of an alternative future for LA.

Homer gets Marge and the kids to leave the house by sending them off to \\"Santa's Village\\". Marge and the kids return home to find the production is still underway. Marge, outraged by Homer's latest bit of idiocy, leaves. Homer, home alone with the kids, tries to figure out what to do next. Just as Marge is about ready to reconcile with Homer (though she flatly expresses that she is not interested in his gift of Kwik-E-Mart chocolates, half of which have test bites), she encounters Dr. Caleb Thorn, a good-looking scientist with a passion for saving the endangered manatee. Homer and the kids go on a quest to find Marge and they stop and stay with their \\"country cousins\\" (their dog is Santa's Little Helper's brother). Meanwhile, Marge is finding herself while helping to save manatees. Caleb helps Marge realize that Homer is still the man she fell in love with and the problem is that she still expects him to change. Homer decides to win Marge back by saving a herd of manatees from a gang of abusing jet skiers. The gang initially agreed to leave, but return after hearing Homer calling them 'rubes'. He attempts to organize the manatees to battle the gang, but they all flee. However, the gang is dispersed when Homer's country cousin shows up with a notarized court order to have all jet skiers vacate the waters at once. Despite Homer's failure, Marge is impressed by his efforts to save the manatees and declares she is taking home \\"the real endangered species\\": \\"a devoted husband\\". The family decides to take a mini-vacation and Homer gets a manatee sent to the power plant to fill in for his job for the next few days. When the manatee is about to die of dehydration, Mr. Burns and Smithers help him by washing him like a car, which the manatee actually enjoys. ==Production== The idea for the episode was originally pitched on January 16, 2004 during the writers' idea sessions for The Simpsons Movie. Al Jean suggested the idea of the family rescuing manatees, and while it was rejected for the film, it was adapted into the script for the episode. ==Reception== On May 11, 2008, Entertainment Weekly named Alec Baldwin's role as Caleb Thorn as the first of 16 great guest stars on The Simpsons. The episode is also notable for having predicted the team matchup for Super Bowl XLVIII between the Denver Broncos and the Seattle Seahawks. The title of the episode is a reference to the novel The Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe. ==References== == External links == # # Category:The Simpsons (season 17) episodes Category:2005 American television episodes fi:Pelastakaa manaatit ","title":"The Bonfire of the Manatees"},{"id":"2586899","text":"Uwe Wittwer.

Schulz. It was originally aired on the CBS network on October 24, 1980. The special won an Emmy Award in 1981 for Outstanding Animated Program. ==Synopsis== Snoopy is lying on top of his doghouse when he hears music. He follows the music and finds a circus unloading. Among other animals, he sees three poodles, and immediately latches onto the white one (whom the audience later learns is named Fifi). He follows her to the entrance of the big top with his tongue hanging out and his pupils shaped like hearts, then stops. Polly, the dog's trainer, sees Snoopy and pulls him inside. The next day, Peppermint Patty calls Charlie Brown to tell him her school gave all students the day off to see the circus. Charlie Brown tells her that his school will be closed as well, and they decide to attend the circus together. At the circus the children see Snoopy perform as part of a dog act. They all realize it is Snoopy and eventually relish his new career, despite Snoopy's shortcomings being completely untrained. However, Charlie Brown isn't having any of it, exclaiming Snoopy's career is being his dog. Despite Snoopy making a fool of himself during the performance, Polly's boss tells Polly to include Snoopy in future performances, but is to be given the name Hugo The Great. Later that night, Charlie Brown realizes Snoopy has not returned. He goes to the circus site in time to see Snoopy enter a boxcar, still following Fifi. The gate of the boxcar slams shut on him, and the circus train pulls away. The next scene involves Snoopy trying to find a good warm place to fall asleep while the train is in motion. First he tries to lie on the humps of a camel, only to slide off in between both humps each time, then he finds what looks like a bail of hay next to one of the bears, which Snoopy settles into. However, it turns out to be a lion, who wakes up and looks at Snoopy contemptuously. Snoopy wakes up and when he sees the lion looking at him, runs away scared, running over the top of the bear (waking it but that's all) and ending up stopping when he sees other props on the other side of the car. He decides to lie on top of one box, which turns out to be the saw-a-person-in-half magic trick. He falls into that box and his head and feet appear out the holes in each end. In the morning, after the circus train arrives at its next call, Polly slowly trains Snoopy to become part of the act. First he is taught to ride a unicycle first on the ground, then on the high wire. Snoopy also learns to do a back flip and his performance in the next show is an improvement. Meanwhile, back home, Lucy has decided to board up the doorway of Snoopy's doghouse and place a sign on it which reads \\"Premises Condemned\\". Charlie Brown also recounts to Linus the story of why his parents gave him a pet dog. (This story was also told in the movie Snoopy Come Home.) Polly decides to expand the act by getting Snoopy and Fifi to do a trapeze act. Snoopy takes to the air a little more fearlessly, Fifi is initially scared. Eventually it works out, and at the next show, combined with the back flips and the unicycle ride, they are a major success. After the show, Polly gives Snoopy and Fifi the good news that they are officially the stars of the circus. However, her boss feels their colors do not fit and wants them both dyed pink. She first wrestles Snoopy into a large vat of food coloring, and after he is completely pink, she goes to do the same to Fifi, but Snoopy jumps between them growling menacingly at her. After Polly shows no fear and tells him basically to get out of her way, Snoopy attacks her and wrestles her into the food coloring until she too is all pink, then jumps out and runs away, taking Fifi with him to the bus stop to return home, but Fifi decides to go back to the circus, then Snoopy sadly boards the bus and returns to Charlie Brown. Back home, Charlie Brown is awakened by the shower running because Snoopy is washing the pink food coloring off him. Charlie Brown sees him exiting the bathroom but says nothing. Snoopy then makes himself some dinner, still crying over being heartbroken from Fifi. Then he realizes that the circus is her life and his home is his life, and he retreats to his doghouse. Upon seeing what Lucy did to it, he rips up the sign and tears the boards off the house. He goes to bed after illuminating a big blinking neon sign which reads \\"Hugo The Great\\". ==Voice cast== * Michael Mandy - Charlie Brown * Brent Hauer - Patricia \\"Peppermint Patty\\" Reichardt * Casey Carlson - Polly * Earl \\"Rocky\\" Reilly - Linus van Pelt * Kristen Fullerton - Lucy van Pelt * Shannon Cohn - Marcie * Christopher Donohoe - Schroeder * Bill Melendez - Snoopy ==Home media== It was one of the first two Peanuts specials released on VHS, on a set release by Media Home Entertainment in June 1984 with You're the Greatest, Charlie Brown.

Directed by debutant Pradeep Sarkar, it was based upon a screenplay by the film's producer, Vidhu Vinod Chopra. The film featured Vidya Balan (In her Bollywood Debut), Sanjay Dutt and Saif Ali Khan in the lead roles. Raima Sen plays the supporting role of Lalita's chirpy cousin. Sabyasachi Chakrabarty plays the pivotal role of Shekhar's father. Dia Mirza, with a cameo appearance as Shekhar's fiancé and Rekha, with a cameo performance of a night club (Moulin Rouge) singer, are other notable performances. Parineeta primarily revolves around the lead characters, Lalita and Shekhar. Since childhood, Shekhar and Lalita have been friends and slowly this friendship blossoms into love. A series of misunderstandings surface and they are separated with the conniving schemes of Shekhar's father. The plot deepens with the arrival of Girish, who supports Lalita's family. Eventually, Shekhar's love defies his father's greed and he seeks Lalita. The film has several notable allusions to the Indian literature and cinema. Despite the pre-release inhibitions, it received critical acclaim and won four Filmfare Awards. Sarkar went on to win the National Award for Best Debut Film. Parineeta was showcased at several international film festivals ==Plot== The story takes place in 1962 in Kolkata. As the credits roll, scenes from erstwhile Calcutta are displayed along with the narrator's (Amitabh Bachchan) introduction of the era. The narration focuses on the night of the marriage of Shekhar and Gayatri Tantiya, a rich industrialist's daughter. The audience is introduced to Naveen Roy as Shekhar's father while we see Shekhar grooming himself for the occasion. While he is doing so, images of Lalita calling him by his name flash through his mind. Downstairs, musical celebrations begin as Shekhar meets Vasundhara, a widow from his neighbourhood, who is thankful to her son-in-law, Girish (Sanjay Dutt), for supporting their family after the death of her husband, Gurcharan. Lalita, who is present there, playfully confronts Shekhar as to why he is being indifferent to her. Shekhar admonishes her for speaking so in spite of being married. An angry Shekhar comes back home to play a favourite tune from the past on his piano. The flashback shows a young Shekhar playing Rabindranath Tagore’s tune on his piano while young Lalita and Koel are around. Lalita, with her parents having died in a car accident, lives with Gurcharan’s family. Koel is her cousin whereas Charu is her neighbour. As this scene flashes across Shekhar’s mind, he sings a song full of sadness and loss. As time flies, they grow up to become close friends. The rebellious and musically inclined Shekhar spends his days playing the music of Rabindranath Tagore or Elvis Presley and composing his own songs with Lalita rather than becoming part of his shrewd father's business. Part of this rebellion involves resistance to meeting Gayatri Tantiya, the beautiful but devious daughter of a wealthy industrialist, whom his father would like Shekhar to marry. Meanwhile, Girish, a steel tycoon from London, makes a dramatic entry into Charu’s house. Girish seems smitten by Lalita while Koel is by Girish. Shekhar is visibly jealous of Lalita’s close friendship with Girish. One day, a shocked Lalita, who is employed at the Roy’s office, remembers a hotel project from Gurcharan’s ancestral haveli (palatial house). On an earlier occasion, Gurcharan had borrowed money from Naveen Roy after putting his haveli on mortgage. She understands that if the money is not repaid in a few months, Naveen Roy would take over the property. She immediately thinks of asking Shekhar for monetary help. Unforeseen circumstances prevent this, and Girish, upon realising this, alleviates their problem by making Gurcharan his business partner. Gurcharan repays the debt and the turn of events prompts Shekhar to think why Lalita chose to ask Girish for money instead of him. On one auspicious night, Shekhar and Lalita exchange garlands and consummate their \\"marriage\\" unbeknownst to anyone else. While Shekhar is off to Darjeeling on a business trip, Naveen Roy violently thunders at Lalita about the loss of his hotel project, embarrassing and humiliating her. Roy gets a wall built between his and Gurcharan's house symbolising the end of their association. Gurcharan, unable to digest this, suffers a heart attack. Upon Shekhar's return, Roy informs him of the ill-health of his mother and Gurcharan viciously adds a note of Lalita and Girish's marriage. Shekhar is disgusted to hear of the marriage and in his anger he scowls at Lalita, humiliating her like his father. Meanwhile, Girish assists Gurcharan's family and takes them to London for the heart treatment. Misunderstandings follow and upon the family's return from London, Shekhar assumes that Girish and Lalita are married and agrees to marry Gayatri. The film returns to the night of Shekhar's marriage when Girish hands him the ownership papers of Gurcharan's haveli. He shocks Shekhar by telling him that he married Koel because Lalita denied his marriage proposal. As a conclusion, Shekhar confronts his father and symbolically breaks down the wall separating the two families.

With 17 years in mainstream advertising and 7 years of advertisement film-making and commercial cinema, he completed about 1000 commercials and 15 music videos. Vidhu Vinod Chopra, the producer, took notice of his music videos and contacted Sarkar to direct some of the music videos of the film Mission Kashmir (2000). After carving a niche in filming music videos, Sarkar gave the thought of filming Parineeta to Chopra. There began the making of the film. About the film's comparison with the novel, Chopra said in an interview that, as compared to its 1953 namesake film by Bimal Roy, the story was based in the year 1962. He said that it took them one and a half years to script the film, with them adding new characters and emphasising under-represented characters from the novel. In a separate interview, Chopra admitted that he was actively involved with the screenplay because the film was an adaptation of the novel. When speaking about cinematic adaptation, Chopra gave due credit to Sarkar, and Natarajan Subramaniam (the film's cinematographer), for providing the vintage visuals. Saif Ali Khan once said that the film was initially attempted to be made in a contemporary way. When the film's crew did not find the depiction appealing, the filming began with the 60s look. Chopra once cited an interesting anecdote about his belief in Sarkar's film-making abilities. He said that he never personally signed the cheques for the film's expenditure. He transferred money into Sarkar's bank account and the cheques were eventually signed by Sarkar and his spouse. === Casting === Chopra said in an interview that Saif Ali Khan and Vidya Balan were not the first choices for the lead roles in Parineeta. In fact Abhishek Bachchan was being cast as Shekhar and Saif Ali Khan as Girish. However Abhishek walked out of the project and Saif readily was accepted as a replacement. This fact was corroborated by Saif in an interview when he said that even though Sarkar had faith in his abilities, Chopra was not too keen on having him. The choice of Vidya Balan came with Sarkar's prior work experience with her in three music videos. Chopra said that Vidya was screen-tested for six months and only then they were sure of her acting abilities. Saif once said that he was not convinced of Vidya's abilities, since Parineeta was to be her first film. He instead hoped to work with established actresses like Aishwarya Rai or Rani Mukherjee. However, after seeing Vidya portray the character of Lalita, he was thoroughly appreciative of her performance. Getting an opportunity to debut with big names from the industry along with a lovely character to portray made Vidya accept the role of Lalita. The choice of Sanjay Dutt was because of his versatility, said Chopra in an interview. He also said that the affable nature of Sanjay was a plus during film making. Dia Mirza liked the script so well that she chose to play the role of the devious Gayatri in spite of it being a short role. Raima Sen had a similar story with her want to work with the duo of Chopra and Sarkar. The cameo of the veteran actress, Rekha was purely out of her interest in the song, \\"Kaisi Paheli Zindgani\\". === Filming and music === Since Sarkar knew the city of Kolkata very well, the film was primarily shot there. While most of the film was made in Kolkata, a small portion was shot in Darjeeling. To re-create the 60s era, lot of efforts were made by the producers. For instance, Chopra said that it cost them money and difficulty to procure the green coloured car which was driven by Shekhar in the film. Chopra confirmed the authenticity of the piano used in the song \\"Piyu Bole\\", and of the toy train used in the song \\"Kasto Mazza\\". About the look of the characters, Mirza said that the 60s look was well captured by the make-up artist, Vidyadar. The song \\"Kaisi Paheli Zindagani\\" was based on the tune to Louis Armstrong's \\"A Kiss to Build a Dream on\\". Critics had high expectations from Parineeta's music because of the award-winning music that was provided in some of Chopra's previous films, such as (1942: A Love Story (1993) and Mission Kashmir (2000)). Shantanu Moitra, Parineeta's music director composed hundreds of tunes before six of them got finalised after a year's effort. After finalising the soundtrack, Chopra was appreciative of the musician's abilities when he said that Moitra has the potential to become another R. D. Burman, a yesteryear Bollywood music director. == Cultural and cinematic allusions == Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, the author of Parineeta, was a contemporary of Rabindranath Tagore; both authors documented Bengali life and social issues at the turn of the century. The 2005 cinematic version of Parineeta pays homage to this relationship by referencing Satyajit Ray's film Charulata, which itself is based upon Tagore's noted novella, Nashtanir. Lalita (Parineeta) is dressed to resemble Nashtanir / Charulata 's Charu (Madhabi Mukherjee), particularly during the song \\"Soona Man Ka Aangan\\", which incorporates Tagore's song \\"Phoole Phoole Dhole Dhole.\\" In both Parineeta and Charulata, \\"Phoole Phoole Dhole Dhole\\" is sung while Lalita and Charu are each on a swing. The film continues the above connection by placing Saif Ali Khan on the same train used in the film Aradhana which featured his mother, Sharmila Tagore. This film was the third one to bear resemblance to the novella, the other two being its 1953 namesake film and the 1976 film, Sankoch. == Reception == === Box-office and ratings === Parineeta collected over Rs 170 million in India at the end of 2005. Its overseas success was notable as well with gross collections of Rs. 36 million in the United Kingdom, Rs. 35 million in North America, and Rs 15 million in the rest of the overseas. === Reviews, critiques and controversies === Before its release on 10 June 2005, one preview wondered how the film would fare at the box office. Citing comparisons with the 1953 version, the preview suggested that debutant director, Sarkar's inexperience in film-making, the probable inability of debutant actress, Balan to portray Lalita's character appropriately, suitable 1960s depiction by contemporary actors and musician, Shantanu Moitra's until then unimpressive soundtracks, could be impediments to a successful adaptation. Post-release, the same critic said \\"Vidhu Vinod Chopra's \\"Parineeta\\" – a remake of an old classic of the same name...(had) the love story (which) was received well by the younger generation and it went on to become the biggest hit of the year.\\" It was generally well-received by the critics, with one of them terming the film as \\"...a beautiful story, beautifully told. It approximates what most of us expect, and increasingly yearn for, in vain, our cinematic experience.\\" A reviewer from About.com said that it is \\"contemporary retelling of...(an) engaging and timeless tale rich with human emotion and universal drama\\". The reviewer appreciates the film in most of the nuances of film making saying that this is \\"enhanced by a brilliant musical score, and accentuated by superb performances by Sanjay Dutt, Saif Ali Khan, Raima Sen, Diya Mirza and debutante Vidya Balan in the lead role of Lalita\\". 3000 copies of the novella were sold within weeks of the film's release, owing to the film's good reception. Derek Elley from Variety said \\"A character-driven meller that's a treat for the eyes, with performances to match, \\"Parineeta\\" is high-end Bollywood near its best\\". He also says that, \\"though the climax is still emotionally powerful, it comes over as overcooked.\\" A mixed review from Mid-Day says \\"Pradeep Sarkar weaves the story like magic, especially in the first half ... excelling in the detailing ... the vintage look of the film (that stood out) with authentic costumes, props and the roads of Kolkata\\". However, the review criticised the film's climax terming it as amateur, thereby diluting the whole film's impact. Another such review came from The Hindu which begins by saying \\"A simple enough story, but Sarkar tells it well, with some great shots of Shekhar and Lalita together.\\" The review eventually says \\"Except for the end ... where it is too much to bear.\\" The issue of piracy cropped up when a news article published in The Indian Express exposed the dark side of the film market. Hardly into weeks of the film's release, CDs were being sold at as low as Rs. 40. Another blemish was that Soumitra Dasgupta, a writer and close associate of Sarkar alleged that the film's story had a striking resemblance to his parallel work on the novella. == Screenings == In 2005, Parineetas cast got a red carpet walk when it was the \\"World Premiere Film\\" at the International Indian Film Awards (IIFA) weekend in Amsterdam. Owing to this European premiere, Sarkar said that the film had a great opening in the American and English box-offices. The film was on the UK Top Ten films for four consecutive weeks. The film was chosen among 15 debut works for the 2006 Berlin Film Festival. It received enthusiastic reception from the audience as it ran to packed houses to the Chopra's surprise. Expecting an audience of about 100 Westerners, a critic visiting the festival was surprised to see the cinema hall full and people jostling for seats even on the steps. At the 24th Annual Minneapolis-St. Paul International Film Festival held in April 2006, Parineeta was the only Indian mainstream cinema to feature among 135 films from 40 countries. In 2006, the film featured in the Palm Springs International Film Festival, 24th San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival, Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles, Helsinki Film Festival and the International Film Festival of Marrakech. == Awards == Sarkar won the National Award for the Best First Film Director. Parineeta won five Filmfare Awards including Best Art Direction to Keshto Mondal, Tanushree Sarkar and Pradeep Sarkar, Best Choreography to Howard Rosemayer, Best Debut to Vidya Balan, RD Burman Award to Shantanu Moitra and Best Sound Recording to Bishwadeep Chatterjee. It was also nominated for an additional nine awards, for the categories Best Film and Best Director, three for actors portraying Lalita, Shekhar and Girish and four nominations for the soundtrack. == DVD == The first version of the DVD version of Parineeta was released by UTV Motion Pictures on 30 October 2006. It has subtitle options in English, Arabic, Spanish, German, Italian, Malay, and French. An additional disc includes interviews with the actors and a behind the scenes look at the making of the film. It is available in 16:9 Anamorphic widescreen, Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, progressive 24 FPS, widescreen and NTSC format. The film is also available on Netflix. == Soundtrack == The soundtrack to Parineeta was released by Tips Music in April 2005 to positive reviews.Shantanu Moitra composed the music and Lyrics were penned by Swanand Kirkire. ==See also== * Indira Gandhi Award for Best Debut Film of a Director ==References== == External links == * * Parineeta at Rediff.com * Parineeta at Bollywood Hungama Category:2000s Hindi-language films Category:2005 romantic drama films Category:2005 directorial debut films Category:2005 films Category:Best Debut Feature Film of a Director National Film Award winners Category:Films about women in India Category:Films based on Indian novels Category:Films based on works by Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay Category:Films featuring an item number Category:Films set in Darjeeling Category:Films set in Kolkata Category:Films shot in Darjeeling Category:Films shot in Kolkata Category:Indian films Category:Indian romantic drama films Category:Films directed by Pradeep Sarkar Category:2005 drama films ","title":"Parineeta (2005 film)"},{"id":"2586965","text":"Lake of Two Mountains (French: Lac des Deux Montagnes) is part of the river delta widening of the Ottawa River in Quebec, Canada, at its confluence with the St. Lawrence River.

The event of 11 January 1850 was very successful and attracted huge crowds. The North won for the first time by a majority of 233 shots.Murray, W. H. (1981), The Curling Companion. Pub. Richard Drew, Glasgow. . P. 98 - 101. The Loch has hosted the Scottish Rowing Championships and the Home International Regatta. ==Buildings== The ruins of the early mediaeval Peel Tower stand on the southern shore of the loch at Air Meadow, inaccessible except by boat. This tower was probably used as a fortified stronghold by the people of the area around the loch for defense against bandits and other dangers, as only the locals knew the safe paths through the marsh. The ruins of the small sixteenth-century Collegiate Church can be found on the northern shore along a well-maintained path. It was built in 1504 by John, Lord Sempill, in the grounds of the original (13th-century) Castle Semple, and is now in the care of Historic Scotland.Castle Semple Collegiate Church Although the house itself burnt down at the beginning of the 20th century, the grounds of Castle Semple on the loch's northern shore still contain the walls of the old walled garden as well as much of the surrounding wall and one of the gates.Millar, A H (1889) The castles and mansions of Renfrewshire and Buteshire: illustrated in sixty-five views with historical and descriptive accounts. unpaginated.NSA (1845), The new statistical account of Scotland by the ministers of the respective parishes under the superintendence of a committee of the society for the benefit of the sons and daughters of the clergy,15v, Edinburgh, Vol.7 (Renfrew), p 96Wham, Alasdair (2000).

Schulz. It originally aired on the CBS network on February 25, 1980, making it the first Peanuts special of the 1980s. It is also one of the few Peanuts animated specials to feature clear and intelligible adult voices. Since 2010, ABC has had the rights to air this wintry-themed special, which it pairs with Happy New Year, Charlie Brown!. ==Synopsis== Peppermint Patty, is practicing figure skating with her coach Snoopy for an upcoming competition, but the many days of getting up to practice at 4:30 A.M. are starting to take their toll, and she falls asleep constantly in class. One of her practices is halted briefly when a group of ten hockey players threatens her if she does not leave the ice so they can play. Patty and Snoopy take care of the situation by shoving the lead hockey players on each squad, causing both teams of hockey players to fall on top of each other like dominoes and be swept off the ice by Snoopy. Later that day after an afternoon practice, Marcie, who is observing, invites Patty over to her house for hot cocoa and cookies. Once there, Patty notices that Marcie has a sewing machine. Despite Marcie explaining that it is her mother's machine, and that she does not know how to sew, Patty commissions her to make a dress for the competition. With that settled, they head to a fabric store and buy the supplies. As expected, the dress does not come out good on Marcie's part, looking more like a sleeveless poncho, to which Marcie defends her mistake by reminding her that she told her she did not know how to sew and (2) the homespun outfit was Patty's idea, not hers. Patty heads back outside and almost tearfully shows Snoopy the mangled dress. He leads her back to Marcie's and, taking the dress from Patty, returns to the sewing machine and almost instantly sews the dress into a top-notch skating outfit. However, Snoopy is less helpful, when Patty complains that her hair is a \\"mousey blah\\" style. Snoopy brings in a large red gift box, and inside is a large red curly- haired wig that makes Patty look like Little Orphan Annie (possibly an inside joke in this special). After trying it on, Patty rolls her eyes and dumps the wig on Snoopy's head. The day of the competition has arrived. All the contestants are first practicing altogether, then they clear while Snoopy clears the ice. The first two contestants end up falling and get rather low scores. The third contestant does not fall, and gets such a good score that the pressure is on for Patty. Unfortunately, disaster seems to strike as her music tape goes haywire in the cassette deck. While Snoopy frantically tries to fix it and ends up in a fight with the machine on the ice, Patty is starting to sweat as she holds her opening pose longer than she expected, and all the rest of the characters in the audience worry that she will be disqualified. However, disaster is averted when Woodstock steps up to the microphone and whistles the music O mio babbino caro. Peppermint Patty receives the highest score, and has won the competition. She is shown on the stand with her trophy, while the runners-up stand below her with silver and bronze medals. On the way out, she is talking with Snoopy about her performance, and Snoopy is back as his grumbling, coaching self. She finally asks if he has anything nice to say, and she gets kissed on the cheek by him. Woodstock is shown bringing up the rear whistling the music again. == Figure skating animation == Although the plot line is implausible, the actual skating portrayed in the film is quite accurate for the time. Peppermint Patty is seen practicing compulsory figures and her free skating routine uses realistic figure skating jumps, spins, and choreography. The skating scenes were animated using the rotoscoping technique, using Schulz's own daughter (credited as Amy Schulz) as one of the models.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=npJVAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=EkANAAAAIBAJ&dq;=she's%20a%20good%20skate%20charlie%20brown&pg;=4829%2C1308487 \\"Skating studied for Peanuts gang\\", The Leader-Post, Feb 5 1982https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=npJVAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=EkANAAAAIBAJ&dq;=she's%20a%20good%20skate%20charlie%20brown&pg;=4829%2C1308487 Good grief! Figure skater traces her lines back to Peanuts gang\\", The Milwaukee Journal, Jan 16 1981 Some of the skating footage appears in the concluding animation associated with the credits. == Original strips == This program was written from a relatively long series of Peanuts comic strips originally published in 1974. The strip had other subplots that were left out of the special, and changes were made to the storyline by the time it went to the small screen. For instance: *In the strip, after the disaster with Patty's skating dress, Marcie's mother stepped in to make the alterations. It was Snoopy who altered the dress in the TV special. *After Patty gets her dress she wants to do something with her self-described \\"mousy-blah\\" hair, so she ultimately decides to go to Charlie Brown's dad's barber shop, but Charlie Brown forgot to tell his dad she was a girl (added to which Peppermint Patty told Charlie Brown's dad that she could strike him out in three pitches), so he gives her a boy's haircut, much to her despair. To cover up the mistake, Patty wears an afro wig several sizes too big. This scene is altered in the special, with the wig a gift from Snoopy and promptly refused. *Patty arrives at the competition and only at that point finds out that it is for roller skating, not ice skating, but not before she gets into trouble inadvertently damaging the rink floor with her skate blades. Patty returns from the competition realizing she still owes Snoopy for her lessons. Having no money, she gives him her wig as payment. ==Voice cast== * Patricia Patts - Peppermint Patty * Casey Carlson - Marcie * Bill Melendez - Snoopy * Arrin Skelley - Charlie Brown, rude hockey player captain * Debbie Muller - Teacher, shopkeeper * Scott Beach - Announcer * Daniel Anderson - Linus van Pelt * Laura Planting - Lucy van Pelt * Jason Victor Serinus - Woodstock (whistling) Schroeder, Linus van Pelt, and Lucy van Pelt appear, but they are silent.

The small farming community was founded in 1908 by Lt. Colonel Allen Allensworth, Professor William Payne, William Peck, a minister; John W. Palmer, a miner; and Harry A. Mitchell, a real estate agent, dedicated to improving the economic and social status of African Americans. Colonel Allensworth (1842–1914) had a friendship with Booker T. Washington and was inspired by the Tuskegee Institute and development in its neighboring town. Allensworth hoped to develop the \\"Tuskegee of the West\\". Uncontrollable circumstances, including a drop in the area's water table, resulted in the town's demise. Allensworth is now an unincorporated area in Tulare County. Colonel Allensworth State Historic Park is also an Amtrak conditional-flag-stop train station on the San Joaquin trains. ==History== ===Early history=== Lt. Colonel Allen Allensworth In 1908, United States Army veteran Lt. Colonel Allen Allensworth and Professor William Payne, Rev. William Peck and John W. Palmer, and Harry A. Mitchell sought to build a town where African Americans could own property, learn, and live the American Dream. They chose an Tulare County site for a new town near the present location of Earlimart, California, and about north of Bakersfield. The site was chosen for fertile soil, adequate water, and its location along a railroad corridor. Black men and women — craftsmen, artisans, businessmen, farmers, ranchers, retired military — moved their families to the newly purchased land. In 1914, the California Eagle newspaper stated that Allensworth deeded land was worth more than $112,000. The affairs of the town were administered by a council form of government known as the Allensworth Progressive Association, which directed the community through its formative and critical early years. Men and women held responsible positions in the community. Allensworth's economy depended on agriculture; farmers cultivated alfalfa, wheat, sugar beets, and cotton; and raised dairy cattle, chickens, turkeys, and Belgian hares. The town had several businesses and public buildings: bakery, drugstore, livery stable, barbershop, church, school, library, and a machine shop. Sources such as the Oakland Sunshine, a leading black Oakland, California newspaper in 1913, claimed that Allensworth generated nearly $5,000 monthly in its business ventures. In 1910 Joshua and Henrietta Singleton opened Singleton's General Store & Post Office. The store sold a variety of merchandise and served as a weigh station for wagons. The Allensworth Hotel was opened by Clara and John Morris; the hotel had eight guestrooms and charged 75 cents per night. ===Water problems=== In 1908 the southwest corner of Tulare County had abundant water from wells drilled into the then-shallow water table. The artesian wells and water mains laid throughout the residences during and since 1912 were controlled by Allensworth Rural Water Company, a state corporation. But water problems began developing in 1912 and by 1914 had become serious. The declining water tables throughout the area and increasing problems with alkali salts helped to doom the community. As the original settlers moved away, the land values declined, some of the houses were left empty, and others were rented or sold. By the 1950s Allensworth was an impoverished area without drinkable water supplies; its only water wells were contaminated with arsenic, and state health officials declared them unusable. When the state acquired the land for park purposes, state officials said land owners were paid \\"market value\\" but because these values were so low, the state also provided financial assistance to relocate the former owners. According to State Park Ranger Greg Kauffman, \\"only two or three families were unhappy with the move\\". And, he said, \\"the project itself has received strong support\\". ===Colonel Allensworth's death=== In 1919 Delilah L. Beasley wrote in her book The Negro Trail-Blazers of California: > \\"The death of Colonel Allensworth was most tragic, because after passing > through three wars, he was finally killed by a careless motorcyclist on the > streets of Monrovia, California, a few miles out from Los Angeles, the > accident occurring on a Sunday morning in September, 1914. The aged Colonel > was on his way to preach in a small church of the village and had just > stepped from a Pacific Electric street car when these men knocked him down > and ran over him, killing him through their careless driving, his death, > occurring within twenty-four hours afterwards without his regaining > consciousness, was like a thunderbolt from a clear sky to the people of the > State. He had spent the two years previous in dictating and assisting > Professor Charles Alexander to write his autobiography.\\" The book had been sent to the publishers and was ready to come off the press when he was killed. Widely loved and respected, Allensworth received a military funeral by the Grand Army of the Republic veterans of Los Angeles. Memorial services were held for him throughout the state and nation. He was interred at Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles on September 18, 1914. The Allensworth community was devastated. Although Professor William Payne and Oscar Overr assumed the leadership of the colony, no one could replace the Colonel. Without Allensworth's spiritual guidance and leadership, the community began to disintegrate. By 1920, the two leading figures, William Payne and the widow Josephine Allensworth, had left the area. Payne accepted a teaching job in El Centro, while Josephine Allensworth returned to Los Angeles to live with her daughter Nella. The exodus of residents continued during the years of the Great Depression and World War II. ===California State Historic Park=== In 1968 Cornelius \\"Ed\\" Pope, a former resident of Allensworth, worked in Sacramento as a draftsman and planner for the California Department of Parks and Recreation. With the help of a professor at California State University, Sacramento, he wrote a proposal to restore the Allensworth settlement as a state historical site. In 1972 \\"Allensworth Historic District\\" was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Finally, in 1974 then- Governor Ronald Reagan authorized the department to establish the park. Colonel Allensworth State Historic Park was established on in 1976. Ed Pope returned to the area in his retirement \\"to become a preservation activist on the scene.\\" The 100th anniversary of Allensworth was celebrated in October 2008. Events are held throughout the year to commemorate the park's history. The preserved townsite features nine restored buildings, including a schoolhouse, a hotel, a general store, and library and several homes. The park has a visitor center, and tours are available by making arrangements with the park in advance. The visitor center features a video presentation, \\"The Spirit of Allensworth.\\" Fifteen campsites, open all year, accommodate RVs or tents. Each site includes a picnic table and a camp stove; flush toilets are nearby. Facilities for disabled people are available. Turf, trees, and shade ramadas are other features. A nearby picnic area is shaded by 75 large trees, planted by the California Conservation Corps. The park is southwest of Earlimart on County Road J22, just west of the Central Valley Highway [SR-43].

The station has a platform only with no shelter. The station is served by Amtrak's San Joaquin service, which runs seven times daily between Bakersfield, California and either Oakland or Sacramento, California. It opened some time in or before 2001. Since special arrangements must be made prior to booking trips to and from the station, it does not appear on many of Amtrak's lists of (active) stations. The station is a conditional flag stop, meaning that the train will only stop if there are passengers ticketed to or from the station and that requires preapproval with reservations several weeks in advance for groups of not less than 20 persons. ==Terrain and environment== The terrain is typical of the southern San Joaquin Valley. Excepting the railroad roadbed, there is less than elevation difference across town. Like most of the valley, there has been some subsidence probably related to historic overpumping of ground water for irrigation. A generally warm, dry climate prevails in the Central Valley; it is hot in the summer, mild in the winter. In the Central Valley precipitation falls mainly from October through April. Winter temperatures well below freezing producing frost; however, snow is very rare. Summer temperatures above are part of the normal pattern. The valley was historically the site of vernal pools and seasonal lakes before 20th-century diversions of water and agriculture. A natural gas well field exists west of town. Burrowing owls, a species active in daylight hours, are sometimes present in the park. Just north of Allensworth is the Pixley National Wildlife Refuge, operated by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Adjacent to the town is the Allensworth Ecological Reserve. The endangered San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica) can be found in this area. In 2007 the State of California passed Assembly Bill 576, which established a dairy-free zone around the park. The bill was in response to two proposed dairies. Environmental activists protested that the operations were likely to have a potentially negative impact (dairy flies and odors) on the adjacent Pixley National Wildlife Refuge, Allensworth Ecological Reserve, and the historic park. ==Rare 1880s railroad boxcars== Two rare 19th-century railroad boxcars, which are believed to have been the residence of the station agent at Allensworth, have been restored by the California State Railroad Museum and are displayed at Colonel Allensworth State Historic Park. California State Parks contracted with the nonprofit museum in mid-2002 to conserve and restore the two railroad boxcar bodies associated with Allensworth. Wheels and axles had been removed after the turn of the 20th century; today the boxcars are today considered rare specimens of early railroad freight cars. For the project, one car was fully documented and received a museum-level conservation. One truckless rail car is on display lettered G.C. & S.F. #1332 (Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe). ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * Allensworth the Freedom Colony * Beasley, Delilah L..

However, after dwarf rabbits were developed, the popularity of the Dutch rabbit dwindled. Nevertheless, the Dutch rabbit remains one of the top ten most popular breeds worldwide. http://mom.me/pets/small-pets/19118-popular-pet-rabbit-breeds/item/dutch- rabbit/ \\"Although the name suggests that the Dutch rabbit is from the Netherlands, it was actually developed in England. During the 1830s rabbits were imported to England from Ostend in Belgium every week for the meat market. Amongst these rabbits was a breed known as the Petit Brabançon, as it originated from Brabant in Flanders. The Petit Brabançon may still be found in paintings from the fifteenth century. The Dutch rabbit has its genetic roots in this old breed. The Petit Brabançon would often display Dutch markings, and breeders in England selected those with even markings, fixing those markings into the breed we know today.\\" Dutch are popular both as pets and among show breeders. == Appearance == The American Rabbit Breeders Association standard calls for a small to medium rabbit. Dutch are a 4-class breed. Junior bucks and does are those under 6 months of age with a minimum weight of 1.75 lbs (0,793kg). Seniors are 6 months of age and over, weighing between 3.5 (1,58kg) and 5.5 lbs (2,48kg), with 4.5 (2,04kg) being the ideal weight. Dutch are to have a compact, well-rounded body; rounded head; short, stocky, well-furred ears; and short, glossy \\"flyback\\" fur. Six colors (in conjunction with white) are recognized for show: Black, a dense, glossy black with a slate blue undercolor. Eyes-- dark brown. Blue, a medium blue-gray with a slate blue undercolor. Eyes-- blue-gray. Chinchilla, (the newest variety to be recognized by the ARBA) an agouti color with bands of pearl white and black with a slate blue undercolor. The ears must have black lacing. Eyes-- brown (preferred). Chocolate, a rich chocolate brown with a dove-gray undercolor. Eyes-- brown (with a ruby cast). Gray, (UK: Brown Grey) an Agouti color similar to that of the American cottontail, with bands of color on the hairshaft which produce a ring effect when blown into. The bands of color should be a light tan, a thin charcoal band then a darker tan over a slate blue undercolor. Eyes--dark brown. Steel, (UK: Steel Grey) a black color with off-white tips to the hairshaft on some hairs. The undercolor is slate blue. Eyes-- dark brown. Tortoise, (UK: Tortoiseshell) a bright, clean orange with slate blue shadings along the ears, whisker beds and hindquarters. the undercolor is dark cream. Eyes-- dark brown. In the UK, Yellow (no US equivalent) and Pale Grey (US: Gold) Dutch are also recognized for show. New varieties under development in the United States include Harlequin (UK: Tri Coloured Dutch) (a pattern of black and orange patches) and Chinchilla. Despite its popularity, the Dutch rabbit has not changed much over the years. The most striking aspect of the breed is the marking pattern: The blaze is an even wedge of white running up the rabbit's face. It is shaped by the cheeks which are the rounded circles of color on either side of the face. The neck marking is a white wedge on the back of the head. The saddle is to be a straight line running behind the shoulders and continuing underneath the rabbit to the undercut across the belly. The stops are located on the rear feet, which should be white from the toes to a point one third the length of the foot. The American standard allots 50 of the 100 total points to markings, 25 points to general type, 10 points to color, 10 points to fur and 5 to condition.American Rabbit Breeders. extinct Association, Standard of Perfection 2006–2010 ==Personality== The Dutch Rabbit is in general a calm, easy-going rabbit.

Schulz. It was originally aired on the CBS network on May 16, 1983. It, along with 1982's A Charlie Brown Celebration, inspired the Saturday Morning series The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show. ==Format== The special is a compilation consisting of eight individual stories adapted from the stories in the comic strip: * Sack: Charlie Brown is having hallucinations as a result of a rash on the back of his head resembling the stitchings of a baseball, most notably seeing the rising sun as a baseball. After consulting with his doctor, he goes to camp in an attempt to get over his hallucinations. To hide his rash, he puts a paper bag over his head. Charlie Brown's fellow campers begin calling him \\"Sack\\" and elect him as camp president, constantly professing their respect and admiration for him. When he removes his sack the next morning, however, he becomes unpopular again. Charlie Brown watches the sun rise, fearing that it will appear as a rising baseball. Instead, the sun is replaced with MAD Magazine mascot Alfred E. Neuman. * Caddies: Peppermint Patty and Marcie become golf caddies. They are forced to deal with an obnoxious supervisor and a pair of female golfers whose bickering degenerates into violence. Fed up with their duties, they quit the job, but not before making $1. * Kite: Charlie Brown, sick of the Kite Eating Tree, bites it as retaliation for eating his kites. Shortly after, he receives a letter from the Environmental Protection Agency threatening action against him. To evade the EPA, Charlie Brown runs away from home. He wanders into a strange neighborhood and accepts a job offer to coach a younger baseball team, even though this requires that he sleep in a cardboard box at night. Charlie Brown gains the respect and admiration of his players despite their incompetence. He discovers that his new team's first game is against his old team. Charlie Brown's old teammates inform him that he can come home, as the Kite Eating Tree was blown over in a storm, thus clearing his name. * Song: Lucy comes to Schroeder's house, annoying him while he tries to play many pieces. * Sally: Sally tells jokes in class. (This story was added as part of The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show.) * Butterfly: Peppermint Patty falls asleep with a butterfly resting on her nose, and Marcie fools her into believing it turned into an angel. Peppermint Patty attempts to contact religious leaders to share her story but is unsuccessful. * Blanket: Lucy attempts to get rid of Linus's blanket twice: first by burying it and later by turning it into a kite and letting it go. When separated from his blanket, Linus has a panic attack and is desperate to find it. Thankfully, Snoopy goes to great lengths to get his blanket back for him both times. * Woodstock: Woodstock performs many of his antics in front of Snoopy, who is taking an afternoon nap. (This story was added as part of The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show.) ==Voice cast== * Michael Catalano as Charlie Brown * Angela Lee Sloan as Lucy van Pelt (Credited As Angela Lee) * Earl (Rocky) Reilly as Linus van Pelt * Cindi Reilly as Sally Brown * Brent Hauer as Peppermint Patty * Michael Dockery as Marcie * Brad Schacter as Schroeder * Brian Jackson as Camp Kids * Jason Castellano as Camp Kids * Gerard Goyette Jr. as Caddie Master * Jenny Lewis as Ruby * Johnny Graves as Austin * Joel Graves as Leland * Jason Mendelson as Milo * John Hiestand as Joe Mel * Bill Meléndez as Snoopy and Woodstock ==References== ==External links== * Category:Peanuts television specials Category:Television programs directed by Bill Melendez Category:1980s American television specials Category:CBS original programming Category:1983 television specials Category:1980s American animated films Category:American films Category:1983 in American television Category:CBS television specials Category:Summer camps in television Category:Television shows written by Charles M.

Schulz, who introduced the hour-long special. It was originally aired on the CBS network on May 24, 1982, and consists of a number of stories adapted from the comic strip. The special was released for the first time on DVD by Warner Home Video on October 4, 2016, as a bonus special to Charlie Brown's All-Stars. ==Production== The formula used in this special, several stories with one or two-word titles, was later adapted for the Saturday morning CBS series, The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show, which started in 1983, and used in another special, It's an Adventure, Charlie Brown. A compilation of short stories also make up You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown (both the stage musical and animated special), Snoopy!!! The Musical (both the stage musical and animated special), and Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales. Schulz first toyed with using vignettes in the 1973 special There's No Time for Love, Charlie Brown. There are a number of storylines in this special: *\\"School\\": Charlie Brown, Sally Brown, Lucy van Pelt, Linus van Pelt, and Schroeder are going to school. The others are going into third grade but Sally is going into first grade. *\\"Kite\\": Charlie Brown is flying a kite while Snoopy is resting, and Lucy and Linus are talking about Edgar Allan Poe. *\\"Charlie Brown's School Days\\": Charlie Brown, Linus, Sally, Peppermint Patty, and Franklin are going to school. *\\"Sally\\": Sally, Eudora, and Snoopy are at summer camp. Eudora teases Snoopy. *\\"Linus and Sally\\": Linus is reading his report on summer camp. Miss Othmar is horrified by references to queen snakes. Charlie Brown is worried because he studied the wrong chapter and Sally is refusing to draw a cow leg. *\\"Peppermint Patty\\": Peppermint Patty is having trouble in school and tries to find a private one to attend instead. Following Snoopy's advice, she goes to the Ace Obedience School and quickly graduates from it, not realizing that it is a dog school. The teacher and principal from Peppermint Patty's elementary school do not believe that she has already graduated. When the girl finds out what has happened, she ends up fighting the vicious cat next door, mistaking him for Snoopy. *\\"Linus\\": Linus and Sally are going on a field trip. Linus is reunited with Truffles. Sally and Truffles fight over Linus and he gets stuck on a farm roof. It is up to Snoopy and Woodstock to save him. *\\"Piano\\": Lucy annoys Schroeder while he is playing his piano. Lucy throws the piano down the sewer. Schroeder tries to get it back with Charlie Brown's help. *\\"Lucy\\": Lucy is very angry and feels she has nothing for which to be thankful. She wants Linus to get logs for the fireplace, playing jokes on him and talking about Abraham Lincoln while he fetches them. *\\"Peppermint Patty and Marcie\\": Marcie tries to make some baseball caps for Peppermint Patty's team. *\\"Charlie Brown\\": Charlie Brown gets sick and goes to the hospital. Sally takes the opportunity to move into his room but Peppermint Patty, Marcie and Lucy are worried about him. Lucy promises that, if Charlie Brown gets better, she will never pull the football away from him again. Linus tells Charlie Brown's mother about this. When Charlie Brown recovers, Lucy is forced to go through with her promise. However, Charlie Brown misses the ball and kicks Lucy's hand. ==Voice cast== * Michael Mandy - Charlie Brown * Kristen Fullerton - Lucy van Pelt * Earl Reily - Linus van Pelt * Cindi Reily - Sally Brown * Casey Carlson - Eudora/Truffles * Shannon Cohn - Marcie * Brent Hauer - Peppermint Patty * Christopher Donohoe - Schroeder/Franklin * Bill Melendez - Snoopy/Woodstock ==Production notes== Although Lucy taunts Charlie Brown to kick the football in this special, this is the first time she promises never to pull it away again. When Charlie Brown gets ill at a ball game, Lucy promises never to pull the ball away. She does not pull the ball away when Charlie Brown gets better, but he misses and kicks her arm, resulting in her arm being encased in a cast. Charlie Brown is mentioned as kicking it in the It's Magic, Charlie Brown special. It was the second (and last) episode for Kristen Fullerton as Lucy van Pelt, after when Sydney Penny voiced Lucy in It's Magic, Charlie Brown, Penny decided she would let Fullerton voice Lucy in this episode, she voiced Lucy in Life Is a Circus, Charlie Brown and A Charlie Brown Celebration, in the next special, Fullerton was replaced by Angela Lee. This is the first hour-long animated Peanuts special. ==Stock footage== Scenes from this special recycles footage and ideas from There's No Time for Love, Charlie Brown (1973) and Play It Again, Charlie Brown (1971). In The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show episode \\"Linus' Security Blanket\\" the footage scene where Charlie Brown and his kite get stuck in a tree is different but in You Can't Win, Charlie Brown the scene where Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy and Linus are caught up with his kite in Snoopy's doghouse is the same thing. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Peanuts television specials Category:Television programs directed by Bill Melendez Category:1980s American television specials Category:1982 television specials Category:1982 in American television Category:CBS television specials Category:CBS original programming Category:Summer camps in television Category:Television shows written by Charles M.

A common type of web fiction is the web serial. The term comes from old serial stories that were once published regularly in newspapers and magazines. Unlike most modern books, a work of web fiction is often not published as a whole. Instead, it is released on the Internet in installments or chapters as they are finished, although published compilations and anthologies are not unknown. The web serial form dominates in the category of fan fiction, as writing a serial takes less specialized software and often less time than an ebook. Web-based fiction dates to the earliest days of the World Wide Web, including the extremely popular The Spot (1995–1997), a tale told through characters' journal entries and interactivity with its audience.Sideroad Magazine (July 1998), \\"Webisodics, Part 1\\" The Spot spawned many similar sites, including Ferndale and East Village, though these were not as successful and did not last long.Forbes Magazine (September 12, 1997), \\"Why Cybersoaps Don't Clean Up\\" Most of these early ventures are no longer in existence. Since 2008, web fiction has proliferated in popularity. Possibly as a result of this, more fans of web serials have decided to create their own, propagating the form further, leading to the number of serious, original works growing quickly. Some serials utilize the formats of the media to include things not possible in ordinary books, such as clickable maps, pop-up character bios, sorting posts by tag, illustrations, and video. Supplementary information is often available on the serial's website, sometimes in the form of wikis that fans of the work help maintain. Web fiction has become hugely popular in China, with revenues topping US$2.5 billion. ==Publication formats== Some web serials are produced on content management systems such as Drupal, WordPress, or Joomla, which may integrate blogs directly into the site and also have many custom add-ons (such as for integrating social networking services such as Twitter or Facebook). LiveJournal is also a popular platform for web serials due to its large userbase and integrated communities. Some web serials are published on Livejournal directly, whereas some have LiveJournal communities for reader discussion and feedback. A distribution tool integrated into almost all media is the RSS feed, so that subscribers can get updates on the latest chapters or episodes via an RSS reader or other media. Another format in use is the internet forum. A free forum service such as ProBoards or Ezboard may be used to create a board for a web serial, or the web serial may be a feature of a larger board in order to benefit from its traffic. Forums can also be integrated into a web serial's main site to increase community interaction. Some web serials have been told entirely on Twitter or have used it as a way of adding depth to the universe. Character Twitter accounts are a very popular example of this. Twitter is also a useful tool for author-fan interaction and update announcements. There are a variety of Twitter hashtags now in use for the web serial community. Facebook integration is also popular, with Facebook fanpages for web serials or web serial authors as well as character accounts. Blog fiction is a form of fiction writing that uses blogs to reach its readership. It is a small-scale fringe activity in the world of blogging, and although it has generated some literary critical interest, it remains isolated. It is presented in many forms, from a pretend diary or posted novel to a serialblog. ==Business== Web serials are cheaper to run than webcomics for the most part, although the returns are not much better, if at all. Most authors must pay for the costs out of their own pockets, though the significantly lower bandwidth strain of text instead of pictures may help lower the expenses. Hosting and advertisement costs are still just as much a concern for non-organized web serial authors as webcomic artists. The advent of free blogging platforms such as the WordPress free host and Blogger have freed some serial writers from financial concerns, as well as any requirement for technical knowledge. However, these free hosts provide less flexibility and also may not be as scalable as a pay host. Many writers use platforms specifically created for hosting fiction. Donations are a common way of getting money for web serials, often using services such as PayPal, but one of the main means of monetizing Web serials is advertising on blogs, which can allow writers to both host banners or purchase them on other sites and blogs. This can allow authors to recoup many of the costs associated with online novel creation. These are sometimes sufficient to cover the basic costs for hosting, and some of the more popular web serials can succeed with their entire budget made from donations or revenue of this type. A few web serial authors have taken to collecting their work and releasing in a book format for easy consumption offline. Self-publishing is key in this field, and services such as CafePress and Lulu.com are often used for distribution and sales of these anthologies. The advent and acceptance of the ebook has allowed writers to become quite prolific with \\"bound collections\\" offered as downloads in formats such as pdf, Smashwords, and Mobipocket. On-demand merchandising sites like CafePress and Zazzle are also sources of income from sales of T-shirts, mugs, calendars, mousepads and other fan items. Some publishers have started using serials on their sites as \\"eye bait\\" and proving grounds for novels, Tor Books. Similarly, writers with established series have been able to continue writing those series after being dropped by conventional publishers, as Lawrence Watt-Evans has done with his Ethshar novels. ==Types== ===Web novel=== A web novel or webnovel is a novel published online. Web novels exist in both free-to-read and pay-to-read formats. Many free-to-read novels are indexed at sites such as Webfiction Guide or Muses Success. ===Web serial=== Most web novels are written as serials. Serialized novels have a long history, predating the internet by centuries. ===Fan fiction=== Fan fiction popularized the publishing of writing on the internet and set the standards for much of the community interaction surrounding web serials. Many fanfiction works have been published in multi-part works of epic length which prepared internet- based reading audiences for the easy digestion of serialized original works. Also, some web serial authors (and many authors in general) made their start in fanfiction before setting out for original work. Therefore, the readerships for fanfiction and web serials intersect quite a bit, and some fandom language and memes are shared by the web serial community. Most web serials tend towards regular publication schedules, however, whereas the bulk of fanfiction is published at the author's convenience. In fanfiction there is less obligation to finish or continue stories. Many fan fiction archives (such as the popular Fanfiction.net archive) are set up to accommodate and encourage the publication of serial works. Fanfiction.net has a sister site, Fiction Press, for original work. ===Interactive novel=== Authors of traditional paper-and-ink novels have sometimes tried to give readers an interactive experience, but this approach didn't become completely feasible until the development of digital media and hypertext. Traditional novels are linear, that is, read from page to page in a straight line. Interactive novels, however, offer readers a unique way to read fiction by choosing a page, a character, or a direction. By following hyperlinked phrases within the novel, readers can find new ways to understand characters. There is no wrong way to read a hypertext interactive novel. Links embedded within the pages are meant to be taken at a reader's discretion - to allow the reader a choice in the novel's world. Panel of 2004 webcomic Town Called Dobson. ===Webcomic=== Webcomics, online comics, or Internet comics are comics published on a website. While most are published exclusively on the web, some are also published in magazines, newspapers, or often self-published books. Webcomics can be compared to self-published print comics in that almost anyone can create their own webcomic and publish it. As of January 2007, the four largest webcomic hosting services hosted over 18,000 webcomics, ranging from traditional comic strips to graphic novels and covering many genres and subjects. Few are financially successful. ==See also== *Blook *Cell phone novel *ebook *Interactive fiction *Online book ==References== ","title":"Web fiction"},{"id":"2587175","text":"Happy Birthday, Charlie Brown is a prime-time animated TV special based upon the comic strip Peanuts, by Charles M.

The piece remains in storage, as the artwork was site-specific, and the artist does not want it displayed in any other location.

Its trendiness was already apparent in the 1960s. ==Buildings== As of 2006, the following buildings can be found on the street (this list is not definitive): ;North side (east to west) *Taylor's Delicatessen (previously Lloyds Pharmacy (with Post Office; closed January 2009) *Carluccio's restaurant - closed January 2020 (previously Strada Italian restaurant, and before that Porter's, and numerous previous incarnations) *Richards' Group hairdresser's; *Elham's Lebanese Deli - closed 2018 (previously Martin's newsagent); *Oddbins wine merchants; *Duke of Cambridge cocktail bar; *Al-Andalus Tapas Bar; *Pierre Victoire Restaurant; *Café Rouge Restaurant; *Margery Fry & Elizabeth Nuffield House, part of the graduate-student accommodation of Somerville College; *Uense (previously Demijohn – The Liquid Deli \\\\- closed 2018; and Sylvester's Art and Gifts - closed 2013); *Gail's Bakery (previously Mumu Cafe and Oxford City Barbers - both closed down 2016) *Sushi bar *Popham Hairdressing (previously Walton and Giles hairdresser, closed 2017) *Natural Bread Company (baker's and café) *Uncle Sam's Vintage American Clothing store (still present, but closed 2014); *Hobbs Clothing Store; *Inspires Art and Prints shop (closed); *Lacy's hair salon; *Posh Frocks clothing store; *Juice sandwich shop; *Oxford Wine Cafe (on corner with Walton Street).

Along its south side the most prominent building is the 1960s University Central Offices, which in the minds of many people is an eyesore that damaged the character of the otherwise stately Wellington Square. The Porters Bar & Restaurant, formerly at 1–2 Little Clarendon Street, but frequently changing hands, and now occupied by Carluccio's, appeared in the BBC television programme The Restaurant. On the wall of Taylor's Delicatessen on the south- side of Little Clarendon Street, a miniature model door and window have been installed by Cambridge-based art project Dinky Doors. ==See also== * Great Clarendon Street, in the nearby Jericho district ==References== ==External links== * Little Clarendon Street Online * Dinky Doors - apparent creators of the Little Clarendon Street miniature door Category:Streets in Oxford Category:Shopping streets in Oxford Category:Restaurant districts and streets in England Category:Somerville College, Oxford ","title":"Little Clarendon Street"},{"id":"2587208","text":"\\"He Never Said a Mumblin' Word\\" (also known as \\"They Hung Him on a Cross\\", \\"Mumblin' Word\\", \\"Crucifixion\\", and \\"Easter\\") is an American spiritual folk song. The song narrates the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, detailing how he was nailed to the cross, \\"whooped up the hill\\", speared in the side, hung his head and died, all the while keeping a dignified silence. Like all traditional music, the lyrics vary from version to version, but maintain the same story. ==Origins== The songs' writers and origins are unknown. Notes accompanying American Ballads and Folk Songs, an anthology of songs collected by John Lomax and Alan Lomax during the 1930s and 1940s, mention that the song as known throughout Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Tennessee, and was titled \\"Never Said a Mumbalin' Word.\\" It is known to be a companion piece to, and possibly has the same writer(s) as, \\"Were You There\\", another spiritual. ==Recorded versions== * Unidentified prisoners – John and Alan Lomax recorded a performance by a group of unidentified prisoners in June 1933 at the Angola Prison Farm, Louisiana, and in July 1933 at the Parchman Farm penitentiary, Mississippi. *Roland Hayes – recorded the song for Victor Records in 1927. A Song Recital (Columbia Masterworks M-393, 1939) includes an unaccompanied piece in a set of mostly of selected classical selections. Hayes published his arrangement of the song as part of the song cycle Life of Christ, and recorded it again in 1953 and other times. Later performers also often credit his arrangement. *Golden Gate Quartet – recorded a rendition in 1941 for Okeh Records. *J. Rosamond Johnson – recorded it in 1944. *Lead Belly – the Lomaxes recorded the song while on a visit to Camp C at Louisiana State Penetentiary in the 1933, where they also discovered Lead Belly, who recorded several versions of the song from 1945 onwards. According to Lead Belly, the song originated from \\"down south\\" and claimed to have learned it from his mother, Sallie Brown.Ledbetter, Huddie. (1948). \\"Listen to this, this is a spiritual to tell the story about Christ. Which I guess makes me happy, but you don't know that it comes from down south. Got it from my mother, my shouting mother.\\" Extract of a transcription from Lead Belly's Last Sessions, released on Smithsonian Folkways, SF-400-69. Lead Belly recorded at least three versions of the song. The earliest was on February 15, 1945, as part of the Standard Oil Company-sponsored radio show Let it Shine on Me in San Francisco. It was recorded as the final part of medley along with two other spiritual songs, \\"Every Time I Feel the Spirit\\" and \\"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\\", featuring children singing along. The song was recorded under the title \\"They Hung Him on a Cross\\", whereas his final two recordings of the song, recorded during his last recording sessions ranging from September 27, 1948 to November 5, 1948 in New York with producer Frederic Ramsey, Jr., list the song as \\"He Never Said a Mumblin' Word.\\" An a cappella version of the song and a solo acoustic version of the song were recorded and are featured on Smithsonian Folkways 1994 box set Lead Belly's Last Sessions. *Morton Gould – adapted it for string orchestra in his 1959 composition Spirituals for Strings. It was recorded in 1963 by Morton Gould and his Orchestra. *The Jury – Members of American alternative rock bands Nirvana and the Screaming Trees formed a side project known as the Jury in 1989, featuring Kurt Cobain on vocals and guitar, Mark Lanegan on vocals, Krist Novoselic on bass and Mark Pickerel on drums. Over two days of recording sessions, on August 20 and 28, 1989, the band recorded four songs also performed by Lead Belly; \\"Where Did You Sleep Last Night?\\", an instrumental version of \\"Grey Goose\\", \\"Ain't It a Shame\\" and \\"They Hung Him on a Cross\\"; the latter of which featured Cobain solo. Cobain was inspired to record the songs after receiving a copy of Lead Belly's Last Sessions' from friend Slim Moon, after which hearing it he \\"felt a connection to Leadbelly's almost physical expressions of longing and desire.\\" *Roger McGuinn – Byrds founder Roger McGuinn recorded two versions of the song. In 1996, he made an mp3 quality recording available for free via his Folk Den website. On the website, McGuinn uses the title \\"Easter\\" (from the opening line \\"On Easter morn he rose\\"). On the 1999 compact disc McGuinn's Folk Den Vol. 2., McGuinn released this same recording under the longer title \\"Easter Morn\\". In 2005, McGuinn released a more professional quality recording of the song, again with the title \\"Easter Morn\\", as part of his four-disc set \\"The Folk Den Project.\\" *The Welcome Wagon – a version appears on the 2008 album Welcome to The Welcome Wagon. ==References== ==External links== *Information file on lyrics variation, bibliography and early recordings *LiveNIRVANA Sessions Guide to The Jury – a comprehensive guide to The Jury's recording session for the song Category:American folk songs Category:Lead Belly songs Category:Nirvana (band) songs Category:Gospel songs Category:Songs about Jesus Category:Okeh Records singles ","title":"He Never Said a Mumblin' Word"},{"id":"2587218","text":"Shawn Carpenter is an American Navy veteran and whistleblower (previously employed by Sandia National Laboratories) who tracked down a Chinese cyberespionage ring that is code-named Titan Rain by the FBI. He came to national attention when his story was reported on in the September 5, 2005 issue of Time magazine. Carpenter was an employee of Sandia National Laboratories, investigating security breaches in its networks. However, upon tracking several breaches of Sandia, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Redstone Arsenal, and even NASA, dating back to 2003, Carpenter noticed patterns that began to appear to link the attacks to a single group. He was impressed by the meticulous, voracious and incredibly fast manner (sometimes completed in less than 30 minutes) in which the hackers operated. Such observations led him to alert the federal government of his findings. The Titan Rain hacking operation was first reported in an August 25, 2005 Washington Post article by Bradley Graham, which didn't mention Carpenter. Graham listed anonymous governmental officials as his sources. After informing his supervisors of the breaches, he was told that his only concern should be Sandia computers, and to drop the issue. His employment was later terminated when Carpenter disobeyed his management and communicated the information about the security breaches first to United States Army Cyber Counterintelligence Special Agents, who verified his information and later brought in the FBI. The FBI requested a Senior DAC Counterintelligence agent known in the counterintelligence community by the nickname \\"Doc\\" to handle Carpenter and lead the operation on behalf of the FBI. Carpenter was a confidential informant for the FBI for almost half a year before Sandia discovered his actions. Carpenter reportedly felt betrayed by the termination, as he viewed his actions were a service to his country, similar to that of his previous military service. According to Carpenter, during his termination hearing at Sandia, Bruce Held, Sandia's chief of counterintelligence, yelled \\"[you're] lucky you have such understanding management... if you worked for me, I would decapitate you! There would at least be blood all over the office!\\" Q&A;: Reverse hacker describes ordeal (Computerworld) During the subsequent court case, Held testified that he did use the word \\"decapitate\\" and, while he did not recall using the word \\"blood,\\" would not contest it. He also apologized. Carpenter sued Sandia National Laboratories for wrongful termination and defamation; a jury awarded him almost $4.7 million in compensatory and punitive damages on February 13, 2007. The jury more than doubled the punitive damages requested by Carpenter's attorneys Thad Guyer, Stephani Ayers and Philip Davis. The 13-person New Mexico state district court jury determined that Sandia's handling of Shawn Carpenter's termination was \\"malicious, willful, reckless, wanton, fraudulent or in bad faith.\\" Juror Ed Dzienis said that, \\"If they (Sandia) have an interest in protecting us, they certainly didn't show it with the way they handled Shawn.\\" Ms. Alex Scott, the jury forewoman, said jurors were upset by the lack of documentation of the process and by the \\"reckless behavior on the part of Sandia to not have adequate policies in place for employees about hacking, and the cavalier attitude about national security and global security.\\" Carpenter's wife, Dr. Jennifer Jacobs, testified at the trial. Dr. Jacobs, a former Sandia scientist, nuclear engineer, West Point graduate, and Army Reserve Major, said Sandia management questioned her loyalty to the company after her husband was fired. Dr. Jacobs left Sandia and was later appointed as a White House Fellow, and was a director at the United States National Security Council. In an interview with the Albuquerque Journal, Dr. Jacobs stated, \\"The point for us all along was this is bad for the country to have contractors like Sandia Corporation behaving this way -- with impunity. And if other citizens don't do this, it's the beginning of the end for our country. That's what we kept coming back to: This is what we have to do, because it's what we expect of others.\\" Sandia Corporation, the private entity that manages Sandia National Laboratories on behalf of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Department of Energy and Federal Government of the United States, was a wholly owned subsidiary of the for-profit Lockheed Martin Corporation. In an ironic twist, Carpenter testified at trial that he found hundreds of pages of detailed schematics and other sensitive documents labeled, \\"Lockheed Martin Proprietary Information\\" and \\"Export Controlled\\" regarding the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter stashed on a foreign server in South Korea. He was helping the FBI investigate the stolen Lockheed Martin information along with hundreds of other network breaches at military and United States defense contractors when Sandia officials fired him. , Carpenter is employed at NetWitness Corporation, a startup headed by Amit Yoran, former director of the National Cyber Security Division within the United States Department of Homeland Security. In March 2007, Sandia National Laboratories retained three additional attorneys at the international corporate defense firm of Baker Botts. In post-trial motions, Sandia attorneys unsuccessfully argued to throw out the jury verdict, to reduce the judgment to zero, and for a new trial. Carpenter's attorneys successfully argued a motion for post- judgment interest and Sandia was ordered to pay an interest rate of 15% per year on the final judgment of $4,742,146.66 (plus attorney fees) during the appeals process. In April 2007, Sandia attorneys filed a motion to appeal the jury verdict. Sandia National Laboratories posted a $5.8 million supersedeas bond to prevent Carpenter from seizing Sandia assets during the appeals process. Interest in the amount of almost $60,000 a month accumulates while Sandia pursues their appeals. According to news reports, Sandia plans to appeal to the New Mexico Supreme Court, if necessary, which could take years. On October 14, 2007, The Albuquerque Journal published a story (\\"Analyst, Sandia Settle Suit\\") that stated that Sandia had dropped its appeal of the verdict.Analyst, Sandia Settle Suit (Albuquerque Journal) According to the story, the judgment had been accumulating 15 percent interest since the verdict in his favor in February 2007. The piece also related that Carpenter continues to work in the national security area for clients in the intelligence community, federal agencies and the military. ==See also== *Timeline of Cox Report controversy *Cyber-warfare *National Security Whistleblowers Coalition ==References== ==External links== *ABC News (February 19, 2013) article \\"Report Fingers Chinese Military Unit in US Hack Attacks\\" * TIME Magazine (September 5, 2005 issue) article \\"The Invasion Of The Chinese Cyberspies (And the Man Who Tried to Stop Them)\\" * TIME Magazine online (August 25, 2005) article \\"Inside the Chinese Hack Attack\\" *Albuquerque Journal (September 15, 2005) \\"Battle Against Hackers Costs Employee Job\\" *Albuquerque Journal (February 14, 2007) article \\"Sandia Hacker Gets $4 Million: Analyst Fired For FBI Contact\\" *Computerworld (February 26, 2007) article \\"Q&A;: Reverse Hacker Describes Ordeal\\" *The New York Times (December 9, 2007) article \\"China Link Suspected in Lab Hacking\\" *SecurityFocus (December 10, 2007) article \\"National Labs Hit With Targeted Attacks\\" *ABC News (February 26, 2007) report \\"Jury Slaps Defense Giant for Neglecting National Security\\" *TIME Magazine online (February 14, 2007) article \\"A Security Analyst Wins Big in Court\\" *Congressional correspondence: Management cover-ups and malfeasance at Sandia (December 4, 2005) blog \\"LANL: The Real Story\\" *The Register (February 16, 2007) article \\"Employee Fired For Probing Bad Guys Awarded $4.7M\\" *Project on Government Oversight (POGO) (March 1, 2007) article \\"Cyber-security at Risk\\" *Los Angeles Times (March 4, 2008) article \\"China's Computer Hacking Worries Pentagon\\" *Computerworld (April 17, 2007) article \\"Reverse Hacker Case Gets Costlier for Sandia Labs\\" *Computerworld (October 20, 2005) article \\"Guard Against Titan Rain Hackers\\" * Searchsecurity.com (September 22, 2005) article \\"The Case of Shawn Carpenter: A Cautionary Tale\\" *The Washington Times (July 26, 2007) article \\"FBI Calls Chinese Espionage 'Substantial'\\" *New Mexico State Judiciary Case Lookup System database \\"Carpenter vs. Sandia\\" Category:Computer security specialists Category:American computer scientists Category:American whistleblowers Category:Nuclear program of the People's Republic of China Category:Living people Category:1968 births Category:United States Navy personnel Category:Sandia National Laboratories people ","title":"Shawn Carpenter"},{"id":"2587221","text":"The Anthony Burgess Center of the University of Angers, France, exists to honor the memory of the 20th-century English novelist Anthony Burgess.

Schulz. It was originally aired on the CBS network on February 21, 1983. In the special, Charlie Brown tries to cope with learning that Linus and Lucy are moving away. ==Plot== This special begins when Linus calls the Brown house, and Sally picks up. She gets very excited that her Sweet Babboo is on the other line. He declines that he is that, and tries to ask if Charlie Brown is home, but while he is doing so, she asks if he called to ask her to a movie. He gets furious, and yells at her, saying, he won't be taking her to a movie, and wants to talk to her brother. She misinterprets that, and tells him she will be waiting outside for him to pick her up. She gives the phone to Charlie Brown. Linus tells Charlie Brown he has something important to tell him and that he will be over right away. When he arrives, he tells Charlie Brown they will have to move, due to his father's job transfer. He is shocked to hear this. Lucy then goes to Schroeder to tell him the same thing Linus told Charlie Brown, and gives him a picture of her so he will always remember her. He says \\"But what if I want to forget you, and turn it around?\\" She does this, and Schroeder panics that it is double-sided. Charlie Brown then sadly watches the \\"Sam's Moving\\" movers take the Van Pelts' things, and load it into their trucks. He then goes to Lucy's psychiatry booth, and tells her he will be miserable without Linus. She yells at him, and reminds him that she is also leaving. She shows him the booth's new owner Snoopy, who has changed its cost on the sign from 5 cents to 50 cents (presumably more than Charlie Brown's allowance). Linus tells Charlie Brown that he is playing his last baseball game with him later on. Lucy then walks over to the Brown house, and finds Sally waiting out in front, saying she is waiting for Linus to take her to the movie. Lucy tells her that they are moving, so he won't pick her up, but she doesn't believe this. Linus then invites Charlie Brown to his and Lucy's going away party. He asks Sally if she wants to come, but she insists that Linus is going to pick her up and take her to a movie. The van Pelts' going away party is catered by Snoopy, who feeds everyone dog biscuits, and dog food with water causing everyone to leave disgusted. The next day, Linus and Lucy say their sad goodbyes to Charlie Brown. As they are pulling out, Linus throws Snoopy his security blanket, as a way to remember him. After the van Pelts leave, Charlie Brown sadly walks home. When Charlie Brown gets home, Sally is sitting on the porch, still waiting for Linus to take her to a movie. Charlie Brown tells her that he and his family moved away. She angrily walks inside. Then, Schroeder comes by to ask where Lucy is, and Charlie Brown tells him that she and her family moved away. He says that he thought she was kidding, then grows upset and says, \\"I never got to say goodbye.\\" In a later scene, Schroeder is playing the piano with the musical staff above him, and her head appears between the treble and bass staff. When he notices, he stops playing and says to us: \\"Don't tell me I've grown accustomed to that face.\\" The next day, Charlie Brown tells Peppermint Patty, that he is upset over Linus' moving away. She tells Marcie that they have to help him get over his sadness. Marcie asks her if she likes him, and she naturally declines it. She walks home trying to convince herself that she couldn't like a loser like him. That night while Patty is trying to sleep, she thinks Charlie Brown is probably feeling bad for himself, and decides to call him to make him feel better. When she calls him, Charlie Brown is so tired that he doesn't seem to be listening to what Peppermint Patty is saying. She invites him on a date to the movies, but makes it seem as if Charlie Brown is asking her instead. She says she would go with him to a movie, then hangs up, and goes to sleep feeling good about herself. Charlie Brown then suddenly wakes up and wonders what he was doing by the phone, thinking he just dreamt he was talking to Peppermint Patty. The next day, Peppermint Patty is waiting for Charlie Brown to pick her up for their date. Marcie goes to him at the wall, and asks why he looks so tired. He tells her that for some strange reason, he woke up at midnight by the phone, after dreaming he spoke to Peppermint Patty. She realizes what is happening, and tells Peppermint Patty that he's not coming. She doesn't believe her and continues to wait. Later that day, Peppermint Patty calls Charlie Brown because she is angry that he didn't show up for their date. She continues to bother him, but says she won't take revenge on him, and when they hang up, he says, \\"I never know what's going on.\\" Sally expects a phone call from Linus, and Charlie Brown reminds her that Linus moved, and that even if he was still here, he wouldn't be calling her. Charlie Brown then shows her a postcard from him which only reads about her: \\"Have you seen any good movies lately?\\" Charlie Brown notices moving trucks in front of the van Pelt house again. He looks to see what is going on, and he is excited to find Linus. He tells him his father didn't like his new job and they are moving back. Just then, Lucy gets out of the car and says, \\"What kind of a neighborhood is this? It didn't change a bit while we were gone,\\" to which Linus says, \\"Oh yeah. She's back too,\\" before Snoopy throws Linus his security blanket back ending the film. ==Voice actors== * Brad Kesten - Charlie Brown * Jeremy Schoenberg - Linus van Pelt * Angela Lee Sloan - Lucy van Pelt (Credited As Angela Lee) * Stacy Heather Tolkin - Sally Brown * Bill Melendez - Snoopy and Woodstock * Kevin Brando - Schroeder and Franklin * Victoria Vargas - Peppermint Patty * Michael Dockery - Marcie Patty, Roy, Pig-Pen, Violet, and Shermy have silent roles. ==Home media== This was released for the first time on DVD alongside Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales as a CVS Pharmacy Exclusive offer on November 3, 2009 and then solicited to the wider market in 2010.

It was produced by Fred Quimby and directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. The short is a spoof of Alexandre Dumas' 1844 novel The Three Musketeers and its film adaptations, featuring mice Jerry and Nibbles as \\"Mouseketeers\\" trying to raid the French king's banquet table, which is protected by Tom as a guard. The cartoon was animated by Ed Barge, Kenneth Muse and Irven Spence. Musical supervision was done by Scott Bradley, using a version of the theme music by Nelson Eddy and the Sportsmen Quartet named \\"Soldier of Fortune\\", from the movie The Girl of the Golden West. The character of Nibbles speaks French in this short and was voiced by six-year-old Francoise Brun-Cottan. The Two Mouseketeers won the series' sixth Oscar for Best Animated Short Film. Such was the cartoon's success, that Hanna and Barbera created a total of four adventures in the Mouseketeers series; the second, 1954's Touché, Pussy Cat! received an Oscar nomination. The success of the short led to three more Mouseketeers shorts: Touché, Pussycat! (1954), Tom and Chérie (1955) and Royal Cat Nap (1958). The premise was also featured in comic books from Dell Comics. ==Plot== Mouseketeers Jerry and Nibbles decide to help themselves to a lavish royal banquet. Tom, in the service of the cardinal, has been ordered to guard the spread from the King's Mouseketeers with his life, under threat of execution by guillotine. Jerry and Nibbles enter the castle hall through a stained-glass window. Jerry releases the rear-end cover on a suit of armor, making a small drawbridge to the windowsill; they sneak into the armor, emerge from the helmet's visor and then parachute onto the table. Jerry lands first, followed by Nibbles who landed on a roasted warthog's mouth, forcing Nibbles to be stuck. Jerry took Nibbles off the warthog, making the pig's mouth to close. Afterwards, Nibbles went inside a big block of cheese, pretending it is a tower with only a few floors. Nibbles shows Jerry that he is on the top-floor but loses his balance as he falls off to an unopened banana. The banana opens and shoots into Jerry's mouth in a few centimeters distance to the back, making Jerry's body a shape of the banana itself. They unwittingly catch Tom's attention by showering him with champagne after trying to open the cork with the roasted pig's tail. After hiding from Tom by wearing white paper decorations from the standing rib roast to look like two ribs, Jerry runs off, but little Nibbles begins making a ham sandwich while singing \\"Alouette\\" to himself. Tom emerges behind him and pokes him with his sword, and the angry Nibbles yells in protest: \\"He, attention-la! Vous pourriez faire mal a quelqu'un, Monsieur Pussycat!...Pussycat?! Au secours! Au secours! Le pussycat! Le pussycat! Sauve moi de le pussycat!\\" (Hey, watch it! You could hurt someone like that, Mister Pussycat!...Pussycat!? Help! Help! The pussycat! The pussycat! Save me from the pussycat!). But before he can get away, Tom captures him by putting his rapier through Nibbles' tabard. Failing to escape, Nibble wishes hello to Tom (saying, \\"Bonjour, Monsieur Pussycat\\"). Jerry manages to stab Tom in the rear-end to rescue Nibbles, and throws a custard in Tom's face for good measure. This launches a swashbuckling fencing display against Tom, ending in Tom catching Jerry. Nibbles tips a halberd toward Tom and it shaves the tabard and all the fur off Tom's back from head to hind end (revealing ruffled white underwear), while Nibbles hides in some fruit. Nibbles runs away, but is sent flying by Tom into a full wine glass – but Jerry saves him by hurling a tomato at Tom, followed by multiple vegetables and meat chunks. After impaling them all on his rapier, Tom then heats and eats them like a shish kebab. Nibbles, now drunk, climbs out of the glass. He pokes Tom in the rear-end, making him yowl and jump up, as Nibbles waves his sword, saying \\"Touché, pussycat!\\" But as he runs away, Tom catches him. Jerry makes the save by hitting Tom on the head with a mace so hard that Tom falls through the table, which leads into Tom and Jerry resuming their sword fighting. While this goes on, Nibbles brings along a cannon and stuffs it with everything on the banquet table. Just as Tom catches Jerry, Nibbles lights the cannon and it violently explodes. As the smoke disappears, Jerry and Nibbles are seen walking triumphantly down the street with stolen banquet food. Suddenly, they look up and see a guillotine in the distance, and with a drumroll the blade comes down, strongly suggesting that Tom was executed (although off-screen in order to comply with the Hays Code). Both mice gulp, and then Nibbles sighs \\"Pauvre, pauvre pussycat!\\" (\\"Poor, poor pussycat!\\"). Then he shrugs, saying \\"C'est la guerre!\\" (\\"Such is war!\\"). With that, the two Mouseketeers continue their victory marching off into the night. ==Production== *Directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera *Animation: Ed Barge, Kenneth Muse, Irven Spence *Music: Scott Bradley *Produced by Fred Quimby ==Availability== VHS * Quest for Camelot DVD * Tom and Jerry's Greatest Chases, Vol. 3 * Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection Vol. 1, Disc Two ==ReferencesCategory:1952 films Category:1952 animated films Category:1952 short films Category:1950s American animated films Category:American films Category:1950s animated short films Category:1952 comedy films Category:American animated short films Category:Best Animated Short Academy Award winners Category:Films based on The Three Musketeers Category:Short films directed by Joseph Barbera Category:Short films directed by William Hanna Category:Tom and Jerry short films Category:Films scored by Scott Bradley Category:Films set in France Category:English-language films Category:French-language films Category:Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer short films Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer animated short films ","title":"The Two Mouseketeers"},{"id":"2587313","text":"Wolfgang W.E. Samuel (born February 2, 1935) is a German-born American author and a veteran of the United States Air Force. ==Early years== Born in what is now Poland, ten-year-old Samuel, along with his mother and sister, ran from his home town of Sagan (now Żagań in Poland) in 1945 as the Red Army approached. As a Flüchtling (refugee), he underwent privation and re- settlement in the post-war years. His mother was raped repeatedly, and his grandfather was killed by German communists. He describes how he and his mother eventually settled near a U.S. airbase in western Germany, where his mother met and married an American serviceman. ==Military career== After the family emigrated to the United States, Samuel attended the University of Colorado at Boulder, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business in 1960, and subsequently the National War College. He served in the United States Air Force for 30 years, retiring with the rank of colonel in 1985. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Medal multiple times during his years of active duty. As of 2008, he resided in Fairfax Station, Virginia. ==Author== Wolfgang Samuel at the Army Navy Country Club in 2009 As of 2015, Samuel has published eight books. The first, German Boy: A Child in War, is a memoir detailing the war years and his post-war life as a refugee, and features a foreword by historian Stephen Ambrose. His second book, I Always Wanted to Fly: America's Cold War Airmen, is a compilation of oral histories of American aviators of the Cold War era. The War of Our Childhood: Memories of World War II, another oral history compilation, tells of twenty-seven Germans who experienced the war as children. American Raiders: The Race to Capture the Luftwaffe's Secrets, is an account of the efforts made by the United States military to acquire German military technology. Glory Days: The Untold Story of the Men Who Flew the B-66 Destroyer into the Face of Fear recounts some of the adventures of the often unsung crews of the B-66, RB-66 and EB-66 aircraft. Watson's Whizzer's: Operation Lusty and the Race for Nazi Aviation Technology documents the United States' efforts to obtain German aeronautical breakthroughs at the end of World War II. His most recent work is In Defense of Freedom that describes the sacrifices of America's World War II Army Air Force flyers and their contributions to the Allied victory. ==Works== * German Boy: A Refugee's Story.

The Riograndense Republic, often called the Piratini Republic ( or ), was a de facto state that seceded from the Empire of Brazil roughly coinciding with the present state of Rio Grande do Sul. It was proclaimed on 11 September 1836, by General Antônio de Sousa Neto, as a direct consequence of the victory obtained by Gaúcho oligarchic forces at the Battle of Seival (1836), during the Farroupilha Revolution (1835–1845). It had a constitution adopted in 1843 and was recognised only by Britain, France, and Uruguay. In 1839, the Riograndense Republic formed a confederation with the short-lived Juliana Republic () which proclaimed its independence in the same year. November 1839, however, saw the war result in the defeat and disappearance of the Juliana Republic. The Riograndense Republic had five capitals during its nearly nine years of existence: the cities of Piratini (for which it is often called Piratini Republic), Alegrete, Caçapava do Sul (official capitals), Bagé (for only two weeks), and São Borja. The war between the Gaúchos and the Brazilian Empire was ended by the Ponche Verde Treaty. ==History== ===Background=== The economy of the then Province of São Pedro of Rio Grande do Sul of the Empire of Brazil was mainly focused on the production of jerky and leather. The province depended entirely on the domestic market, but the overvalued exchange rate and the tariff benefits then offered meant that imported beef was cheaper. Thus, the estancieiros of the region, among then the famous Bento Gonçalves, began a rebellion against the Imperial Government. After a meeting, it was decided that armed militias would be formed inside the province to take over the government under Bento's leadership. At first the objective was to take over the province's government, which was successfully done, and enter into negotiations with the regent Diogo Antônio Feijó to demand a new government acceptable to the regional elite. Meanwhile, the newly appointed Imperial Governor of the Province, :pt:José de Araújo Ribeiro, completely rejected by that elite, nevertheless took office. This was seen by the landowners as a declaration of war. Araújo Ribeiro then began gathering his soldiers who had been scattered since October, and hunting down Farroupilhos. He ordered the Provincial Assembly to be closed and removed Bento Gonçalves from the command of the National Guard. In Rio de Janeiro the imperial government closed the customs house in the provincial capital Porto Alegre for as long as the city was in the hands of the rebels, restricting the arrival of ships. Soon open conflict began, as imperial forces secured the city and rebels retaliated against them. ===Independence=== With the overwhelming victory of the rebels, led by Antônio de Sousa Neto, the separatist idea took shape. At night ideological questions were revised and Lucas de Oliveira and Joaquim Pedro, ardent republicans, catechized Neto, arguing that there was no other way out but to embark on the path of independence and that there was no other popular desire but desire of freedom, of abolition of slavery and of democracy under the republican system. Neto came to sympathize with the idea but resisted before a probable disapproval of his peers. He thought that such a proclamation of a new Republic should start from Bento Gonçalves, the great commander of all rags. They contended that Bento had already decided on the republic, that \\"rigid hierarchy was a thing of the empire, and that the republican system was centered on the people, their wants and needs, and not on the governing elite\\". Finally, with the acquiescence of Colonel Neto, they began to write the Proclamation of the Riograndense Republic that he would read out before his assembled troops, on 11 September 1836.. Bento Gonçalves was advised of this and was later proclaimed President. Here is the text read by General Antônio de Sousa Neto in front of his ranks: Antônio de Souza Neto proclaimed the Riograndense Republic. Brave comrades of the 1st Cavalry Brigade! Yesterday you obtained the most complete triumph over the slaves of the Court of Rio de Janeiro, which, envious of the local advantages of our province, makes mercilessly pour the blood of our compatriots, in order to make her prey to her ambitious sights. Miserable! Whenever their satellites have appeared before the free forces, they have succumbed, without this fatal disappointment making them give up their infernal plans. There are countless injustices made by the Government. His despotism is the most atrocious. And will we suffer so much shame? No, our comrades, the Rio Grande, are willing, like us, not to suffer for the longer time the arrogance of a tyrannical, arbitrary, and cruel government like the present. In every corner of the province there is no other echo than that of independence, republic, freedom or death. This echo, majestic, which they constantly repeat, as a part of this soil of free men, makes me declare that we proclaim our provincial independence, for which our work for liberty and the triumph we obtain yesterday, on these miserable slaves of absolute power. Comrades! We who are the 1st Brigade of the Liberal Army, must be the first to proclaim, as we proclaim, the independence of this province, which is disconnected from the rest of the Empire, and forms a free and independent state, with the title Riograndense Republic, and whose manifesto to the civilized nations will be done competently. Comrades! Let's shout for the first time: Long live the Riograndense Republic! Long live the independence! Long live the Republican Army of Rio Grande! Campo dos Menezes, 11 September 1836 - Antônio de Sousa Neto, colonel-commander of the 1st brigade. The other Brazilian provinces were called to unite as federated entities in the republican system. A national anthem was adopted, along with a flag, still used by the State of Rio Grande do Sul. The capital was also established in the small city of Piratini, from which came a new nickname, the Republic of Piratini. From this moment on, the immediate end of the Ragammuffin Revolution occurred and the Ragamuffin War began. ===Confederation=== Flag of the Juliana Republic. As the war progressed with successive ragamuffin victories, the Riograndense Navy led by the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi and the gaucho David Canabarro advanced to the Province of Santa Catarina to attack the city of Laguna. Laguna was taken, with the help of the Laguna people themselves, on 22 July 1839. On 29 July the Juliana Republic was proclaimed an independent country, linked to the Riograndense Republic by ties of confederalism, and David Canabarro became its first President. With the capture of Laguna, half of the imperial province was in the hands of the republican separatists, however, the rampage was contained by entrenched imperial troops. Shortly afterwards the empire reacted with full force, destroying the Riograndense Navy and advancing rapidly on the rebels in Santa Catarina. The retaking of Laguna on 1 November 1839 put an end to the Juliana Republic. ===Dissolution=== Until the year 1840, one could perceive a period of ascent ragamuffin, with several victories in the military field. After this period, a situation of decay, beginning with the fall of Laguna, is perceptible. With the Imperials controlling the great cities, the rags were retained in the interior, and soon internal quarrels began. The declaration of the Duke of Caxias announced the end of the Ragamuffin War, in 1845. Bento Gonçalves, still in the year 1840, due to the failures, waved to the empire with the possibility of agreement. Bento asked the imperials for safeguards so that his comrades could cross with impunity the places conquered by the empire, in order to settle with the imperial chiefs the details of a collective surrender of the ragamuffin rebels. They actually carried a letter of this design. But there was another oral message to be given to those leaders, which could not be written. The maneuver, however, was so well thought out and executed that it would fool even his fellow combatants, and motivated a letter of disapproval written by Domingos José de Almeida, then Vice-President and Minister of Finance of the Riograndense Republic. The fighting continued on several fronts. Meanwhile, a Constituent Assembly had been called on 10 February 1840, but maneuvers of Bento Gonçalves, who did not want to lose power, led to the promulgation only in 1842 of the Constitution of the Republic. Facing internal conflicts, economic and military problems against the forces of the Empire, the Republic was forced to start the peace negotiations. In 1844, Fructuoso Rivera proposed to broker peace between legalists and republicans. Manuel Luís Osório was sent to the camp of Rivera, where he met with Antônio Vicente da Fontoura, to inform that the Duke of Caxias, leader of the imperial forces, rejected the proposal of peace, but that there could be negotiations with the government, but without third parties. Vicente da Fontoura was sent to court to discuss peace. Caxias received instruction from the empire, which feared the advance of Rosas in the disputed territory, to propose honorable conditions to the rebels, such as an amnesty of officers and men, incorporating them into the Imperial Brazilian Army with their ranks preserved, allowing the Governor of the Province to be elected by the Provincial Assembly, and raising taxes on meat imported into Brazil from the Platine region. However, one question remained unanswerable, that of slaves freed by the Republic to serve in the Republican army. For the Empire of Brazil, it was unacceptable to recognize the freedom of slaves given by a sedition, although it did annihilate the leaders of the same revolt. Finally, on 1 March 1845, peace was signed: the Ponche Verde Treaty, after almost ten years of war. Among its main conditions were the amnesty full to the rebels, the liberation of the slaves who fought in the Republican Army and the election of a new provincial president by the ragamuffins. Partial or full compliance with the treaty to date raises discussions. The impossibility of a regionally restricted abolition of slavery, persistence of animosity between local leaders and other administrative and operational factors may have at least hindered, if not prevented full compliance with it. Such discussion is referred to the main article of this subject. The Riograndense Republic was reattached to the Brazilian Empire. ==Flag== The official flag of the Riograndense Republic was green, yellow and red. There were differing accounts for its design: one version indicated that the colors-symbols of Brazil, yellow-green and red, symbolized the republic, intersecting them; another that the green represented the forest of the pampas, the red, the revolutionary ideal, and the yellow the riches of the gaucho territory; another still that it combined the green of the Portuguese flag and the yellow of the Spanish flag (respectively, the most important and second most important colonizers of the territory of the state of Rio Grande do Sul), interspersed by the vertical red stripe symbolising federation in the platine region from the time of Jose Gervasio Artigas (1764-1850). However, green would only be added to the Portuguese flag in 1910, 65 years after the end of the Farroupilha Revolution, which discards this latest version. Likewise, the current flag of the state of Rio Grande do Sul comes to have the same colors, having been added the coat of arms of the Riograndense Republic in the middle of the flag. ==Government== Bento Gonçalves, first President of the Riograndense Republic. The Riograndense Republic was created as a constitutional presidentialist republic. Its first President, Bento Gonçalves, was appointed by the Ragamuffin Assembly and took office on 6 November 1836, along with 4 vice presidents: *Antônio Paulino da Fontoura *José Mariano de Matos *Domingos José de Almeida *Inácio José de Oliveira Guimarães In 1841 Bento Gonçalves was imprisoned by the imperial forces in Bahia, far away from his army, and it a new president, José Gomes de Vasconcelos Jardim, was elected and immediately appointed the new ministry of the republic: *Domingos José de Almeida - Minister of Interior and Finance *José Pinheiro de Ulhoa Cintra - Minister of Justice and Foreign Relations *José Mariano de Matos - Minister of War and Navy Throughout the war they were named generals of the republic: *João Manuel de Lima e Silva *Bento Gonçalves *Antônio de Sousa Neto *Bento Manuel Ribeiro *Davi Canabarro *João Antônio da Silveira The Constitution of the Riograndense Republic was completed in 1843, after seven years of independence from the Brazilian Empire. It was signed, \\"by the very fist of all the deputies\\" in Alegrete (when it was still a town), on 8 February 1843. The document includes the names of José Pinheiro de Uchôa Cintra, Francisco de Sá Brito, José Mariano de Matos, Serafim dos Anjos France, Domingos José de Almeida. Among its articles was written: Detached the Riograndense people of the Brazilian communion, resumes all the rights of primitive freedom, makes use of these imprescriptible rights constituting an independent Republic, takes in the extensive scale of the sovereign states the place that is responsible for the sufficiency of their resources, civilization and natural riches that assure you the full and complete exercise of your independence, eminent sovereignty and dominion, without objection to the sacrifice of the smallest part of this same independence or sovereignty to another nation, government or any strange power. Piratini, 29 August 1838'' This legacy of ragamuffin, came to be considered as the legitimate cradle of Brazilian Republican law. ===Armed forces=== Garibaldi leading the Riograndense navy to Laguna. The Imperial Brazilian Navy controlled the main communications media of the province, the Patos Lagoon, between Porto Alegre, Pelotas and Rio Grande, and most of the navigable rivers. In spite of this, it was constantly attacked by ragamuffins, when near the ravines of the rivers. On 1 February 1838, a troop of two thousand rags and a battery of artillery were able to attack two gunboats and a barge on the Caí River, killing almost all the sailors, imprisoning one of the commanders and capturing their ships, thus beginning the creation of the Riograndense Navy. In 1838 Giuseppe Garibaldi had known Bento Gonçalves still in his prison, in Rio de Janeiro, and gave him a corso letter to imprison imperial ships. On 1 September 1838, Garibaldi was appointed captain- lieutenant, commander of the Riograndense navy.Bento organized the freemasonry in Riograndense territory, which was allowed for the Imperial Government to his person A shipyard was set up next to a weapons and ammunition factory in Camaquã, at the resort of Ana Gonçalves, sister of Bento Gonçalves. There Garibaldi coordinated the construction and armament of two war-craft. At the same time, Luigi Rossetti went to Montevideo, seeking the help of Luigi Carniglia and other indispensable professionals. After a few weeks, the equipment of masters and workers was complete. Some sailors came from Montevideo and others were recruited around. After the construction of the boats and launched into the water, they captured some merchant ships, but there was not much success against the powerful imperial navy. The Riograndense Navy was completely destroyed in 1839 after their defeat in Santa Catarina. ===International recognition=== The United Provinces of Rio de la Plata at the time were being unified by the dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas and tried to recover the Uruguayan territory (Platine War), not excluding also the possibility of aid to the Riograndense separatists. Juan Manuel de Rosas, the Argentine dictator, offered support so that David Canabarro continued the fight.. Juan Manuel de Rosas was removed from power in Argentina in a confrontation involving Brazilian troops. Alongside the de facto recognition by the Argentine Confederation, Uruguay started to recognize the independence and sovereignty of the Riograndense Republic, but the diplomatic process was not completed. The United Kingdom and France recognised the new republic under the condition that its port would be open to French and British ships. ==Religious schism== Alegoria Farroupilha, Museu Júlio de Castilhos archive, Porto Alegre. The parishes of Rio Grande do Sul were linked to the bishopric of Rio de Janeiro, which brought several obstacles to the Riograndense Republic. To break with the Empire of Brazil, the farroupilhas separated completely from the court. On 22 June 1838, they named Father Chagas as apostolic vicar, denying obedience to the bishop of Rio de Janeiro, creating a schism in the Catholic Church of the then Province of St. Peter of Rio Grande do Sul. The apostolic vicar had true religious authority: and appointed priests and dispensed marriages. Father Chagas was excommunicated and his acts were declared unlawful by the bishop of Rio de Janeiro - the maximum authority of the Catholic Church in Brazil. Likewise, most of the Gaucho clergy adhered to the new ecclesiastical authority. The situation lasted until the end of the Ragamuffin Revolution (1835–45). With the defeat, the priest Chagas sought a reconciliation with the bishop of Rio de Janeiro, having been secretary of the new bishop of Porto Alegre. After the end of the revolution, Father Fidêncio José Ortiz was entrusted by the bishop of Rio de Janeiro to review all the acts practiced and other documents. ==Legacy== Current flag of the state of Rio Grande do Sul with the Riograndense Republica coat of arms on its centre The Riograndense Republic is symbolically perennial in the flag and coat of arms of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, just as other Brazilian states maintained in their civic symbols evocations of relevant deeds. Its territory derived from the partial split of the Province of São Pedro do Rio Grande do Sul, which had its limits totally defined in relation to Uruguay only after the end of the Ragamuffin War (1835–45). After the proclamation of the Brazilian Republic (1889), the whole territory of the Province became one of the federal units of Brazil, the state of Rio Grande do Sul. ===Question about the document of the Ponche Verde Treaty=== In a hypothesis of invalidity of the Ponche Verde Treaty, because of the lack of formalities or incompetence of the signatories, the Republic remaining in the following days would lack sovereignty, since it does not have the requisites that legitimize it: *It does not hold the monopoly of force since it no longer has its own army: it hosts the Southern Military Command of the Imperial Brazilian Army. *Its administration is not independent of the Imperial Government, within the Brazilian unitary state, nor was there any subsequent nomination or election of another national president of this Republic other than Bento Gonçalves and Gomes Jardim. *Finally, the inhabitants of the territory declare themselves Brazilian and participate in Brazilian political life; thus lacking the third fundamental element for the legitimate existence of any national State. Among the many understandings about what is State, we can mention the signed in the Convention of Montevideo on 26 December 1933, Brazil being one of the signatories. In this convention the state definition consists of a (a): *Government *Permanent population *Defined territory *Ability to relate to other nation- stateshttp://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/390844/Montevideo-Convention ==Notes== == References == * Varela, Alfredo.

NetworkManager is available for Linux kernel-based and other Unix-like operating systems. ==How it works== Linux kernel: network device drivers and network stack. Utility programs are not depicted, they communicate through the SCI with the different components of the kernel. To connect computers with each other various communications protocols have been developed, e.g. IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet), IEEE 802.11 (\\"wireless\\"), IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), PPPoE, PPPoA, and many many more. Each participating computer must have the suitable hardware, e.g. network card or wireless network card and this hardware must be configured accordingly to be able to establish a connection. In case of a monolithic kernel all the device drivers are part of it. The hardware is accessed (and also configured) through its device driver. In case of Linux, the kernel presents for each device driver a representation in form of a device file. All device files are found in the \`/dev\` directory, and traditionally the device files for Ethernet hardware have been named \`eth0\`, \`eth1\`, etc. Since systemd, they are named differently: \`enp4s0\`, etc. (This abstraction is called the everything is a file concept.) Anything in user- space accesses the hardware through its device file. The configuration utility to configure the hardware, and programs like the web browser/SSH/NTP- client/etc. to send and receive network packets. ===Configuration of network interfaces without NetworkManager=== On Linux and all Unix-like operating systems, the utilities \`ifconfig\` and the newer \`ip\` (from the iproute2-bundle) are used to configure IEEE 802.3 and IEEE 802.11 hardware. These utilities configure the kernel directly and the configuration is applied immediately. After boot-up, the user is required to configure them again. To apply the same static configuration after each boot-up, the PID1-programs are used: System V init executes shell scripts and binary programs, systemd parses its own conf-files (and executes programs). The boot-up configuration for network interfaces is stored in \`/etc/network/interfaces\` for Debian Linux distributions and its derivatives or \`ifcfg\` files in \`/etc/sysconfig/network- scripts/\` for Fedora and its derivatives, and DNS-servers in \`/etc/resolv.conf\`. \`/etc/network/interfaces\` or \`/etc/sysconfig/network- scripts/ifcfg-*\` can define a static IP-address or \`dhclient\` to be used, and all kinds of VPN can be configured here as well. In case the configuration has to be changed, DHCP-protocol goes a long way to do so automatically, without the user even noticing. ===Configuration of network interfaces with NetworkManager=== * NetworkManager is accessible via dbus. * Configuration is stored in \`/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\` However, dynamic configurations (i.e., not stored in a static configuration file but taken from outside the host, and potentially changing after boot) have been an increasingly more common configuration, especially as we've moved from physically large servers to more portable hosts that may be plugged and unplugged (or moved from WiFi hotspot to WiFi hotspot) at the will of the user. Bootp was an early protocol used for this, and to this day its descendant DHCP is still very common. Many Unix-like systems include a program called dhclient to handle this dynamic configuration. Given a relatively static or simple dynamic configuration, static configuration modified by dhclient works well. However, as networks and their topologies get more complex, a central manager for all the network configuration information becomes more essential. ====Software architecture==== NetworkManager has two components: # the NetworkManager daemon, the actual software which manages connections and reports network changes # several graphical front-ends for diverse surfaces, such as GNOME Shell, GNOME Panel, KDE Plasma Workspaces, Cinnamon, etc. Both components are intended by the developers to be reasonably portable, and the applet is available to desktop environments which implement the Freedesktop.org System Tray Protocol, including GNOME, KDE Plasma Workspaces, Enlightenment (software) and Xfce. As the components communicate via D-Bus, applications can be written to be “link-aware”, or to replace the provided applet entirely. One example is KNetworkManager, a KDE frontend to NetworkManager developed by Novell for SUSE Linux. Graphical front-ends and command line interfaces File:Network Manager 0.9.5.pngThe GUI shows all available APs. The user merely needs to click on the desired one. File:GNOME Shell NM front-end 3.10.pngGraphical front-end for GNOME Shell 3.10 ;nm-applet :nm-applet is the GNOME applet for NetworkManager. ;nmcli :nmcli is NetworkManager's built-in command-line interface added in 2010. nmcli allows easy display of NetworkManager's current status, manage connections and devices, monitor connections. ;nmtui :nmtui is a built-in text-based user interface. nmtui is relatively basic compared to nmcli, which only allows users to add/edit a connection, activate a connection, and set the hostname of the system. ;cnetworkmanager :cnetworkmanager command-line interface for NetworkManager. ===Mobile broadband configuration assistant=== Antti Kaijanmäki announced the development of a mobile broadband configuration assistant for NetworkManager in April 2008; it became available in NetworkManager version 0.7.0. Together with the package mobile-broadband- provider-info the connection is easily configured. ==History== Red Hat initiated the NetworkManager project in 2004 with the goal of enabling Linux users to deal more easily with modern networking needs, particularly wireless networking. NetworkManager takes an opportunistic approach to network selection, attempting to use the best available connection as outages occur, or as the user roams between wireless networks. It prefers Ethernet connections over “known” wireless networks, which are preferred over wireless networks with SSIDs to which the user has never connected. The user is prompted for WEP or WPA keys as needed. The NetworkManager project was among the first major Linux desktop components to utilize D-Bus and HAL extensively. Since June 2009, however, NetworkManager no longer depends on HAL, and since 0.9.10 (ca. 2014), neither does it require the D-Bus daemon to be running for root operation. ==See also== * Linux on the desktop * BlueZ * GNOME Keyring Manager * usbserial * Wicd – network manager written in Python * wpa_supplicant * wvdial * netifd – tiny daemon with the ability to listen on netlink events; does not require D-Bus, does not depend on GLib, targets embedded devices * ConnMan – daemon for managing Internet connections within embedded devices ==References== ==External links== * NetworkManager Homepage * Service Provider Database * NetworkManager in freedesktop.org * NetworkManager status on the freebsd-gnome mailing list * Original NetworkManager page at redhat.com via WaybackMachine * Announcement of the first public release of NetworkManager * How to use a WiFi interface with NetworkManager Category:Applications using D-Bus Category:Free network-related software Category:Linux network-related software Category:Red Hat software ","title":"NetworkManager"},{"id":"2587358","text":"Snoopy's Getting Married, Charlie Brown is the 28th prime-time animated television special based on the comic strip Peanuts by Charles M.

Soon after, Snoopy decides to get married, and wants his brother Spike to be the Best Beagle at his wedding, resulting in Spike traveling a long way from Needles, California and trying to earn money by competing in a dog race, only to be disqualified for being a beagle and not a greyhound. Snoopy is at first excited, but soon grows nervous at the prospect of marriage, acting miserable at his own bachelor party, and even breaking down into tears hours before the wedding. At the ceremony, everything is in order, until it seems Genevieve is late. Lucy soon arrives with news that Genevieve fell in love with a golden retriever and ran off with him, meaning that the wedding is off. Snoopy is heartbroken at first, but soon lightens up at the prospect of remaining a bachelor, and enjoys salad with Woodstock. Spike returns home to his residence, a gigantic hollowed-out cactus with electricity and modern amenities, and the show ends by Spike enjoying part of the wedding cake by himself. ==Production== Snoopy's Getting Married, Charlie Brown was based on a comic strip story in 1977 (later published as The Beagle Has Landed).

This is most commonly used for interactive media such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), peer-to-peer communications, video, and instant messaging. In such applications, you want to avoid communicating through a central server (which would slow down communication, and be expensive), but direct communication between client applications on the Internet is very tricky due to network address translators (NATs), firewalls, and other network barriers. ICE is developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force MMUSIC working group and is published as RFC 8445, as of August 2018,RFC 8445, Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal, A. Keranen, C. Holmberg Ericsson, J. Rosenberg (July 2018) and has obsoleted both RFC 5245RFC 5245, Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols, J. Rosenberg (April 2010) and RFC 4091.RFC 4091, The Alternative Network Address Types (ANAT) Semantics for the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework, G. Camarillo, J. Rosenberg (June 2005) ==Overview== Network address translation (NAT) became an effective technique in delaying the exhaustion of the available address pool of Internet Protocol version 4, which is inherently limited to around four billion unique addresses. NAT gateways track outbound requests from a private network and maintain the state of each established connection to later direct responses from the peer on the public network to the peer in the private network, which would otherwise not be directly addressable. VoIP, peer-to-peer, and many other applications require address information of communicating peers within the data streams of the connection, rather than only in the Internet Protocol packet headers. For example, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) communicates the IP address of network clients for registration with a location service, so that telephone calls may be routed to registered clients.

Inspired by the Freedom Riders of the American Civil Rights Movement, students from the University of Sydney formed a group called the Student Action for Aborigines, led by Charles Perkins (the first Indigenous Australian to graduate tertiary education) among others, and travelled into New South Wales country towns on what some of them considered a fact-finding mission. What they encountered was de facto segregation; the students protested, picketed, and faced violence, raising the issue of Indigenous rights. They commonly stood protesting for hours at segregated areas such as pools, parks and pubs which raised a mixed reception in the country towns. Australia overwhelmingly passed a 1967 referendum removing discriminatory sections from the Australian Constitution and enabling the federal government to take direct action in Aboriginal affairs. At the time of the Freedom Ride in 1965, some Aboriginal People of Australia were counted separately in the censusYear Book Australia, 1960, Australian Bureau of Statistics, pages 327–328. and their rights as citizens were regularly ignored. In 1964 a University of Sydney protest against racial segregation in the United States had brought comments from members of the public urging students to look to their own backyard if they wanted to draw attention to racial discrimination. ==Participants== The original Freedom Riders were: Charles Perkins, Gary Williams, Aidan Foy, Alan Outhred, Alex Mills, Ann Curthoys, Barry Corr, Beth Hansen, Bob Gallagher, Brian Aarons, Chris Page, Colin Bradford, Darce Cassidy, David Pepper, Derek Molloy, Hall Greenland, Helen Gray, Jim Spigelman, John Butterworth, John Gowdie, John Powles, Judith Rich, Louise Higham, Machteld Hali, Norm Mackay, Paddy Dawson, Pat Healy, Ray Leppik, Rick Collins, Robyn Iredale, Sue Johnston, Sue Reeves, Warwick Richards and Wendy Golding. ==Communities visited== Ann Curthoys and Louise Higham interview residents at Moree Aboriginal Station during the Freedom Ride Moree was the site of a violent conflict during the Freedom Ride.

The first two towns they went to were Wellington and Gulargambone. Protests were not conducted there. Instead the locals were asked questions which affirmed perceptions of how bad discrimination against Indigenous Australians was in rural areas. Other towns that were visited include Lismore, Bowraville, Dubbo and Kempsey. ==2005 re- enactment== In 2005 another ride travelled through New South Wales. The aim was to determine how much had changed in 40 years and foster debate on reconciliation. Although the 2005 event focussed on reconciliation, experiences of discrimination were reported and the poor housing conditions for some Aboriginal People were noted. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs Andrew Refshauge was presented with the findings of the 2005 ride which visited more than 13 communities. ==2015 50th anniversary== To mark the 50th anniversary of the Freedom Ride, two coaches re-ran the route with several of the original participants and a group of present-day University of Sydney students.

Originally hosted by comic actress Joan Rivers, it first aired on October 9, 1986, under the title The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers. It is also the first late-night show hosted by Arsenio Hall. ==Background== The talk show was a direct attempt at competing against NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, where Rivers had been Carson's permanent guest host since 1983. The show was initially broadcast live. Many in 1986, including top executives at NBC, thought it was possible that Johnny Carson would retire after reaching his 25th anniversary on October 1, 1987, as it was such a logical cut-off point. In spring 1986, a confidential memo between top NBC executives listing about 10 possible successors in the event of Carson's retirement the next year was leaked. Rivers was shocked to see that she was not on the list. In an article she wrote for People magazine, Rivers said that NBC offered her only a one-year contract in 1985 as permanent guest host while Carson's contract had been renewed for two years, which signaled to her that her future was uncertain as her previous one year contracts had run the same length as Carson's. In addition, Rivers noted numerous snubs from NBC executives over the years, such as not being invited to the annual Carson party until recently, and taking the fall for a controversial joke that management approved during rehearsal. Rivers had received higher-paying offers from other networks in prior years but declined them out of her loyalty to Carson, but in 1986 as NBC was unwilling to give assurances on her future and negotiations were fruitless, this was the impetus for Rivers to seriously consider the Fox offer. ===Rivers and Carson=== Fox was looking for a host for a late-night talk show for the network's launch in October 1986. Through its purchase of Metromedia, it had been clearing The Merv Griffin Show (a syndication stalwart for two decades) but opted to drop that program (leading to its cancellation) to make room for its own show. The new network offered Rivers the job at a salary higher than what NBC was paying. She accepted, and Carson was blindsided by the news when he saw the press conference on television. Moments later, when Rivers called him at home, he refused to take the call. Carson was furious when he found out about Rivers going to Fox. Carson stated that he felt betrayed by Rivers – not because she dared to compete with him, but because she was not honest with him beforehand about her intentions and did not ask him for advice and his blessing. For her part, Rivers was adamant that her problem was with NBC and not with Carson, who was like a father figure to her. She stated that she didn't want to tell Carson before the announcement was made because she was afraid Fox would cancel the deal if word leaked out. She had previously been ordered by Carson's producers and lawyers not to go to him with her problems, as they kept Carson completely insulated since he was a major source of NBC profits; thus Carson had been completely unaware of Rivers' problems with NBC. When others obtained their own competing shows (such as David Brenner, Alan Thicke, Joey Bishop, and Pat Sajak), Carson always had them on The Tonight Show beforehand to wish them luck – and again after he had forced their show into cancellation by maintaining superior ratings. Rivers did not appear on the Tonight Show again during the remainder of Carson's tenure after 1986 or during that of his successors (in this case, Jay Leno and subsequently, Conan O'Brien) until February 17, 2014, when she appeared in a cameo on Jimmy Fallon's first show, by which point Carson had been dead for nine years. This blacklisting extended to The Late Show With David Letterman on CBS, Carson's hand picked successor. Carson continued to be friends and support Letterman and in 2004, a few weeks before Carson died, Rivers appeared his show with no mention of their incident, her show, or their falling out. Rivers spoke highly of Carson the night he died on January 23, 2005, but revealed that he never spoke to her again. ==History== ===Sagging ratings and carriage refusals=== After a moderate start, ratings for the talk show soon sagged. The ratings struggles also made it hard for Fox to attract affiliates for its primetime launch on April 5, 1987. Some prospective affiliates, such as Milwaukee's WCGV-TV, would only sign with the network if they did not have to carry The Late Show. KPTM in Omaha refused outright out of loyalty to Carson, who hailed from Corning, Iowa, east of Omaha and started his career on local radio and television. The network acquiesced to allow some stations out of that obligation so that the network launched in primetime with as many affiliates as possible, at the cost of ratings and access to The Late Show. For instance, at the time the show launched Fox had not closed on its purchase of its Boston station, WXNE-TV (now WFXT). That station's previous owners, the Christian Broadcasting Network, objected to the show's content and refused to clear it. As a result, until Fox took control of the station in January, its audio feed aired on a low-rated AM station. The behind-the-scenes relations between Rivers and network executives quickly eroded, and Rivers was eventually fired in May 1987. For the final show, which aired May 15, 1987, the set was vandalized with toilet paper, slime, and shaving cream. Her guests were Howie Mandel, Pee-Wee Herman, then-fledgling comedian Chris Rock, Wendy O. Williams, and show stage manager Michelle Aller as her alter-ego Mavis Vegas Davis. Soon afterward the program was renamed The Late Show and featured rotating guest hosts including Suzanne Somers, Richard Belzer, and Robert Townsend. After firing prospective guest host Frank Zappa, producer John Scura replaced him with Arsenio Hall, who made his debut as a talk show host. Eventually, Hall was named the permanent replacement host in mid-1987. ====The Howard Stern Show==== On April 16, 1987, a meeting was held between Howard Stern and management of WNYW, Fox's flagship television station. The network was considering Stern as replacement to The Late Show.Colford, p. 176. Five one- hour pilots titled The Howard Stern Show were recorded at a cost of about $400,000.Colford, p. 177. They featured rock guitarist Leslie West of Mountain fame as band leader and Steve Rossi as announcer and singer.Colford, pp. 180–181. By early June, air dates were yet to be scheduled; the pilots were instead being tested among focus groups in California. With no formal announcement, in July, the network decided not to put the Stern show on the air.Colford, p. 178. Paul Noble, the former executive producer for WNYW, was never told of Fox's decision. \\"By today's standards, they were absolutely tame.\\" He also said, \\"They were not the kind of thing that a local New York television station was prepared to get involved with at that time. It was more like off-the-wall radio.\\" ===Arsenio Hall=== Fox had originally cancelled The Late Show, but executives were stunned by the success of Hall, who was performing well among adults 18–49. In return, Hall was given a 13-week deal to host the show – however, a replacement program entitled The Wilton North Report was already in pre-production and scheduled, which meant that the deal would not be extended beyond that. Further, Hall would not be available in any event, as he was committed to filming the Eddie Murphy feature Coming to America. During the monologue of his final appearance as host, Hall stated that the reason he had agreed to only do 13 weeks was because that was as long as he was able to stay, as he had plans \\"to do other things.\\" Clint Holmes continued as announcer while Mark Hudson remained as band leader. However, the band's name changed from \\"Mark Hudson and the Party Boys featuring the Tramp\\" – as it had been known during Rivers's tenure, with \\"the Tramp\\" referring to baritone sax player Beverly Dahlke-Smith – to simply \\"Mark Hudson and the Late Show Band\\". Guests tended to be third-string actors, with performances by lesser-known bands such as The Williams Brothers (Los Angeles) and The Amazing Pink Things (Seattle). One noteworthy guest during Hall's era was Bob Barker, then in his fifteenth year as host of the long-running game show The Price is Right. World-famous \\"Earthquake Astrologer from KROQ and KFOX\\", Farley Malorrus, appeared as a guest following an accurate earthquake prediction in Los Angeles during October 1987. When problems developed with Wilton North, Fox attempted to bring back Hall – but it was too late. Wilton North debuted on December 11, 1987, and was a disaster on all fronts. Fox canceled it after only 21 episodes on January 8. It started airing Late Show repeats with both Hall and Rivers on January 11, 1988, and scrambled to revive the talk show. ===1988 hosts=== The show came back with a new group of unknown guest hosts, including comedians Jeff Joseph and John Mulrooney; Daniel Rosen took over as announcer, while Jack Mack and the Heart Attack became the new house band. Ultimately, none of the tryout hosts would work out, and the network turned to Seattle TV personality Ross Shafer to take over The Late Show. ===Ross Shafer=== By the time Shafer began hosting, ratings were so low that the show could only attract newsmakers and human interest-style guests; this led to a format change in the summer to focus on tabloid and ripped-from-the-headlines stories. Fox canceled the show effective October 28, 1988, getting out of late night until 1993, when it launched the ill-fated The Chevy Chase Show. ====Notable episodes==== Despite the show's low ratings by 1988, Shafer's tenure as host produced six notable episodes. These are especially notable for being the last public appearances of well-known celebrities: * The movie Leonard Part 6 won three Golden Raspberry Awards on April 10, 1988, for Worst Actor (Bill Cosby), Worst Picture, and Worst Screenplay (Jonathan Reynolds and Cosby). It was nominated for two more Razzie Awards, for Worst Supporting Actress (Foster) and Worst Director (Weiland). A few weeks after the ceremony, Cosby accepted his three Razzies on The Late Show. He requested that the three Razzies he earned be specifically made out of 24 karat (99.99%) gold and Italian marble. * A reunion of the 1960s Batman TV series cast (Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin, Julie Newmar, Yvonne Craig, Alan Napier, and Eartha Kitt) aired on April 28. Napier, who had been long-retired at this point and very frail when this special was recorded, died on August 8 after being checked into a hospital two months earlier. Because Cesar Romero had other commitments at the time, he was instead interviewed by Shafer from Romero's home. Also interviewed was Batmobile customizer George Barris. * A reunion of the Gilligan's Island cast aired on May 18 with a custom set, audience members and a barbershop quartet singing the theme, cast member trivia, and more. This would be the last appearance of all the regular cast members together, including Tina Louise who had distanced herself from the rest of the cast since the show ended, and Jim Backus, who was suffering from Parkinson's disease. Backus died in July 1989; Alan Hale, Jr. died in January 1990, Natalie Schafer died in April 1991, Bob Denver died in September 2005 and Russell Johnson died in January 2014. * A \\"Game Show Hosts\\" special featuring Gene Rayburn, Gary Owens, Tom Kennedy, Dennis James, and Jim Lange, plus Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows co-author Fred Wostbrock. Various clips were shown, including rare footage of James' Name That Tune. (Schafer would later succeed Rayburn as host of Match Game.) James died in 1997, while Rayburn died in 1999, Lange died in 2014, and Owens died in 2015. * Artist Mark Kostabi's appearance, where he wrapped Shafer in aluminum foil and threw large amounts of cash into the studio audience. Some of this footage resurfaced in the documentary film about Kostabi, Con Artist, directed by Michael Sladek. * A reunion of the cast of National Lampoon's Animal House (Tim Matheson, Martha Smith, Stephen Furst, James Daughton, and John Vernon) in honor of its tenth anniversary, which aired on October 6. ==Aftermath== Edgar Rosenberg, Rivers's husband and the show's producer during her tenure, committed suicide on August 14, 1987, three months after Rivers and he were fired, and shortly after the couple separated. Rivers made the first of several career comebacks with the debut of The Joan Rivers Show in daytime on September 5, 1989. The show was nominated for numerous Emmy Awards with Rivers winning the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host in 1990. The Arsenio Hall Show launched on January 3, 1989. Hall had sealed a deal with Paramount Television to launch his own show, and was able to clear it on many Fox affiliates throughout the country. He essentially reclaimed his old time period, though not in the network. Ross Shafer went on to host a revival of Match Game for ABC in 1990. The title of The Late Show was revived by CBS in 1993 for their unrelated late-night talk show franchise The Late Show for David Letterman and since 2015 for Stephen Colbert. ==See also== * List of late night network TV programs ==References== ==External links== * The Late Nightlife Tonight Show * * Category:1986 American television series debuts Category:1988 American television series endings Category:1980s American late-night television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Fox late-night programming Category:Television series by 20th Century Fox Television ","title":"The Late Show (1986 talk show)"},{"id":"2587422","text":"Lolita performing at Miami Seaquarium Lolita is a , orca who has lived at the Miami Seaquarium since 1970. ==Early life== On August 8, 1970 Lolita was caught in Penn Cove, Puget Sound, Washington. She was one of seven young whales sold to marine parks around the world from a roundup of over 80 orcas conducted by Ted Griffin and Don Goldsberry, partners in a capture operation known as Namu, Inc. Tokitae, as she was originally named, was purchased by Seaquarium veterinarian Dr. Jesse White for about $20,000. On arriving to the Seaquarium, Lolita joined another Southern Resident Orca named Hugo who was captured some time before Lolita and had lived in the park two years before her arrival. Tokitae was renamed Lolita \\"after the heroine in Vladimir Nabokov’s novel\\". Lolita, the Killer Whale She and Hugo lived together for 10 years in what is known as the Whale Bowl, a tank by deep. Even though the pair mated many times (once to the point of suspending shows) the two never produced any offspring. Hugo died on March 4, 1980. Since then, Lolita has lived in the Whale Bowl together with a pair of Pacific White Sided dolphins. ==Controversy== While Lolita is Seaquarium's main attraction, she has attracted attention from animal rights groups and anti-captivity activists. In 2003, Lolita was the subject of the documentary Lolita: Slave to Entertainment in which many anti-captivity activists, most notably Ric O'Barry (former Flipper trainer), argue against her current conditions and express a hope that she may be re-introduced to the wild. Protesters assert that the Seaquarium is treating Lolita cruelly. Lolita is approximately long and 7,000 pounds. Per the guidelines, the tank for a killer whale the size of Lolita must be a minimum of wide in either direction with a straight line of travel across the middle. Lolita’s tank is only wide from the front wall to the slide out (work island) barrier*. It is deep at the deepest point and a mere deep around the edges. On January 17, 2015, thousands of protesters from all over the world gathered outside the Seaquarium to ask for Lolita's release, and asked other supporters worldwide to tweet #FreeLolita on Twitter. ==Legal cases== In November 2011 Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF), PETA, and three individuals filed a lawsuit against the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to end the exclusion of Lolita from the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of the Pacific Northwest's Southern Resident orcas. NMFS reviewed ALDF’s joint petition, along with the thousands of comments submitted by the public and found the petition merited. In February 2015, the NOAA announced it would issue a rule to include Lolita in the endangered species list. Previous to this, although the Orca population that she was taken from is listed as endangered, as a captive animal, Lolita was exempted from this classification. This change does not impact on her captivity at Miami Seaquarium. On March 18, 2014 a judge dismissed ALDF's case challenging Miami Seaquarium's Animal Welfare Act license to display captive orcas. In June 2014 ALDF filed a notice of appeal of the District Court decision that found the USDA had not violated the law when it renewed Miami Seaquarium's AWA exhibitor license. ==See also== * List of captive orcas ==References== ==External links== * Lolita: Slave to Entertainment film Category:Individual killer whales Category:Southern resident killer whales ","title":"Lolita (killer whale)"},{"id":"2587441","text":"Veronica Lario (born Miriam Raffaella Bartolini, 19 July 1956) is a former Italian actress and the former wife of ex Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. ==Biography== Born in Bologna, Lario was a stage actress under Enrico Maria Salerno, with whom she had a love affair. She also worked in theatrical plays with well-known actors; Her most famous role is in Tenebrae by horror master Dario Argento. She retired from acting after meeting Silvio Berlusconi. Married on 15 December 1990, Berlusconi and Lario have three children together: Barbara Berlusconi (1984),At this time Silvio Berlusconi was still married to Carla Elvira Lucia Dall'Oglio, from whom he was divorced in 1985. Eleonora (1986), and Luigi (1988). In the 80s, before the birth of their first-born daughter Barbara, Lario terminated an earlier pregnancy with an induced abortion, in order not to give birth to a child affected by significant morbidity.http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Politica/2005/04_Aprile/08/veronica.shtml. corriere.it. As the wife of the Italian premier, Veronica Lario chose to maintain a low public profile. She avoided most public events and meetings and she seldom accompanied her husband Silvio Berlusconi at official meetings. On the other hand, she was known to publicly express political opinions contrasting with those of her then-husband (for example, on bioethics or in backing protesters demonstrating against the war in Iraq). Lario's husband was never shy about mentioning her on public occasions, and he alluded at least once to a supposed affair between her and philosopher and opposition politician Massimo Cacciari.While the supposed affair was only mentioned in gossip tabloids, on October 2002, during a press conference with Danish prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Silvio Berlusconi said he ought to introduce his wife to Rasmussen, \\"the best-looking prime minister in Europe and certainly more handsome than Cacciari\\". See also the Guardian on this episode. On 31 January 2007, Lario said her dignity had been damaged by comments Berlusconi reportedly made during the VIP party after a TV awards ceremony broadcast by one of his channels. \\"If I weren't married I would marry you immediately\\", the 70-year-old media mogul told showgirl and future parliamentarian Mara Carfagna, according to reports widely carried in the Italian press. He reportedly told another, \\"With you, I'd go anywhere\\". Lario's letter appeared in La Repubblica, a nationally prominent newspaper. She declared: > I see these statements as damaging my dignity. To both my husband and the > public man, I therefore demand a public apology, since I haven't received > any privately. I have faced the inevitable contrasts and the more painful > moments that a long conjugal relation entails with respect and discretion. \\"Now I write to state my reaction,\\" added Lario, saying her husband's comments were \\"unacceptable\\" and could not be reduced to mere jokes. But after a few hours, Silvio Berlusconi responded with a public letter to his wife and apologized for what he had said three days earlier. In April 2009 she once more published an open letter, criticising her husband for consorting with young ladies and defining his chosen candidates for the European Parliament as \\"shameless rubbish\\". On 3 May 2009 it was reported that she was to file for divorce, which under Italian law can only be started after a couple has reached a separation agreement. On 10 May 2010 it was revealed that a separation settlement had been reached, with Berlusconi accepting alimony payments of €3,6 million per year, and allowing her to live in their luxury home near Milan. In December 2012, a Milan court established that Silvio Berlusconi would be required to pay his ex-wife Veronica Lario €3 million a month (36 million a year).Veronica €100,000 per day – Berlusconi keeps the heritage (in Italian). corriere.it. In 2015 on 23 June 2015, the Court of Justice of Milan established that Silvio Berlusconi would pay his ex-wife €1,4 million a month. Finally in 2017, on 16 November, the Court of Appeal of Milan decided that Silvio Berlusconi will not have to pay the 1,4 million per month to his ex-wife, who has been ordered to give back the amounts she received since 2014: approximately 60 million euros. ==External links== * ==Notes== Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Spouses of Prime Ministers of Italy Category:Italian film actresses Category:Italian television actresses Category:Actors from Bologna Category:Berlusconi family Category:Italian stage actresses Category:20th-century Italian actresses Category:Italian Roman Catholics ","title":"Veronica Lario"},{"id":"2587447","text":"It's the Girl in the Red Truck, Charlie Brown is the 32nd prime-time animated television special based upon the popular comic strip Peanuts, by Charles M. Schulz. It is a hybrid of animation and live-action footage, and features Spike instead of the core Peanuts characters. A spin-off focused on Spike's unrequited love for a young woman, it was described as being similar to Beauty and the Beast.Rheta Grimsley Johnson, Good Grief: The Story of Charles M. Schulz, New York, NY: Pharos Books, 1989. . Chapter 17: \\"My Citizen Kane\\", page 197. ==Plot== Spike waves to a young woman driving an old red Chevrolet pickup truck through the desert of Needles, California every day; it is the highlight of his day. In this combined animated and live-action special, we meet her, aerobics instructor Jenny, who wants to be a big city jazz dancer. She and Spike drive around, looking at the desert scenery and spending some time at a roller rink. However, when Spike is accidentally thrown out of the rink he runs off, and is pursued by people on a nighttime coyote hunt. A sub- plot sees Jenny's boyfriend, Jeff, set up an audition for her, which she is angry about because he did it without consulting her. ==Production== It is a departure from the usual Peanuts specials. Apart from the animated introduction, the entire show is a mixture of live-action and animation. While most specials include a variety of characters from the comic strip, like Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, and Lucy, this one is centered on Snoopy's brother, Spike.Johnson, page 196. It starts with a brief animated introduction with Charlie Brown and Snoopy, introducing the character of Spike to audiences. Schulz apparently was against this scene, feeling that fans would already be familiar with the supporting character. Production of the film took four years, and cost \\"millions of dollars\\".Johnson, page 195. A serious film buff who watched both foreign and art films, Schulz commented, \\"I wanted this to be my Citizen Kane, but it's not.\\" Many cast members were from Schulz's friends, family, or neighborhood. His daughter, Jill, was cast in the lead role of Jenny, while his son, Monte, helped write the script. Bit player Molly Brice was discovered by Schulz from a Santa Rosa Little Theatre production of The Oldest Living Graduate. Director Walter Miller's regular projects include the Academy Awards telecast, and was used to working with name actors. Miller and Schulz had previously worked together, when the director worked on a broadcast of a Peanuts ice show. The movie's music was provided by Paul Rodriguez, who composed for Redwood Empire's ice shows. As the animation/live- action technique requires, characters were animated later to work with the motions of the live actors. On occasion, Spike would be the only character to appear on screen, meaning only the set would be filmed. Director Miller commented \\"I never shot so much plain brown dirt in my life.\\" Fake saguaro cacti were purchased for $1,000 each, as the actual ones in the desert were not placed right for the action. The truck featured cost just $300, \\"and looks it\\". ==Critical reaction== It was not well received upon its initial airing. It suffered due to its release just months after the popular theatrically released feature Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The next day, This is America, Charlie Brown aired \\"The Birth of the Constitution\\". It was originally titled The Girl in the Red Truck, and supposed to air in March. Numerous production delays caused it to be aired in 1988, shortly after Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Roger Rabbit is widely considered to have significantly helped heralding in the Disney Renaissance, and the rebirth of American feature animation in general. While films throughout the ages have used a mix of animation and live-action (the Alice comedies, Song of the South, Mary Poppins), Schulz worried that viewers would assume he copied the new film's technique. Jill Schulz was instructed by her father to clearly emphasize the program's conception date during interviews.Johnson, page 197. The New York Times decided \\"the similarities between the two are superficial\\", describing it as \\"relatively primitive\\" and \\"generally clumsy\\", the interaction was \\"not terribly convincing\\". Of the show's plot, he commented that the \\"story goes nowhere.\\" Jill had been shouldering most of the blame.Johnson, page 198. John J. O'Connor, critic for The New York Times wrote \\"Part of the problem may be that this production is a family project, the sort of thing that gets bogged down in good intentions and parental pride...Although she is perky and likable, and she does a passable dance routine on roller skates, her performance does little or nothing to enliven the spiritless proceedings.\\" Schulz notes she stated that the director was very strict, often yelling at her. As of Good Grief being written in 1989, Schulz was still considering further attempts at a \\"masterpiece\\". Johnson suggested it might be \\"a quiet story about cancer\\", inspired by the special Why, Charlie Brown, Why? So far, the special received mixed to negative reviews. Recently, MetLife used the Peanuts characters in cartoon form for their live-action commercials, and would continue to use the characters until October 20, 2016. ==Voice cast== * Jason Riffle - Charlie Brown (voice briefly) * Steven Solifar - French Teacher on Cassette (voice briefly) * Jill Schulz - Jenny * Molly Brice - Molly * Greg Deacon - Jeff * Bill Melendez - Spike (voice) Snoopy has brief cameo appearances but is silent. ==References* Category:Peanuts television specials Category:Films with live action and animation Category:Films directed by Walter C.

The company has its origins in a venue known as The Gilded Balloon on Edinburgh's Cowgate, where artistic director Karen Koren first started promoting comedy events in 1986. When a fire in 2002 destroyed the original premises, Gilded Balloon shifted its Fringe operations to Teviot Row House in Bristo Square, which became the company's main venue. Gilded Balloon also operates outside the Fringe, running year round events at the Rose Theatre, Edinburgh. ==History== Gilded Balloon founder, Karen Koren, started promoting comedy at McNally's, a restaurant and club based in a townhouse at 6 Palmerston Place, near Haymarket Station, which opened in February 1985. The owner had intended to open a casino upstairs, but it was rejected for a licence. Koren, who was working there alongside other part-time jobs, including working for the Norwegian Consulate, was well- connected to people involved with the Comedy Store and had been observing the growth of comedy during the Edinburgh Fringe each year. Instead of the intended casino, she turned the room into a year-round performance space for comedians, particularly Scottish ones. Early performances included Craig Ferguson, Jerry Sadowitz, and duo Alan Cumming and Forbes Masson as glam double-act Victor and Barry. The Gilded Balloon itself was established by Karen Koren in 1986, staging seven shows a day in a building on Cowgate that was formerly J. & R. Allan's department store. The building was built in 1823 by James Spittal, a draper and silk merchant, who used it as a warehouse for his shop \\"The Gilded Balloon\\". It had twelve arches and a gentle curve on its South Bridge side. Its 3am late-licence meant it became a place for socialising, and Late'n'Live, a raucous late night show was started there. It became \\"a natural home\\" for comedians. In 1988, the Gilded Balloon devised the competition \\"So You Think You're Funny\\", which has been won by many notable comics including Rhona Cameron, Lee Mack, Dylan Moran, Tommy Tiernan and Peter Kay; other finalists have included Ed Byrne, Jason Byrne, Ardal O'Hanlon and Johnny Vegas. The competition was sponsored by Channel 4 from 1993 until 2004, with five and the Paramount Comedy Channel taking over in 2005. Karen Koren is one of the major supporters of Australian comedy talent, and has produced a number of notable Australian acts at the Gilded Balloon over the years, including Greg Fleet, and is particularly noted for being the springboard for the careers of Tim Minchin and Drags Aloud. During his early career, Russell Brand was forcefully ejected from the Gilded Balloon. In 2001, the Gilded Balloon expanded to include Teviot Row House in Bristo Square, which is owned by the Edinburgh University Students' Association. On 7 December 2002, a fire devastated its original Cowgate base. In 2007, the C venues used the space to create a new venue, the \\"Soco Urban Garden\\". For a short while the Gilded Balloon ran comedy nights at the Festival Theatre Studio in Edinburgh. ==Current venues== The Gilded Balloon continues to use Teviot Row House which, in 2014, contained nine performance spaces, The Debating Hall being the biggest, seating 360, and The Turret being the smallest at 50 seats. Other venues include The Dining Room, The Wine Bar, The Wee Room, The Nightclub, The Sportsman's, The Balcony and The Billiard room. In recent years, the Gilded Balloon has expanded into different venues. For several years it has held Fringe events at the National Museum of Scotland, billed as Gilded Balloon at the Museum. For one year in 2016, it also took over the Counting House venue from Laughing Horse and ran it on a pay-what-you-want model for audiences. Then in 2017, it took over the former Charlotte Chapel on Rose Street, now owned by dancer Peter Schaefuss. It now runs this as Gilded Balloon at the Rose Theatre on a year-round basis. Finally, in 2019, the Gilded Balloon started operating in two more venues - the Old Tolbooth Market, which had been a Free Fringe venue the previous year, and Adam House, which for many years had been the main venue in C Venues portfolio. The latter was billed as the Patter Hoose. Karen Koren's daughter, Katy Koren, became joint artistic director in 2015, with a view to taking over from her mother in due course. Gilded Balloon's year round base is on Commercial Street in Leith. ==References== ==External links== *The Gilded Balloon *Late 'n' Live *So You Think You're Funny?

P. Parset after P. Falconet Duchess of Richmond (1775 stipple engraving) William Wynne Ryland attempting suicide. William Wynne Ryland (1732 * Robert Edmund Graves or July 173829 August 1783) was an English engraver, who pioneered stipple engraving and was executed for forgery. ==Life and work== Ryland was born in London, the eldest of seven sons of Edward Ryland (died 1771), an engraver and copper- plate printer. He studied engraving under Ravenet in London, and, in Paris, drawing under François Boucher and engraving under Jacques-Philippe Le Bas. After spending five years on the continent he returned to England, and having engraved portraits of George III and Lord Bute (after Ramsay), and a portrait of Queen Charlotte and the Princess Royal after Francis Cotes , he was appointed engraver to the king, a position that carried a salary of £200 per annum. In 1766 he became a member of the Incorporated Society of Artists, and he exhibited with them and in the Royal Academy. In his later life Ryland abandoned line engraving, and introduced chalk-engraving, in which the line is composed of stippled dots, and in which he transcribed Mortimer's \\"King John Signing Magna Carta\\", and copied the drawings of the Old Masters and the works of Angelica Kauffman. Ryland became prosperous, and seeking an investment, went into partnership with a pupil, Henry Bryer, putting his money into a print shop in Cornhill, London; the business went bankrupt in December 1771. After an interval, he resumed business as a print-seller in the Strand, but before long retired to a private residence at Knightsbridge. ==Arrest and execution== By 1783 Ryland was suspected of involvement in forgery. He disappeared from his home on 1 April 1783. An advertisement was issued offering a reward for his apprehension, on a charge of forging and uttering two bills of exchange for £714 with intent to defraud the East India Company. On the arrival of officers to arrest him in a small house near Stepney, he made a desperate attempt to commit suicide by cutting his own throat. On 27 July he was tried at the Old Bailey before Sir Francis Buller. Suspicion had been raised when two bills had been found with the same number, however there was no evidence from the engravings as to which was the real bill and which the forgery. Only the evidence of the paper manufacturer, that the paper upon which Ryland's bill was printed had not been sold until after the date of the bill resulted in his being convicted, and sentenced to death. He was hanged at Tyburn on 29 August 1783, and buried at St Dunstan's Church in Feltham Middlesex.Pelham, Camden. The chronicles of crime; or, The new Newgate calendar, volume 1 (London T. Miles, 1887) pp. 308–310. According to Walford, \\" It is worthy of record that the last criminal executed here was one Ryland, who was hung for forgery in 1783; after which the gallows were taken down about London in order to concentrate the executions at Newgate and Horsemonger Lane\\". The poet William Blake prophesied 12 years earlier that Ryland would be hung. This prophecy was made when Blake was sent to be apprenticed to Ryland, however, he refused, saying \\"I do not like the man's face: it looks as if he will live to be hanged!\\" He left a widow and six children. His widow kept a print-shop for many years in Oxford Road, and his daughter became a teacher of drawing, and instructed the Princess Elizabeth and others of the royal family. One of Ryland's brothers was, in 1762, convicted of highway robbery, committed in a drunken frolic, and was reprieved only on the morning of the day of execution through his brother's personal influence with the king. ==Notes== ==References== * * * == External links == * Portrait engravings by Ryland (National Portrait Gallery, London) * Short biography (The Newgate Calendar - Ex-Classics Web Site) *Artwork in the Plymouth City Museum * Dormio Innocuus (engraving after Angelica Kauffman - British Museum) Category:1738 births Category:1783 deaths Category:People executed by the Kingdom of Great Britain Category:English engravers Category:Executed people from London Category:People executed for forgery Category:People executed by England and Wales by hanging ","title":"William Wynne Ryland"},{"id":"2587512","text":"DDR stamp showing the Soviet memorial statue at the Seelow Heights.

She was the second ship to be named for the city of Wichita, Kansas. The second Wichita (AOR-1) was laid down on 16 June 1966 at Quincy, Massachusetts, by the General Dynamics Quincy Shipbuilding Division; launched on 16 March 1968; sponsored by Mrs. Howard B. Yeager; and commissioned on 7 June 1969, Captain Robert R. Deibler in command. ==Service history== ===1969-1974=== After fitting out in the Boston Naval Shipyard, Wichita on 17 June sailed for the west coast. Following stops at San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and after transiting the Panama Canal, she arrived at Long Beach, California, her home port, on 19 July. For the next four months, she remained at Long Beach undergoing post construction availability. In December, she got underway to conduct standardization trials, followed by shakedown training. In February 1970, the ship began a two-month post-shakedown availability at Long Beach. In April, she began normal operations out of Long Beach, which included type training and damage control training which kept the ship busy until 22 June, when she began her first deployment to the western Pacific. She changed operational control to Commander, 7th Fleet on Independence Day and arrived in Subic Bay on 11 July. After adjusting her load at Subic, she got underway for her first line period in support of the combat ships operating off the coast of Vietnam. During her first deployment to the western Pacific, Wichita made five separate line swings to replenish the ships operating on Yankee Station. She terminated each at Subic Bay and varied her routine with two liberty calls at Hong Kong. The ship concluded her first deployment when she arrived back in Long Beach on 2 February 1971. Wichita with , before addition of the hangar. Wichita spent the next six months engaged in operations out of her home port. These included refresher training, underway replenishments, and port visits to other American and Canadian ports. She also participated as a support ship in the tests conducted on the new Mark 48 torpedo. On 7 August, she departed Long Beach for her second tour of duty with the 7th Fleet. She arrived in Subic Bay on the 24th and embarked upon her first line swing on the 31st. After two periods on station off Vietnam, Wichita visited Sattahip, Thailand, late in October. Two more line periods followed in November and early December. On 10 December, however, she received orders to join Task Force 74, a contingency force bound for the Indian Ocean in the wake of the Indo-Pakistani War. She remained in the Indian Ocean until early January 1972 at which time all ships returned to the operating area off the coast of Vietnam. Wichita, however, after a very brief tour on station off Vietnam went to Subic Bay for a much-needed upkeep. She made one more line swing to Yankee Station in February and then headed back to Long Beach, where she arrived on 31 March. Wichita remained in the United States only long enough to allow for the usual month of post-deployment leave and upkeep and to conduct some major repairs at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard. On 17 July, she again pointed her bow westward and set a course for the Far East. On 4 August, the ship arrived in Subic Bay. During the next six months, Wichita made six replenishment voyages to the waters surrounding Vietnam. She also made frequent stops at Subic Bay to load supplies and conduct repairs as well as liberty calls at Hong Kong and at Sattahip, Thailand. She concluded that deployment when she arrived back in Long Beach on 16 March 1973. The end of that deployment coincided with the end to American involvement in the Vietnam war. While that stopped Wichitas support of combat operations, it did not interrupt her pattern of deployments to the western Pacific. She settled into a more normal routine alternating peacetime operations with the 7th Fleet with routine duties along the west coast of the United States. After six months on the west coast of the United States, the ship embarked upon her fourth tour of duty with the 7th Fleet, her first under peacetime conditions. She provided routine support for the ships of the 7th Fleet and for the ships assigned to a fast carrier task force operating in the Indian Ocean. She returned to Long Beach on 26 March 1974 and, following post- deployment standdown and a brief period of west coast operations, entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 28 June to begin her first regular overhaul. She remained in the shipyard until the following January. ===1975-1979=== On 24 January 1975, her home port was changed from Long Beach to San Francisco. Four days later, she completed overhaul and got underway for the first time since early in the previous summer. Following trials out of Long Beach, a voyage to Acapulco, Mexico, and refresher training out of San Diego, Wichita finally arrived in her new home port on 4 April. After a month of preparations, the ship departed San Francisco on 6 May, bound for a seven-month deployment to the western Pacific. She arrived in Subic Bay on 24 May and began a tour of duty with the 7th Fleet characterized by a full schedule of underway replenishments and port visits to such places as Hong Kong, Sasebo, and Yokosuka in addition to Subic Bay. Her assignment lasted until 26 November at which time she departed Subic Bay to return home. She made a stop at Pearl Harbor early in December and reentered San Francisco on the 15th. Wichita spent the entire year of 1976 engaged in normal operations out of San Francisco. She participated in type training and in several operational readiness exercises. By the end of the year, she was preparing for her sixth deployment to the western Pacific. That deployment began on 12 April 1977 after a period of refresher training. After a somewhat extended voyage, she arrived in Subic Bay on 4 May. During this deployment, the ship initially operated from Subic Bay; but, after 26 July, she limited her activities to the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan, operating from the Japanese ports of Sasebo and Yokosuka. Those duties in support of the 7th Fleet continued until 6 November when she departed Yokosuka to return to the United States. She concluded the deployment at Alameda, California, on 21 November. Following post-deployment standdown, Wichita resumed normal west coast operations. These included the usual type training and operational readiness exercises as well as port visits to American and Canadian ports. She also helped to train naval reservists. While participating in the initial phases of RIMPAC 78, the ship visited Pearl Harbor on 5 and 6 April 1978 to take on stores and to give her crew a brief liberty. She returned to Pearl Harbor later in the month at the conclusion of her RIMPAC duties. Such activities as these occupied her time until 2 November when she entered the Triple A Shipyard at Hunters Point, California, to begin a nine-month overhaul. As of the summer of 1979, she was completing that overhaul. Completing the complex overhaul, the ship returned to its homeport of Alameda from Hunters Point Shipyard. During the period of May 1979 to March 1980, the USS Wichita completed refresher training and sea trials after the yard period. The ship won a Battle \\"E\\" award. ===1980-1990=== Ports of call were to Vancouver, BC for their Seafarer Festival, Mazatlán and San Diego. In 1980, the ship completed a WestPac that included ports of calls in Hawaii, Subic Bay, Philippines, Singapore, Diego Garcia, Misera Oman and Pattaya Beach, Thailand. While operating in the Indian Ocean, the ship lost a detached CH-46 helicopter, Sideflare 70, from Detachment 5 from Naval Air Station North Island. Three crewmen were lost at sea in the Gulf of Oman on 16 July 1980.USS Wichita AOR-1, 1980 cruise book, pg-1 They were LTJG Paul Cappellino, AT3 Philip Zahlout and AMS3 Robert Malvica.USS Wichita AOR-1, 1980 cruise book, pg-1 The Shellback initiation was cancelled to a later date. The Navy Expeditionary Medal was awarded to the crew during the 109 days in the Indian Ocean. For the trip to Alameda, one of the shafts spun a stern tube bearing and the shaft had to be locked down. The last port call was to Pattaya Beach and while transiting the Gulf of Thailand, the ship encountered a boat full of Vietnamese refugees being robbed by Thai pirates. The crew rescued the refugees and took them to Pattaya Beach where they were taken to a Refugee Camp. The crew received the Humanitarian Service Medal for their actions. The transit from the Indian Ocean to Alameda was on one shaft so this took almost 30 days. Also on the transit to Alameda, a mural was painted on the aft elevator by one of the Mess Specialists. On 20 July 1983 the New York Times reported that the Wichita along with seven other vessels in the Carrier Ranger Battle Group left San Diego on Friday 15 July 1983 and were headed for the western Pacific when they were rerouted and ordered to steam for Central America to conduct training and flight operations in areas off the coasts of Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras as part of major military exercises planned for that summer. Besides the carrier , the battle group was composed of the cruiser , the guided missile destroyer , the destroyers and , the frigate , the oiler Wichita and the support ship . While en route to Central America, the Wichita met the Ranger off the coast of San Diego. During \\"UNREP\\" the next day, the Ranger collided with the Wichita causing extensive damage to two sets of the Wichitas kingposts, winch control booths and the aft superstructure. Later in the deployment, because of that damage, the Wichita spent 3 weeks in Subic Bay for repairs and was detached from the Ranger Battlegroup which continued on into the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. Shortly after the repairs at Subic Bay, the Wichita became the lead support ship in the search for the KAL-007 Korean airliner that was shot down and spent 45 days at sea, searching off the coast of northern Japan. The ports of call in the '83 deployment included, Naval Station Panama Canal, Pearl Harbor, Guam, Subic Bay, Singapore, Chin Hae Korea, Pattaya Beach Thailand, Hong Kong, Yokosuka and Nagasaki Japan. The final Westpac tour of duty commenced in September 1989. Notable item which occurred during this WestPac includes participation of PACEX 89 which had the highest number of ships assembled together since the end of World War II. PacEx had five complete battle groups and a flotilla of Japanese ships aligned in six columns. Ports of call include Hong Kong in October, Philippines (Subic Bay) in November, Pattaya Beach, Thailand and Singapore in December, Diego Garcia in January, a working port of call in Muscat, Oman in February (five times), Ko Phuket, Thailand, and another visit to Subic Bay in February and a final port of call to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in March to clear customs and to pick up dependents for a tiger cruise back to the Naval Supply Center in Oakland, California. During the cruise, the Wichita was part of the battle group. Wichita was part of the Enterprise's battle group until after the port of call in Muscat, Oman. After that, the Enterprise and the proceeded to the East Coast of the USA to Norfolk, Virginia. Wichita became the lead ship of the remainder of that WestPac. During the period between the final WestPac deployment to the decommissioning of the Wichita, the ship completed some short-term deployments to Victoria, British Columbia, Mazatlan, Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and Portland, Oregon. During the deployment to Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta, the Wichita hosted a complement of US Coast Guard personnel for drug-smuggling operations. In addition, the ship was in the yards during the end of 1990 and received two CIWS turrets. :[1990-1993] ==Decommissioning== Wichita was decommissioned on 12 March 1993 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 February 1995. She was transferred to United States Maritime Administration on 18 December 1998 and laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, California. During 2013 she was recycled at EMR's International Shipbreaking Ltd. in Brownsville, TX, USA. == Awards == Wichita earned four battle stars for Vietnam service. Wichita earned the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for setting a record of replenishing the most ships in a 24-hour period (23 ships). ==References== * * * Category:Wichita-class replenishment oilers Category:Cold War auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Vietnam War auxiliary ships of the United States Category:United States Navy Kansas-related ships Category:Ships built in Quincy, Massachusetts Category:1968 ships ","title":"USS Wichita (AOR-1)"},{"id":"2587544","text":"Snoopy's Reunion is the 34th prime-time animated TV special based upon the comic strip Peanuts, by Charles M. Schulz. It originally aired on the CBS network on May 1, 1991 as part of the animated anthology series Toon Nite. It is one of three Peanuts projects to date (the others being Snoopy, Come Home and The Peanuts Movie) not to have \\"Charlie Brown\\" in the title (though the working title was Those Were the Days, Charlie Brown) and one of the few Peanuts specials to feature adults on-screen. ==Summary== The story begins at the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm, set at the time of Snoopy's puppyhood. While still puppies, Snoopy and his siblings quickly become adept musicians, with each puppy learning to play an instrument. Snoopy plays the guitar, Spike plays the first fiddle, Belle on the second fiddle, Marbles on banjo, Olaf on jug, Molly on mandolin, Rover on steel guitar, and Andy on drum set. Time goes by, and the owner puts a sign which reads \\"PUPPIES FOR SALE\\". Missy, Snoopy and his siblings' mother, and the puppies cry as when they see the sign. The puppies realize they are going to be parting ways when they are sold from the puppy farm. Meanwhile, Charlie Brown, depressed from a recent defeat, arrives home to an empty, unwelcoming house. He tells his sister Sally he needs to have someone to welcome him home after a defeat, like a dog. Back at the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm, Snoopy and his siblings are all playing music together. Snoopy is sold to Lila, his first owner. His siblings are also sold, one by one. Lila and Snoopy have fun together for a brief time in Lila's house, which is at first shown with her family living in a neighborhood. Lila and her family move to an apartment building and are told by the landlord that no pets are allowed. Lila's mother tells her they can no longer keep Snoopy, and that that Snoopy must go back to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm. Lila responds by crying out loud \\"But Mom...! They can't do that! It's too unfair! It's heartful break! How can I ever tell him?\\" Lila tells Snoopy,\\"Snoopy? I have to talk to you. You are a good puppy. And I love you very much\\". Lila tells him about the sad news. She says that she can no longer keep him because pets are not allowed, and that she is very sorry he has to go back to the puppy farm. She promises him that she will visit him. With her mother, Lila returns Snoopy to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm and tearfully says goodbye and that she is going to miss him. The owner of the puppy farm tells Snoopy that he promises to find him a new home and owner. He has not failed yet. He goes back to the chalkboard and reinstates Snoopy's name on the list. Snoopy is the only puppy who becomes purchased by an owner, only to be returned back, and (temporarily) still living at the puppy farm. The next buyer turns out that it is going to be Charlie Brown, who decides it's time for him to get a dog. He and Linus head to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm. He negotiates with the owner and is able to purchase Snoopy for $5. While talking to the owner, Linus looks at some paperwork. The owner of the puppy farm tells Charlie Brown that a dog like Snoopy costs more than $5 and may be expensive, but senses Charlie Brown is the right owner for Snoopy, and sells Snoopy for $5. Linus tells Charlie Brown that Snoopy had a previous owner and is a \\"used dog\\". Charlie Brown happily takes him home, tries to train him, and soon realizes that he is an unusual dog. A montage showcases some of his abilities, such as playing baseball, sledding, surfing, and tennis. After about a lustrum (five years), Charlie Brown realizes that Snoopy misses his family and invites him and his siblings to a reunion at the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm. Invitations are sent to Belle, Spike, Olaf, Marbles, Molly, Rover, and Andy, who unanimously agree to the reunion. Each one excitedly heads to the reunion, carrying their respective instruments. They all arrive at Charlie Brown's house. He, Sally, Snoopy, and Snoopy's siblings get on a bus to visit the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm for their reunion. Eventually, they arrive at the Daisy Hill bus stop. Instead of the puppy farm, all they see is a parking garage. Charlie Brown is confused, and asks the bus driver if it's the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm. The bus driver insists that it is. Snoopy and his siblings exit the bus and play music on the sidewalk in front of the parking garage. They do not realize Daisy Hill Puppy Farm had been demolished and replaced with a parking garage. Charlie Brown explores the area and discovers an old \\"Puppy For Sale\\" sign half buried in the dirt pile. He says out loud they are in fact, at the puppy farm. He shows Snoopy and his siblings their old home and that it has become a parking garage. Despite the loss of the puppy farm, Snoopy and his siblings seem happy to be together again, and continue to play more music. Charlie Brown later realizes that the reunion has made Snoopy and his siblings happy, and declares it was a reunion even if it was not the best. He then wonders how Snoopy's siblings are going to get home. Snoopy responds by getting into his World War I flying ace costume, and ushers them up on top of his doghouse (i.e. Sopwith Camel). The camera cuts back to Charlie Brown and Linus, insinuating that Snoopy is flying his 'plane'. All his siblings have go back home. Charlie Brown is shocked and wonders aloud how he could do that, to which Linus replies, \\"Well, he's your dog, Charlie Brown\\". ==Continuity== Charles Schulz did not consider material from the television specials and films to be canonical with the Peanuts comic strip. This results in the following continuity errors: *In the comic strip, Snoopy existed as Charlie Brown's dog long before Sally and Linus were born. In this special, Charlie Brown doesn't acquire him until long after they were born. *In the comic strip, Charlie Brown and Snoopy knew each other way before Charlie Brown adopted Snoopy. In this special, Charlie Brown sees Snoopy for the first time. *In the comic strip, Snoopy acts as an ordinary dog prior to his adoption by Charlie Brown. In this special, he is already well talented when Charlie Brown adopts him. *Originally in the strip and later in the 1972 movie Snoopy, Come Home and the 1980 special Life Is a Circus, Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown tells Linus about how a kid dumped sand on him and made him cry, and the next day he and his parents went to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm to get Snoopy. In this special, they both go to get him. *In the strip and Snoopy, Come Home, Linus calls the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm to find out about Snoopy's history when he goes to see Lila in the hospital, and finds out that he was a \\"used dog\\". In this special, when Charlie Brown and Linus go to pick him up, Linus finds out about his history in a ledger sitting on a desk. *In the strip, Snoopy (and Woodstock) find out on their own that the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm (Snoopy's old home) was closed and demolished and turned into a parking garage. In the special Charlie Brown discovers this and shows this to Snoopy and his siblings. Charlie Brown even says a line similar to what Snoopy says in the strip: \\"Do you realize what happened? They're parking on your memories!\\". In the strip, however, Snoopy is shown with Woodstock at this. Snoopy (as Woodstock looks on) says about the parking garage (which is what the puppy farm was turned into after it was demolished), \\"YOU STUPID PEOPLE! YOU ARE PARKING ON MY MEMORIES!\\". ==Voice cast== *Phil Shafran: Charlie Brown *Josh Keaton: Linus van Pelt *Kaitlyn Walker: Sally Brown *Bill Melendez: Snoopy and his siblings *Megan Parlen: Lillian \\"Lila\\" Emmons Allcroft (flashback appearance) *Laurel Page: Lila's mom (flashback appearance and seen) *Steve Stoliar: Bus driver/Mr. Allcroft ==References== ==External links== * Category:Peanuts television specials Category:Television programs directed by Sam Jaimes Category:1990s American television specials Category:1990s American animated films Category:American films Category:1991 television specials Category:1991 in American television Category:CBS original programming Category:CBS television specials Category:Television shows written by Charles M.

Born in Cedar County, Iowa he started wrestling as a teenager and made money traveling around the Midwest wrestling in carnivals and fairs. As a professional he claimed the American Heavyweight Championship by defeating Evan \\"Strangler\\" Lewis in 1895 and held the title for two years, during the time when contests were legitimate. At this time. Martin Burns himself claimed to have wrestled in more than 6,000 matches and is said to have lost only seven.The Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum, Martin “Farmer” Burns After the end of his active wrestling career he started a successful wrestling school in Omaha and later coached Cedar Rapids' Washington high school to the first Iowa high school state wrestling tournament title. He died in Council Bluffs in 1937. In 2001 Martin \\"Farmer\\" Burns was inducted into the International Wrestling Institute and Museum Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 2002. The Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame inducted Martin Burns in 2003. ==Childhood== Martin Burns was born on February 15, 1861, in a log cabin on a farm in Cedar County, Iowa. Growing up amidst the Civil War, Burns was exposed at an early age to the sport of wrestling, which was a preferred activity among the soldiers while stationed in camp. Consequently, the sport's popularity further increased during the 1860s, and many historians also speculate that the added interest may be due to the fact that President Abraham Lincoln had himself been a champion wrestler in his younger years (it is documented that Lincoln once beat the Louisiana State Champion in New Salem, LA in 1831). Burns wrestled impromptu matches as a child; and at age 8, he tossed an older rival to claim a fifteen cent prize. His father died when he was 11, leaving him to support his mother, brother, and five sisters. To earn money, Burns worked at a nearby farm for $12 per month; and while he received little schooling, it was this physical labor that enabled Burns to develop his tremendous physical strength. He also spent time working in grading camps, where he competed in regular competitions against rugged strongmen. However, while these men focused on brute strength, Burns spent much time meticulously perfecting the strategies and techniques of catch wrestling, which is a grappling style where various holds and tactics are used with the intent to either submit or pin both opponent's shoulders to the ground at once. Therefore, the combination of Burns’ superior conditioning, intellect, and advanced skill made him a nearly unbeatable wrestling opponent. ==Early career== By 1880, Martin Burns had developed a formidable reputation; and at 19, he wrestled his first match against a professional grappler when he battled David Grafft to a 2-hour and 19 minute draw. He then honed his skills against the top pro wrestlers of the day, losing decisions to Henry Clayton and Tom Connors in 1886 and 1887 respectively. The defeat to Clayton particularly irked Burns, as he was unable to offset the feared stranglehold that subsequently earned Clayton the moniker Evan “Strangler” Lewis (long before the more famous Ed “Strangler” Lewis was ever born). Consequently, Burns launched into a rigorous program of neck development; and soon built an immense 20” neck that possessed such strength that he could be dropped six feet on a hangman's noose to no effect (a stunt that Burns would often perform at carnivals and fairs). While on a trip to Chicago in the spring of 1889, Burns saw a sign offering $25 to anyone who could last fifteen minutes against top grapplers Jack Carleek and Evan Lewis. Burns accepted the challenge and showed up at the Olympic Theater dressed in his regular farmer's overalls. Consequently, the event's announcer introduced Martin to the crowd as “Farmer” Burns; and the “Farmer” promptly made a monkey out of Carleek, throwing him across the stage before being declared the winner after fifteen minutes. The next challenge was Burns’ much-awaited rematch against Evan “Strangler” Lewis, who was now the reigning Catch-as-Catch-Can Heavyweight Champion, having defeated Joe Acton on March 14, 1887. However, fifteen minutes proved not enough time for Lewis to throw Burns; and again, the unknown “Farmer” was declared the winner and was subsequently lauded as a wrestling hero the next day in Chicago newspapers. Reverse Back-body-hold as illustrated in Lessons in Wrestling & Physical Culture by Martin Burns. ==American Champion== Following Farmer Burns’ emergence as a premier grappler, he traveled the country, taking on the greatest wrestlers of the day, while also beating all comers at carnivals. Though he weighed just 165 pounds, he regularly defeated men who outweighed him by as much as 50-100 pounds. At the time, professional catch- as-catch-can (freestyle) wrestling often used no time limit, and a match was usually decided when a wrestler “threw” his opponent to the ground. However, Burns became known as the master of the pinfall, as he perfected the art of trapping his opponents’ shoulders to the mat while contriving such dangerous maneuvers as the full and half-nelson, hammerlock, double-wrist lock, chicken wing, and a variety of submission toe holds. Farmer Burns soon encountered the renowned Sorakichi Matsuda, who is regarded as Japan's first-ever pro wrestler, and who had been a top challenger to World Wrestling Champions William Muldoon and Ernest Roeber during the previous decade. The two faced off in Troy, NY on May 13, 1891, and Burns scored his biggest win yet when he pinned Matsuda in just four minutes. As a result, Farmer Burns soon became known as the world's premier all-around grappler; and between 1890–93, he never lost a single fall. Then, on March 2, 1893, Evan Lewis was recognized as wrestling's American Heavyweight Champion when he beat Ernest Roeber to unify the American Greco-Roman Heavyweight Championship with the Catch-As-Catch-Can Championship. This set up yet another rematch between Farmer Burns and Strangler Lewis; and on April 20, 1895, Burns pinned Lewis to capture the title. Burns would go on to reign as wrestling's American Champion for two years until he was finally beaten by Dan McLeod and Tom Jenkins in 1897. ==Retirement and Post-Career== Nevertheless, Farmer Burns’ greatest contribution to wrestling's evolution may be as a trainer. He opened a gymnasium in Rock Island, Illinois in 1893, and helped to establish schools that enlightened young grapplers to the world of catch wrestling. In 1899, Burns defeated a 21-year-old Iowan named Frank Gotch, but he recognized his raw talent and recruited him as his prized student. Burns would then mold Gotch into perhaps the greatest wrestling champion of all-time, as he defeated George Hackenschmidt in 1908 to claim the undisputed World Heavyweight Title. In addition, Farmer Burns also served as a teacher to a myriad of grapplers who would transform the sport in the early 1900s, including future World Champion Earl Caddock, future Middleweight World Champion and Champion Wrestler of the A.E.F. Ralph Parcaut, as well as creative pioneer Joseph “Toots” Mondt. Other big names he personally trained included Rudy Dusek, Joe Malcewicz, Emil Klank, Jess Westergaard, Fred Beell and Jack Sherry. It is said he trained more than 1,600 wrestlers in all.Hornbaker, Tim, Farmer Burns Wrestling History http://www.legacyofwrestling.com/FarmerBurns.html Burns was so respected as a trainer that he was even recruited to serve as the conditioning coach for boxer Jim Jeffries’ 1910 title bout against Jack Johnson. In 1914, Burns published a 96-page mail-order course entitled The Lessons in Wrestling and Physical Culture, which incorporated breathing techniques, calisthenics, stamina exercises, and Eastern martial arts principles, thus becoming the bible for all aspiring wrestlers during the early 1900s. Moreover, it is said that Ed “Strangler” Lewis, the great wrestling champion of the 1920s and 30s (and the eventual teacher of Lou Thesz) got his start in wrestling by following Burns’ training methods. Consequently, it is because of Burns’ many efforts that his native state of Iowa has subsequently become the nation's amateur wrestling capital, with the University of Iowa consistently serving as an NCAA powerhouse, and with the International Wrestling Institute and Museum also based in Newton. On March 31, 2017, Burns was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as a part of the Legacy wing. ==Personal life== Burns had two sons, Raymond and Charlie, who became musicians in Chicago, and a daughter, Celia Burns Beem. He suffered the loss of his wife Amelia in 1930, which led to the deterioration of his own condition. At this point he went to live with his daughter who died in 1951.Hornbaker, Tim, Farmer Burns Wrestling History http://www.legacyofwrestling.com/FarmerBurns.html ==Death== Farmer Burns grave in St. James Cemetery Burns died on January 8, 1937, in Council Bluffs, Iowa at the age of 75, and was buried at the St. James Cemetery in Toronto, Iowa. ==The \\"Farmer\\" Burns Workout== The \\"Farmer\\" Burns workout is a custom workout routine developed by Martin Burns for himself and his students. It is based only on resistance provided by one's own body, a pair of dumbbell weights, and supplemental aerobic exercise, such as running. The workout consists of three phases of exercises organized into sets and repetitions. The first phase is a combination of warm-ups and stretches, using only one's own body for resistance. The second phase uses a pair of dumbbells for resistance, otherwise resembling aerobics in appearance. The third phase of exercises are partner exercises, again only relying on the two persons' bodies for resistance. Martin Burns' career success is often accredited greatly in part to this intense workout routine. ==Feats of Strength== Burns was well known in the early twentieth century for his neck. He managed to have a twenty-inch neck. With this neck, according to an article in WWE Magazine, he gained fame by being put into a noose, getting hanged, and living, while whistling \\"Yankee Doodle\\". ==Championships and accomplishments== * Catch wrestling ** World Catch-as-Catch-Can Championship (1 time) ** American Catch-as-Catch-can Championship (1 time) * Iowa Sports Hall of Fame :*Inducted by Des Moines Register in 1951 * George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame ** Class of 2001 * Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame :*Pioneer Era inductee in 2003 * Wrestling Observer Newsletter :*Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame (Class of 2002) * WWE :*WWE Hall of Fame (Class of 2017) * Other titles ** American Heavyweight Championship (1 time) ** World Light Heavyweight Championship (2 times) ==Nicknames== * Farmer * The Grandmaster of American Wrestling ==ReferencesWrestling Museum * Martin \\"Farmer\\" Burns * The \\"Farmer\\" Burns workout Category:1861 births Category:1937 deaths Category:American catch wrestlers Category:American male professional wrestlers Category:People associated with physical culture Category:People from Cedar County, Iowa Category:Professional wrestlers from Iowa Category:Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum Category:19th century professional wrestlers Category:WWE Hall of Fame Legacy inductees ","title":"Martin Burns"},{"id":"2587549","text":"The North Slope is a neighborhood of the north end of Tacoma, Washington, located south of Yakima Hill. == Background == Although there is no truly defined boundary for the North Slope, and it overlaps with Yakima Hill under some definitions, the area typically is considered to border North I Street on the northeast, Division Avenue on the southeast, and North Steele Street on the west. This area is known as the North Slope because it is both (mostly) at a slope and because the streets within it are at a slant relative to the grid of the rest of North Tacoma. Two streets, North State Street and North Trafton Street, as well as portions of North 8th Street, also may be considered part of the North Slope, with a southern boundary on 6th Avenue.

North Grant Avenue caps off the south end of the district. The North Slope has 1,285 resources and is one of the state's largest historic districts. The District was settled primarily as a residential neighborhood and contains a wide variety of architectural styles including Stick Style, Queen Anne, Craftsman, American Foursquare, Tudor Revival, and Mission Revival. Within it you will find many churches, apartments, and a few business areas. The neighborhood developed over time and it is common to find structures built 20, 30 or even 50 years later. There were three building booms within the district: 1888 to 1893, 1902 to 1915, and 1919 to 1929.

He was also the de facto head of the Russian Orthodox Church in 1925–1943, firstly as deputy Patriarchal locum tenens (1925–1937) subsequently as Patriarchal locum tenens (1937–1943). ==Early life== Ivan Stragorodsky was born in the town of Arzamas, Nizhny Novgorod Governorate in a deeply religious family of an archpriest. Named Sergius after becoming a monk, he studied in Nizhny Novgorod seminary and later in Saint Petersburg Theological Academy. In 1890 Sergius was sent with an Orthodox Christian mission to Japan and became fluent in Japanese (he already knew Greek, Latin and Hebrew). In 1899 he returned to Saint-Petersburg Theological Academy and was appointed its rector. In 1901 Sergius was consecrated bishop of Jamburg, the vicar of St. Peterburg diocese. In 1905 Sergius was appointed as archbishop of Vyborg and all Finland. Grigori Rasputin contacted him as one of the first in the capital. In 1911 he became a member of the Russian Holy Synod. On August 10, 1917 he was transferred to the see of Vladimir and Shuya and on November 28 of the same year, Patriarch Tikhon elevated him to the rank of Metropolitan Bishop. Bolsheviks arrested Metropolitan Sergius in January 1921; after months in jail he was exiled from Moscow to Nizhny Novgorod. From June 16, 1922 to August 27, 1923, Sergius participated in the so-called Living Church (or Renovationist schism), but later publicly repented of his actions and was forgiven by Patriarch Tikhon. He was appointed the Metropolitan of Nizhny Novgorod on March 18, 1924.Дневники Святого Николая Японского. Том II. Санкт-Петербург, Гиперион, 2004. стр 295 == Election == Knowing that it would not be possible to conduct proper elections of the Patriarch upon his death, Patriarch Tikhon made a will where he appointed three candidates, one of whom would assume the leadership of the Church after Tikhon's own death. On April 12, 1925, one of the candidates, Metropolitan Peter of Krutitsy was elected as the Patriarchal Locum Tenens (Местоблюститель Патриаршего Престола).Документы Патриаршей канцелярии 1926—1927 годов (комментарий в аспекте культуры) However, only 8 months later, on December 10, 1925 he was arrested. Foreseeing his imminent arrest, he followed Tikhon's example, likewise appointing three candidates to succeed him. After Peter's arrest, Sergius of Nizhny Novgorod was the only bishop from Peter's \\"list\\" who was not in prison or exile at the time. He assumed leadership of the Church with the title Acting Patriarchal Locum Tenens (Заместитель Патриаршего Местоблюстителя), which presupposed that Peter of Krutitsy remained the de jure locum tenens and would return to his duties upon his release (which never happened). However, Sergius himself also was again in prison from November 30, 1926 till March 27, 1927. ==Patriarchate== Seeking to convince Soviet authorities to stop the campaign of terror and persecution against the Church, Sergius tried to look for ways of peaceful reconciliation with the government. On July 29, 1927, he issued his famous Declaration where he professed absolute loyalty of the Russian Orthodox Church to the Soviet Union and to its government's interests. The Declaration, albeit well-intended, sparked an immediate controversy among the Russian churchmen, many of whom (including many notable and respected bishops in prisons and exile) broke communion with Sergius. Later, some of these bishops reconciled with Sergius, but many still remained in opposition to the \\"official Church\\" until the election of Patriarch Alexius I in 1945. Sergius also formed the Temporary Patriarchal Council (later called Synod) which received recognition from the Soviet government. In 1934, Sergius assumed a more elevated title of \\"His Beatitude, Metropolitan of Moscow and Kolomna\\" and in 1936, following a false report of Metropolitan Peter of Krutitsy's death in prison (in fact, he was still alive until his execution in 1937), Sergius assumed the position of Patriarchal Locum Tenens. Despite his pledges that the ROC would not interfere in secular affairs and would be loyal to the state, the arrests and executions of Orthodox clergy by the GPU and later the NKVD, destruction of Orthodox cathedrals, churches, icons, seminaries and so on were commonplace throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Before the beginning of the German-Soviet War, in the entire USSR, only 4 bishops remained who were not imprisoned or exiled. Likewise, of the 50,000 Russian Orthodox priests in 1918, only 500 remained by 1935.Прием товарищем И. В. СТАЛИНЫМ Митрополита Сергия/№ 01 сентябрь 1943/Архив Журнала Московской Патриархии с 1943 по 1954 год Only after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 did Joseph Stalin finally start to scale back the anti-religious campaign, needing the moral support of the Church during the war. In the early hours of September 5, 1943, Stalin met with the three chief hierarchs of the Russian Orthodox Church and promised some concessions to religion in exchange for their loyalty and assistance. Among the concessions were the permission to open the Moscow Theological Seminary and Academy, the release of imprisoned clerics, the return of some church property, including the famous Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra. In return, the Soviet government put the Church under the control of its secret services. However, the most important concession was the permission to gather the episcopal council and to elect a new Patriarch. On September 8, 1943, at a Council of Bishops, Sergius was elected Patriarch of Moscow. He was enthroned on September 12 of the same year, already being advanced in age (76 years old) and with declining health.К истории Русской Церкви в годы Великой Отечественной войны (комментарий в интересах нации) He died in Moscow eight months later, on May 15, 1944. ==References== ==External links== * Сергий (Страгородский) * Сергий, Страгородский Category:1867 births Category:1944 deaths Category:People from Arzamas Category:People from Nizhny Novgorod Governorate Category:Metropolitans and Patriarchs of Moscow Category:Orthodox Archbishops of Finland Category:Russian people of World War II ","title":"Patriarch Sergius of Moscow"},{"id":"2587561","text":"Coccoloba pubescens, known as grandleaf seagrape, largeleaf, mountain-grape, and Eve's umbrella, is a species of Coccoloba native to coastal regions of the Caribbean: on Antigua, Barbados, Barbuda, Dominica, Hispaniola, Martinique, Montserrat, and Puerto Rico.USDA Plants Profile: Coccoloba pubescens ==Description== Grandleaf seagrape is a medium-sized tree growing to 24 m tall, with an open, sparsely branched crown.

The name derives from the French word, bateau, which is simply the word for boat and the plural, bateaux, follows the French, an unusual construction for an English plural. In the southern United States, the term is still used to refer to flat-bottomed boats, including those elsewhere called jon boats. == Construction== Bateaux were flat-bottomed and double- ended. They were built with heavy stems at bow and stern and a series of frames amidships, likely from natural oak crooks when available, and planked with sawn boards, likely pine although builders would have used whatever material was available. These boats would have varied from place to place, from builder to builder and also evolved over time, however in general, they were long and wide. The bottoms were planked and flat, without a keel, but possibly with a larger \\"keel-plank\\" in the center and sometimes reinforced with cross cleats. The sides were planked, tapering to sharp at either end. ==History== The French explorers of North America used batteaux as well as the native canoes and cartols. The boats' shallow draft worked well in rivers while its flat bottom profile allowed heavy loading of cargoes and provided stability. The smallest batteau required only one crewman, while larger ones required up to five and reach up to in length. The largest batteaux could carry two to ten tons of cargo. Batteaux could mount a small sail although the flat bottom was not optimal for sailing. In military records, it is seen that the boats were propelled primarily by oars with one oar being used at the stern as a rudder. Of Louisiana in 1763 it was described: \\"Beyond the mouth of the Missouri river the bateau of no prying New Orleans trader had ever penetrated.\\" The same author wrote of the Roanoke Valley, Virginia: \\"One may make a pleasant voyage on the New River from this point to Eggleston's Springs, further down the current, taking one of the many bateaux which ply constantly on the stream, and simply drifting on the lazy wave until the destination is reached.\\" In the same book, the spelling is given as \\"batteaux\\": > Along the Greenbrier and New Rivers adventurous boatmen ply in \\"batteaux\\", > carrying merchandise or travelers who wish to explore the wonders of the New > River cañon. …Our artists, who made the tour of the New River cañon in a > batteau, found it an exciting experience. At the junction of the Greenbrier > and New Rivers they engaged one of the boats used in running the rapids. > This boat was long by wide, and was managed by three negroes,—the > \\"steersman\\", who guided the boat with a long and powerful oar; the headsman, > who stood on the bow to direct the steersman by waving his arms; and an > extra hand, who assisted with an oar in the eddies and smooth parts of the > river. :— Two colonial bateaux in the Buffalo Inner Harbor. These 25-foot replicas were built based on the remains of 1756-era colonial bateaux recovered by the Adirondack Museum from Lake George in 1960. Many types of batteaux were deployed by the Colonial French and British militaries, with the largest capable of mounting small cannon or swivel guns. In the wilderness with many rivers but few bridges, batteaux were sometimes constructed, used, then purposely sunk to prevent the enemy from discovering them and using them to raid behind the passing army. Alternately, utilizing the stability of their flat bottoms, batteau could be strung together to form pontoon bridges, which are, therefore, sometimes known as \\"batteau bridges\\". Some British military batteau of the French and Indian War could haul twenty men or 12 barrels of supplies with a smaller crew. In the Revolutionary War, an extant plan of the British Admiralty calls for batteau of in length, with a beam and a depth of .\\"\\"Batteaux and 'Battoe Men': An American Colonial Response to the Problem of Logistics in Mountain Warfare\\" , New York State Military Museum, accessed September 11, 2007 Specific designs were developed to suit local conditions. Batteau were used as freight boats on canals in the northern U.S. until replaced by the larger canal boats in the early 1800s. James River batteau were large craft designed for hauling tobacco on Virginia's large rivers, while Mohawk River batteau were smaller and of very shallow draft (and sometimes with awnings).\\"The Batteau\\" , New York State Museum, accessed September 11, 2007 Most of the inland navigations in the southern United States, penetrating the Piedmont by way of the river valleys, were for bateau.National Register of Historic Places Inventory and Nomination, US Department of the Interior, National Park Service, accessed July 3, 2010. Batteaux were a very important part of the American culture. The town of Ronceverte, West Virginia, commemorates the logging and batteau industry with an annual outdoor theater, Riders of the Flood, where the spring rains sent harvested timbers down the Greenbrier River for the sawmills. An ark is used in the play, a scaled-down model of the original crafts that accompanied the batteaux downriver for the spring floods. West Virginia author W. E. Blackhurst used \\"bateau\\" in his books of Pocahontas County and the Greenbrier River. These boats figure in the logging-era book Riders of the Flood, on which the play of the same name is based. This batteau was primarily for logging, meant to maneuver quickly and withstand dangerous river conditions and is built differently from the New River batteau at the confluence of the Greenbrier River.The New River Atlas: Rediscovering the History of the New and Greenbrier Rivers, published by the Virginia Canals and Navigations Society, 2003. ==See also== * Ark (river boat) * Boat * Cumberland pontoon * Durham boat * James River bateau * Mackinaw boat * Punt * York boat ==References== ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== * Reconstructed Mohawk River bateau * Military bateau reenactors * Military bateau specifications * Mohawk River bateau * James River Batteau Festival * In Search of Lake George's Colonial Warships (VHS; 1991) Category:Boat types Category:Human-powered vehicles Category:Fur trade ","title":"Bateau"}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},H={class:"card-container"};function I(s,a,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Life Quotes🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",H,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const L=d(R,[["render",I]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/65.md","filePath":"drive/65.md"}'),D={name:"drive/65.md"},E=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(a,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{x as __pageData,E as default};
