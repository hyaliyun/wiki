It was discovered by German-born astronomer William Herschel on April 6, 1785. The galaxy lies at a distance of approximately from the Milky Way. NGC 4725 is the brightest member of the Coma I Group of the Coma-Sculptor Cloud, although it is relatively isolated from the other members of this group. This galaxy is strongly disturbed and is interacting with neighboring spiral galaxy NGC 4747, with its spiral arms showing indications of warping. The pair have an angular separation of , which corresponds to a projected linear separation of . A tidal plume extends from NGC 4747 toward NGC 4725. This is a suspected type 2 Seyfert galaxy with a supermassive black hole at the core. The morphological classification of this galaxy is SAB(r)ab pec, indicating a peculiar, weakly-barred spiral galaxy (SAB) with a complete ring surrounding the bar (r) and somewhat tightly-wound spiral arms (ab). It is actually double-barred, a feature found among about a third of all barred spirals. The galactic plane is inclined by approximately 46¬∞ to the line of sight from the Earth. The ring structure of the galaxy is a region of star formation. It is offset from the galactic center and displays non-circular motion. There is a compact radio source positioned approximately from the nucleus of NGC 4725. Since there is no optical counterpart at that position, this may be a star forming region that is heavily obscured by dust. Multiple supernova candidate events have been detected in this galaxy: * SN 1940B was detected on a photograph taken May 5, 1940, about northeast of the galactic core. The light curve indicates this was a type II supernova. * Candidate SN 1987E was detected April 24, 1987 with a magnitude of 15.65. A follow-up study failed to detect this event, so it may have been the result of gravitational lensing. * SN 1999gs was detected on December 28, 1999 with a magnitude of 19.3. It was positioned west and south of the nucleus of NGC 4725. * On automated images taken July 5, 2016, a magnitude 17.0 transient source was discovered at an angular separation of from the galactic nucleus. Designated ASASSN-16gu (AT 2016cyu), this was most likely a supernova event.

The film featured Kishore Kumar, his two brothers Anoop Kumar and Ashok Kumar, and Madhubala. Kishore Kumar sang many of the songs in the film, along with Asha Bhosle. The music was composed by S. D. Burman, and the lyrics were written by Majrooh Sultanpuri. The success of the film led the brothers to act in another comedy titled Badhti Ka Naam Dadhi (\\"That Which Grows Is a Beard\\") to rhyme with the name of this film. The film was remade in Marathi in 2006 as Saade Maade Teen. == Plot == Brothers Brijmohan, Manmohan and Jagmohan Sharma run a garage. Brijmohan hates women and does not allow any women or pictures of them in his garage unless it is an emergency. One day, while Manmohan is on the night shift, a woman named Renu comes to the garage seeking help as her car breaks down. Renu gets angry at Manmohan because he is sleeping when he is supposed to be on duty. Manmohan does not like the fact that Renu shouted at him and initially refuses to repair her car, but finally agrees. Manmohan fixes the car, and Renu leaves, forgetting to pay Manmohan for his services. He tells his brother Brijmohan about this and realizes that Renu forgot her purse in the garage. Manmohan goes through it and finds a pass to a concert. Manmohan goes to this concert to recover his money. When Manmohan reaches the venue, he is not allowed to enter as the pass has Renu's name on it. Not wanting to let go of his money, Manmohan waits in Renu's car to meet her when she comes out. He, however, falls asleep and Renu does not notice him; she drives home and parks in her garage with Manmohan in the car. When Manmohan wakes up, he gets hungry and looks for some food in Renu's garage. A servant in the house sees this and chases Manmohan, who manages to escape. On his way home, he notices a few men dumping a corpse on the road and fleeing. When he tells his brothers about his night the next morning, they have a hearty laugh at his expense. Later, Renu calls the garage asking for help with her car and assuring she will pay back her fees. Manmohan refuses to go to her house, fearing that he will be recognized by Renu's servant and will get into trouble; Jagmohan decides to go. Jagmohan meets Sheela in Renu's house and the two start talking. Jagmohan is, however, afraid of women. He gets nervous because Sheela is around and cannot repair the car. After Jagmohan takes off (not before drinking 10 glasses of water due to anxiety), Renu decides to call Manmohan. Meanwhile, Renu's father is approached by Raja Hardayal Singh, who wants to get his younger brother married to Renu. Renu's father decides to talk to Renu about this, not knowing that Raja Hardayal and his brother are crooks ‚Äì Manmohan saw Raja Hardayal's brother dump the corpse. As Renu is falling for Manmohan and the crooks desperately want her inheritance, Renu and Manmohan are captured by Hardayal's men. In captivity, they meet Kamini, the woman whose photo Renu had found in Brijmohan's room. Brijmohan and Kamini were in love, but she was married off to Raja Hardayal. Brijmohan is under the impression that she dumped him for a richer man; as a result, he decides that he never wants to associate with women again. Kamini tries to free Renu and Manmohan, but a guard enters. Kamini, however, is able to escape and goes looking for Brijmohan. Meanwhile, Raja Hardyal Singh captures Renu's father and forces him to get Renu married to his brother, threatening to kill Manmohan if he doesn't. Before Raja Hardayal Singh has his way, Brijmohan is brought to the scene by Kamini. Brijmohan, who is a boxing champion, fights Raja Hardyal Singh's men with the help of his two brothers. In the end, Brijmohan and his brothers are victorious. Manmohan and Renu decide to get married. So do Brijmohan and Kamini, and Jagmohan and Sheila. == Cast == * Ashok Kumar as Brijmohan Sharma * Kishore Kumar as Manmohan \\"Manu\\" Sharma * Madhubala as Renu * Anoop Kumar as Jagmohan \\"Jaggu\\" Sharma * Sahira as Sheela * Veena as Kamini * K.N.

To his disgust, the film became a success; as he did not want to add to his earnings, he gave Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi and all its rights to his secretary Anoop Sharma, who retained the copyright. The income tax case on Kishore Kumar was not solved even after forty years. == Soundtrack == The music is composed by S.D. Burman and his son, R. D.

A non-profit corporation operating as a public- private partnership, the CTF was financed by contributions from the Government of Canada through the Department of Canadian Heritage and the Canadian cable and direct-to-home satellite industries. The CTF developed and implemented policies to offer financial contributions to Canadian producers through specific program funding streams. File administration of these programs was contracted to the Television Business Unit at Telefilm Canada. On 1 April 2010, the Canadian Television Fund became the Canada Media Fund after merging with the \\"Canada New Media Fund\\". ==Responsibilities== The Department of Canadian Heritage sets out objectives for the CTF within a Contribution Agreement. The main goal of the CTF is to support the creation and broadcast in peak viewing hours of high-quality Canadian television programs in both official languages in the genres of Drama, Children's and Youth, Documentary, and Variety and Performing Arts, and to build audiences for these programs. The CTF must also: * allocate one-third of its resources to French-language programming and two-thirds to English-language programming; * support the production of Aboriginal-language programming; * encourage production by majority and minority official-language sectors; * provide incentives for regionally based productions; * set aside an envelope to support French- language productions from producers outside of Quebec; * implement a mechanism that enhances access to the CTF by programs supported by educational broadcasters; * provide developmental support, including script and pilot development; * allocate an envelope for programs licensed by CBC/Radio-Canada; * ensure appropriate levels of market access for broadcaster-affiliated production companies and independent production companies, with no competitive advantage in French or English broadcast markets; * support language versioning and subtitling. The CTF provides financing for the development, production and broadcast of Canadian-made programming in French, English and Aboriginal languages in the following genres: Drama, Children's and Youth, Documentary, and Variety and Performing Arts. The CTF provides four types of contributions to projects: repayable advances (development); grants (versioning); licence fee top-ups (production); and equity investments (production). The CTF makes financial contributions through five funding streams: Broadcaster Performance Envelopes, Development, French-language Projects Outside Quebec, Aboriginal-language Projects, and Versioning Assistance. Eligible projects must meet the following four Essential Requirements (4ER) before they can be submitted for consideration to any stream of funding (with the exception of 2ER documentaries): * The project speaks to Canadians about and reflects Canadian themes and subject matter. * The project will be certified by the Canadian Audio-Visual Certification Office (CAVCO) and has achieved 10/10 points (or the maximum number of points appropriate to the project), as determined by the CTF using the CAVCO scale. * Underlying rights are owned and significantly and meaningfully developed by Canadians. * The project is shot and primarily set in Canada. The level of the CTF's contribution to a production varies by genre, language and the stream of funding through which the contribution is obtained. Each funding stream may provide a mix of licence fee top-ups and equity investments, according to a set formula. NB: Some contributions may take forms other than equity or licence fee top-up, such as grants or advances. ==Timeline== In 1994, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) proposed establishing a funding initiative that would focus on facilitating the production and broadcast of high-quality Canadian television programs in under-represented categories during peak viewing periods. Its revenues were to come from contributions by broadcasting distribution undertakings (i.e., cable and direct-to-home satellite providers) at a certain percentage of their revenues. What follows is a brief history of the Canadian Television Fund (CTF): 1995 CRTC establishes Cable Production Fund (CPF). Goal: Facilitate the production and broadcast of high-quality Canadian television programs in under-represented categories during peak viewing periods. 1996 Department of Canadian Heritage invites the CPF to join it in a redefined public-private partnership in conjunction with Telefilm Canada's Broadcast Development Production Fund. Result: CPF renamed Canada Television and Cable Production Fund (CTCPF). 1997 Regulatory framework changes made. Result: CTCPF renamed Canadian Television Fund (CTF) in 1998. 2005 Transition begins, establishing new relationship with Telefilm Canada. Goal: Telefilm Canada becomes responsible for the administration of CTF files, while the CTF continues to lead the development of strategic policy and program guidelines, research and to report on audiences and funding results. The Canadian Television Fund (CTF) receives its funding from two primary sources: the Department of Canadian Heritage and broadcasting distribution undertakings (BDUs). In addition, the CTF receives revenue from recoupment on production investments made through its Equity Investment Program. Under licence agreements with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, BDUs are required to contribute up to 5% of their gross broadcasting revenue to Canadian programming, with 1.5% to 5% to be contributed to production funds. Of the total contributions to production funds, at least 80% must be directed to the CTF. By fostering the growth of television production in Canada through financial investment and industry research, the Canadian Television Fund (CTF) supports the development of Canadian talent, programs and audiences. Since 1995, the CTF has contributed to the creation of over 25,000 hours of Canadian programming and has infused over $2.5 billion into the industry, triggering the production of over $8 billion of Canadian programming. CTF-supported productions have cultivated thousands of jobs in the Canadian television sector. On December 20, 2006, Jim Shaw, CEO of Shaw Communications Inc. informed the Canadian Television Fund that he would be pulling approximately $56 million per year out of the fund.1 The move was later followed by Vid√©otron (a subsidiary of Quebecor Inc.) who announced their plans to withdraw their contributions on January 23, 2007.2 On July 20, 2007, Keith Mahar, a former manager at broadcaster CHUM Limited, submitted a report to the CRTC, entitled Profiteering in the Name of Culture, respecting the Canadian Television Fund . The submission recommends a judicial review of alleged CRTC corruption related to the Fund which he contends has unjustly enriched cable companies. As per Mr. Mahar, Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regulations, cable and satellite television distributors in Canada are required to contribute 5% of their revenue to the fund, which the companies can pass on to their customers in the form of inflated rates service. Since such consumer costs are embedded in their fees for service, consumers are subject to pay the 5% levy plus P.S.T. and G.S.T. on the cost of the company subsidy program. A copy of the submission is posted on the CRTC public file. On February 7, 2008, Mahar issued a press release covered by Reuters which was critical of Prime Minister Stephen Harper for his alleged failure to act on information respecting related activities by the CRTC and corporations in the affair. ==External links== * Canadian Television Fund website Category:Canadian mass media regulation Category:Department of Canadian Heritage Category:Television organizations in Canada Category:1998 establishments in Canada Category:2010 disestablishments in Canada ","title":"Canadian Television Fund"},{"id":"2557042","text":"A golden triente minted at Braga during the reign of Wittiza and bearing his (rough) effigy WittizaGotho-spanish name probably derived from Gothic name Wittich (related to Gothic hero Vidigoia). (Witiza, Witica, Witicha, Vitiza, or Witiges; 687 ‚Äì probably 710) was the Visigothic King of Hispania from 694 until his death, co-ruling with his father, Egica, until 702 or 703. ==Joint rule== Early in his reign, Ergica made it clear that his intention was to secure his family in a position of power from which they could not be removed. Based on a charter dated to Ergica's seventh year (November 693 to November 694) which mentions Wittiza as co-king, it is probable that Wittiza was made co-ruler in 694, even though the Chronicle of 754 places the event in 698.Collins, Visigothic, 108. Numismatic analysis of coinage types also supports the thesis that Wittiza ruled from 694.Numismatic evidence of Wittiza's coinage also indicates that the city of Reccopolis founded by Reccared I was still in use as a mint in the early eighth century (Thompson, 64). The raising of Wittiza to the kingship coincided with the revolt of Suniefred and may have been either its cause or effect. On 15Thompson, 249. or 24 NovemberCollins, Visigothic, 109. 700, Wittiza was anointed king; this forms the last entry in the Chronica Regum Visigothorum, a Visigothic regnal list. The delay between his appointment as co-regent and his unction, to which much importance was ascribed, is most probably explained by his coming of age, likely fourteen, in that year. Wittiza was Ergica's son by Cixilo,Also spelled Cixila, Cixillo, or Cixilona. daughter of the previous king Erwig, who was dismissed by her husband in late 687 after a short marriage and thus puts a limit on the possible date of birth of Wittiza. Sometime during the joint reign of Ergica and Wittiza, a Byzantine fleet raided the coasts of southern Hispania and was driven off by Theudimer. The dating of this event is disputed: it may have occurred as part of Leontios' expedition to relieve Carthage in 697, perhaps later, around 702, or perhaps late in Wittiza's reign.Bachrach, 31. A plague broke out at Constantinople in 698 and it spread westward across the Mediterranean reaching Hispania in 701.Collins, Visigothic, 110. It was severe enough to force the two kings from their capital of Toledo and it might be that this was the period when Wittiza was sent by his father to rule in Tui in Gallaecia over the regnum Suevorum, an event recorded by the Chronicle of Alfonso III. Although often dismissed by scholars, there is numismatic evidence that suggests Wittiza's subkingdom was a reality.L√≥pez S√°nchez, \\"Moneda\\", 177. ==Sole rule== The death of Ergica can be dated to 702 (traditionally) or 703 (based on the fact that Ergica promulgated a law in his sixteenth year, which began on 24 November 702).Collins, Visigothic, 111. ===Concessions upon succession=== Soon after his death, the Eighteenth Council of Toledo was held under the supervision of Wittiza and the archbishop of Toledo, either Gunderic or Sindered. The acts of the council are lost to us, but may have been highly controversial, leading to their suppression. Wittiza may have forced the council to force marriage upon the Catholic clergy.Collins, Arab, 15‚Äì19. The Chronicle of Alfonso III reports that he tried to make the bishops of the realm marry. There is a reference in the Chronicle of 754 to Wittiza commanding Sindered to exert pressure on the established clergy, but what exactly this means is unknown. It may mean that he pressured the Eighteenth Council to ratify the decision of the Quinisext Council that clerical marriage was permissible: according to the Chronicle of Alfonso III, Fruela I of Asturias (757‚Äì68) reversed this ruling.Collins, Arab, 19. The collective sense is that Wittiza made an effort to reform corruptions in the Visigothic Catholic church.Bradley, The Goths, 356. Of Wittiza's early acts after his father's demise was the rescission of the exile of several noblemen. He returned their slaves and confiscated property, and reinstated them in their palatine offices.Collins, Visigothic, 112. Wittiza also had the cautiones written against them burned publicly. The cautiones were probably pledges, cessions, or confessions the exiles had been forced to sign; or statements of debt to the treasury. Wittiza also returned land which his family was holding to the royal fisc in accordance with the law. All this activity was probably a response to complaints made about his father's rule and which he considered politically wise to correct. The Chronicle of 754 calls Wittiza \\"merciful\\", and only criticizes the method of his succession, probably in reference to these events and to the hated Ergica.Thompson, 249. Wittiza's reputation for mercy and mildness is accepted by historians today. Bachrach, 31, quotes Ziegler saying \\"in general 'he [Wittiza] ruled more mildly than his father.'\\" ===Legislation=== During his years of sole government, Wittiza promulgated two new laws and issued a revised version of the Liber Iudiciorum.King, 131. This reissue, too, may be related to the political situation following Ergica's death and Wittiza's need to consolidate his authority and the support of the nobility and the clergy. Though he himself passed no legislation further oppressing the Jews, Wittiza also probably did not repeal the legislation of his father in that regard. A thirteenth-century chronicle by Lucas of Tuy accuses Wittiza of relieving the oppression of the Jews and being eager for their support in an attempt to smear him as a \\"Jew-lover.\\"Bachrach, 31. Among the German historians who reject Lucas' account are Graetz, Katz, and Dahn, while Scherer and Ziegler affirm it. The Spanish historian Altamira also believes Lucas' story. The accuracy of Lucas' statement, despite the lateness of it, has been bolstered by the fact that Lucas was from Tui, the Galician city whereat Wittiza probably ruled as sub-king under his father at one point. Perhaps the people of Tui preserved an oral tradition or perhaps the canons of XVIII Toledo were available to Lucas.Bachrach, 31‚Äì32. A law sometimes attributed to Ergica which prescribes the caldaria (ordeal of boiling water) for those accused of theft no matter how small the sum has been attributed to Wittiza by some.Thompson, 249, according to whom it represents the \\"nadir of Visigothic legislation.\\" Collins, \\"Sicut\\", 504, explains that manuscripts differ in attribution to Ergica or Wittiza. ==Death, succession crisis and legacy== The date of Wittiza's death and the end of his reign are unknown. The several surviving regnal lists imply a death year of 710 (sometimes with a death month of FebruaryBradley, The Goths, 357.) while the Chronicle of 754 implies 711. Whatever the case, the Chronicle strongly implies that he was assassinated in a coup led by Roderic with the support of a faction of nobles.Collins, Visigothic, 113. Others believe he died a natural death.Hodgkin, 234. At the time, the king was still only in his twenties. After his death, natural or forced, or deposition, Hispania was divided between rival claimants: Roderic in the south and Achila II in the north.Collins, Visigothic, 132. Agila may have been a son of Wittiza's and a co-monarch (from about 708), but this would require that he be either a child king or that Wittiza not be the son of Cixilo. Others say Wittiza left two sons not yet of age. At the time of his death, \\"he was beloved in the highest degree by the people and equally hated by the priesthood.\\"Hodgkin, 233, quoting Dahn. A similar sentiment is expressed by Bradley, The Goths, 357. Whatever the actual circumstances surrounding the end of Wittiza's reign, memory of him was not positive a century and a half later. The Chronicle of Moissac, circa 818, wrote that Witicha deditus in feminis exemplo suo sacerdote ac populum luxuriose vivere docuit, irritans furorem Domini: \\"Wittiza left a poor example to his clergy and his people by his unchaste life, thus provoking the fury of the Lord.\\"Hodgkin, 233 n34. The Chronicle of Alfonso III mentions his many wives and mistresses and how he brought \\"ruin to Hispania\\",Collins, Visigothic, 136. while the Chronicle of 754, written less than a half century after his death, records that he brought \\"joy and prosperity\\" to the kingdom. The \\"sons of Wittiza\\", who are otherwise unknown, are made out by the Chronicle of Alfonso III to be traitors who helped deliver Hispania to the Moors. Oppa, a shadowy but historical figure, is reputed to have been either a brother, half-brother, or a son of Wittiza, though the latter is impossible based simply on Wittiza's youthfulness and Oppa's reputed age in 711. According to the Rotensis version of the Chronicle of Alfonso III, Wittiza had three sons: Olmund, Romulus, and Ardabast (Artabasdus), who became Count of the Christians of Coimbra.Garc√≠a Moreno, 153. Olmund is a Gothic name, Romulus is Roman, and Ardabast (Artavasdes) is PersianEncyclopaedia Iranica: ARTAVASDES. Old Iranian male personal name. accessed September 2014. (through Armenian). ==Legend== According to American writer and historian Washington Irving, in the first part of his 1835 Legends of the Conquest of Spain, Wittiza's reign initially showed great promise. \\"He redressed grievances, moderated the tributes of his subjects, and conducted himself with mingled mildness and energy in the administration of the laws.\\" However, the honeymoon lasted only a short while. Soon Wittiza \\"showed himself in his true nature, cruel and luxurious.\\"Irving, Legends, \\"The Legend of Don Roderick,\\" Chapter I. Coming to doubt the security of his throne, he ended the careers of two relatives regarded as rivals: Favila, Duke of Cantabria, and Theodofred, duke of C√≥rdoba, who lived in retirement at court. Wittiza had Favila killed and Theodofred blinded then imprisoned in the C√≥rdoba dungeon. The son of Favila, who we are told was Pelayo, happened to be elsewhere at the time and was thus spared for the major role he would later play in history. The son of Theodofred was Roderic, duke of Baetica, who escaped to Italy. At last feeling safe, the king \\"gave reins to his licentious passions, and soon, by his tyranny and sensuality, acquired the appellation of Witiza the Wicked.\\" Specifically, using secret orders he demolished castles that he feared could be used by future internal enemies, oblivious to the possibility that he was weakening the kingdom's defenses against foreign invaders. And at court, inspired by the custom of Muslim rulers, he \\"indulged in a plurality of wives and concubines, encouraging his subjects to do the same.\\" In later times such stories were told of Wittiza because, in opposition to the policies of the Church hierarchy, he had been lenient toward the Jews and had encouraged the clergy to marry. Therefore, when the kingdom met sudden ruin in the first year of his successor Roderic (a favorite of the Church), this was readily explained by alleging that the sins of Wittiza \\"had drawn down the wrath of Heaven upon the unhappy nation.\\" As the story goes, it was in an attempt to save Hispania from such divine punishment that the exiled Roderic returned from Italy with an army. Wittiza was soon defeated in the field and taken captive. Roderic was then crowned king at Toledo, after which he avenged his father by having Wittiza blinded and imprisoned at C√≥rdoba. There the former king \\"passed the brief remnant of his days in perpetual darkness, a prey to wretchedness and remorse.\\"Irving, Legends, \\"The Legend of Don Roderick,\\" Chapter II. Meanwhile, Wittiza's two sons, Evan and Sisebut, were banished or escaped to Tangier in Africa. ==Sources== *Bachrach, Bernard S. \\"A Reassessment of Visigothic Jewish Policy, 589‚Äì711.\\" The American Historical Review, Vol. 78, No. 1.

He later became a partner and then took over ownership of the business after his uncle's death. Garland served as mayor of Portage la Prairie for two years, and was a city alderman for a further eight. He also was president of the local Board of Trade. In 1898, Garland married Kathleen Fox. In religion, he was a member of the Church of England. He was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1914 provincial election, defeated Liberal candidate Charles D. McPherson by ten votes in the constituency of Lakeside. The Conservatives won a majority government, and Garland served as a backbench supporter of Rodmond Roblin's administration. In 1915, the Roblin administration was forced to resign from office amid a serious corruption scandal. A new election was called, in which the Liberals won a landslide majority. Garland lost to Mcpherson by 163 votes. He died in Portage la Prairie at the age of 51. == References == Category:1873 births Category:1925 deaths Category:Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba MLAs ","title":"John J.

They usually present with an abdominal mass. The disease is most commonly diagnosed during a child's first three years of life.http://hepatoblastoma.mditv.com/generalinfo Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels are commonly elevated, but when AFP is not elevated at diagnosis the prognosis is poor. ==Signs and symptoms== Patients are usually asymptomatic at diagnosis. As a result, disease is often advanced at diagnosis. ==Pathophysiology== Micrograph showing a hepatoblastoma (right of image) and normal liver (left of image). H&E; stain. Liver tumor types by relative incidence in adults in the United States, with hepatoblastoma at right.Table 37.2 in: Hepatoblastomas originate from immature liver precursor cells, are typically unifocal, affect the right lobe of the liver more often than the left lobe, and can metastasize. They are categorized into two types: \\"Epithelial Type\\" and \\"Mixed Epithelial / Mesenchymal Type.\\" Individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a syndrome of early-onset colonic polyps and adenocarcinoma, frequently develop hepatoblastomas. Also, beta-catenin mutations have been shown to be common in sporadic hepatoblastomas, occurring in as many as 67% of patients. Recently, other components of the Wnt signaling pathway have also demonstrated a likely role in constitutive activation of this pathway in the causation of hepatoblastoma. Accumulating evidence suggests that hepatoblastoma is derived from a pluripotent stem cell. Syndromes with an increased incidence of hepatoblastoma include Beckwith Wiedmann syndrome, trisomy 18, trisomy 21, Acardia syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, von Gierke disease, and familial adenomatous polyposis.Zimmerman A, Saxena R. Hepatoblastoma. In: WHO Classification of Tumours of the Digestive System, 4th, Bosman FT, Carneiro F, Hruban RH, Theise ND (Eds), IARC, Lyon 2010. p.229. ==Diagnosis== The most common method of testing for hepatoblastoma is a blood test checking the alpha-fetoprotein level. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is used as a biomarker to help determine the presence of liver cancer in children. At birth, infants have relatively high levels of AFP, which fall to normal adult levels by the second year of life. The normal level for AFP in children has been reported as lower than 50 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) and 10 ng/ml in adults. An AFP level greater than 500 (ng/ml) is a significant indicator of hepatoblastoma. AFP is also used as an indicator of treatment success. If treatments are successful in removing the cancer, the AFP level is expected to return to normal. ==Treatment== Surgical removal of the tumor, neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to tumor removal, and liver transplantation have been used to treat these cancers. Primary liver transplantation provides high, long term, disease-free survival rate in the range of 80%, in cases of complete tumor removal and adjuvant chemotherapy survival rates approach 100%. The presence of metastases is the strongest predictor of a poor prognosis. ==References== == External links == *humpath #2775 (Pathology images) Category:Hepatology Category:Small- blue-round-cell tumors Category:Gastrointestinal cancer Category:Pediatric cancers ","title":"Hepatoblastoma"},{"id":"2557069","text":"Nicholas \\"Little Nick\\" Corozzo (born March 17, 1940) is an American New York mobster who was the reputed acting boss of the Gambino crime family. ==Biography== Nicholas Corozzo was born on Pitkin Avenue in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn. Nicholas Corozzo's first headquarters was located in a small candy store on the corner of Eastern Pkwy & Atlantic Ave. in the Ocean Hill section of Brooklyn, known as \\"The Hill\\" to his crew members. He later opened a social club next to the candy store which became his new headquarters. Corozzo later moved his headquarters to the Canarsie section of Brooklyn. Nicholas is the older brother of alleged reputed Gambino consigliere Joseph \\"Jo Jo\\" Corozzo as well as twin brothers Blaise Corozzo, a Gambino soldier, and Anthony Corozzo who is an associated of the Gambino crime family. Anthony Corozzo is a longtime parishioner of Our Lady of Loreto Church located at the corner of Pacific St. & Sackman St. in Brownsville, Brooklyn where he attended regular Sunday mass. Anthony Corozzo along with his lifelong friend and Gambino crime family associate Dominick Mondelli AKA Donny Mondelli, were well known for organizing neighborhood reunions and charitable events for the church for decades. Nicholas Corozzo is the uncle of Joseph Corozzo Jr, a high-profile New York defense attorney. Nicholas' daughter, Bernadette, is married to Gambino associate Vincent Dragonetti. Prior to Corozzo's incarceration, he lived in Bellmore, Long Island. He stands at 5‚Ä≤5\\" tall and weighs approximately 170 pounds. ==Rise to family boss== During the early 1980s, Nicholas Corozzo was a bitter rival of Gambino capo John Gotti. When Gotti became boss in 1985, he declined to promote Corozzo to capo. However, since Corozzo was such a good earner for the family, Gotti did not want to get rid of him. In turn, Corozzo professed loyalty to Gotti.\\"Nicholas Corozzo: Gambino Capo Escapes Dragnet\\" AMV Case Files Fugitives It was only after Gotti went to prison in 1992 that Corozzo was finally promoted to Caporegime, along with Gambino soldier Leonard \\"Lenny\\" DiMaria. With Gotti in prison, Corozzo, DiMaria, and Nicholas' brother Joseph, now the alleged consigliere, formed a ruling panel that unofficially ran the Gambino family. In the mid 1990s, Corozzo was elevated to acting boss of the family.\\"John Gotti - The Last Mafia Icon\\" Crime Library on truTV.com In 1996, Corozzo allegedly ordered the murder of Lucchese crime family associate Robert Arena. Arena had allegedly murdered Anthony Placido, a member of Corozzo's crew, and had failed to return some stolen marijuana to a drug dealer.Gambino Capo Nicholas Corozzo Sentenced Friend of Ours April 18, 2009 On June 26, 1996, the Gambino gunmen found Arena driving with Thomas Maranga, an Arena childhood acquaintance with no criminal connections, in the Mill Basin section of Brooklyn. After forcing Arena to stop the car, the gunmen shot and killed both men. However, till this day there is no concrete evidence that Corozzo ordered the murder of Robert Arena. ==Florida arrest== In December, 1996, Corozzo was indicted in Miami, Florida on 20 racketeering charges that included attempted murder, arson, and loansharking. Corozzo was accused of running a loansharking business in Deerfield Beach, Florida that charged 260% yearly interest on loans.\\"Attorney for Corozzo Denies his Client has Ties to the Mob\\" Sarasota Herald-Tribute, December 20, 1996 Federal agents arrested Corozzo as he emerged from the surf at a beach in Key Biscayne, Florida.Reputed New Gambino Boss is Arrested\\" New York Times December 19, 1996 In August 1997, Corozzo pleaded guilty to racketeering charges in Florida and was sentenced to five to ten years in prison. Later that year, Corrozo again pleaded guilty in Brooklyn to racketeering and bribing a jail guard. While in federal prison, Corozzo shared a cell with Gambino associate Joseph Vollaro, who was serving a drug conviction. After his release, Vollaro started paying tribute to Corozzo's crew on a trucking company he started. However, facing another drug conviction in 2004, Vollaro agreed to become a government informant and record his conversations with Corozzo.\\"Accused Gambino Leaders Indicted in Sweep\\" New York Times February 8, 2008 After Corozzo's release from prison on June 10, 2004, Corozzo was again expected to take over Gambino crime family. However, due to increased law enforcement attention, he initially kept a low profile. The Gambinos were reportedly led by Jackie D'Amico until 2005. Corozzo kept his position as a Caporegime, despite health concerns and tight parole restrictions. In 2006, a new report stated that Nicholas Corozzo and D'Amico were the new bosses of the Gambino family, with Arnold \\"Zeke\\" Squitieri as underboss and Joseph Corozzo as consigliere. ==Indictment and prison== In February 2008, Corozzo was indicted twice, one for the federal Operation Old Bridge and the other for the state Operation Touchback. The federal indictment was for the 1996 Arena and Maranga murders and other racketeering charges, with Vollaro as their main witness. The state indictment, prosecuted by Queens County District Attorney Richard A. Brown, Organized Crime and Rackets Bureau Chief Gerard A. Assistant District Attorney Benjamin J. Mantell, included the top count of enterprise corruption surrounding a Queens-based gambling ring that grossed almost $10 million over two years from sports betting.\\"Gambino Captain, Others Busted for Sports Gambling\\" North Country Gazette, February 7, 2008 Amid a roundup of 62 mobsters named in an indictment, Corozzo had fled his Long Island home. The FBI searched intensively for Corozzo and the television program America's Most Wanted did a feature on him. On May 29, 2008, after four months as a fugitive, Corozzo walked into the FBI's New York City office and surrendered. In July 2008, Corozzo pleaded guilty to the state enterprise corruption charges. On April 17, 2009, Corozzo was sentenced to 13 and a half years in federal prison for 1996 Arena and Maranga murders.

Egica, Ergica, or Egicca (c. 610 - 701x703), was the Visigoth King of Hispania and Septimania from 687 until his death. He was the son of Ariberga and the brother-in-law of Wamba. ==Accession== He was married (c. 670) to Cixilo (also known as Cixilona, Cioxillo, or Cixila), the daughter of his royal predecessor Erwig and wife Liuvigoto. On his deathbed on 14 November 687, Erwig confirmed Egica as his heir and sent him with the royal court to Toledo to be crowned.Collins, Visigothic Spain, 105. He was anointed on 24 November. Upon Egica's marriage to Cixilo, Erwig had made him swear an oath to protect Erwig's children. Before his death Erwig required a second oath, swearing not to deny justice to the people. Shortly after taking the throne, Egica called the Fifteenth Council of Toledo on 11 May 688, at which he claimed the two oaths were contradictory (because to do justice to the people required \\"harming\\" Erwig's children) and asked the council of bishops to release him from one or the other. Egica, however, met the opposition of Julian of Toledo. The council allowed Egica to abandon his wife but only partially rescinded the oath to protect Erwig's children. Egica waited until Julian's death in 690 to call a second provincial council of Tarraconensis, which resulted in Erwig's widow, Liuvigoto, being sent to a convent. ==Notable Events== In 691, Egica oversaw the beginning of the building of the Church of San Pedro de la Nave in Zamora. In 693, the metropolitan of Toledo, Sisebert, led a rebellion against Egica in favor of raising a man named Suniefred to the throne. The rebels controlled Toledo for a time, because they were able to mint coins in the potential usurper's name.Collins, Visigothic Spain, 72. The plan to assassinate Egica, the dowager queen Liuvigoto, and several main counsellors failed, and Sisebert was defrocked, excommunicated and his descendants were barred from holding office. The other rebels and their descendants were sold into slavery. ==Legislation== In 694, Egica enacted the most severe anti-Jewish law by a Visigothic king yet. This was in response, so he claimed to the Seventeenth Council of Toledo, to a conspiracy of domestic and foreign Jews to overthrow Christian leaders. Egica declared all Jewish-held land forfeit, all Jews to be enslaved to Christians, and all Jewish children over the age of seven to be taken from their homes and raised as Christians. Jewish-owned Christian slaves were to be invested with the Jews' property and to be responsible for paying the taxes on the Jews. This law was not applied in towns where Jews were deemed indispensable to the economy. Indeed, as a result of disintegrating Visigothic power, it was hardly enforced beyond the capital city itself. Shortly before he died, Egica amended a law which stated that anyone accused of theft of goods worth 300 solidi was to undergo a trial by boiling water. Under Egica's changes, anyone accused of theft for whatever amount would have to undergo this ordeal. At the same time, Egica published several laws which dealt harshly with the issue of fugitive slaves, while simultaneously rescinding laws which permitted slaveholders to mutilate their slaves as punishment. Egica also remitted taxes, but this does not seem to have boosted his popularity. He got the bishops to order prayers to be said in his name and that of his family in every cathedral in Hispania. ==Death and succession== As early as 694 he co-ruled with Wittiza, his son by Cixilo, even though Wittiza was a minor. In one of his very last acts he had Wittiza anointed in 700. Egica died in his bed, with his succession secured, sometime between 701 and 703. His other two sons were Don Oppas, and Sisebuto. Don Oppas, who was possibly a bastard son, was Archbishop or Bishop of Seville and joined Musa bin Nusair and Tariq ibn Ziyad against Roderic during the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. Sisebuto became the Comes of the Christians of Coimbra, as did his son Ataulfo, his grandson Atanarico and his great-grandson Teudo in 770, 801/802 and 805. ==Sources== * Collins, Roger.

The park straddles the border between South Africa and Botswana and comprises two adjoining national parks: * Kalahari Gemsbok National Park in South Africa * Gemsbok National Park in Botswana The total area of the park is . Approximately three-quarters of the park lies in Botswana and one-quarter in South Africa. Kgalagadi means \\"place of thirst.\\" In December 2015, media reports claimed that rights for gas-fracking in more than half of the Botswana portion of the park had been sold. The Botswana government later refuted these reports. African News Agency: Botswana dismisses reports of fracking rights in pristine Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park Mining Weekly ==Location and terrain== The park is located largely within the southern Kalahari Desert. The terrain consists of red sand dunes, sparse vegetation, occasional trees, and the dry riverbeds of the Nossob and Auob Rivers. The rivers are said to flow only about once per century. However, water flows underground and provides life for grass and camelthorn trees growing in the river beds. The rivers may flow briefly after large thunderstorms. ==Wildlife== The park has abundant, varied wildlife. It is home to large mammalian predators such as lions, cheetahs, African leopards, and hyenas. Migratory herds of large herbivores such as blue wildebeest, springbok, eland, and red hartebeest also live and move seasonally within the park, providing sustenance for the predators. More than 200 species of bird can be found in the park, including vultures and raptors such as eagles, buzzards, and secretary birds. Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit and a lion stronghold in Southern Africa.IUCN Cat Specialist Group (2006). Conservation Strategy for the Lion Panthera leo in Eastern and Southern Africa. IUCN, Pretoria, South Africa. ==Weather== The weather in the Kalahari can reach extremes. January is midsummer in southern Africa and the daytime temperatures are often in excess of . Winter nights can be quite cold with temperatures below freezing. Extreme temperatures of and up to have been recorded. Precipitation is sparse in this desert area. ==Facilities== Within the park there are three traditional tourist lodges, called \\"rest camps\\". These are fully serviced lodges and include amenities such as air conditioning, shops and swimming pools. There are also six wilderness camps in the park. The wilderness camps provide little more than shelter and wash water; visitors must supply their own food, drinking water and firewood. == Visitors == During the year 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018, the park received a total of 52,463 visitors up from 48,221 in the previous year. ==History== The Kalahari Gemsbok National Park in South Africa was established on 31 July 1931 mainly to protect the migrating game, especially the gemsbok, from poaching. In 1948 an informal verbal agreement was made between the then Bechuanaland Protectorate and the Union of South Africa to set up a conservation area in the contiguous areas of the two lands. In June 1992 representatives from the South African National Parks Board Board (now SANParks) and the Department of Wildlife and National Parks of Botswana set up a joint management committee to manage the area as a single ecological unit. A management plan was drafted, reviewed, and approved in 1997. The parties agreed to cooperate in tourism and share equally in park entrance fees. On 7 April 1999, Botswana and South Africa signed a historic bilateral agreement whereby both countries undertook to manage their adjacent national parks, the Gemsbok National Park in Botswana and the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park in South Africa as a single ecological unit. The boundary between the two parks had no physical barriers, although it is also the international border between the two countries. This allowed for the free movement of animals. On 12 May 2000, President Festus Mogae of Botswana and President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa formally launched Southern Africa's first peace park, the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. ==Cultural preservation and establishment of !Xaus Lodge== In October 2002, the governments set aside 580 km¬≤ (224 mi¬≤) for the use of the native peoples, the Khomani San and Mier communities. This was divided between 277.69 km¬≤ of San Heritage Land and 301.34 km¬≤ of Mier Heritage Land. The South African National Parks (SANParks) manages the land under contract. This land was named the !Ae!Hai Heritage Park. The settlement agreement also provided for the communities to receive funds for the specific purpose of constructing a tourism facility. The lodge was named !Xaus Lodge (meaning 'heart' in the local language) and is managed commercially on behalf of the ‚Ä°Khomani San and Mier communities by Transfrontier Parks Destinations. !Xaus Lodge's existence allows the cultural practices of the ‚Ä°Khomani San to continue in a few ways. The cultural village near the Lodge allows the local people to create and sell their crafts. This is both a way for them to emulate and remember the culture of historical ‚Ä°Khomani San, and a way for them to express the changes in that culture. The !Ae!Hai Heritage park has also been named the first International Dark Sky Sanctuary in Africa by the International Dark Sky Association. ==Fracking== In December 2015, it was reported in the media that the government of Botswana quietly sold the rights to frack for shale gas in Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park.

In November 2007 it became a division of Cessna. ==History== In 1994 NASA launched the Advanced General Aviation Transport Experiments (AGATE) project in an attempt to re-energize the rapidly shrinking general aviation (GA) market. A series of factors, including new regulatory requirements and immense legal liability lawsuit settlements made the GA field unprofitable and most manufacturers had abandoned production of piston-engined light aircraft to concentrate on the business turbine aircraft market. As a result, GA design work had basically ended and aircraft for sale in 1990 were essentially the same as those from the 1970s. With a thriving market for used aircraft, American GA aircraft production numbers declined from 18,000 in 1978 to 954 in 1993, an all-time low.\\"AGATE -- Revitalizing General Aviation\\" , NASA Langley, July 1996, FS-1996-07-02-LaRC During the same period the kit-built market was thriving. Free of some of the problems that certified aircraft had, and populated largely by experimenters looking for better performance, the kit market expanded rapidly in the 1980s. Designs available as kits often surpassed the performance of certified aircraft, while also being much less expensive. A leading kit manufacturer, Lancair's high performance Lancair IV design set a number of records, including a long-range flight at 360-mph.\\"Lancair IV-P\\" , Lancair As part of AGATE, NASA used a Lancair ES as a testbed for advanced avionics fits. The ES was a version of the unpressurized Lancair IV with fixed landing gear. Lancair founder Lance Neibauer was encouraged to certify the design, which would make it one of the first all-new GA aircraft certified in years. On April 3, 1995, Lancair established a new company, Pacific Aviation Composites USA,Business Registry Business Name Search, Pacific Aviation Composites USA, LLC in Redmond, Oregon. Originally intended simply to spread out production of the existing Lancair aircraft product lines, the new factory was rechristened Lancair Certified and was used as the main site for what was then known as the Lancair LC-40, for \\"Lancair Certified, model 40\\". The first prototype flew in July 1996, followed by the certification prototype in early 1997.\\"The Lancair LC-40 Columbia 300/350/400\\", airliners.net After a lengthy development and certification process the aircraft was officially certified on September 18, 1998, as the Model LC40-550FG and marketed under the name Columbia 300. Lancair Certified was renamed Columbia Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation in 2005 to focus on the new design. Neibauer sold the kit-build portion of the company, Lancair International, to Joseph Bartels in March 2003. The 300 was the fastest fixed- gear aircraft in the world when it was released, but held this title only for a short period until the turbocharged and FADEC-equipped Columbia 400 (Model LC41-550FG) flew in June 2000. The 400 also featured a new glass cockpit developed under the AGATE program, which Columbia refers to as the \\"Highway in the Sky\\" (HITS). The 400 was certified on March 30, 2003. The upgrades used in the Columbia 400 were then incorporated in the original 300 design to create the Model LC42-550FG, marketed as the Columbia 350. It appeared in April 2002 and was certified on April 8, 2004. In January 2003, Composite Technology Research Malaysia (CTRM) bought a controlling interest in Columbia for over $50 million. CTRM is owned by the Malaysian government and was incorporated in November 1990 by Minister of Finance Malaysia Inc. CTRM's CEO is Retired Col. Rosdi Mahmud. CTRM became interested in selling its share of the company in 2006. All of the Columbia aircraft competed heavily with similar designs from Cirrus Design, which was also developed under AGATE and included many of the same features. First to market, the SR22 outsold the Columbia models by a wide margin. On September 24, 2007 Columbia Aircraft announced that Textron would purchase the company, which would be merged with its Cessna division, including its line of high-performance single-engined aircraft. As part of the sale agreement Columbia Aircraft was to enter Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The arrangement would be subject to approval of the bankruptcy court and also to a final agreement with Cessna. The fate of Columbia Aircraft was complicated on October 14, 2007 when three additional companies entered the bidding for Columbia Aircraft. These were Columbia's competitor, Cirrus Design as well as Versa Capital Management and Park Electrochemical Corp. The two latter companies filed motions with the bankruptcy court stating that Cessna has been \\"getting preferential treatment in the process\\". On 20 November 2007 Cirrus Design announced that they would not pursue purchasing Columbia, citing Columbia's problems as being too serious and that resolving them would require excessive resources. On November 27, 2007, Cessna's parent company Textron announced that Cessna Aircraft was the successful bidder for Columbia Aircraft, that the Columbia 350 and 400 are renamed the Cessna 350 and Cessna 400 and that all existing Columbia aircraft will be supported by Cessna. Cessna paid USD$26.4M for the company and committed to investing in the current company location on the southeast corner of Bend Municipal Airport in Bend, Oregon. On April 29, 2009, Cessna announced that it would close the former Columbia plant in Bend, Oregon facility where the Cessna 350 and 400 were built and move production to Kansas. The company laid-off all the remaining 150 employees at the Bend plant. ==Columbia aircraft== * Columbia 300 - production completed * Columbia 350 - later known as the Cessna 350 * Columbia 400 - later known as the Cessna 400 ==References== ==External links== *www.flycolumbia.com - the former location of the Columbia Aircraft website *Lancair website Category:Defunct aircraft manufacturers of the United States Category:Companies based in Bend, Oregon Category:Privately held companies based in Oregon Category:1995 establishments in Oregon ","title":"Columbia Aircraft"},{"id":"2557150","text":"Lakewood High School is a public high school in St. Petersburg, Florida operated by Pinellas County Schools.

Frederick George Lieb (March 5, 1888 ‚Äì June 3, 1980) was an American sportswriter and baseball historian. In 1973, he became the first sportswriter to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Lieb published his memoirs in 1977, which documented his nearly 70 years as a baseball reporter. Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Lieb died at age 92 in Houston, Texas. == Career == Lieb was born on March 5, 1888, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; his favorite team growing up as a child was the Philadelphia Athletics. His sportswriting career began in 1909, when while working as a clerk for the Norfolk & Western Railroad he began submitting biographies of players to Baseball magazine. That led to a job with the Philadelphia news bureau; in 1911 he moved to New York where he joined the new Base Ball Writers Association. For the next 20 years, Lieb wrote for the New York Sun, Philadelphia Evening Telegraph, and New York Post, surrounded by sportswriting legends such as Damon Runyon, Heywood Broun, and Grantland Rice. Lieb is credited with coining the term \\"The House that Ruth Built,\\" referring to the New York Yankees' brand new stadium that was christened by a Babe Ruth home run on their opening day, April 18, 1923. He and his wife Mary were especially close to Ruth's teammate Lou Gehrig; Walter Brennan's character in the movie The Pride of the Yankees was loosely based on him. In October 1931, Fred Lieb took a team, headlined by Gehrig, Lefty Grove, Mickey Cochrane, Al Simmons, and Lefty O'Doul, to Hawaii and Japan for a profitable exhibition tour. This and many other profitable investments along the way allowed Lieb to retire in 1934 from the \\"real work\\" of daily reporting to focus solely on writing about baseball. In 1935, Taylor Spink convinced Lieb to write a regular weekly column and select obituaries for The Sporting News; Lieb did this at his leisure from his home in St. Petersburg, Florida, for 35 years. At the peak of their circulation, his syndicated columns reached more than 100 newspapers. Lieb's career would last a little over 70 years, as he continued to contribute to the Sporting News and St. Petersburg Times until his death on June 3, 1980. Lieb remained a member of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) for 68 years, serving as president from 1921 to 1924. in 1972, he received the Spink Award (named after his original Sporting News boss), and was thereafter inducted into the writers' wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1973. In what turned to be an early cross-generational tribute, Lieb received the first SABR salute from the Society for American Baseball Research in 1976. Over his career, Fred Lieb covered every World Series game from 1911‚Äì1958, thirty All- Star games, and over 8,000 major-league baseball games. == List of major works == Fred Lieb was a prolific writer, contributing to the Sporting News from 1935‚Äì1980, the St. Petersburg Times from 1965 until his death, the Saturday Evening Post from 1927‚Äì1933, as well as freelancing for other numerous publications, scoring games in New York, and authoring several books. Among his 11 books include his memoirs Baseball As I Have Known It; Connie Mack, Grand Old Man of Baseball; The Story of the World Series; 'The Baseball Story; and team histories of the Detroit Tigers, Boston Red Sox, St. Louis Cardinals, Pittsburgh Pirates, Baltimore Orioles, and Philadelphia Phillies. == Controversies and rule changes == Lieb initiated a rule change when on February 9, 1920, he suggested that a game-winning home run with men on base be counted as a home run even if its run was not needed to win the game. On May 15, 1922, Ty Cobb beat out a grounder to shortstop Everett Scott, and Lieb scored it a hit in the box score he filed with the Associated Press. This contradicted official scorer John Kieran of the New York Tribune, who ruled the play an error. At the end of the season AL official records were compiled using the AP box scores, giving Cobb a .401 average. Lieb reversed his call, but Ban Johnson went with the hit call. The New York writers protested to the commissioner on December 14, 1922, claiming that Ty Cobb's batting average should be .399 based on the official scorer's stats, but to no avail. On September 11, 1923, as the official scorer for a Yankees‚ÄìRed Sox game, Lieb ruled that a ball hit hard past Red Sox third baseman Howard Shanks was a hit. This was much to the chagrin for the Red Sox pitcher Howard Ehmke, who proceeded to retire the next 27 batters he faced for a 3-0 shutout (Ehmke had thrown a no hitter in the last game he had pitched, September 7). ==References== ==External links== *Baseball Hall of Fame Category:1888 births Category:1980 deaths Category:J.

In 1960 and 1961, Carey performed the role of Casey, Macdonald Carey's (no relation) secretary, in several episodes of the television series Lock-Up. On November 7, 1961, Carey played Ma Tolliver, the owner of a former stagecoach stop, in the episode \\"Deadly Is the Night\\" of NBC's Laramie western series. On April 22, 1962, she delivered a noteworthy performance as a bullying mother, \\"Ma\\" Martin, of three grown sons in the episode \\"The Youngest\\" of the ABC-Warner Brothers western series, Lawman. == Personal life == In 1920, she wed actor Harry Carey, with whom she remained until his death in 1947. They had two children, a daughter Ellen and a son, actor Harry Carey, Jr. In 1928, the failure of the St. Francis Dam northwest of Los Angeles caused a flood, the damages of which included seven deaths on the Careys' ranch and a loss estimated at $750,000 ($ million today). As a result, when Carey died in 1947, his estate was worth only about $15,000 ($ today). == Death == Carey died of natural causes at the age of 92 at her home in Carpinteria, California. ==Filmography== *The Sorrowful Shore (1913) ‚Äì The Orphan *Tess of the Storm Country (1914) ‚Äì Teola Graves *When the Gods Played a Badger Game (1915) ‚Äì Marie ‚Äì a Chorus Girl *Such Is Life (1915) ‚Äì Olive Trent *Just Jim (1915) ‚Äì Aunt Mary *The Millionaire Paupers (1915) *The Frame-Up (1915) ‚Äì Nell Harter *A Knight of the Range (1916) ‚Äì Bess Dawson *Stampede in the Night (1916) ‚Äì Nell Wilson *The Night Riders (1916) ‚Äì Jennie Marston ‚Äì the Sheriff's Sister *The Passing of Hell's Crown (1916) ‚Äì Rose Graney *The Wedding Guest (1916) ‚Äì Panchita *The Committee on Credentials (1916) ‚Äì Josephine *For the Love of a Girl (1916) ‚Äì Jane Buckley ‚Äì Cliff's Daughter *Love's Lariat (1916) ‚Äì Goldie Le Croix *A Woman's Eyes (1916) ‚Äì Sunny Baker *The Devil's Own (1916) ‚Äì Vera Browning *The Yellow Pawn (1916) *Trader Horn (1931) ‚Äì Edith Trent *The Vanishing Legion (1931, Serial) ‚Äì Nurse Lewis [Chs. 9‚Äì12] *Border Devils (1932) ‚Äì Ethel Denham *Naughty Marietta (1935) ‚Äì Madame Renavant (uncredited) *The Whip Hand (1951) ‚Äì Mabel Turner *On Dangerous Ground (1951) ‚Äì Mrs. Brent *Monkey Business (1952) ‚Äì Johnny's Mother (uncredited) *Face to Face (1952) ‚Äì Laura Lee ('The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky') *Affair with a Stranger (1953) ‚Äì Cynthia Craig *Rogue Cop (1954) ‚Äì Selma *The Cobweb (1955) ‚Äì Mrs. O'Brien ‚Äì Nurse *I Died a Thousand Times (1955) ‚Äì Ma Goodhue *The Searchers (1956) ‚Äì Mrs. Jorgenson *Pillars of the Sky (1956) ‚Äì Mrs. Anne Avery *The Wings of Eagles (1957) ‚Äì Bridy O'Faolain (uncredited) *Gunfight at the O.K.

They are vascular tumors that commonly present with an enlarging mass and most commonly involve the lungs, liver, and musculoskeletal system, although many other body sites have been reported, including the head and neck, intestines, lymph nodes, pleura, retroperitoneum, heel, stomach. ==Cause== Possibly Bartonella spp bactaraemia ==Diagnosis== ===Classification=== Hemangioendotheliomas may be classified as: * Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is an uncommon vascular tumor of intermediate malignancy that was first described by Steven Billings, Andrew Folpe, and Sharon Weiss in 2003. These tumors are so named because their histologic appearance resembles a proliferation of epithelioid cells, with polygonal shape and eosinophilic cytoplasm. * Composite hemangioendothelioma is a low-grade angiosarcoma typically occurring in adults, although it has been described in infancy.James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. . * Spindle-cell hemangioendothelioma) is a vascular tumor that was first described in 1986 by Sharon Weiss, M.D., and commonly presents in a child or young adult who develops blue nodules of firm consistency on a distal extremity. These tumors were reclassified by Dr. Weiss in 1996 as \\"spindle cell hemangioma\\", rather than hemangioendothelioma, due to the excellent prognosis observed in a group of 78 patients. * Retiform hemangioendothelioma (also known as a \\"Hobnail hemangioendothelioma\\") is a low-grade angiosarcoma, first described in 1994, presenting as a slow-growing exophytic mass, dermal plaque, or subcutaneous nodule. * Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (also known as \\"Infantile kaposiform hemangioendothelioma\\") is an uncommon vascular tumor, first described by Niedt, Greco, et al. (Hemangioma with Kaposi's sarcoma-like features: report of two cases.(Niedt GW, Greco MA, Wieczorek R, Blanc WA, Knowles DM 2nd. that affects infants and young children, with rare cases having also been reported in adults.Pediatr Pathol. 1989;9(5):567-75.) * Endovascular papillary angioendothelioma, also known as \\"Dabska tumor\\", \\"papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma\\" (PILA), \\"Dabska-type hemangioendothelioma\\", \\"hobnail hemangioendothelioma\\", and \\"malignant endovascular papillary angioendothelioma\\", is a rare low-grade angiosarcoma of lymphatic channels. Approximately 30 such tumors have been described in the medical literature.Schwartz, RA. Dabska Tumor. Medscape, updated: Apr 5, 2013 Although included in the World Health Organization tumor classification, there is uncertainty as to whether EPA is a distinct entity or a heterogenous group of tumours. The lesion usually presents as a slow-growing tumor of the skin and subcutaneous tissues of the head, neck, or extremity, of infants or young children. However, EPA has involved the testicle, deep muscle tissue as a neoplastic transformation of a larger existing benign cavernous hemangioma, bone and spleen, and has been found in adults. Some reports indicate a good prognosis but metastasis is occasionally seen. * Infantile hemangioendothelioma is a rare benign vascular tumour arising from mesenchymal tissue and is usually located in the liver. It often presents in infancy with cardiac failure because of extensive arteriovenous shunting within the lesion. It is the third most common liver tumor in children, the most common benign vascular tumor of the liver in infancy, and the most common symptomatic liver tumor during the first 6 months of life.Full text These hemangioendotheliomas have 2 growth phases: an initial rapid growth phase, which is followed by a period of spontaneous involution (usually within the first 12 to 18 months of life). Detection of the hemangioendothelioma within the first 6 months of life is attributed to the initial rapid growth during this time; however, the tumor has been detected with fetal ultrasonography.Banks T, Podraza J. What's Your Diagnosis? Newborn with abdominal mass and distention. Consultant for Pediatricians. 2010;9:168-173. Histopathologically, there are 2 types of hepatic hemangioendotheliomas: ** Type I: Hemagioendotheliomas of this type have multiple vascular channels that are formed by an immature endothelial lining with stromal separation from bile ductules. ** Type II: These hemangioendotheliomas have an appearance that is more disorganized and hypercellular, and there are no bile ductules. : In children, distinguishing between a primary malignant liver tumor (hepatoblastoma) and a benign primary hepatic lesion (hemangioendothelioma) is crucial. The absence of urinary catecholamines supports the diagnosis of hemangioendothelioma. In patients with hemangioendotheliomas, elevations in Œ±1-fetoprotein levels are milder than those found in patients with hepatoblastomas. Infantile hepatic hemangioendothelioma is strongly suggested by the presence of a vascular lesion on imaging studies. A complex, heterogeneous mass is often seen on ultrasonograms; a complex tumor that lacks central enhancement can be see on CT scans; and the vascular nature of the lesion along with dilation of the aorta proximal to the origin of the celiac artery and a decrease in the diameter distally, indicating significant shunting, is seen on angiograms.Banks T, Podraza J. What's Your Diagnosis? Newborn with abdominal mass and distention. Condultant for Pediatricians. 2010;9:168-173. Because most hemangioendotheliomas in infants sponanteously involute and regress within the first 12 to 18 months of life, asymptomatic lesions are generally managed conservatively. Infants who have severe anemia and/or thrombocytopenia can be given blood products; for those who have cardiac failure, diuretics and digoxin are often given. To stop further growth and to speed regression of lesions in infants with more significant clinical sequelae, treatment with corticosteroids or interferon-Œ±-2a is administered. To slow the growth of tumors that are rapidly enlarging, chemotherapy and radiation therapy have been used. Surgical resection, partial hepatectomy, and embolization of afferent vessels should be considered for severe cases.

Few entrapped seminiferous tubules are also noted (arrow). File:SkinTumors-PB061072.JPGCharacteristic budding, hobnail-like endothelial cells visible. ==Treatment== Treatment is varied and depends on the site and extent of tumor involvement, site(s) of metastasis, and specific individual factors. Surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy have all been used to treat these masses, although studies on survival have yet to be conducted to delineate various treatment regimens.Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma might respond to chemotherapy or antiangiogenic therapies. Recently propanolol and steroids have been shown to be very effective in kaposiform hemangioendothelioma. ==References== == External links == Category:Vascular neoplasia ","title":"Hemangioendothelioma"},{"id":"2557193","text":"The monthly Chess Life and bi-monthly Chess Life Kids (formerly School Mates and Chess Life for Kids ) are the official magazines published by the United States Chess Federation (US Chess).

This is the second Bomberman title licensed under Majesco Entertainment. It was released in Japan in 2002 and in North America in 2004. The PlayStation 2 version does not use cel-shaded graphics, while the North American GameCube version continues to use cel-shading, just like the previous game in the series, Bomberman Generation.Footage of Japanese PS2 version with non-cel-shaded graphics The opening theme to the game uses footage from the Japanese opening to the Jetters anime series, but the Japanese theme song \\"Boku wa Gakeppuchi\\" was replaced with a rock instrumental in the North American version. ==Plot== Mujoe and the Hige Hige Bandits, tired of White Bomber repeatedly stopping their plans for galactic conquest, enact a plan to crash the Dark Star, Mujoe's artificial comet, into the surface of Planet Bomber, which would obliterate the planet and everyone on it. With only 24 hours until the comet reaches the surface, White Bomber and MAX are sent out to deactivate the huge engines propelling the comet through space to prevent Planet Bomber's destruction. ==Gameplay== ===Normal Mode=== Gameplay is similar to the previous title, Bomberman Generation. Players control White Bomber and explore 3D environments, using different types of elemental Attribute Bombs to defeat enemies, solve puzzles and progress to the end of the stage. Players who fully explore each stage will often be rewarded with bonus collectibles such as health upgrades, new characters for use in multiplayer battles, and Charabom partners that augment White Bomber's abilities. Up to twelve different Charaboms can be found in Jetters, though their acquisition and usage is different than in Generation. Instead of Pok√©mon-style battles to acquire them, they are either hidden in certain levels or must be rescued from enemies. New to Jetters is a Charabom evolution system. By collecting food, Charaboms can evolve, changing their appearance and further improving their abilities. Some Charaboms are required to progress through a stage or collect hidden items. In addition to White Bomber, Jetters also adds a second playable character, Max, whom players can switch to at any time during gameplay. While Max cannot use Charaboms like White Bomber, his Hyper Plasma Bomb can destroy certain walls and eliminate all on-screen enemies, making it helpful against some bosses. While Generation featured non- linear progression, allowing players to attempt stages in any order, Jetters features sequential stage progression. ===Battle mode=== Battle mode has also been improved from Generation. Instead of having only the four standard bombers, a variety of characters can be used and a few can be unlocked, such as Mighty and Mujoe. The handicaps in the game are also different. Instead of granting just hearts, the player can be given items on default. Characters also have a super move-type ability called the \\"Killer shot\\" which allows them to gain the upper hand on opponents by attacking them or gaining special abilities during the match. The hyper bar must be full in order to use a hyper shot, and it can only be filled by laying bombs consistently. Also, unlike previous games in the series, Bomberman Jetters sports various modes and stages. The gameplay modes are as follows: Standard Battle: Basic overhead battle in which the series is known for. Battle one-two: Players must press the numbered switches in the order they flash to win the game, stepping on a number already activated will take back the numbers the player currently is on. Only one player can do the process at a time, meaning the other players will have to neutralize him/her first before trying to press the switches. Battle for Balloons: Players must collect balloon enemies and drop them in any of the four open holes. Players can blow an opponent's collection up, decreasing his chances of winning. Also as you collect more balloon enemies, the increasing weight of the amount will slow you down. Knock-out Battle: Players have fully powered bombs, throws, punches, and kicks. The field has no destructible blocks and blasts can go through obstacles. The goal is to use bomb blasts to knock the other players off the arena. After each game, players go to \\"Dig Em Bomber\\" (If the mini-game option is on). The winner(s) must dig for their own items while the others dig items and toss them off-screen. If played in 4P vs, the winner's character will be turned gold. ===Bomber Mansion=== Players also have an arcade style mini-game in which they can access by dying at least once in normal mode. Similar to the arcade mode in Saturn Bomberman, the game lasts five stages and players can gain different ranks depending on how well they do. ==Reception== Bomberman Jetters received average to mixed reviews. The game was criticized for its voice-acting, character's personalities being altered compared to the anime series version, and gameplay being unimproved from Bomberman Generation. Max's inclusion in the game was considered a wasted improvement and the charabom system was slightly criticized for being an imitation of Pok√©mon and for being required to get through some stages. However, as with its predecessor, it has won praise due to its multiplayer as many have stated it to \\"remain true to the formula\\". In an episode of Judgement Day on G4, Tommy Tallarico criticized the game for its voice acting and abundance of invisible walls. ==Notes== *Though based on the anime series of the same name, the \\"Jetters\\" game is more along the lines of a sequel to 2002's Bomberman Generation as a result of the similar gameplay, graphics, and characters (Bomberman and Max versus Mujoe and the Hige Hige Bandits). ==References== ==External links== *Japanese Hudson Soft page Category:2002 video games Jetters Category:GameCube games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:Video games based on anime and manga Category:Video games based on television series Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games with cel-shaded animation Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Hudson Soft games Category:Majesco Entertainment games ","title":"Bomberman Jetters (video game)"},{"id":"2557207","text":"Pinellas County Schools is the public school district serving Pinellas County, Florida.

Retrieved on August 28, 2011. \\"301 Fourth St. SW Largo, FL 33770\\" ==History== The district was created upon Pinellas County's split from Hillsborough County in 1912. Dixie M. Hollins was the county's first superintendent of schools. Like other school districts in Florida and elsewhere in the United States, Pinellas County has had to deal with issues of desegregation, court-ordered busing, and school choice. In 2000, the district received \\"unitary\\" (desegregated) status from the court assigned to monitor integration issues, and from 2003 to 2007 operated a \\"controlled choice\\" program which set minimum and maximum percentages of black pupils in individual schools. In 2007 the \\"Choice\\" program was replaced with a \\"close-to-home' school program, where students go to the school that is nearest to their residence. The Tampa Bay Times was the biggest proponent of resegregation. In multiple editorials in 2007, the Tampa Bay Times, formerly the St. Petersburg Times, urged the school district to abandon integration efforts in favor of \\"close to home\\" schools. In addition to neighborhood schools, the district offers 70 application programs, including magnet, fundamental and career academy programs.http://www.pcsb.org/cms/lib8/FL01903687/Centricity/Domain/105/PCSB%20Application%20Programs%20Guide%20for%20Families.pdf From 2007 and by 2015 student performance and behavior at five elementary schools in a mostly black area of St. Petersburg sharply declined. Hired in 2012, Michael Grego has launched reforms to aid students in the five schools. They include adding extended learning programs, extra summer instruction and bringing in counselors and social workers to connect families with outside services. In 2014, he began pumping more money into the schools, adding classroom aides, mental health counselors and liaisons to connect families with social servicesFitzpatrick, Cara, Lisa Gartner, and Michael LaForgia.\\"Failure Factories\\" (Archive).

However, in subsequent interviews with police, psychiatrists, and journalists, it became apparent that he had killed many more, whom he could not specifically remember by name, though he could often remember details of their murders. Experts have estimated that Cullen may ultimately be responsible for 400 deaths, which would make him the most prolific serial killer in recorded history. ==Early life== Charles Cullen was born in West Orange, New Jersey to a working-class Irish Catholic family, the last of eight children. His father Edmond, a bus driver, was 56 when Charles was born, and died on September 17, 1960 when Charles was just seven months old. Cullen has described his childhood as \\"miserable\\" and being constantly bullied by his sisters' boyfriends and his schoolmates. When he was 9, he made the first of many suicide attempts by drinking chemicals from a chemistry set. Later, while working as a nurse, Cullen claimed to have fantasized about stealing drugs from the hospital where he worked and using them to end his life. Cullen's mother Florence Cullen (nee Ward) was killed in a car accident on December 6, 1977 at the age of 60, when Charles was in his senior year of high school. Charles recalled his mother's death as being \\"devastating\\", and his being upset that the hospital would not return her body‚Äîinstead having it cremated. The following year, Charles dropped out of high school and enlisted in the U.S. Navy, where he served aboard the submarine USS Woodrow Wilson. Cullen successfully passed basic training and the rigorous psychological examinations required for submarine crews, who were expected to spend as long as two months at a time underwater in a cramped vessel. Cullen rose to the rank of petty officer second class as part of the team that operated the ship's Poseidon missiles. He did not fit in any better in the Navy and was hazed and bullied by his fellow crewmen. A year into his service, Cullen's leading petty officer on the Woodrow Wilson discovered him seated at the missile controls wearing a surgical mask, gloves, and scrubs, rather than his uniform. Cullen was disciplined for this action, but never explained why he had dressed the way he had. The Navy made the decision to reassign Cullen to a lower-pressure job on the supply ship USS Canopus. He attempted suicide and was committed to the Navy psychiatric ward several times over the subsequent few years. Cullen received a medical discharge from the Navy in 1984, for undisclosed reasons. Shortly thereafter, he enrolled at the Mountainside Hospital School of Nursing in Montclair, New Jersey. Elected president of his nursing class, he graduated in 1986 and started work at the burn unit of St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston. During this time, he met and married his wife Adrianne Baum. Their daughter Shauna was born later that year. Cullen's wife became increasingly disturbed at his unusual behavior and abuse of the family dogs. ==Murders== Somerset Medical Center The murders that became the first to which Cullen later confessed, occurred at St. Barnabas. On June 11, 1988, Cullen administered a lethal overdose of intravenous medication to a patient.Hepp, R (December 1, 2004). Cullen admits killing N.J. judge. Newark The Star-Ledger archive Cullen eventually admitted killing several other patients at St. Barnabas, including an AIDS patient who died after being given an overdose of insulin. Cullen left St. Barnabas in January 1992 when hospital authorities began investigating who had contaminated IV bags. That investigation determined that Cullen had most likely been responsible, resulting in dozens of patient deaths at the hospital. One month after leaving St. Barnabas, Cullen took a job at Warren Hospital in Phillipsburg, where he murdered three elderly women with overdoses of the heart medication digoxin. His final victim said that a \\"sneaky male nurse\\" had injected her as she slept, but family members and healthcare providers at the hospital dismissed her comments as unfounded. The following year, Cullen moved into a basement apartment in Phillipsburg following a contentious divorce from his wife. He shared custody of his daughters. Cullen would later claim that he had wanted to quit nursing in 1993, but the court-ordered child support payments forced him to continue working. In March 1993, Cullen broke into a co-worker's home while she and her young son slept, but left without waking them. He then began stalking the woman, who filed a police report against him. Cullen subsequently pleaded guilty to trespassing and received one year of probation. The day after his arrest, Cullen attempted suicide again. He took two months off work and was treated for depression in two psychiatric facilities, but attempted suicide twice more before the end of 1993. That September, a 91-year-old cancer patient reported that Cullen, who was not her assigned nurse, had come into her room and injected her with a needle. She died the next day. Her son protested that her death was not natural and Warren Hospital administered lie detector tests to Cullen and several other nurses, which Cullen passed. Cullen continued to work at Warren until the following spring. Cullen began a three- year stint in the intensive care/cardiac care unit of Hunterdon Medical Center in Flemington. He claimed that he did not harm anyone during the first two years, but hospital records for that time period had been destroyed by the time he was arrested in 2003. Cullen admitted murdering five patients between January and September 1996, again with overdoses of digoxin. He then found work at Morristown Memorial Hospital, but was soon fired for poor performance. Cullen remained unemployed for six months and stopped making child support payments. After seeking treatment for depression in the Warren Hospital emergency room, Cullen was admitted to a psychiatric facility for a short time. In February 1998, Cullen was hired by the Liberty Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where he staffed a ward of respirator-dependent patients. There, Cullen was accused of giving patients drugs at unscheduled times. He was fired after being seen entering a patient's room with syringes in his hand‚Äîan encounter that left the patient with a broken arm, but without criminal injections. Cullen caused a patient's death at Liberty Hospital, which was blamed on another nurse. After leaving Liberty, Cullen was employed at Easton Hospital in Easton, Pennsylvania, from November 1998 to March 1999. On December 30, 1998, he murdered yet another patient with digoxin. A coroner's blood test showed lethal amounts of digoxin in the patient's blood, but an internal investigation within Easton Hospital was inconclusive; evidence diid not definitively point to Cullen as the murderer. Even with his history of mental instability and the number of deaths during his employment at various hospitals, Cullen continued to find work due to a national shortage of nurses. Additionally, no reporting mechanism existed at the time to identify nurses with mental health or employment problems. Concerned about liability, hospitals were unwilling to take significant action against Cullen. In March 1999, Cullen took a job at the burn unit of Allentown's Lehigh Valley Hospital, where he murdered one patient and attempted to murder another. One month later, he voluntarily resigned from Lehigh Valley Hospital and took a job working in the cardiac care unit at St. Luke's Hospital in Bethlehem. During the subsequent three years, Cullen murdered at least five patients and is known to have attempted to kill two more. On January 11, 2000, he once again attempted suicide by lighting a charcoal grill in his bath tub, hoping to succumb to carbon monoxide poisoning. Cullen's neighbors smelled smoke and called the fire department and police. He was taken to a hospital and a psychiatric facility, but returned home the following day. No one suspected Cullen was murdering patients at St. Luke's until a co-worker found vials of medication in a disposal bin. The drugs were not valuable outside the hospital and were not used by recreational drug users, so their theft was curious. An investigation showed that Cullen had taken the medication. He was offered a deal by the medical facility: resign and be given a neutral recommendation, or be fired. He resigned and was escorted from the building in June 2002. Seven of his co-workers at St. Luke's later alerted the Lehigh County district attorney about their suspicions that Cullen had used drugs to kill patients. Investigators never looked into Cullen's past, and the case was dropped nine months later due to lack of evidence. In September 2002, Cullen began working in the critical care unit of the Somerset Medical Center in Somerville, New Jersey. He began dating a local woman around this time, but his depression worsened. Cullen killed at least thirteen patients and attempted to kill at least one more by mid-2003, using digoxin, insulin, and epinephrine. On June 18, 2003, Cullen unsuccessfully attempted to murder Somerset patient Philip Gregor, who was later discharged, and who died six months later of natural causes. Soon afterward, Somerset began to notice Cullen's wrongdoing. The hospital's computer system showed that Cullen was accessing the records of patients to whom he was not assigned. Co-workers began seeing Cullen in the rooms of patients to whom he was not assigned. The hospital's computerized drug-dispensing cabinets showed that Cullen was requesting medications that his patients had not been prescribed. Cullen's drug requests were strange, and included many orders that were immediately canceled, and many repetitive requests within minutes of each other. In July 2003, the executive director of the New Jersey Poison Information and Education System warned Somerset officials that at least four suspicious overdoses indicated the possibility that an employee was killing patients. The hospital delayed contacting authorities until October. By then, Cullen had killed at least another five patients and attempted to kill a sixth. When a patient in Somerset died of low blood sugar in October 2003, the hospital alerted the New Jersey State Police. That patient was Cullen's final victim. State officials castigated the hospital for failing to report a nonfatal insulin overdose, administered by Cullen, in August. An investigation into his employment history revealed past suspicions about his involvement in patient deaths. Somerset fired Cullen on October 31, 2003, ostensibly for lying on his job application. Fellow nurse Amy Loughren alerted the police after becoming alarmed about Cullen's records of accessing drugs and links to patient deaths. Police kept him under surveillance for several weeks, until they had finished their investigation. Investigators assigned Loughren to visit Cullen after work hours and talk with him while wearing a wire. From this, they were able to produce enough evidence for probable cause of arrest. ==Arrest and sentencing== Cullen was arrested at a restaurant on December 12, 2003, charged with one count of murder and one count of attempted murder. On December 14, he admitted to homicide detectives Dan Baldwin and Tim Braun that he had murdered Florian Gall and attempted to murder Jin Kyung Han, both patients at Somerset. In addition, Cullen told the detectives that he had murdered as many as 40 patients over his 16-year career. In April 2004, Cullen pled guilty in a New Jersey court to killing 13 patients and attempting to kill two others by lethal injection while employed at Somerset. As part of his plea agreement, Cullen promised to cooperate with authorities if they did not seek the death penalty for his crimes. A month later, he pled guilty to the murder of three more patients in New Jersey. In November 2004, Cullen pled guilty in an Allentown court to killing six patients and trying to kill three others. He repeatedly interrupted the proceedings by taunting the judge with the chant, \\"Your Honor, you need to step down.\\" Cullen was ordered to be restrained and gagged. On March 2, 2006, Cullen was sentenced to eleven consecutive life sentences in New Jersey, and is not eligible for parole until the year 2403. Currently, he is held at New Jersey State Prison in Trenton. On March 10, 2006, Cullen was brought into the courtroom of Lehigh County President Judge William H. Platt for a sentencing hearing. Cullen, upset with the judge, kept repeating, \\"Your honor, you need to step down\\" for thirty minutes until Platt had Cullen gagged with cloth and duct tape. Even after being gagged, Cullen continued to try to repeat the phrase. In this hearing, Platt gave him an additional six life sentences. As part of his plea agreement, Cullen has been working with law enforcement officials to identify additional victims. ==Motive== Cullen stated he administered overdoses to patients in order to spare them from being \\"coded\\" ‚Äî going into cardiac or respiratory arrest and being listed as a Code Blue emergency. He told detectives that he could not bear witness to or hear about attempts at saving a victim's life. Cullen also stated that he gave patients overdoses so that he could end their suffering and prevent hospital personnel from dehumanizing them. However, not all of his victims were terminal patients. Some, like Gall, had been expected to recover before Cullen killed them. Nurse Lynn Tester described many of the victims as \\"people on the mend\\" in a police interview. Instead of using common painkillers and stimulants, access of which was strictly regulated by hospitals due to their value as street drugs, Cullen chose instead to use as his tools of choice drugs such as digoxin and insulin, which had little use outside of a hospital setting and were less likely to attract attention. Investigators stated that Cullen may have caused patients to suffer, but that he appears not to realize this, contradicting his claims of wanting to save patients. Similarly, Cullen told investigators that although he often observed patients' suffering for several days, the decision to commit each murder was performed on impulse. Cullen told detectives in December 2003 that he lived most of his life in a fog and that he had blacked out memories of murdering most of his victims. He said he could not recall how many he killed or why he had chosen them. In some cases, Cullen adamantly denied committing any murders at a given facility, but after reviewing medical records, he admitted that he was involved in patient deaths. ==Legal impact== Cullen was largely able to move from facility to facility undetected because of the lack of requirements to report on suspicious behavior by medical workers, and inadequate legal protection for employers. New Jersey and Pennsylvania, like most states, required health care facilities to report suspicious deaths only in the most egregious cases, and penalties for failing to report incidents were minor. Many states did not give investigators the legal authority to discover where a worker had previously been employed. Employers feared to investigate incidents or give a bad employment reference for fear that such actions might trigger a lawsuit. According to detectives and Cullen himself, several hospitals suspected he was harming or killing patients, but failed to take appropriate legal actions. Following Cullen's criminal conviction, many of the hospitals where he had worked were sued by the families of his victims. The files and settlements against the New Jersey hospitals, all settled out of court, are sealed. In some cases, individual workers took it upon themselves to informally try to prevent Cullen from being hired, or to have him terminated. Some contacted nearby hospitals in secret, or quietly spoke to their own superiors, to alert them that they should not hire Cullen. When Cullen took a job at Sacred Heart Hospital in Allentown in June 2001, a nurse who had heard rumors about him at Easton Hospital advised her co-workers. They threatened to quit en masse if Cullen was not immediately dismissed, which he was. Prompted by the Cullen case, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and 35 other states adopted new laws which encourage employers to give honest appraisals of workers' job performance and which give employers legal protections when they provide a truthful employee appraisal. The New Jersey laws in particular formed the model that the rest of the states would follow. First, the 2004 Patient Safety Act increased hospitals' responsibility for reporting \\"serious preventable adverse events\\". The 2005 Enhancement Act was a supplement to the Patient Safety Act, and required hospitals to report certain details about their employees to the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs. It also mandated that complaints and disciplinary records relating to patient care be kept for at least seven years. == Media == The 2008 direct-to-video film Killer Nurse, written and directed by Ulli Lommel, was loosely based on Cullen. The upcoming film The Good Nurse, adapted from Charles Graeber's non- fiction book The Good Nurse: A True Story of Medicine, Madness, and Murder, is being scripted by Krysty Wilson-Cairns and is set to be directed by Tobias Lindholm. ==See also== *Donald Harvey *Orville Lynn Majors *Arnfinn Nesset *List of serial killers in the United States ==References== ==External links== * NJ.com archive of news articles about Charles Cullen * CNN Law Center: Death a Constant Companion of Confessed Killer Nurse Category:American serial killers Category:Male serial killers Category:American nurses Category:People from Pennsylvania Category:People from West Orange, New Jersey Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by New Jersey Category:American prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Pennsylvania Category:Nurses convicted of killing patients Category:American people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by New Jersey Category:People convicted of murder by Pennsylvania Category:United States Navy sailors Category:Male nurses Category:1988 murders in the United States Category:20th-century American criminals Category:21st-century American criminals Category:Criminals from New Jersey Category:Organ transplant donors Category:Submariners ","title":"Charles Cullen"},{"id":"2557230","text":"George Raymond (Holman) Ray (November 30, 1869 - October 13, 1935) was an English-born politician in Manitoba, Canada.

Ray was born in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England, as George Holman, the youngest child and only son of George and Hanna (n√©e Ray) Holman, and was educated in England. Ray worked as an accountant in London and in Africa. He served in the Royal Navy from 1888 to 1891. In 1900, he married Maude Williams in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Ray became an employee of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1901. He served as post manager at Berens River, Churchill, York Factory, Norway House and Fort Alexander. In 1911, he became manager for the Nelson River district, stationed at Fort Nelson in northern Manitoba. He was elected to the legislature in the 1914 provincial election, in a deferred election for the constituency Churchill and Nelson. The Conservatives had already won a majority government in the rest of the province, and Ray won without opposition. He served as a backbench supporter of Rodmond Roblin's government. The Roblin administration was forced to resign in 1915, amid a serious corruption scandal. A new general election was called, which the Liberals won in a landslide. Ray did not seek re-election. In 1920, Ray rejoined the Hudson's Bay Company as an inspector in the fur trade commissioner's office in Winnipeg and then, in 1921, became manager for the James Bay district. He retired from the Company in 1927. He was the author of Just Craft and Skill, a play published in 1911, and Kasba, a novel published in 1915.

Winner of the Travers Stakes during his racing career, he is best known as the sire of 2012 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner I'll Have Another. == Background == Flower Alley was bred in Kentucky by George Brunacini's Bona Terra Farms. A chestnut horse, he has a small white star on his forehead and a small white sock on his back right leg. At maturity, he stood 16.1 hands high. Breeder George Brunacini was notably killed in the August 27, 2006, crash of Comair Flight 5191 at Blue Grass Airport in Lexington, Kentucky. Flower Alley is a son of Distorted Humor, a Mr. Prospector line sire whose other offspring includes dual classic winner and champion Funny Cide and Belmont Stakes and Breeders' Cup Classic winner Drosselmeyer. Flower Alley is inbred 3√ó3 to Mr. Prospector. His dam, Princess Olivia, is sired by Lycius, who won the Gr.I Middle Park Stakes as a juvenile. Flower Alley was bought by the Melnyk Racing Stables of Eugene Melnyk for $165,000 at the 2003 Keeneland September yearling sale Eugene Melnyk's daughter is named Olivia, and selected Flower Alley from the sale because of his dam's name. == Racing career == === Two-year-old season === Flower Alley made his racing debut in December 2004 at Calder, finishing third in a maiden race. It was his only run as a juvenile. === Three-year-old season === Flower Alley won the Grade II Jim Dandy Stakes, the Grade II Lane's End Stakes (in his third career start), and, on August 27, the Grade I Travers Stakes at Saratoga as a sophomore. He was trained by Saratoga's leading trainer, Todd Pletcher, and was ridden in the Travers by top jockey John Velazquez. Flower Alley was second to Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year winner Saint Liam in the Breeders' Cup Classic on October 30, 2005. Flower Alley spent his 2005 winter break in Ocala, Florida, at his owner's Winding Oaks Farm, then trained at Churchill Downs for an early summer return to the track. === Four-year-old season === Flower Alley, under his Travers Stakes jockey John Velazquez (who skipped his Saturday Belmont mounts to ride the four-year-old), came back to the races as the favorite to win the Grade III $150,000 Salvator Mile Handicap at Monmouth Park in Oceanport, New Jersey, on June 24, 2006. It was a 3 -length victory as the 1‚Äì2 favorite. Out of 11 starts, he had now won 5, placed three times, and showed once. With that win in the slop, his earnings totaled more than $2,500,000. After the Salvator Mile, Todd Pletcher said, \\"We'll go to the Whitney Stakes on August 5th now, if everything goes smoothly.\\" Pletcher also planned to run Flower Alley in Saratoga's G1 Woodward Stakes as well as the Breeder's Cup Classic, run this year at Churchill Downs. On August 5, 2006, Invasor, an Argentine-bred son of Candy Stripes, won the Whitney by a nose to the surging Sun King. Flower Alley, a joint favorite in the race, made a brief run at the leading horses, then faded to come home seventh. Flower Alley also failed to hit the board in the Woodward Stakes, again finishing seventh. He finished 11th in the November 2006 Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs, which was the last race of his career. He was retired after the race with a record of 14: 5-3-1 and earnings of $2,533,910. ==Stud career== In 2007, Flower Alley began his career as a stallion at Three Chimneys Farm, alongside Point Given, Rahy, Albert the Great, Big Brown. The Midway, Kentucky, farm had acquired a 50% ownership of Flower Alley, the second graded stakes winner by Distorted Humor to stand at stud. In May 2012, Flower Alley's son I'll Have Another won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, bringing his status as a stallion into the spotlight. After his son's accomplishments on the track, Flower Alley's stud fee was raised to $20,000; a big increase from his $7,500 price tag of recent years. In 2015, however, despite his recent success as a stallion, Flower Alley was sold to stand at Wilgerbosdrift Stud in South Africa. He currently resides there, alongside United States Gr.III winner Fire Away, a grandson of Personal Ensign. Flower Alley's most notable progeny includes: * I'll Have Another: Winner of the 2012 Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, Robert B. Lewis Stakes and Santa Anita Derby * Bullards Alley: Winner of the 2017 Canadian International Stakes and Louisville Handicap * My Wandy's Girl: Winner of the Barbara Fritchie Handicap, Clasico Accion de Gracias (PR-G1), Dia de los Padres Stakes (PR-G1), and Roberto Clemente Stakes (PR-G1) * Lilacs and Lace: Winner of the Ashland Stakes and California Oaks * Neck 'N Neck: Winner of the Indiana Derby, Matt Winn Stakes, Ack Ack Handicap, and Greenwood Cup Stakes * Lukes Alley: WInner of the Gulfstream Park Turf Handicap, Autumn Stakes, and Durham Cup Stakes * Bouquet Booth: Winner of the Delta Downs Princess Stakes and Silverbulletday Stakes Flower Alley has also found success as a broodmare sire.

Chronos had gained increased time travel powers from Neron, but with a side effect of prematurely aging. He found a way to transfer that side-effect onto someone else, and realized a child would be able to store more chronal energy before dying of old age than an adult. After his defeat by the Legion, Lori remained in the 30th century. Stuck at a physical age of seventeen (but still mentally 10), and with no way to return to the 20th century, she was \\"adopted\\" by the Legion. She instantly developed a crush on time-travel researcher Rond Vidar. She briefly defended the Legion Headquarters against shapeshifting \\"Proteans\\" as \\"Future Girl\\", subsequently befriending one whom she named Proty. ==Life with the Legion of Super-Heroes== Eventually, much to her disappointment, Vidar found a way of removing the excess chronal energy, and she returned to her former age. Shortly after that she gained access to the Hero dial, and began secretly taking various superhero identities to aid the Legion. The dial had actually been given to her by the Time Trapper, but when the Trapper attempted to recruit her, she used the power of the dial to defeat him as \\"Galaxy Girl\\". Shortly after this, when an attempt by Leland McCauley to utilise the power of a mysterious space anomaly resulted in time stopping, Lori found herself as one of the few beings unaffected. She attempted to use the H-dial to help, but was stopped by the Time Trapper, who felt she was too unpredictable. Although she did not see her assailant, the Trapper's face was visible, and was her own. The Legion eventually learned that Lori had been using the H-dial. Their disagreement as to whether she was ready to be a hero led to her leaving, and joining McCauley's Workforce. It was discovered the Legion had not claimed to be her legal guardian, and so McCauley's Khundian assistant Amilia Crugg did so. Following the Blight, McCauley announced that risking the lives of teens was unconscionable, and that the Workforce would now consist of adults. This was an anti-Legion PR move that backfired when it was revealed, as the new Workforce battled the Rift, that one member was Lori, using the dial. Lori gave the dial to Brainiac 5.1 so he could use it to stop the Rift, and it was destroyed. This marked the character's final appearance in the Legion titles to date; that version of the Legion's continuity was later rebooted. Due to her name, and the fact she was a blonde girl of fluctuating age who was possibly destined to be the Time Trapper, it has been speculated that Lori was the post-Reboot version of Glorith, a theory which was confirmed by the Legion creative team during a panel discussion at the 1999 Heroes Convention in Charlotte, NC. ==See also== *List of Legion of Super-Heroes members ==External links== *Lori Morning biography Category:Comics characters introduced in 1995 Category:DC Comics female superheroes Category:DC Comics superheroes Category:Female characters in comics ","title":"Lori Morning"},{"id":"2557257","text":"James Robert Shawkey (December 4, 1890 ‚Äì December 31, 1980) was an American baseball pitcher who played fifteen seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB).

Because the team's first game was at home, this also meant that he was the first player to pitch at the newly built Yankee Stadium. The Yankees won 4‚Äì1 behind Babe Ruth's three-run home run, with Shawkey pitching a complete game to become the first winning pitcher at the stadium. Shawkey also served as the Yankees' manager in the season‚Äîfollowing the sudden death of Miller Huggins‚Äîand guided the Yankees to a third-place finish. Shawkey won 195 games in his career, and won 20 or more games in five different seasons (his high was 26). Shawkey is noted as the starting pitcher in the first game played in Yankee Stadium on April 18, 1923, and set the franchise record for 15 strikeouts in a single game, which stood until Ron Guidry broke it in 1978.https://sabr.org/gamesproj/game/june-17-1978-ron-guidry-strikes- out-18-sets-new-yankee-record/ Bob credited his success to a super fastball and an outstanding curve ball. He later served as the baseball coach for Dartmouth College. An adept batsman during his 15 year career, Shawkey compiled a .214 batting average (225-for-1049) with 90 runs, 3 home runs and 95 RBI. From 1920-1924, he drove in 59 runs for the New York Yankees. In 8 World Series games, he hit .267 (4-for-15) with 2 RBI. In 1970, Shawkey was inducted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in Brookville, Pennsylvania. During the 1976 opening day festivities for the renovated Yankee Stadium, Shawkey threw out the ceremonial first pitch. He died at age 90 in Syracuse, New York, on New Year's Eve 1980. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball annual ERA leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual saves leaders ==ReferencesInterview with baseball player Bob Shawkey conducted by Eugene C.

When placed in the scabbard the sword has a total length of 101 centimetres (40 inches) and weighs 1.9 kilograms (4.2 pounds). The swords neck between the blade and the hilt is decorated with a gold inlaid miniature of Vishnu riding the Garuda. The sword's history has been shrouded in myth and legend. In 1784, Chao Phraya Apai Pubet of Cambodia received the blade from a fisher who found in it in Tonle Sap when it was caught in his fishing net. He gave it to King Phutthayotfa Chulalok (Rama I) of Thailand, his suzerain at the time. According to legend, it was said that the moment the blade arrived in Bangkok, seven lightning strikes hit the city simultaneously, including the city gate, where the blade entered, and over the main gate of the Grand Palace. The sword's name means 'the wisdom of the king', as it was supposed to remind the king that he must rule over his people with wisdom. King Rama I had the hilt and scabbard made of gold, inlaid with diamonds and precious stones. During the coronation ceremony the king is handed the sword by a Brahmin, then straps it onto his belt himself. The sword features heavily in the Oath of Allegiance Ceremony where the King ceremoniously dip the sword into a bowl of sacred water, and then drink the water as an example, followed by senior civil servants and military officers as a sign of allegiance to the institution of the monarchy. ==See also== *Coronation of the Thai monarch ==References== * Siamese Jewels-Regalia Category:Southeast Asian swords Category:Regalia of Thailand ","title":"Sword of Victory"},{"id":"2557280","text":"Arnold Abraham Goodman, Baron Goodman, CH, (21 August 191312 May 1995)Brivati, Brian, \\"Goodman, Arnold Abraham, Baron Goodman (1913-1995)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, October 2008. Retrieved 4 February 2018 was a British lawyer and political advisor. ==Life== Arnold Goodman was born to middle class Jewish parents in London, England. He was educated at Hackney Downs School (formerly The Grocers' Company School), University College London, and Downing College, Cambridge. He became a leading London lawyer as Senior Partner in the law firm Goodman, Derrick & Co (now Goodman Derrick LLP).Goodman Derrick LLP, UK. He was solicitor and advisor to politicians such as Harold Wilson. Lord Goodman was chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain from 1965 until 1972, succeeded by Lord Gibson. As chair of the Arts Council, Goodman managed the organisation's 'golden age' with the establishing of the South Bank Centre and adoption of the only UK government bill for the Arts while the Council began regular funding for a number of galleries and theatre companies in the English regions. He was also chairman of British Lion Films, the Committee of Inquiry into Charity Law, the Committee on London Orchestras, the Housing Corporation, the National Building Agency, the Newspaper Proprietors' Association, and The Observer Trust, as well as being Director of the Royal Opera House and Sadler's Wells, Governor of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, a member of the Planning Committee for the Open University and President of the Theatrical Advisory Committee. He was a Senior Fellow of the Royal College of Art and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Art. He was also a founder and patron of the Next Century Foundation. He was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Laws) by the University of Bath in 1976. On 7 November of the same year, he formally opened the British Music Information Centre (BMIC). Publisher Rupert Hart-Davis was a client when Goodman was a partner in Rubenstein Nash; Goodman reached an agreement with Winston Churchill and Lord Beaverbrook over G. M. Young's life of Stanley Baldwin in 1952, though it required the \\"hideously expensive\\" job of removing and replacing seven leaves with revised wording in 7,580 copies of the book. In 1963, Goodman (now in his own firm, Goodman Derrick) arranged for Granada Television to take over Hart-Davis's loss-making publishing firm and Hart-Davis \\"wasn't surprised when he became a leading trouble-shooter for the government\\". After hearing details of the firm's finances for ten or fifteen minutes Goodman dictated everything back to his secretary: \\"the most amazing feat of mental agility I‚Äôve ever seen or heard of\\". In 1977, Goodman founded the Motability scheme for disabled motorists. Later in his career, Lord Goodman was Master of University College, Oxford, succeeding Lord Redcliffe-Maud in 1976. He retired from the post in 1986 and died from pneumonia on 12 May 1995. Arnold Goodman was created a life peer as Baron Goodman, of the City of Westminster in 1965 and sat as a Crossbencher. He was made a Companion of Honour in 1972. ==Criticisms== After Goodman's death one of his wealthy clients, Lord Portman alleged that Goodman stole funds worth ¬£10 million from his family's trust over a 30-year period and made donations to the Labour Party. Portman commenced legal proceedings for recovery but the claim was never substantiated, and the research of Goodman's biographer concluded that it had no substance. Goodman was often portrayed by Private Eye as a sinister \\"power behind the throne\\" exerting huge influence on the British establishment. Private Eye often referred to him as Lord \\"Two Dinners\\" Goodman, a reference to his girth. According to a documentary made by Richard Bond for Channel 4, The Gangster and the Pervert Peer, screened on 16 February 2009, Goodman, who never married, was one of the chief parties responsible for suppressing investigations by journalists which exposed how Lord Boothby and others were responsible for protecting the Krays from justice. Official MI5 records declassified on 22 October 2015 revealed that the association between the bisexual Boothby and the Kray twins had been the subject of an MI5 investigation in 1964. ==Arms== ==Publications== * Not For the Record selected speeches and writings (1972). ==Offices held== ==References== ==Sources== *The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (includes photograph) *Goodman's obituary in the Galton Institute *Criticism of Goodman *Goodman's obituary in The New York Times *Goodman allegations, The Guardian *Goodman commentary, Times Higher Education ==External links== * Lord Goodman ‚Äì Daily Telegraph obituary * Biography of Goodman by Brian Brivati * Goodman Derrick LLP *Parliamentary Archives, Papers of Baron Goodman Category:1913 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Alumni of Downing College, Cambridge Category:Alumni of University College London Category:People educated at Hackney Downs School Category:British Jews Category:British Queen's Counsel Category:English solicitors Category:Labour Party (UK) life peers Category:Masters of University College, Oxford Category:Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour Category:People associated with the Royal College of Art Category:20th-century British lawyers Category:Jewish British politicians Category:Honorary Queen's Counsel Category:Burials at Liberal Jewish Cemetery, Willesden ","title":"Arnold Goodman, Baron Goodman"},{"id":"2557283","text":"USS Tautog may refer to: * , a Tambor-class submarine launched in 1940 and stricken in 1959 * , a Sturgeon-class submarine launched in 1967 and stricken in 1997 Category:United States Navy ship names ","title":"USS Tautog"},{"id":"2557284","text":"Erich H√§√üler (April 22, 1899 - December 2, 2005) was a German pediatrician and academic from Leipzig, Saxony.

Headrights are most notable for their role in the expansion of the Thirteen Colonies; the Virginia Company gave headrights to settlers, and the Plymouth Company followed suit. The headright system was used in several colonies, including Maryland, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Most headrights were for 1 to of land, and were granted to those who were willing to cross the Atlantic and help populate the colonies. Headrights were granted to anyone who would pay for the transportation costs of an indentured laborer. These land grants consisted of for someone newly moving to the area and for people previously living in the area. By ensuring the landowning masters had legal ownership of all land acquired, the indentured laborers after their indenture period had passed had little opportunity to procure their own land. This kept a large portion of the citizens of the Thirteen Colonies poor and led to tensions between the laborers and the landowners. ==Overview of the headright system== The headright system began in the colony of Jamestown in 1618 as an attempt to solve labor shortages due to the advent of the tobacco economy, which required large plots of land with many workers. The disproportion that existed between the amount of land available and the population led to a situation with a low supply of labor, resulting in the growth of indentured servitude and slavery. The headright system also served to attract new settlers. Settlers who had already been living in Virginia were each given two headrights of 50 acres (200,000 m2); immigrant colonists who paid for their passage were given one headright, and individuals would subsequently receive one headright each time they paid for the passage of another individual. This last mechanism increased the division between the wealthy land-owners and the working poor. Headrights were given to heads-of-households, and because 50 acres were accumulated for each member of the household, families had an incentive to make the passage to the colonies together. ==Process of obtaining headrights== After paying for the passage of an individual to make it to the colonies, one needed to obtain a patent for the land. First, the governor or local county court had to provide a certificate that certified the validity of the importation of a person. One would then select the land one desired and have an official survey made. The two basic surveying instruments used to mark plots of land were a chain known as Gunter's chain and a compass. The patent's claimant would then take the description of this land to the colony's secretary, who created the patent to be approved by the governor. Once a headright was obtained, it was treated as a commodity and could be bought, sold, or traded. It also could be saved indefinitely and used at a later date. ==Eligibility== Individuals who could afford to do so would accumulate headrights by providing funds for poor individuals to travel to Virginia. During the 17th century, the cost of transport from England to the colonies was about six pounds per person. This system led to the development of indentured servitude where poor individuals would become workers for a specified number of years and provide labor in order to repay the landowners who had sponsored their transportation to the colonies. The claimants to headrights could receive grants for men, women and children since anyone could become an indentured servant. Early documentation from the Virginia Company seems to suggest that a landowner could receive a headright even if the indentured servant whose trip they sponsored did not make it to Virginia alive. ==Slavery and the headright system== Plantation owners benefited from the headright system when they paid for the transportation of imported slaves from Africa. This, along with the increase in the amount of money required to bring indentured servants to the colonies, contributed to the shift towards slavery in the colonies. Until 1699, an enslaved person was worth a headright of fifty acres. According to records, in the 1670s over 400 enslaved people were used as headrights in Virginia. This number increased in the 1680s and 1690s. Many families grew in power in the colonies by receiving large tracts of land when they imported enslaved people. For example, George Menefie purchased sixty enslaved people, and received a total of 3,000 acres in 1638.Bruce, Philip Alexander [1896]. Economic History of Virginia in the Seventeenth Century: an Inquiry into the Material Condition of the People, Based upon Original and Contemporaneous Records, Volume 2 (Google EBook). New York: Macmillan and Co. In 1699, it was decided that headrights would only be granted to free citizens and that transporting indentured laborers or slaves would no longer a guarantor of land. ==Issues with land patent records== According to records, there was a large discrepancy between the number of headrights issued and the number of new residents in the colonies. This gap may be explained by high mortality rates of people during their journey to the colonies. Landowners would receive headrights for the dead and thus, the gap would widen between population growth and amount of headrights issued. Another explanation suggests that the secretary's office that issued the headrights grew more lax. There were few regulations in place to keep the headright system in check. Because of this, several headrights were claimed multiple times and people took advantage of the lack of governance. For instance, when a person was brought to the colonies, both the ship captain and the individual paying the transportation costs may have attempted to receive land patents or headrights for the same person. Another problem was that secretaries sometimes issued headrights for fictitious people. During the 1660s and 1670s, the number of headrights was about four times more than the increase in population. If this large discrepancy must be attributed to more than fictitious issuing, a final explanation suggests that people had accumulated and saved headrights. Headrights could be bought for about 50 pounds of tobacco each. The owners of the grants then claimed the land years later once the land had risen in value. Although keeping a count of the number of headrights issued may not lead to accurate estimations of population growth in the colonies, the number of patents issued acts as an indicator of the demand for land. ==Consequences of the headright system== In addition to leading to the distribution of too much land at the lax secretary's discretion, the headright system increased tensions between Indian tribes and the colonists. Indentured servants were granted land inland, regions which often bordered Indian tribes. This migration produced conflict between the natives and the indentured servants. Later, Bacon's Rebellion was sparked by tensions between the natives, settlers, and indentured servants. ==See also== * Patroon ==References== Category:Thirteen Colonies Category:History of labor relations in the United States Category:Indentured servitude in the Americas ","title":"Headright"},{"id":"2557303","text":"Royal Friesland Foods (Koninklijke Friesland Foods N.V.) was a Dutch company that developed, produced and sold branded dairy products and fruit-based drinks. Royal Friesland Foods had a strong presence in Western Europe, Central Europe, West Africa and Southeast Asia. In 2008, Friesland Foods merged with Campina, under the new name of FrieslandCampina. The process was announced in December 2007. The EU conditioned the merger to the sale of certain cheese and dairy drink divisions by both companies. ==Overview== Royal Friesland Foods employs 15,312, of whom 10,000 work outside the Netherlands. The cooperative's leading brands are Appelsientje, Bonnet, Chocomel/C√©c√©mel, Completa, CoolBest, Debic, DubbelFrisss, Dutch Lady, Extran, Frico, Friso, Foremost, Friesche Vlag, Frisian Flag, Fristi, Milli, NoyNoy, Peak, P√∂tty√∂s T√∫r√≥ Rudi, Rainbow, and Taksi. Royal Friesland Foods is organized as a cooperative, with roots going back to 1879. It has grown through mergers and takeovers, the most significant of which occurred in late 1997, when four Dutch dairy cooperatives joined to create the business in its current form. In December 2001, KFF NV acquired the Drinks & Dairy division of Numico including the brands Chocomel/C√©c√©mel, Fristi and Extran. Royal Friesland Foods gained its current name in June 2004 after Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands granted it the Royal status (\\"Koninklijk\\" in Dutch) in honour of its 125th anniversary. Prior to that, the company was known as Friesland Coberco Dairy Foods. ==Longevity Brand - S·ªØa √îng Th·ªç== In Vietnam, the U.S. and Canada the company is well known for its canned condensed milk product, S·ªØa √îng Th·ªç (Longevity Brand condensed milk), popularly used in Vietnamese iced coffee with milk (C√† ph√™ s·ªØa ƒë√°) drinks, and in various other Vietnamese desserts. S·ªØa √îng Th·ªç was mass-produced in the Saigon-Bi√™n H√≤a area and widely consumed in the Republic of Vietnam, produced by Friesland Foods prior 1975. It was used in coffee, mixed with hot water to produce hot milk for babies and young children to drink (since fresh milk had to be imported and were thus expensive), dipped with French bread (B√°nh m√¨) or in other dessert applications. After the 1975 Fall of Saigon, the factories manufacturing S·ªØa √îng Th·ªç, along with all other commercial and private properties were collectivized by the communists, and the facilities came under the state company Vinamilk, who continued to produce S·ªØa √îng Th·ªç condensed milk under the same name and used domestically and elsewhere in Indochina. Friesland Foods continued production of S·ªØa √îng Th·ªç - Longevity Brand after 1975 in the U.S. and Canada for the North American market, especially catering to Overseas Vietnamese consumers, and increasingly to Western consumers as the popularity of Vietnamese coffee and cuisine in general, increases.

Secondary sources, primary sources and material evidence such as that derived from archaeology may all be drawn on, and the historian's skill lies in identifying these sources, evaluating their relative authority, and combining their testimony appropriately in order to construct an accurate and reliable picture of past events and environments. In the philosophy of history, the question of the nature, and the possibility, of a sound historical method is raised within the sub-field of epistemology. The study of historical method and of different ways of writing history is known as historiography. == Source criticism == Source criticism (or information evaluation) is the process of evaluating the qualities of an information source, such as its validity, reliability, and relevance to the subject under investigation. Gilbert J. Garraghan and Jean Delanglez divide source criticism into six inquiries: Gilbert J. Garraghan and Jean Delanglez A Guide to Historical Method p. 168 # When was the source, written or unwritten, produced (date)? # Where was it produced (localization)? # By whom was it produced (authorship)? # From what pre-existing material was it produced (analysis)? # In what original form was it produced (integrity)? # What is the evidential value of its contents (credibility)? The first four are known as higher criticism; the fifth, lower criticism; and, together, external criticism. The sixth and final inquiry about a source is called internal criticism. Together, this inquiry is known as source criticism. R. J. Shafer on external criticism: \\"It sometimes is said that its function is negative, merely saving us from using false evidence; whereas internal criticism has the positive function of telling us how to use authenticated evidence.\\"A Guide to Historical Method, p. 118 Noting that few documents are accepted as completely reliable, Louis Gottschalk sets down the general rule, \\"for each particular of a document the process of establishing credibility should be separately undertaken regardless of the general credibility of the author.\\" An author's trustworthiness in the main may establish a background probability for the consideration of each statement, but each piece of evidence extracted must be weighed individually. === Procedures for contradictory sources === Bernheim (1889) and Langlois & Seignobos (1898) proposed a seven-step procedure for source criticism in history:Howell, Martha & Prevenier, Walter(2001). From Reliable Sources: An Introduction to Historical Methods. Ithaca: Cornell University Press. . # If the sources all agree about an event, historians can consider the event proven. # However, majority does not rule; even if most sources relate events in one way, that version will not prevail unless it passes the test of critical textual analysis. # The source whose account can be confirmed by reference to outside authorities in some of its parts can be trusted in its entirety if it is impossible similarly to confirm the entire text. # When two sources disagree on a particular point, the historian will prefer the source with most \\"authority\\"‚Äîthat is the source created by the expert or by the eyewitness. # Eyewitnesses are, in general, to be preferred especially in circumstances where the ordinary observer could have accurately reported what transpired and, more specifically, when they deal with facts known by most contemporaries. # If two independently created sources agree on a matter, the reliability of each is measurably enhanced. # When two sources disagree and there is no other means of evaluation, then historians take the source which seems to accord best with common sense. Subsequent descriptions of historical method, outlined below, have attempted to overcome the credulity built into the first step formulated by the nineteenth century historiographers by stating principles not merely by which different reports can be harmonized but instead by which a statement found in a source may be considered to be unreliable or reliable as it stands on its own. === Core principles for determining reliability === The following core principles of source criticism were formulated by two Scandinavian historians, Olden- J√∏rgensen (1998) and Thur√©n (1997):Thur√©n, Torsten. (1997). K√§llkritik. Stockholm: Almqvist & Wiksell. * Human sources may be relics such as a fingerprint; or narratives such as a statement or a letter. Relics are more credible sources than narratives. * Any given source may be forged or corrupted. Strong indications of the originality of the source increase its reliability. * The closer a source is to the event which it purports to describe, the more one can trust it to give an accurate historical description of what actually happened. * An eyewitness is more reliable than testimony at second hand, which is more reliable than hearsay at further remove, and so on. * If a number of independent sources contain the same message, the credibility of the message is strongly increased. * The tendency of a source is its motivation for providing some kind of bias. Tendencies should be minimized or supplemented with opposite motivations. * If it can be demonstrated that the witness or source has no direct interest in creating bias then the credibility of the message is increased. === Eyewitness evidence === R. J. Shafer offers this checklist for evaluating eyewitness testimony:A Guide to Historical Method, pp. 157-158 # Is the real meaning of the statement different from its literal meaning? Are words used in senses not employed today? Is the statement meant to be ironic (i.e., mean other than it says)? # How well could the author observe the thing he reports? Were his senses equal to the observation? Was his physical location suitable to sight, hearing, touch? Did he have the proper social ability to observe: did he understand the language, have other expertise required (e.g., law, military); was he not being intimidated by his wife or the secret police? # How did the author report?, and what was his ability to do so? ## Regarding his ability to report, was he biased? Did he have proper time for reporting? Proper place for reporting? Adequate recording instruments? ## When did he report in relation to his observation? Soon? Much later? Fifty years is much later as most eyewitnesses are dead and those who remain may have forgotten relevant material. ## What was the author's intention in reporting? For whom did he report? Would that audience be likely to require or suggest distortion to the author? ## Are there additional clues to intended veracity? Was he indifferent on the subject reported, thus probably not intending distortion? Did he make statements damaging to himself, thus probably not seeking to distort? Did he give incidental or casual information, almost certainly not intended to mislead? # Do his statements seem inherently improbable: e.g., contrary to human nature, or in conflict with what we know? # Remember that some types of information are easier to observe and report on than others. # Are there inner contradictions in the document? Louis Gottschalk adds an additional consideration: \\"Even when the fact in question may not be well-known, certain kinds of statements are both incidental and probable to such a degree that error or falsehood seems unlikely. If an ancient inscription on a road tells us that a certain proconsul built that road while Augustus was princeps, it may be doubted without further corroboration that that proconsul really built the road, but would be harder to doubt that the road was built during the principate of Augustus. If an advertisement informs readers that 'A and B Coffee may be bought at any reliable grocer's at the unusual price of fifty cents a pound,' all the inferences of the advertisement may well be doubted without corroboration except that there is a brand of coffee on the market called 'A and B Coffee.'\\"Understanding History, p. 163 === Indirect witnesses === Garraghan says that most information comes from \\"indirect witnesses\\", people who were not present on the scene but heard of the events from someone else.A Guide to Historical Method, p. 292 Gottschalk says that a historian may sometimes use hearsay evidence when no primary texts are available. He writes, \\"In cases where he uses secondary witnesses...he asks: (1) On whose primary testimony does the secondary witness base his statements? (2) Did the secondary witness accurately report the primary testimony as a whole? (3) If not, in what details did he accurately report the primary testimony? Satisfactory answers to the second and third questions may provide the historian with the whole or the gist of the primary testimony upon which the secondary witness may be his only means of knowledge. In such cases the secondary source is the historian's 'original' source, in the sense of being the 'origin' of his knowledge. Insofar as this 'original' source is an accurate report of primary testimony, he tests its credibility as he would that of the primary testimony itself.\\" Gottschalk adds, \\"Thus hearsay evidence would not be discarded by the historian, as it would be by a law court merely because it is hearsay.\\"Understanding History, 165-66 === Oral tradition === Gilbert Garraghan maintains that oral tradition may be accepted if it satisfies either two \\"broad conditions\\" or six \\"particular conditions\\", as follows:A Guide to Historical Method, 261-262) # Broad conditions stated. ## The tradition should be supported by an unbroken series of witnesses, reaching from the immediate and first reporter of the fact to the living mediate witness from whom we take it up, or to the one who was the first to commit it to writing. ## There should be several parallel and independent series of witnesses testifying to the fact in question. # Particular conditions formulated. ## The tradition must report a public event of importance, such as would necessarily be known directly to a great number of persons. ## The tradition must have been generally believed, at least for a definite period of time. ## During that definite period it must have gone without protest, even from persons interested in denying it. ## The tradition must be one of relatively limited duration. [Elsewhere, Garraghan suggests a maximum limit of 150 years, at least in cultures that excel in oral remembrance.] ## The critical spirit must have been sufficiently developed while the tradition lasted, and the necessary means of critical investigation must have been at hand. ## Critical-minded persons who would surely have challenged the tradition - had they considered it false - must have made no such challenge. Other methods of verifying oral tradition may exist, such as comparison with the evidence of archaeological remains. More recent evidence concerning the potential reliability or unreliability of oral tradition has come out of fieldwork in West Africa and Eastern Europe.See J. Vansina, De la tradition orale. Essai de m√©thode historique, in translation as Oral Tradition as History, as well as A. B. Lord's study of Slavic bards in The Singer of Tales. Note also the Icelandic sagas, such as that by Snorri Sturlason in the 13th century, and K. E. Bailey, \\"Informed Controlled Oral Tradition and the Synoptic Gospels\\", Asia Journal of Theology [1991], 34-54\\\\. Compare Walter J. Ong, Orality and Literacy. === Anonymous sources === Historians do allow for the use of anonymous texts to establish historical facts.Gottschalk,A Guide to Historical Method, 169) == Synthesis: historical reasoning == Once individual pieces of information have been assessed in context, hypotheses can be formed and established by historical reasoning. === Argument to the best explanation === C. Behan McCullagh lays down seven conditions for a successful argument to the best explanation:Justifying Historical Descriptions, p. 19 #The statement, together with other statements already held to be true, must imply yet other statements describing present, observable data. (We will henceforth call the first statement 'the hypothesis', and the statements describing observable data, 'observation statements'.) #The hypothesis must be of greater explanatory scope than any other incompatible hypothesis about the same subject; that is, it must imply a greater variety of observation statements. #The hypothesis must be of greater explanatory power than any other incompatible hypothesis about the same subject; that is, it must make the observation statements it implies more probable than any other. #The hypothesis must be more plausible than any other incompatible hypothesis about the same subject; that is, it must be implied to some degree by a greater variety of accepted truths than any other, and be implied more strongly than any other; and its probable negation must be implied by fewer beliefs, and implied less strongly than any other. #The hypothesis must be less ad hoc than any other incompatible hypothesis about the same subject; that is, it must include fewer new suppositions about the past which are not already implied to some extent by existing beliefs. #It must be disconfirmed by fewer accepted beliefs than any other incompatible hypothesis about the same subject; that is, when conjoined with accepted truths it must imply fewer observation statements and other statements which are believed to be false. #It must exceed other incompatible hypotheses about the same subject by so much, in characteristics 2 to 6, that there is little chance of an incompatible hypothesis, after further investigation, soon exceeding it in these respects. McCullagh sums up, \\"if the scope and strength of an explanation are very great, so that it explains a large number and variety of facts, many more than any competing explanation, then it is likely to be true.\\"Justifying Historical Descriptions, p. 26 === Statistical inference === McCullagh states this form of argument as follows:Justifying Historical Descriptions, 48 #There is probability (of the degree p1) that whatever is an A is a B. #It is probable (to the degree p2) that this is an A. #Therefore, (relative to these premises) it is probable (to the degree p1 √ó p2) that this is a B. McCullagh gives this example:Justifying Historical Descriptions, p. 47 #In thousands of cases, the letters V.S.L.M. appearing at the end of a Latin inscription on a tombstone stand for Votum Solvit Libens Merito. #From all appearances the letters V.S.L.M. are on this tombstone at the end of a Latin inscription. #Therefore, these letters on this tombstone stand for '‚ÄôVotum Solvit Libens Merito‚Äô‚Äô. This is a syllogism in probabilistic form, making use of a generalization formed by induction from numerous examples (as the first premise). === Argument from analogy === The structure of the argument is as follows:Justifying Historical Descriptions, p. v85 #One thing (object, event, or state of affairs) has properties p1 . . . pn and pn + 1. #Another thing has properties p1 . . . pn. #So the latter has property pn + 1. McCullagh says that an argument from analogy, if sound, is either a \\"covert statistical syllogism\\" or better expressed as an argument to the best explanation. It is a statistical syllogism when it is \\"established by a sufficient number and variety of instances of the generalization\\"; otherwise, the argument may be invalid because properties 1 through n are unrelated to property n + 1, unless property n + 1 is the best explanation of properties 1 through n. Analogy, therefore, is uncontroversial only when used to suggest hypotheses, not as a conclusive argument. == See also == *Antiquarian *Archaeology *Archival research *Auxiliary sciences of history *Chinese whispers *Historical criticism *Historical significance *Historiography *List of history journals *Philosophy of history *Scholarly method *Scientific method *Source criticism *Unwitting testimony == Footnotes == == References == *Gilbert J.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1899 to 1915 as a member of the Conservative Party. Riley was born in Mornington Township in Perth County, Canada West (now Ontario), the son of Charles Riley, and was educated at public schools. He entered business as a lumber merchant. In 1876, Riley came to Winnipeg. He later moved to Stonewall, Manitoba where he was a lumber merchant and also owned a hotel. In 1882, Riley married Laura M. Poore. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1899 provincial election, defeating Liberal incumbent Samuel Jacob Jackson by sixty-five votes in the Rockwood constituency. The Conservatives won a majority government, and Riley served as a backbench supporter of the administrations led by the Hugh John Macdonald and Rodmond Roblin. Riley was re-elected in the elections of 1903, 1907, 1910 and 1914, and continued to serve as a government backbencher. In the 1914 campaign, he defeated Liberal candidate Arthur Lobb by fifty-nine votes. The Roblin administration was forced to resign in 1915 amid a serious corruption scandal. A new general election was called, which the Liberals won in a landslide. Riley did not seek re-election.

Dimension \\"b\\" is the beam. The beam of a ship is its width at its widest point. The maximum beam (BMAX) is the distance between planes passing through the outer extremeties of the ship, beam of the hull (BH) only includes permanently fixed parts of the hull, and beam at waterline (BWL) is the maximum width where the hull intersects the surface of the water. Generally speaking, the wider the beam of a ship (or boat), the more initial stability it has, at the expense of secondary stability in the event of a capsize, where more energy is required to right the vessel from its inverted position. A ship that heels on her beam ends has her deck beams nearly vertical. == Typical values == Typical length- to-beam ratios for small sailboats are from 2:1 (dinghies to trailerable sailboats around ) to 5:1 (racing sailboats over ). Large ships have widely varying beam ratios, some as large as 20:1. Rowing shells designed for flatwater racing may have length to beam ratios as high as 30:1,Science News Online: Ivars Peterson's MathTrek (7/17/99): Row Your Boat while a coracle has a ratio of almost 1:1 - it is nearly circular. ==Rule of thumb - formula== The beam of many monohull vessels can be calculated using the following formula: :Beam = LOA^\\\\frac{2}{3} + 1 Where LOA is Length Overall and all units are in feet. Some examples: * For a standard yacht: the cube root of 27 is 3, 3 squared is 9 plus 1 = 10. The beam of many 27 ft monohulls is . * For a Volvo Open 70 yacht: 70.5 to the power of 2/3 = 17 plus 1 = 18. The beam is often around . * For a long ship: the cube root is 9, and 9 squared is 81, plus 1. The beam will usually be around , e.g. Seawaymax. As catamarans have more than one hull, there is a different beam calculation for this kind of vessel. ==BOC== BOC stands for Beam On Centerline. This term in typically used in conjunction with LOA (Length overall). The ratio of LOA/BOC is used to estimate the stability of multihull vessels. The lower the ratio the greater the boat's stability. The BOC for vessels is measured as follows: For a catamaran: the perpendicular distance from the centerline of one hull to the centerline of the other hull, measured at deck level. For a trimaran: the perpendicular distance between the centerline of the main hull and the centerline of either ama, measured at deck level ==Other beams== Other meanings of 'beam' in the nautical context are: *Beam ‚Äì a timber similar in use to a floor joist, which runs from one side of the hull to the other athwartships. *Carlin ‚Äì similar to a beam, except running in a fore and aft direction. ==Notes== ==References== * * Category:Nautical terminology Category:Ship measurements ","title":"Beam (nautical)"},{"id":"2557334","text":"Charles N. \\"Charlie\\" Papazian (born January 23 ca. 1949) is an American nuclear engineer, brewer and author. He founded the Association of Brewers and the Great American Beer Festival, and wrote The Complete Joy of Home Brewing (1984). He is the longtime former president (1979-2016) of the Brewers Association. He is also the creator of the National Pie Day, a celebration of pies which is celebrated on January 23, Papazian's birthday. ==Beginnings== Papazian, an American of Armenian descent, was born in 1949 and raised in Warren Township, New Jersey. His father was a chemical engineer who managed a manufacturing plant. He attended the University of Virginia, graduating in 1972 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Nuclear Engineering.Matthew Shaer, \\"The Schoolteacher who Sparked America's Craft Brew Revolution,\\" Smithsonian, June 2020. In 1970, while in Charlottesville, Papazian was introduced to an older man who had learned to brew beer during Prohibition. Papazian, who was working part time as a janitor at a daycare facility, began brewing in the daycare's kitchen during off-hours. As people began to show interest in his beer, Papazian wrote up a two-page set of instructions and began distributing it by hand. After college, he moved to Boulder, Colorado where he eventually landed a job as an elementary school teacher, a position he held for ten years. During that period, Papazian began offering weekly home brewing classes in his kitchen. One of his earliest students was Jeff Lebesch, co-founder of New Belgium Brewing Company. ==Brewing associations== In 1978 U.S. President Jimmy Carter signed a law reopening the beer market to small craft brewers, also permitting homebrewing. In 1979 Papazian founded the Association of Brewers, and remained president of that organization until 2005, when the Association of Brewers merged with the 63-year-old Brewers Association of America, and Papazian was named president of the combined organization. Papazian also founded the American Homebrewers Association in 1978, a group that is also now under the umbrella of the Brewers Association. Other organizations and annual events subsequently founded by Papazian include the Institute for Brewing Studies, Brewers Publications, the Great American Beer Festival, the World Beer Cup, and Zymurgy magazine. The American Homebrewers Association is a division of the Brewers Association focused on homebrewers of beer, cider, and mead. The AHA was founded in 1978 by Papazian. The AHA runs the world's largest homebrew competition and also organizes several homebrew events in the United States and Canada. Gary Glass is the current director. The AHA publishes the magazine Zymurgy six times per year to its 47,000 members. Every year the AHA hosts events like National Homebrew Competition, the Homebrew Con (previously known as the National Homebrewers Conference) which includes the finals of the National Homebrew Competition, held the third week in June, the Big Brew, held the first Saturday in May, Mead Day, held the first Saturday in August and Learn to Homebrew Day, held the first Saturday in November American Homebrewers Association gives the Ninkasi Award, a prize given for the brewer who gains the most points in the final round of the National Homebrew Competition, judged at the National Homebrewers Conference. Points are gained from the brewer's winning entries in the 23 categories of beer and several categories of mead and cider. At least 2 points (1 bronze placement) must come from a beer entry. The Ninkasi Award is named in honor of Ninkasi, the Sumerian goddess of beer. ==Complete Joy of Home Brewing== In 1984 Papazian published his first book on the subject of homebrewing, titled The Complete Joy of Home Brewing. The book contained a foreword by influential British beer writer Michael Jackson. As of August 2005, The Complete Joy of Home Brewing had seen 25 reprintings, 3 editions, and has sold over 900,000 copies. A fourth edition was released in September 2014. As the first American (and, for over a decade, the only) mass-market book to provide in-depth information on subject of how to brew beer in the home, The Complete Joy of Home Brewing was very often the sole source of home brewing information for novice home brewers in America. Consequently, the book has gained iconic status among America's home brewing community, who have referred to it as the \\"home brewer's bible.\\" Throughout The Complete Joy of Home Brewing, Papazian reminds the novice brewer to \\"Relax. Don't worry. And have a homebrew.\\" Papazian has since written five more books. ==National Pie Day== Papazian also began National Pie Day, a celebration of pies. It is celebrated on January 23, Papazian's birthday. after he declared his own birthday, January 23, to be National Pie Day. Since 1986, National Pie Day is sponsored by the American Pie Council. In 2014, the American Pie Council partnered with Paramount Pictures in promoting the romantic thriller film Labor Day in conjunction with National Pie Day.

The Welland Recreational Waterway is a water channel in the city of Welland, Ontario, Canada. It is an old alignment of the Welland Ship Canal that has been abandoned after the construction of the Welland By-Pass in the 1970s. The Waterway is now managed by the Welland Recreational Canal Corporation to provide enjoyment for the city's residents. Most local residents refer to it as the old canal or simply the canal. ==Original plans== The bottom of the canal was at a time proposed to become a roadbed for an extension of Highway 406. However, that never came to be and the old canal was retained in an almost original state with the purpose of developing several recreational facilities and tourist attractions along its shores. The plans called for fishing platforms, water slides, boat rental points, as well as marine and rail historical exhibits. To date most of these plans have not been realized, but some are in the process of being accomplished. ==Changes== Some changes have been made to the Waterway's original shape since the construction of the By-Pass. The most significant modification is an earth plug that bisects the Waterway along Ontario Highway 58A (between Humberstone Road and Townline Tunnel Road). This was necessary due to very long (4 km, or 2.5 miles) low- grade approaches to the Townline Tunnel required for trains to travel underneath the new canal segment. The Waterway's no-wake zone. Merritt Island with its path appear opposite the channel. As multiple leaking problems were surfacing with the aqueduct that carries the Welland River underneath the old alignment, it was decided to control the problem by drilling intentional holes in the aqueduct. As a result, the Welland River downstream of the aqueduct is partially fed from the canal, and the flow in the northern section of the Waterway has reversed to compensate for the water flowing into the river. The old alignment was originally spanned by five vertical lift bridges and a railroad swing bridge (bridge 15). After the relocation, two of the bridges were replaced by modern fixed-span bridges and another had its towers removed due to excessive cost of potential renovation. Two more bridges were built in the northern section of the Waterway, and a bridge was constructed in downtown Welland to twin the East Main Street bridge. ==The Waterway today== Today, pedestrian and bicycle pathways line both banks of the Waterway. The pathways are important components of Welland's pedestrian and bicycle transportation network, providing a safe and pleasant environment in which to move about the central part of the city. A section that is particularly popular is the path on Merritt Island, a carefully cared for, elongated strip of land created when the old alignment of the canal was constructed basically parallel to the Welland River. Signs outlining the path and listing local attractions have been erected along the paths. The equally popular 140-km Greater Niagara Circle Route (GNCR) also runs along the canal, and is used by residents and tourists alike. Welland City Councillors placed a motorboat prohibition on the waterway known as the \\"Go Quietly\\" by-law, turning the former shipping canal into a waterway suitable for kayaking, rowing, canoeing and paddle boating. The Welland Recreational Canal Corporation is an organization whose board of directors is made up of three members of city council and six citizens. The corporation is responsible for the protection and development of the canal and adjacent lands, and has inaugurated various programs, including a canoe/paddle boat rental facility and numerous fishing platforms. vertical lift East Main Street Bridge (Bridge #13) on the right. ==Future plans== The Waterway is seen as a crucial part of plans for revival of downtown Welland. The Civic Square, housing the city hall and the library, was newly built by the canal. The Welland Recreational Waterway Master Plan is available online and details proposals for the future of the canal. In 2012, Bike Welland and ShortHills Cycling Club (SHCC) jointly presented a proposal to the Welland Recreational Canal Corporation (WRCC) for a 160-acre naturalized, urban park along the \\"northern reach\\" section of the Welland Canal. The land, which is embedded in the urban fabric, is already used by residents for hiking, trail running and mountain biking, and is the only section of the canal in Welland that is undeveloped. The Northern Reach Park would conserve the area for recreation and wildlife habitat, and continue to provide opportunities for hikers, runners, mountain bikers and cross-country skiers, as well as naturalists, to engage with a \\"natural\\" landscape. The proposal also outlines the potential of the park for sport tourism.\\"Northern Reach Park Proposal\\". Bike Welland. Retrieved 2015-02-26.

Its name comes from the geographical characteristic of the region, very flat with fields (campos in Portuguese) and from the Goytacazes Indians, which inhabited the region. Campos, as the city is usually known, is a macro region of the Northern Fluminense, and is a micro region of Campos dos Goytacazes. The city has a tropical climate. The municipality contains part of the Desengano State Park, created in 1970. The city's distance to Rio de Janeiro city, which is the capital of the state, is .

Colonization of the area started in the 16th century, and the village of S√£o Salvador de Campos de Goytacazes was founded on May 29, 1677. On March 28, 1835 the village was promoted to city status. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Campos was the see of Bishop Ant√¥nio de Castro Mayer, nicknamed \\"The Lion of Campos\\", who was one of the bishops who opposed the Vatican II reforms and who teamed with Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre of Dakar to consecrate four independent bishops in √âc√¥ne, Switzerland, in 1988. Nowadays there are in Campos two Roman Catholic jurisdictions: a Diocese, whose Bishop is Monsignor Roberto Gomes Guimar√£es and the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney, whose Apostolic Administrator is Monsignor Fernando Areas Rifan. ==Economy== City's economy is based on oil extraction. The GDP for the city was R$ 17,283,381. (2016). The per capita income for the city was R$ 35,475. (2016). ==Crime== Campos dos Goytacazes recorded 233 homicides in 2018 for a murder rate of 46 homicides per 100,000 people for the year.

The city in the 1950s was the second largest of the state of Rio de Janeiro. The reasons behind these reductions are the \\"crash\\" that the economy of the town, based on oil, suffered in 1954, something similar that happened in Detroit with the auto industries.

The Liber Usualis is a book of commonly used Gregorian chants in the Catholic tradition, compiled by the monks of the Abbey of Solesmes in France. According to Willi Apel, the chants in the Liber Usualis originated in the 11th century.Apel, Willi. Gregorian Chant. Indiana University Press, 1958. p. 417 This 1,900-page book contains most versions of the ordinary chants for the Mass (Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, and Agnus Dei), as well as the common chants for the Divine Office (daily prayers of the Church) and for every commonly celebrated feast of the Church Year (including more than two hundred pages for Holy Week alone). The \\"usual book\\" or \\"common book\\" also contains chants for specific rituals, such as baptisms, weddings, funerals, ordinations, and benediction. This modal, monophonic Latin music has been sung in the Catholic Church since at least the sixth century to the present day. An extensive introduction explains how to read and interpret the medieval musical notation (square notation of neums or neumes). A complete index makes it easy to find specific pieces. The Liber was first edited in 1896 by Solesmes Abbot Dom Andr√© Mocquereau (1849‚Äì1930). Its use has decreased since the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council (opened by Pope John XXIII in 1962), in the constitution on the liturgy (Sacrosanctum Concilium), allowed the local language to be used in Church rites, even though the same council mandated that Gregorian Chant should retain \\"pride of place\\" in the liturgy (Sacrosanctum Concilium, 116). Gregorian chants are still sung in most monasteries and some churches, and in performances by groups dedicated to its preservation. In recent years, due to a resurgence of interest in Gregorian chant and the Tridentine Mass, some editions of the Liber Usualis have been reprinted or scanned and made available for download. == Bibliography and external links == * Solesmes Abbey * Liber Usualis (1924, Modern notation with a five line staff, publisher number 780c) in PDF format * Liber Usualis (1961, Solesmes notation with a four line staff) in PDF format (115 MB) * Bergeron, Katherine.

He is best known for an incident in 1957 when he ejected from his T-33 jet trainer over California's Kings Canyon National Park. Presumed dead by the Air Force, Steeves nevertheless wandered out of the wilderness after 54 days. He became a national hero until the news media raised doubts about his story. Lieutenant Steeves had been ordered to fly his jet on a training flight from Hamilton Air Force Base near San Francisco, California to Craig Air Force Base near Selma, Alabama on May 9, 1957. Something went wrong with the jet and Steeves was forced to eject and parachute out, landing in Dusy Basin, Kings Canyon National Park, near the 12,000 ft. level. Badly injuring both ankles, for 15 days he crawled nearly 20 miles over impassable mountains without food in freezing weather down the Middle Fork of the Kings River. He found a ranger's cabin at Simpson Meadow that had fish hooks, beans and a canned ham. Meanwhile the military declared him dead, having been unable to find any trace of the plane or Steeves. 52 days after the accident, Steeves was found by a group of campers on horse back near Granite Basin and brought out of the mountains. The wreckage of Steeves' jet was never found, and during elevated Cold War tensions, there was said to be speculation among uninformed observers that Steeves had sold his jet to Russia or shipped it piecemeal to Mexico. This speculation was not entertained by serious observers, however, given that Steeves' T-33 was a low-tech training jet that the Russians would not have wanted. Even so, the Air Force's accident report mentioned, as one of three probable causes for the jet crash, that Steeves had carried out a hoax; however, the accident report did not offer any explanation as to what the hoax might have involved. Even though no charges were brought against Steeves, he requested discharge from the Air Force, which was granted. Steeves moved to Fresno, west of where he ejected, and established an aviation firm that flew skydivers and modified light airplanes. In the following years, he took hiking trips to Kings Canyon and flew over the area in a search for the wreckage of his jet. In October 1965, Steeves was killed at the Boise, Idaho airport in the crash of a Stinson airplane that he had modified. In the summer of 1977 some Boy Scouts from Los Angeles on a hiking trip in Dusy Basin in Kings Canyon National Park came across an aircraft canopy. In October the following year it was announced the serial number on it matched the missing T-33A jet that Steeves had piloted. As of June, 2014, no more wreckage has been found. ==References== == Bibliography == * ==External links== *Aviation History On- Line Museum Article *David Steeves at Find a Grave Category:1934 births Category:1965 deaths Category:United States Air Force officers ","title":"David Steeves"},{"id":"2557419","text":"Gaetano \\"Tommy\\" DeVito (June 19, 1928 ‚Äì September 21, 2020) was an American musician and singer, best known as a founding member, vocalist, and lead guitarist of rock band the Four Seasons. ==Early years== DeVito was born on June 19, 1928 in Belleville, New Jersey, United States, the youngest of nine children in an Italian-American family. At eight years old, he taught himself to play his brother‚Äôs guitar by listening to country music on the radio. By the time he was 12, he was playing for tips in neighborhood taverns. He quit school after the eighth grade. (Belleville High made him an honorary graduate in 2007.) By 16, he had his own R&B; band and was making $20 or $25 a night. ==Career== DeVito's musical career began in the early 1950s when he formed \\"the Variety Trio\\" with his brother Nick DeVito and Hank Majewski. This core group performed under various names and changing lineups. The band expanded to a quartet and changed its name to \\"the Variatones\\" including the addition in 1954 of singer Francis Castelluccio (later known as Frankie Valli). When they were signed to a recording contract with RCA Victor, in 1956, the quartet of DeVito/DeVito/Hank Majewski/Valli had renamed themselves \\"the Four Lovers\\". Tommy and Frankie remained the only consistent members of the Four Lovers, as the group released seven singles and one album under the Four Lovers name. Their 1956 debut single, Otis Blackwell's \\"You're the Apple of My Eye\\", achieved enough national sales to appear as a minor hit on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.Whitburn, Joel. Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955‚Äì1993, Billboard Publications 1994 The single landed Tommy his first national television appearance, when the Four Lovers appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1956.https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xfuyn While his brother Nick left the group, Tommy DeVito continued his musical pursuits, reforming and realigning the group. He was close friends with Joe Pesci, who introduced DeVito and Valli to Bob Gaudio. By 1960 The Four Lovers consisted of DeVito and Valli along with lyricist/singer/keyboardist Bob Gaudio and vocal arranger Nick Massi, and were mainly used as a backup band for producer Bob Crewe under contract. This is the lineup which adopted the name \\"The Four Seasons\\" (actually, they were billed numerically as the 4 Seasons), named after a bowling alley in Union, New Jersey, that had a lounge where they had auditioned. Signed by songwriter/producer Bob Crewe, the Four Seasons cut their first single under that name, \\"Bermuda\\", in November 1961. It was released by Gone Records, but did not succeed. Their next single did, in 1962 Gaudio's composition No. 1 single \\"Sherry\\". Released by Vee Jay Records in July 1962, \\"Sherry\\" hit number one in September, the first of three consecutive chart-topping hits by the Four Seasons, the others being \\"Big Girls Don't Cry\\" and \\"Walk Like a Man\\". Massi left the group in 1965, just before the release of \\"Let's Hang On!\\", and arranger Charles Calello played bass until a new bass player could be found, and then Joe Long joined the band and participated on many chart topping hits for the remainder of the decade and into the mid-1970s. DeVito left the group in April 1970 before the album Half and Half was released. He told the Las Vegas Review Journal in 2009 \\"I had had it up to here with the traveling and changing clothes three times a day, and taking two planes and then driving 100 miles to do a date. Getting on stage and doing the same stuff‚ÄîI just had it.\\" On the last song of this album, \\"Oh Happy Day, Any Day Now\\", DeVito can be heard playing a bit of a solo on his guitar. He sold Valli and Gaudio his rights to the Four Seasons' material, name, and touring act in 1971. The reason for his departure was originally indicated as a hearing problem, but it was later revealed that he had accrued significant debt and financial trouble. Times were tough for him for a while, as he discussed in a 2009 interview with Doug Elfman in the Las Vegas Review- Journal. DeVito, along with fellow original Four Seasons Valli, Massi, and Gaudio, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999. DeVito rejoined Valli and Gaudio (Massi had died in 2000) on stage at the 2005 Broadway opening of the documentary-style musical Jersey Boys, a Tony Award winning hit chronicling the story of the group's early days, which was later adapted to a 2014 feature film directed by Clint Eastwood.https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/06/clint- eastwoods-baffling-jersey-boys/373145/ ==Death== DeVito died on September 21, 2020, at the age of 92 in Las Vegas. His death was announced on Facebook by his friend, actor Alfred Nittoli, who stated that DeVito had recently been hospitalized after contracting COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nevada. ==References* * Tommy DeVito, Original Member of the Four Seasons, Dies at 92.

Mankiewicz, who also wrote the uncredited screenplay, and produced by John Houseman. The original music score is by Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa. The film stars Marlon Brando as Mark Antony, James Mason as Brutus, John Gielgud as Cassius, Louis Calhern as Julius Caesar, Edmond O'Brien as Casca, Greer Garson as Calpurnia, and Deborah Kerr as Portia. ==Casting== Many actors in this film had experience in the play. John Gielgud had played Mark Antony at the Old Vic Theatre in 1930 and Cassius at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1950, James Mason had played Brutus at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin in the 1940s, and John Hoyt, who plays Decius Brutus, also played him in the Mercury Theatre's 1937 stage version. Gielgud later played the title role in the 1970 film with Charlton Heston, Jason Robards and Richard Johnson (as Cassius) and in a stage production directed by John Schlesinger at the Royal National Theatre. John Houseman, who had produced the famous 1937 Broadway version of the play starring Orson Welles and the Mercury Theatre, also produced the MGM film. By this time, however, Welles and Houseman had had a falling out, and Welles had nothing to do with the 1953 film. P. M. Pasinetti, Italian-American writer, scholar, and teacher at UCLA served as a technical advisor. Brando's casting was met with some skepticism when it was announced, as he had acquired the nickname of \\"The Mumbler\\" following his performance in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951). Director Joseph L. Mankiewicz even considered Paul Scofield for the role of Mark Antony if Brando's screen test was unsuccessful. Brando asked John Gielgud for advice in declaiming Shakespeare, and adopted all of Gielgud's recommendations. Brando's performance turned out so well that the New York Times stated in its review of the film: ‚ÄúHappily, Mr. Brando's diction, which has been guttural and slurred in previous films, is clear and precise in this instance. In him a major talent has emerged.‚Äù Brando was so dedicated in his performance during shooting that Gielgud offered to direct him in a stage production of Hamlet, a proposition that Brando seriously considered but ultimately turned down. During filming, James Mason became concerned that Brando was stealing the audience's sympathy away from him and his character, Brutus, so Mason appealed to Mankiewicz, with whom he had bonded earlier while making the film 5 Fingers, requesting that the director stop Brando from dominating the film and \\"put the focus back where it belongs. Namely on me!\\" The subsequent shift in directorial attention didn't escape Brando, who threatened to walk off the film if Mankiewicz \\"threw one more scene to Mason\\", alleging a m√©nage √† trois among Mankiewicz, Mason and Mason's wife Pamela. Despite the feuding, production continued with only minimal disruption, thanks to what Gielgud called, \\"Mankiewicz's consummate tact that kept us together as a working unit.\\" O. Z. Whitehead is listed on the Internet Movie Database as having played Cinna the Poet in the film and not receiving screen credit, but his one scene was deleted before release, and it is not included in any DVD or video releases of the film. (However, Cinna the Conspirator does appear; he is played by actor William Cottrell.) ==Cast== * Marlon Brando as Mark Antony * James Mason as Brutus * John Gielgud as Cassius * Louis Calhern as Julius Caesar * Edmond O'Brien as Casca * Greer Garson as Calpurnia * Deborah Kerr as Portia * George Macready as Marullus * Michael Pate as Flavius * Richard Hale as a Soothsayer * Alan Napier as Cicero * John Hoyt as Decius Brutus * Tom Powers as Metellus Cimber * William Cottrell as Cinna * Jack Raine as Trebonius * Ian Wolfe as Ligarius * Morgan Farley as Artemidorus * Bill Phipps as Servant to Antony * Douglass Watson as Octavius Caesar * Douglass Dumbrille as Lepidus * Rhys Williams as Lucilius * Michael Ansara as Pindarus * Dayton Lummis as Messala * Edmund Purdom as Strato * John Doucette as a Carpenter * John Hardy as Lucius * Chester Stratton as Servant to Caesar * Lumsden Hare as Publius * Preston Hanson as Claudius * Victor Perry as Popilius Lena * Michael Tolan as Officer to Octavius * John Lupton as Varro * Joe Waring as Clitus * John Parrish as Titinius * Stephen Roberts as Dardanius * Paul Guilfoyle as a Citizen of Rome * Lawrence Dobkin as a Citizen of Rome * Jo Gilbert as a Citizen of Rome * David Bond as a Citizen of Rome * Ann Tyrrell as a Citizen of Rome * John O'Malley as a Citizen of Rome * Oliver Blake as a Citizen of Rome * Alvin Hurwitz as a Citizen of Rome * Donald Elson as a Citizen of Rome ===Dramatis personae=== in the order of their appearance * John Doucette as a Carpenter * George Macready as Marullus * Michael Pate as Flavius * Louis Calhern as Julius Caesar * Edmond O'Brien as Casca * Greer Garson as Calpurnia * Deborah Kerr as Portia * Marlon Brando as Mark Antony * James Mason as Brutus * John Gielgud as Cassius * Richard Hale as a Soothsayer * Alan Napier as Cicero * William Cottrell as Cinna * John Hardy as Lucius * John Hoyt as Decius Brutus * Tom Powers as Metellus Cimber * Jack Raine as Trebonius * Ian Wolfe as Ligarius * Chester Stratton as a Servant to Caesar * Lumsden Hare as Publius * Morgan Farley as Artemidorus * Victor Perry as Popilius Lena * Bill Phipps as a Servant to Antony * Michael Tolan as an officer to Octavius * Douglass Watson (as Douglas Watson) as Octavius Caesar * Douglass Dumbrille as Lepidus * Rhys Williams as Lucilius * Michael Ansara as Pindarus * Dayton Lummis as Messala * John Lupton as Varro * Preston Hanson as Claudius * John Parrish as Titinius * Joe Waring as Clitus * Stephen Roberts as Dardanius * Thomas Browne Henry as Volumnius * Edmund Purdom as Strato and as citizens of Rome * Paul Guilfoyle Lawrence Dobkin * David Bond Jo Gilbert Ann Tyrrell * John O'Malley Oliver Blake * Alvin Hurwitz Donald Elson * James Dime ==Production== Producer John Houseman says the film was made because Henry V (1944) had been a success. MGM's head of production Dore Schary offered the project to Houseman, who said he wanted Joseph L.

Based on the novel of the same name by Nicci French, it introduces several substantial changes to the story and focuses heavily on the intense sexual relationship between the two lead characters. It is Kaige's first and only English-language film . == Plot == Alice is a young American woman living in London who believes she is happy in a secure job and a relationship with her boyfriend. After a chance encounter with a mysterious stranger, she seeks him out, taking a taxi with him to his house and having passionate sex. She returns home to her boyfriend and unsuccessfully attempts to bring out the same feelings between them that she had with the strange man. The following day she seeks the stranger out again, discovering his name is Adam - a mountain climber who is considered a hero after saving six people in a tragic event that killed several others, including the woman he loved. Alice leaves her boyfriend and begins a relationship with Adam, although her friend shows reservations about Alice being in such a sudden relationship. When Alice is mugged on the street, Adam beats the thief terribly, and then asks Alice to marry him, a proposal she happily accepts. For their honeymoon, he takes her to a secluded cabin. The newlyweds settle into their new life, but Alice is troubled by a series of mysterious letters and phone calls, and begins to wonder about her husband's mysterious past. A reporter who did a story on Adam sends her a copy of a letter from a woman claiming Adam raped her. Alice interviews her, posing as a journalist. Disturbed by the fact that she barely knows her new husband, she begins to go through their apartment, becoming even more alarmed when she searches a locked wardrobe and finds a box of old letters from an ex-lover, Adele, who insists she and Adam end their affair. Adam begins to question Alice more about her activities, including where she got a necklace that she received from his sister, Deborah. Soon after, Alice receives yet another warning. Following the trail, she discovers that Adele has been missing for eight months. She also finds a picture of Adele at the same cabin where she and Adam honeymooned. She realizes she doesn't feel safe with him and runs to the police. She tells her story, insisting they reopen Adele's missing persons case, but they can't do anything without any evidence, telling her they can only keep him for a few hours. Alice seeks help from Deborah, telling her she believes Adam killed Adele for leaving him and buried her at the cabin. On the way to the cabin, Deborah admits that she was the one who sent the messages to Alice, because she wanted to save her from Adam's violent rages. When Adam returns home from the police station, he finds that Alice was there and left the two pictures, and realizes she must have gone to the cemetery. At the cemetery, Alice discovers a body buried in the dirt, wearing the same necklace that Deborah gave her. Deborah tells her that Adele didn't have to die, if she'd only gone back to her husband. It is apparent that Deborah has incestuous feelings for Adam, resulting in her subsequent possessiveness and need to rid his life of any other woman. She tries to kill Alice, but Adam appears in time and saves her. Furious, Deborah tries to kill him but is stopped short by Alice, who shoots her with a flare pistol. Adam tells Alice that he and his sister used to come to the cabin together, but that he thought that if Alice just trusted him, then everything would be alright. Adam is led away by police that morning. Two years later, Alice and Adam see one another again on either side of an escalator - she's going down and he's riding up. They both watch each other as they pass without saying anything. Adam stops at the top and turns to stare back at Alice before walking away. The film ends with Alice's voiceover recalling the events in posterity and wondering what might have happened had fate not led her to Adam one morning. She wonders if the passion between them could ever have lasted, and if a \\"flatlander\\" like her could ever have stayed at such a high altitude. At least that's what she tells herself anyway. == Cast == == Production == Filming commenced on October 29, 2000, and was mostly based in or around London and Cumbria, England. == Release == Killing Me Softly was released on June 21, 2002, in the UK.

He was mortally wounded at the Battle of Cedar Creek and was mourned by a number of leading generals. ==Early life== Charles Russell Lowell III was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His mother, Anna Cabot Jackson, a daughter of Patrick Tracy Jackson, married Charles Russell Lowell, Jr., brother of Robert Traill Spence Lowell and James Russell Lowell. Charles Jr., Robert, and James were sons of Unitarian Minister Charles Lowell. Anna wrote verse and books on education. Lowell III graduated as the valedictorian from Harvard College in 1854, and worked in an iron mill in Trenton, New Jersey, for a few months in 1855. He spent two years abroad, and from 1858 to 1860 was local treasurer of the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad. In 1860, he took charge of the Mount Savage Iron Works in Cumberland, Maryland. ==Civil War== Lowell entered the Union Army in June 1861, and was commissioned as a captain in the 3rd U.S. Cavalry, transferring to the 6th U.S. Cavalry in August. He served as an aide- de-camp to General George B. McClellan during the formation of the Army of the Potomac in the summer and fall of 1861 and continued at McClellan's side during the 1862 Peninsula Campaign and the Battle of Antietam. In 1863 Lowell recruited and organized the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry, and on May 10 was appointed its colonel. During the winter of 1863‚Äì1864, he was in charge of the outer defenses of Washington, D.C., and was engaged in repelling the raid by Confederate Lt. Gen. Jubal Early that reached the outskirts of the capital. During the Valley Campaigns of 1864, Lowell commanded a brigade of cavalry in Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt's division of the Cavalry Corps of Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan's army. He distinguished himself at Third Winchester and took a leading role in the Confederate rout at Tom's Brook. He was mortally wounded during the Union counterattack at the Battle of Cedar Creek on October 19, 1864. General Sheridan interceded to ensure that he was promoted to brigadier general on that day. He died on the next day at Middletown, Virginia, at the age of 29. He is buried in the Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Lowell was nominated as a brigadier general two days after his death. Since he was unable to sign his new commission after his death, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton authorized an exception allowing the posthumous promotion to become official. Upon hearing of his death, General George Armstrong Custer wept and Sheridan remarked \\"I do not think there was a quality which I could have added to Lowell. He was the perfection of a man and a soldier.\\" Josephine Shaw and Colonel Lowell in 1863 Grave of Charles Russell Lowell at Mount Auburn Cemetery In October 1863, Lowell married businesswoman Josephine Shaw (1843‚Äî1905), a sister of his close friend and fellow Union Army casualty Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (1837‚Äî1863). Her home when she was married was on Staten Island, and she became deeply interested in the social problems of New York City.

The project was conceived by John Holmgren of Shafer, Minnesota in the United States after hearing the song \\"Have You Forgotten\\" by country singer Darryl Worley. An over-the-road truck driver, Holmgren transformed his 18-wheeler into the tribute with the help of a mural artist. The mural image, along with the names of the victims of the attack, were printed onto vinyl sheets and applied to the truck at a cost of nearly $40,000 USD. Holmgren sold t-shirts, toy models of the truck and other merchandise to cover expenses but has nonetheless gone into debt. Holmgren attributes the popularity of his truck to an e-mail forward, which apparently started in 2004 with a food company employee who photographed the truck. The e-mail eventually made its way into the hands of celebrities such as Jimmy Buffett and Reba McEntire, who then asked Holmgren to bring his truck to their concerts. The truck was also invited to \\"ground zero\\" for a special commemorative ceremony in 2004. Holmgren displays the truck all over the U.S. and continues to use it to transport freight when possible. In an interview with the Star Tribune, he said \\"Troopers pull me over just to get a picture with the truck. Once I even got out of a ticket. The guy said, 'I can't give this to you, knowing what you're doing.'\\" Holmgren has received emails from over 20 countries, and there are several websites devoted to his truck. He has also met with families of 9/11 victims. There was a plan to donate the truck to New York City in 2006, but there is no evidence this has happened. ==Notes== == External links == * *Gear Up 343 panel - Photo of panel on truck sponsored by the firefighters group Gear Up commemorating the 343 FDNY firefighters and paramedics who lost their lives in the response to 9/11 Category:Monuments and memorials in the United States Category:Aftermath of the September 11 attacks ","title":"The Rolling Memorial"},{"id":"2557480","text":"The Web is a 1947 American film noir crime film directed by Michael Gordon and starring Ella Raines, Edmond O'Brien, William Bendix and Vincent Price.. ==Plot== Leopold Kroner (Fritz Leiber, Sr.), formerly of Colby Enterprises, is released after five years in prison for embezzlement. Andrew Colby (Price), claiming that Kroner has threatened him, hires lawyer Bob Regan (Edmond O'Brien) as a personal bodyguard. That evening, Regan hears a gunshot from Colby's study and finds Kroner there, apparently trying to kill Colby. Regan kills Kroner when he turns around, pointing the gun at him. Regan believes Colby's explanation that Kroner had become delusional and threatening, until Regan's police buddy Damico (William Bendix) lets on that he's suspicious that Regan murdered Kroner. Kroner's daughter Martha Kroner (Maria Palmer) shows up at Regan's apartment and tries, but fails, to murder him. She reveals that Colby had invited Kroner to the house that night and Kroner was of sound mind. Regan investigates further, getting information about Kroner's embezzlement case from a reporter and Colby's secretary, Noel (Ella Raines). Regan has a friend impersonate one of Colby's associates on the phone to deceive him into providing information about the embezzlement, unknowing that this associate is already long dead. Colby uses this situation to his advantage to set a trap for Regan and Noel (whom he has decided has betrayed him). He innocently asks Noel to remove money from his safe, then after she leaves, he kills his associate Charles (John Abbott) with a weapon having Regan's fingerprints. The two of them are framed for theft and murder, but Lt. Damico tricks Colby into thinking Charles is still alive. Since Charles would reveal all of Colby's actions, that night Colby tries to sneak down and strangle Charles, only to be caught red-handed. ==Cast== * Ella Raines as Noel Faraday * Edmond O'Brien as Bob Regan * William Bendix as Lt.

Asian Highway AH66 runs through the pass, which provides for the only modern day overland border crossing along the 450 km boundary between the two nations. The pass has an elevation of and opens from the north to the southeast, and is 500 m wide from north to south and 1 km in length from east to west with a gentle incline not exceeding 20 degrees. On the Tajik side, the pass is 80 km by road to Murghab and about 850 km to Dushanbe. On the Chinese side, the pass is 13.9 km from Karasu (), a port of entry on the Karakorum Highway which leads to Tashkurgan (60‚Äì70 km) and Kashgar (220 km). The pass is open from the 16th to the 30th day of each month from May to November. Map including the Kulma Pass area; from the International Map of the World (AMS, 1966) Map including the Kulma Pass area (1988) The pass was closed for many years due to political tensions between the Soviet Union and China, and then the Tajikistani Civil War. In 1997, China and Tajikistan signed an agreement to develop a commercial corridor between the two countries through the pass. The opening of the pass reduced cargo travel time between the two countries by ten to fifteen days, obviating lengthy detours into Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. ==Karasu Port of Entry== The Karasu Port of Entry opened on May 25, 2004, and traffic volume grew considerably. In the first three months after the pass opened, an official tally by the Tajik Ministry of Traffic and Roads counted legal crossings of just 17 trucks, 10 buses, 240 tons of cargo, and 171 people over a three-month period. Unofficial transits are believed to be more common, as many locals lack passports needed to cross the pass legally. From May to August 2006, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce registered 649 cargo shipments totaling 11,218.5 metric tons of goods. In the same three months the following year, traffic volume reached 1,836 cargo shipments and 30,556 metric tons. In all, travelers made 12,500 trips through the pass in 2007 transporting 56,300 metric tons of goods worth US$250 million. Commonly traded goods include automobiles, construction materials, machinery, electronics, furniture, eggs, and rice. In 2013, 31,000 tons of goods were shipped through the Kulma Pass and processed at the Karasu Border Crossing. The bilateral agreement signed between China and Tajikistan includes the opening of the pass for nationals of all countries. After an initial period where foreigners were still turned back, since 2017, foreign travelers have been passing regularly and without extra problems. ==See also== * China‚ÄìTajikistan border * China National Highway 314 ==Notes== ==References== Category:Mountain passes of Tajikistan Category:Mountain passes of Xinjiang Category:Transport in Xinjiang Category:China‚ÄìTajikistan border crossings Category:Mountain passes of the Pamir ","title":"Kulma Pass"},{"id":"2557510","text":"A long squeeze is a situation in which investors who hold long positions feel the need to sell into a falling market to cut their losses. This pressure to sell usually leads to a further decline in market prices. This situation is less common than the opposite short squeeze, because in a short squeeze, the traders who have taken the short contracts have a legal obligation to settle with the promised shares. A trader who is 'long' in a long squeeze may well have no such obligation, but may sell out of fear. Other investors may see the rapid decline in price as irrational and a buying opportunity (more often than a rapid rise in price seen as a shorting opportunity). However, in times of significant market turmoil, identifying a long squeeze becomes of more practical interest rather than merely a theoretical possibility. In 2008, Bear Stearns was wiped out after market rumors that the company had cash concerns. Investors started selling the scrip, resulting in a long squeeze, which triggered many other stop order losses and accelerated the decline of the company's stock. In 2020, the oil futures market saw a long squeeze when the price of near-month futures for West Texas Intermediate oil fell below $0, causing long holders to be margin-called, forcing the price lower and triggering additional margin-calls, in a manner similar to a classic short squeeze, eventually reaching a bottom of $-37.63, before later recovering to nearly $3. ==External links and sources== *What is a Squeeze Play? ==References== Category:Business terms Category:Stock market ","title":"Long squeeze"},{"id":"2557535","text":"Eva Briegel (born 3 December 1978) is a German singer and member of the rock band Juli. ==Early life== Briegel's family lived in B√∂blingen in 1978, when Eva was born.

His father, Richard Chapman Pincher, was a major in the British army stationed in India, and his mother Helen (n√©e Foster), was an actress. His father's family was from north Yorkshire and his father was serving in the Northumberland Fusiliers when Chapman was born. They had married in 1913 in Pontefract. which is a small market town. The family returned home to Pontefract when Pincher was aged three, and he attended 13 different schools before the family settled in Darlington, where his father would later own a sweet shop and a pub on the River Tees. Aged 10, he won a scholarship to Darlington Grammar School where he took an interest in genetics, afterwards studying zoology and biology at King's College London. Chapman Pincher married Constance Sylvia Wolstenholme in 1965. Pincher had two children, but they were from a previous marriage. Pincher was married three times altogether. ==Early career== His first teaching job as a physics master was at the Liverpool Institute High School for Boys where he took pride in writing agricultural journals. When World War II began, Pincher decided to join the Royal Armoured Corps to serve his country, mainly because he felt that was the right thing to do, and because his father was no longer in the Army by this point. Pincher was a Staff Officer in the Corps, which he grew to very much enjoy during his time in the military. He took a keen interest in the trade of weaponry and learned as much as he possibly could. Pincher eventually became a tank gunner. Pincher also grew interested in intelligence and how it related to military purposes. He learned quickly that there was a lot of lying going on that he believed he could get to the bottom of if someone would give him the chance in the first place. Pincher was contacted by the Daily Express for information about a new explosive that had been developed while he was researching rockets during his time in the Royal Armoured Corps. Pincher reported news of the development of RDX and would continually supply information of this sort, specifically about ‚ÄúV-1 flying bomb, the V-2 rocket and the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima.‚Äù https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/06/chapman-pincher The Daily Express could see the potential in the pieces which he sent in and when he finished his time in the Army, he was recruited by that newspaper. Pincher believed it was his job to keep the media informed on decisions the military took every day, and took joy in finding angles that nobody else could find. ==Career== At the Daily Express, Pincher developed his own style of investigative journalism, actively seeking out high-level contacts to obtain secret information. Assigned to cover the stories of physicists Alan Nunn May and Klaus Fuchs, who in the early post-war years were unmasked as Soviet spies, espionage became a particular interest of Pincher's. Pincher's career as a journalist thereon mainly involved uncovering Cold War secrets in London for the Daily Express. During his career, he had contacts within the British Government that suggested MI5 and MI6 could possibly be providing housing unwittingly for Soviet agents. Pincher always went \\"above and beyond\\" for his investigative reporting style, including checking people's personal phone calls and relentlessly importuning important people, such as Prime Minister Harold Wilson, for answers to questions that Pincher thought were being concealed from the public. He regularly provided exclusives that other journalists had missed, which led to his employers calling him \\"the lone wolf of Fleet Street\\". He made both friends and enemies in high places. In 1959, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote to his Minister of Defence: \\"Can nothing be done to suppress or get rid of Chapman Pincher?\\" Pincher obtained the title \\"spy catcher\\" after he exposed several people as spies, one of the most famous being George Blake, an MI6 member who let close to one hundred Soviet spies get jobs at the embassy in London. https://www.britannica.com/biography/Chapman-Pincher He won awards as Journalist of the Year in 1964, and Reporter of the Decade in 1966. ==Later life and career== Pincher is best known as the author of the book Their Trade is Treachery (1981), in which he publicized for the first time the suspicions that MI5's former Director General Roger Hollis had been a spy for the Soviet Union, and described MI5's and MI6's internal inquiries into the matter. Pincher was at one point close to Peter Wright, who, he knew, suspected Harold Wilson of having been a Soviet agent, and according to the biography of Wilson written by Ben Pimlott, Pincher was trying to get information from Wright so that he could accuse Wilson in a public setting in the near future. Wright, a retired MI5 Soviet counterespionage officer, was Pincher's main source for Their Trade is Treachery, along with British MP Jonathan Aitken and Wright's former colleague Arthur S. Martin. Aitken, using information from retired CIA counterespionage chief James Jesus Angleton, wrote a highly confidential letter in early 1980 to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, outlining Angleton's suspicions of Hollis acting as a double agent. Pincher became ensnared in 1986 in the Spycatcher affair, when Wright tried to publish his own book in Australia, in apparent violation of his oath-taking of the Official Secrets Act when he joined MI5. The matter led to prolonged legal wrangling, with the British government mounting a strong defence against publication, which was ultimately unsuccessful through three levels of the Australian court system. Wright was represented by a young barrister called Malcolm Turnbull who, in 2015, would become the 29th Australian Prime Minister. During his cross-examination, Turnbull exposed the British Cabinet Secretary, Sir Robert Armstrong, in a clear lie. In the meantime, Spycatcher was published in the United States in mid-1987, where it became a best seller. Pincher was investigated and cleared of any wrongdoing, through a police investigation.Chapman Pincher A Web of Deception: The Spycatcher Affair, London: Sidgwick and Jackson, 1987; Pincher was convinced that, alongside Wilson, many other members of the Labour Party were Soviet agents, among them Member of Parliament, Tom Driberg, who was Chairman of the Labour Party. Pincher claimed that Driberg was an active double agent for MI5 and the KGB despite his well-founded reputation for total indiscretion.\\"UK Politics: Driberg always under suspicion\\", BBC News, 13 September 1999. Treachery: Betrayals, Blunders, and Cover-ups: Six Decades of Espionage Against America and Great Britain, first published in 2009, brings the known Soviet espionage cases against the UK and United States up to date. ==Death== Pincher died on 5 August 2014 at Kintbury in West Berkshire, England at 100 years old. Just seven weeks before his death, Pincher suffered a stroke. He died with his family by his side, talking about his time in espionage and the power it gave him in his career.

It was destroyed by the Last Island Hurricane of August 10, 1856. Over 200 people perished in the storm, and the island was left void of vegetation.

Vine Island).http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=816 The western end of the remaining westernmost island is known as Raccoon Point. The remnants of Last Island are now a haven for pelicans and other seabirds.

The closest village is Cocodrie, which is about 13 miles northeast of Trinity Island. ==Resort at Last Island== Before the Last Island Hurricane, Isle Derni√®re (Last Island) was a popular resort where people could enjoy white sand beaches and clearer water, which are not found on the marshy mainland. Last Island was also known for an almost continuous breeze, which would have been welcomed by those escaping the suffocating heat of the mainland. Accommodations included the John Muggah's Ocean House Hotel, and for entertainment there were several gambling establishments and the Captain Dave Muggah's Billiard House. Several hundred yards to the west of the hotel was the settlement known as Last Island Village which consisted of approximately 100 beach homes, some \\"fine\\" houses and other temporary summer houses. Regular steamer service to the island was provided by the Star from Bayou Boeuf. The New Orleans, Opelousas and Great Western Railroad provided a connection to Bayou Boeuf from Algiers, La., a short ride on the Algiers Train Ferry across the Mississippi River from the French Quarter landing at St. Ann Street. Regular railroad fare was $3.50 with half-fare for children and servants. (New Orleanians could take the Algiers passenger ferry.)

In 1981 Noel hired Jack O'Brien to replace him as artistic director, but he remained active in the leadership of the Old Globe right up until his death. He created the San Diego National Shakespeare Festival in 1949, making the Globe the first professional Actors Equity theater on the West Coast. Under his leadership the Globe added a second theatre, the in-the-round Cassius Carter Theatre, in 1968, and a third, the outdoor Festival Stage, in 1978. He led rebuilding efforts after the original Globe and later the Festival Stage were destroyed by arson. He was instrumental in creating the Master of Fine Arts in Acting program at the University of San Diego in 1987. In 1983, he established Teatro Meta, a bilingual playwriting program involving thousands of San Diego young people. He fostered the careers of numerous actors and directors who later achieved fame, including Jack O'Brien, Marion Ross, David Ogden Stiers, Kelsey Grammer, Kandis Chappell and Jonathan McMurtry. In 2005 Craig Noel celebrated his 90th birthday coinciding with the 70th anniversary of the Old Globe Theatre. In 2007, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts for his ‚Äùdecades of leadership as a pillar of the American theater.‚Äù He died April 3, 2010 at the age of 94 at his home in San Diego.San Diego Union Tribune, April 5, 2010 ==References== Category:1915 births Category:2010 deaths Category:American theatre managers and producers Category:Businesspeople from San Diego Category:United States National Medal of Arts recipients Category:Balboa Park (San Diego) Category:People from Deming, New Mexico ","title":"Craig Noel"},{"id":"2557571","text":"RYB color wheel Blue-green is a representation of the color that is between green and blue on a typical traditional RYB color wheel. It belongs to the cyan family of colors. ==Variations== ===Cyan (aqua)=== RGB color wheel Cyan, also called aqua, is the blue-green color that is between blue and green on a modern RGB color wheel. The modern RGB color wheel replaced the traditional old-fashioned RYB color wheel because it is possible to display much brighter and more saturated colors using the primary and secondary colors of the RGB color wheel. In the terminology of color theory, RGB color space has a much larger color gamut than RYB color space.

It was endowed by a bequest of $250,000 left by John Lowell, Jr., who died in 1836. The Institute began work in the winter of 1839/40, and an inaugural lecture was given on December 31, 1839, by Edward Everett. ==Bequest== Lowell's will set up an endowment with a principal of over $1 million (in 1909), stipulating 10% of its net annual income was to be added back to help it grow. None of the fund was to be invested in a building for the lectures. The trustees of the Boston Athenaeum were made visitors of the fund, but the trustee of the fund is authorized to select his own successor. In naming a successor, the Institute's trustee must always choose in preference to all others some male descendant of Lowell's grandfather, John Lowell, provided there is one who is competent to hold the office of trustee, and of the name of Lowell. The sole trustee so appointed is solely responsible for the entire selection of the lecturers and the subjects of lectures. The first trustee was Lowell's cousin, John Amory Lowell, who administered the trust for more than forty years, and was succeeded in 1881 by his son, Augustus Lowell. He in turn was succeeded in 1900 by his son Abbott Lawrence Lowell, who in 1909 also became president of Harvard University. ==Activities== ===Popular lectures=== The founder provided for two kinds of lectures, one popular, and the other more advanced. The popular lectures have taken the form of courses usually ranging from half a dozen to a dozen lectures, and covering almost every subject. The payments to the lecturers have always been large, and lectures of many eminent people from America and Europe have been sponsored. A number of books have been published which consist of those lectures or have been based upon them. During the mid-20th century, the Lowell Institute decided to enter the broadcasting business, which led to the creation of the WGBH-FM radio station in 1952, and the WGBH- TV television station in 1955. The WGBH Educational Foundation is now one of the largest producers of public television content and public radio programming in the United States. , the Lowell Institute sponsors an annual series of free public lectures on current scientific topics, under the aegis of the Museum of Science Boston. In addition, the Lowell Institute sponsors the Forum Network, a public media service of the WGBH Educational Foundation which distributes free public lectures over the Internet, from a large number of program partners in and beyond Boston. ===Advanced lectures=== As to the advanced lectures, the founder seems to have had in view what is now called university extension, and in this he was far ahead of his time. In pursuance of this provision, public instruction of various kinds has been given from time to time by the Institute. The first freehand drawing in Boston was taught there, but was given up when the public schools undertook it. In the same way, a school of practical design was carried on for many years, but finally in 1903 was transferred to the Museum of Fine Arts. Instruction for working men was given at the Wells Memorial Institute until 1908, when the Franklin Foundation took up the work, which resulted in the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology (BFIT). A Teacher's School of Science was maintained in co- operation with the Boston Society of Natural History, later renamed the Museum of Science Boston, which still continues to sponsor professional development courses for secondary school science teachers. For many years, advanced courses of lectures were given by professors of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and in 1903 these were superseded by an evening \\"School for Industrial Foremen\\" sharing classroom and laboratory facilities. Over time, this became known as the Lowell Institute School, remaining on the MIT campus until 1996, when it was transferred to the Northeastern University Engineering School. The Lowell Institute School now is a division of the School of Professional Studies at Northeastern, offering full- and part-time programs leading to certificates, and associate's or bachelor's degrees. In 1907, under the title of \\"Collegiate Courses\\", a number of the elementary courses in Harvard University were offered free to the public under the same conditions of study and examination as in the university. This program eventually became the Harvard University Extension School, now offering hundreds of courses, and certificate and academic degree programs to residents of Greater Boston. ==See also== * Lowell Technological Institute ==References== ==Further reading== *Charles F.

It started to play at midnight on 1 January 2000, and if all goes as planned, it will continue without repetition until 31 December 2999. It will end and play again until 3999 or 3998. Longplayer can be played on any format, including ones not yet invented and is thus not tied to any one form of technology. There have also been several live performances and future performances continue to be planned. It began as an original commission by arts organisation Artangel and is currently maintained by the Longplayer Trust and is located in Bow Creek Lighthouse, Trinity Buoy Wharf on the north bank of the River Thames. ==History== Tibetan singing bowl used at a live performance of Longplayer Longplayer is based on an existing piece of music, 20 minutes and 20 seconds in length, which is processed by computer using a simple algorithm. This gives a large number of variations, which, when played consecutively, gives a total expected runtime of 1000 years. It is played on a single instrument consisting of 234 Tibetan singing bowls and gongs of different sizes, which are able to create a range of sounds by either striking or rolling pieces of wood around the rims. This source music was recorded in December 1999. It was commissioned by Artangel. The piece is described as reflecting on the concepts of time and impermanence from a cosmological and philosophical perspective, and questions traditional ideas about composition sound, time and duration. The piece was the conclusion of several years' study into musical systems by Finer and is written as a self generating computer programme. According to Finer, the idea first came to him on the back of a tour bus whilst he was a musician in punk band The Pogues. He began working on the programming in 1995, for which he learned several computer programming languages before finally settling on SuperCollider, a language which uses algorithms to organise notation, data or MIDI to compose music, sometimes known as algorithmic composition. The programme is regularly transferred from one motherboard to another in order that the software remains continuously viable. As of 2015 this was operated by a wall of Apple computers in the Bow Creek Lighthouse. The music is produced by simple mechanical processes, and Tibetan bowls were decided on partly because of their relative robustness and ability to stay in tune without frequent retuning and partly because they have a long musical tradition stretching back over a thousand years and would not sound fixed to a particular musical fashion in history and become dated. ==Listening and performances== One of the listening posts, Bow Creek Lighthouse Longplayer could be heard in the relaxation zone of the Millennium Dome in London during its year of opening in 2000. The piece is also played in the 19th century lighthouse at Trinity Buoy Wharf and other public listening posts in the United Kingdom. It can currently be heard in several locations including the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Horniman Museum and Kings Place. Other listening stations can be found in the United States, Australia and Egypt, where it can still be heard today. It can also be heard via an Icecast Internet stream. Jem Finer and David Toop at the Roundhouse In 2009 a 1000 minute long part of the piece was performed with a 26 piece orchestra on a purpose built stage at the Roundhouse, a converted railway turntable building now a performing arts venue in Chalk Farm, London. Performers included David Toop and Ansuman Biswas and the piece was played on what Finer described as a \\"giant synthesiser built of bronze-age technology.\\" Musicians played in shifts in groups of 6, beginning at 08:20 BST with the performance lasting in total 16 hours and 40 minutes. The piece is also available as an app for mobile devices, designed by Joe Hales and Daniel Jones which runs completely independently of the piece being broadcast but is exactly in synchronised performance with it. Four excerpts of Longplayer were also released on vinyl LP which accompany a book of the same name written by Finer, along with essays by Kodwo Eshun, Janna Levin, Margaret and Christine Wertheim. ==See also== * As Slow as Possible * Clock of the Long Now ==References== ==External links== * listen to Longplayer livestream * Longplayer website: news, live stream (when available) and more * Longplayer at Artangel Category:Instrumentals Category:2000 compositions Category:Musical compositions Category:Works by English people Category:2000 establishments in England ","title":"Longplayer"},{"id":"2557590","text":"In algebra, Lagrange's identity, named after Joseph Louis Lagrange, is: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\biggl( \\\\sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2\\\\biggr) \\\\biggl(\\\\sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2\\\\biggr) - \\\\biggl(\\\\sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k\\\\biggr)^2 & = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^n (a_i b_j - a_j b_i)^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\biggl(= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\sum_{j=1,j eq i}^n (a_i b_j - a_j b_i)^2\\\\biggr), \\\\end{align} which applies to any two sets {a1, a2, . . ., an} and {b1, b2, . . ., bn} of real or complex numbers (or more generally, elements of a commutative ring). This identity is a generalisation of the Brahmagupta‚ÄìFibonacci identity and a special form of the Binet‚ÄìCauchy identity. In a more compact vector notation, Lagrange's identity is expressed as: :\\\\ \\\\mathbf a \\\\^2 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\mathbf b \\\\^2 - (\\\\mathbf {a \\\\cdot b } )^2 = \\\\sum_{1 \\\\le i < j \\\\le n} \\\\left(a_ib_j-a_jb_i \\\\right)^2 \\\\ , where a and b are n-dimensional vectors with components that are real numbers. The extension to complex numbers requires the interpretation of the dot product as an inner product or Hermitian dot product. Explicitly, for complex numbers, Lagrange's identity can be written in the form: :\\\\biggl( \\\\sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2\\\\biggr) \\\\biggl(\\\\sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2\\\\biggr) - \\\\biggl\\\\sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k\\\\biggr^2 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^n a_i \\\\overline{b}_j - a_j \\\\overline{b}_i^2 involving the absolute value. ; . Since the right-hand side of the identity is clearly non-negative, it implies Cauchy's inequality in the finite-dimensional real coordinate space ‚Ñùn and its complex counterpart ‚ÑÇn. Geometrically, the identity asserts that the square of the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by a set of vectors is the Gram determinant of the vectors. ==Lagrange's identity and exterior algebra== In terms of the wedge product, Lagrange's identity can be written :(a \\\\cdot a)(b \\\\cdot b) - (a \\\\cdot b)^2 = (a \\\\wedge b) \\\\cdot (a \\\\wedge b). Hence, it can be seen as a formula which gives the length of the wedge product of two vectors, which is the area of the parallelogram they define, in terms of the dot products of the two vectors, as :\\\\a \\\\wedge b\\\\ = \\\\sqrt{(a \\\\cdot a)(b \\\\cdot b) - (a \\\\cdot b)^2} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\a\\\\^2\\\\b\\\\^2 - (a \\\\cdot b)^2}. ==Lagrange's identity and vector calculus== In three dimensions, Lagrange's identity asserts that if a and b are vectors in ‚Ñù3 with lengths a and b, then Lagrange's identity can be written in terms of the cross product and dot product: : \\\\mathbf{a}^2 \\\\mathbf{b}^2 - (\\\\mathbf {a \\\\cdot b})^2 = \\\\mathbf {a \\\\times b}^2 Using the definition of angle based upon the dot product (see also Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality), the left-hand side is :\\\\mathbf{a}^2\\\\mathbf{b}^2(1-\\\\cos^2\\\\theta) = \\\\mathbf{a}^2\\\\mathbf{b}^2\\\\sin^2\\\\theta where Œ∏ is the angle formed by the vectors a and b. The area of a parallelogram with sides a and b and angle Œ∏ is known in elementary geometry to be :\\\\mathbf{a}\\\\,\\\\mathbf{b}\\\\,\\\\sin\\\\theta, so the left-hand side of Lagrange's identity is the squared area of the parallelogram. The cross product appearing on the right-hand side is defined by :\\\\mathbf{a}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{b} = (a_2b_3-a_3b_2)\\\\mathbf{i} + (a_3b_1-a_1b_3)\\\\mathbf{j} + (a_1b_2-a_2b_1)\\\\mathbf{k} which is a vector whose components are equal in magnitude to the areas of the projections of the parallelogram onto the yz, zx, and xy planes, respectively. ===Seven dimensions=== For a and b as vectors in ‚Ñù7, Lagrange's identity takes on the same form as in the case of ‚Ñù3 See particularly ¬ß 7.4 Cross products in ‚Ñù7, p. 96. :\\\\mathbf{a}^2 \\\\mathbf{b}^2 -\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{b}^2 = \\\\mathbf{a} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{b}^2 \\\\ , However, the cross product in 7 dimensions does not share all the properties of the cross product in 3 dimensions. For example, the direction of a √ó b in 7-dimensions may be the same as c √ó d even though c and d are linearly independent of a and b. Also the seven-dimensional cross product is not compatible with the Jacobi identity. ===Quaternions=== A quaternion p is defined as the sum of a scalar t and a vector v: :p = t + \\\\mathbf v = t + x \\\\ \\\\mathbf i +y \\\\ \\\\mathbf j + z\\\\ \\\\mathbf k. The product of two quaternions and is defined by :pq = (st - \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{w}) + s \\\\ \\\\mathbf{v} + t \\\\ \\\\mathbf{w} + \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{w}. The quaternionic conjugate of q is defined by :\\\\overline{q} = t - \\\\mathbf{v}, and the norm squared is :q^2 = q\\\\overline{q} = t^2 \\\\ + \\\\ x ^2 + \\\\ y^2 \\\\ +\\\\ z^2. The multiplicativity of the norm in the quaternion algebra provides, for quaternions p and q: :pq = p q. The quaternions p and q are called imaginary if their scalar part is zero; equivalently, if :p = \\\\mathbf{v},\\\\quad q=\\\\mathbf{w}. Lagrange's identity is just the multiplicativity of the norm of imaginary quaternions, :\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\mathbf{w}^2 = \\\\mathbf{v}^2\\\\mathbf{w}^2, since, by definition, : \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\mathbf{w}^2 = (\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{w})^2 + \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{w}^2. == Proof of algebraic form == The vector form follows from the Binet-Cauchy identity by setting ci = ai and di = bi. The second version follows by letting ci and di denote the complex conjugates of ai and bi, respectively, Here is also a direct proof. See, for example, Frank Jones, Rice University, page 4 in Chapter 7 of a book still to be published. The expansion of the first term on the left side is: :() \\\\left( \\\\sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2\\\\right) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\sum_{j=1}^n a_i^2 b_j^2 = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 b_k^2 \\\\+ \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^n a_i^2 b_j^2 \\\\+ \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{i=j+1}^n a_i^2 b_j^2 \\\\ , which means that the product of a column of as and a row of bs yields (a sum of elements of) a square of abs, which can be broken up into a diagonal and a pair of triangles on either side of the diagonal. The second term on the left side of Lagrange's identity can be expanded as: :() \\\\left(\\\\sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k\\\\right)^2 = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 b_k^2 + 2\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^n a_i b_i a_j b_j \\\\ , which means that a symmetric square can be broken up into its diagonal and a pair of equal triangles on either side of the diagonal. To expand the summation on the right side of Lagrange's identity, first expand the square within the summation: : \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^n (a_i b_j - a_j b_i)^2 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^n (a_i^2 b_j^2 + a_j^2 b_i^2 - 2 a_i b_j a_j b_i). Distribute the summation on the right side, : \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^n (a_i b_j - a_j b_i)^2 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^n a_i^2 b_j^2 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^n a_j^2 b_i^2 - 2 \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^n a_i b_j a_j b_i . Now exchange the indices i and j of the second term on the right side, and permute the b factors of the third term, yielding: :() \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^n (a_i b_j - a_j b_i)^2 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^n a_i^2 b_j^2 + \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{i=j+1}^n a_i^2 b_j^2 - 2 \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^n a_i b_i a_j b_j \\\\ . Back to the left side of Lagrange's identity: it has two terms, given in expanded form by Equations (') and ('). The first term on the right side of Equation (') ends up canceling out the first term on the right side of Equation ('), yielding :(') - (') = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^n a_i^2 b_j^2 \\\\+ \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{i=j+1}^n a_i^2 b_j^2 - 2\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^n a_i b_i a_j b_j which is the same as Equation (')', so Lagrange's identity is indeed an identity, Q.E.D.. == Proof of Lagrange's identity for complex numbers == Normed division algebras require that the norm of the product is equal to the product of the norms. Lagrange's identity exhibits this equality. The product identity used as a starting point here, is a consequence of the norm of the product equality with the product of the norm for scator algebras. This proposal, originally presented in the context of a deformed Lorentz metric, is based on a transformation stemming from the product operation and magnitude definition in hyperbolic scator algebra.M. Fern√°ndez-Guasti, Alternative realization for the composition of relativistic velocities, Optics and Photonics 2011, vol. 8121 of The nature of light: What are photons? IV, pp. 812108‚Äì1‚Äì11. SPIE, 2011. Lagrange's identity can be proved in a variety of ways. Most derivations use the identity as a starting point and prove in one way or another that the equality is true. In the present approach, Lagrange's identity is actually derived without assuming it a priori. Let a_{i},b_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C} be complex numbers and the overbar represents complex conjugate. The product identity \\\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\\\left(1-a_{i}\\\\bar{a}_{i}-b_{i}\\\\bar{b}_{i}+a_{i}\\\\bar{a}_{i}b_{i}\\\\bar{b}_{i}\\\\right)=\\\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\\\left(1-a_{i}\\\\bar{a}_{i}\\\\right)\\\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\\\left(1-b_{i}\\\\bar{b}_{i}\\\\right) reduces to the complex Lagrange's identity when fourth order terms, in a series expansion, are considered. In order to prove it, expand the product on the LHS of the product identity in terms of series up to fourth order. To this end, recall that products of the form \\\\left(1+x_{i}\\\\right) can be expanded in terms of sums as \\\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\\\left(1+x_{i}\\\\right)=1+\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}+\\\\sum_{i where \\\\mathcal{O}^{3+}(x) means terms with order three or higher in x. \\\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\\\left(1-a_{i}\\\\bar{a}_{i}-b_{i}\\\\bar{b}_{i}+a_{i}\\\\bar{a}_{i}b_{i}\\\\bar{b}_{i}\\\\right)=1-\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\left(a_{i}\\\\bar{a}_{i}+b_{i}\\\\bar{b}_{i}\\\\right)+\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}\\\\bar{a}_{i}b_{i}\\\\bar{b}_{i} +\\\\sum_{i The two factors on the RHS are also written in terms of series \\\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\\\left(1-a_{i}\\\\bar{a}_{i}\\\\right)\\\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\\\left(1-b_{i}\\\\bar{b}_{i}\\\\right)=\\\\left(1-\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}\\\\bar{a}_{i}+\\\\sum_{i The product of this expression up to fourth order is \\\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\\\left(1-a_{i}\\\\bar{a}_{i}\\\\right)\\\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\\\left(1-b_{i}\\\\bar{b}_{i}\\\\right)=1-\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\left(a_{i}\\\\bar{a}_{i}+b_{i}\\\\bar{b}_{i}\\\\right) +\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}\\\\bar{a}_{i}\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_{i}\\\\bar{b}_{i}\\\\right)+\\\\sum_{i Substitution of these two results in the product identity give \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}\\\\bar{a}_{i}b_{i}\\\\bar{b}_{i}+\\\\sum_{i The product of two conjugates series can be expressed as series involving the product of conjugate terms. The conjugate series product is \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\bar{x}_{i}\\\\right)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\\\\bar{x}_{i}+\\\\sum_{i, thus \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}b_{i}\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\overline{a_{i}b_{i}}\\\\right)-\\\\sum_{i The terms of the last two series on the LHS are grouped as a_{i}\\\\bar{a}_{i}b_{j}\\\\bar{b}_{j}+a_{j}\\\\bar{a}_{j}b_{i}\\\\bar{b}_{i}-a_{i}b_{i}\\\\bar{a}_{j}\\\\bar{b}_{j}-\\\\bar{a}_{i}\\\\bar{b}_{i}a_{j}b_{j}=\\\\left(a_{i}\\\\bar{b}_{j}-a_{j}\\\\bar{b}_{i}\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\bar{a}_{i}b_{j}-\\\\bar{a}_{j}b_{i}\\\\right), in order to obtain the complex Lagrange's identity: \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}b_{i}\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\overline{a_{i}b_{i}}\\\\right)+\\\\sum_{i In terms of the moduli, \\\\left\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}b_{i}\\\\right^{2}+\\\\sum_{i Lagrange's identity for complex numbers has been obtained from a straightforward product identity. A derivation for the reals is obviously even more succinct.

Built in 1796 by General David Bradford, it is touted as \\"one of America's most haunted homes.\\" There are a variety of legends surrounding the Myrtles. The house is reputedly built over an Indian burial ground, and the ghost of a young Native American woman has been reported. \\\\- Myrtles Plantation Bed and Breakfast Haunted House. ==House and grounds== ===Architecture=== Sited on a hill, the eastward-facing frame house, which features a clapboard exterior, is built in the Creole cottage style that characterized many Louisiana plantation houses in the 19th century. The original house was built in 1796 and featured six bays and three dormers on the roof. In the mid-1850s, the one-and-a-half-story house was extended south, almost doubling its size, and increased to nine bays including a new double door entrance. The entry doors are surrounded with a transom and sidelights, showcasing original hand-painted stained glass, etched and patterned after the French cross to allegedly ward off evil. The main feature of the Myrtles is the 125-foot-long veranda that extends the entire length of the fa√ßade, and wraps around the southern end of the house. The ornamental cast-iron railing, with an elaborate grape-cluster design, supports a broad Doric entablature, and on the gabled roof, with six brick chimneys, are two large double-paned, pedimented dormers with Doric style pilasters, interspersed with three single-paned dormers. When the original roof of the house was extended to encompass the new addition, the existing dormers were copied to maintain a smooth line. The west facing rear fa√ßade features a central, open loggia that is enclosed on three sides by the house, and on the roof are five pedimented dormers identical to the front. ===Interior=== The Myrtles has 22 rooms spread over two floors. The spacious entry hall runs the length of the house and features faux-bois, open pierced friezework molding, a French Baccarat crystal chandelier weighing more than 300 pounds and a cantilevered staircase. The flooring and most of the windows in the house are original. To the left of the hall is the music room that is adjacent to the only bedroom found on the first floor. The principal rooms of the house are found to the right of the hall. The walls of the original house were removed and repositioned to create four large rooms that were used as identical ladies and gentlemen's parlors, a formal dining room and a game room. The two parlors feature Carrara marble mantles in the Rococo Revival-style on the north and south walls, and are crowned with elaborate plaster cornices and ceiling medallions, made from a mixture of clay, Spanish moss and cattle hair, with no two being the same. The second floor features five bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms. The largest bedroom, known as the Judge Clarke Woodruff Suite, is the only room that is accessed by the main staircase in the entry hall. The remaining four bedrooms, that are separated by a common sitting room, are accessed by a staircase that ascends from the rear loggia. The floor of these bedrooms were raised one foot when the house was renovated, as the addition had higher ceilings than the original house. ===Grounds=== The current plantation landscape is centered on a large pond that features a small island centered with a gazebo accessed by a bridge. To the rear of the main house is the oldest structure on the grounds. Now known as the General's Store, this was where General Bradford lived while the main house was being built. Currently it is used as the gift shop, laundry facilities, plantation offices and guest breakfast spot. To the south is another structure that houses a restaurant. The two ancillary buildings are connected to the main house by a old brick courtyard. Scattered elsewhere on the grounds are modern wooden cottages available to guests. ==History== ===19th century=== The Myrtles Plantation was built in 1796 by General David Bradford on and was named \\"Laurel Grove.\\" Bradford lived there alone for several years, until President John Adams pardoned him for his role in the Pennsylvania Whiskey Rebellion in 1799. He then moved his wife Elizabeth and their five children to the plantation from Pennsylvania. \\\\- National Park Service \\"Explore the History and Culture of Southeastern Louisiana\\" Upon Bradford's death in 1808, his widow Elizabeth continued running the plantation until 1817, when she handed the management to Clarke Woodruff, one of Bradford's former law students, who had married her daughter, Sara Mathilda. The Woodruffs had three children: Africa Gale, James, and Mary Octavia, before Sara Mathilda and two of her three children died in 1823 and 1824 of yellow fever. \\\\- America's Most Haunted: Myrtles Plantation \\\\- \\"Haunted Plantation - Myrtles Plantation Bed and Breakfast, St. Francisville, Louisiana\\" by Joe Nickell, Skeptical Inquirer, Septempter-October 2003, retrieved July 18, 2006 When Elizabeth Bradford died in 1831, Clarke Woodruff and his surviving daughter Mary Octavia moved to Covington, Louisiana, and left a caretaker to manage the plantation. In 1834, Woodruff sold the plantation, the land, and its slaves to Ruffin Gray Stirling. Stirling and his wife, Mary Catherine Cobb, undertook an extensive remodeling of the house, nearly doubling the size of the former building, and filling the house with imported furniture from Europe. It was during this time that the name was changed to \\"The Myrtles\\" after the crepe myrtles that grew in the vicinity. Stirling died in 1854 and left the plantation to his wife. The Myrtles survived the American Civil War, though robbed of its fine furnishings and expensive accessories. In 1865, Mary Cobb Stirling hired William Drew Winter to help manage the plantation as her lawyer and agent. Winter was married to Stirling's daughter, Sarah, and they went on to have six children, one of whom (Kate Winter) died from typhoid at the age of three. The family fortune was lost in the aftermath of the war due to it being tied up in Confederate currency, and the Winters were forced to sell the plantation in 1868, but were able to buy it back two years later. In 1871, William Winter was killed on the porch of the house, possibly by a man named E.S. Webber. Sarah remained at the Myrtles with her mother and siblings until 1878, when she died. Mary Cobb Stirling died in 1880, and the plantation passed to her son Stephen. The plantation was heavily in debt, however, and Stephen sold it in 1886 to Oran D. Brooks, who in turn sold it in 1889. The plantation changed hands several times until 1891, when it was purchased by Harrison Milton Williams. ===20th century=== thumb In the early part of the 20th-century, the land surrounding the house was divided among the heirs of Harrison Milton Williams. In the 1950s, the house itself was sold to Marjorie Munson, who apparently noticed odd things happening around the Myrtles resulting in numerous ghost stories. The plantation went through several more ownership changes in the 1970s before being bought by James and Frances Kermeen Myers who ran the plantation house as a bed and breakfast. During this time Frances Myers, writing as Frances Kermeen, wrote a book about the Myrtles Plantation, naming it as the most haunted house in America. The current owners, John and Teeta Moss, continue to open the house for tours and overnight guests. ===21st century=== In August 2014, a fire occurred in the historical General's Store, located just 10 feet from the main house, causing substantial damage. The most severe damage was in an extension of the building constructed in 2008 leaving most of the original structure intact and not harming the house at all. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Myrtles Plantation continues to be a popular tourist attraction due to its association with paranormal activity, and has been featured in many books, magazines, newspapers and television shows. ==Legends and ghost stories== Alleged ghost photo taken at Myrtles Plantation The plantation house is rumored to be on top of an ancient Tunica Indian burial ground. It is currently a bed and breakfast, and offers historical and mystery tours. Touted as \\"one of America's most haunted homes\\", the plantation is supposedly the home of at least 12 ghosts.Myrtles Plantation Bed and Breakfast Haunted House It is often reported that 10 murders occurred in the house, but historical records only indicate the murder of William Winter. William Drew Winter is also a very popular character in the plantation. He was an attorney who lived in the plantation from 1865 until 1871. He was shot by a stranger. After being shot, he staggered inside the house and died trying to climb the stairs. He died on the 17th step of the stairs. To the present day, visitors, as well as employees in the hotel, still hear his dying footsteps.Ghosts of Myrtles Plantation HauntedRooms.com In 2002, Unsolved Mysteries filmed a segment about the alleged hauntings at the plantation. According to host Robert Stack, the production crew experienced technical difficulties during the production of the segment. The Myrtles was also featured on a 2005 episode of Ghost Hunters. The TV series Ghost Adventures also filmed an episode there. The television series Most Terrifying Places in America profiled the plantation. ==References== ==External links== *Official Website - *Official Unexplained Apparitions Research Society website *Unexplained Paranormal Investigative Team's Myrtles Plantation Field Reports Category:Plantation houses in Louisiana Category:Historic house museums in Louisiana Category:Museums in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Louisiana Category:Reportedly haunted locations in Louisiana Category:Bed and breakfasts in the United States Category:Houses completed in 1796 Category:Neoclassical architecture in Louisiana Category:Antebellum architecture Category:Houses in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana Category:National Register of Historic Places in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana ","title":"Myrtles Plantation"},{"id":"2557600","text":"David Isberg (born 23 February 1975) is a Swedish musician, most famous for having founded seminal Swedish progressive death metal band Opeth. David Isberg is also known as DJ Dake, having a successful DJ career with independent and electronic music, often influenced by the Madchester & obscure 70srock and psychedelic music. He also DJs old school heavy, thrash, speed and death metal. ==Before Opeth== Starting early with a band he called Satanic Slaughter, which he renamed as soon as he heard about another band from Sweden with the same name and demos out to Casket. Casket played two live shows. David appeared in the grindcore band Dr. Deaths Armageddon playing a few shows and releasing 1 live cassette and one rehearsal demo. David was in the Swedish death/black metal band Procreation (1989‚Äì1991). In Procreation, he used the alias of The Unholy Emperor. Alongside David was Christofer Johnsson, the man most known for being the frontman of the band Therion, using the name Necro. Procreation made two demo tapes (\\"Enter the Land of the Dark Forgotten Souls of Eternity\\" 1991 and \\"Procreation of the Antichrist\\" 1990, along with two live shows (both at Hunddagis, Handen 1 held in 1989 or 1990 (the year is not confirmed) and the second show being held on 23 February 1991 (to celebrate David's 16th birthday) with various Therion members filling in on the empty slots. ==Opeth== David formed Opeth with some friends from T√§by in the Spring of 1990. Long-time friend Mikael √Ökerfeldt was in a band called Eruption, but was considering a departure from this group. David invited him to play bass for Opeth and √Ökerfeldt accepted the offer. When he came to the rehearsal, however, none of the other members of the band knew Mikael was coming and they did not want to kick out the bass player they already had. The ensuing argument played out with all the members of Opeth (aside from David) leaving. They renamed themselves Crowley and released a demo tape called \\"The Gate\\" in 1991. David remained with Opeth until 1992 when he left citing creative differences. His duties as a lead singer were taken up by √Ökerfeldt. ==After Opeth== David Isberg continued his musical career with electronic project Grooveza (later Grooveza/Fuzz), death metal band Mynjun, and later to be found in experimental death metal band David Isberg & The Stockholm War Ensemble as well as Stockholm Death Metal band Tutorial together with Adam Skogvards of Mynjun. David was also active in extreme blues maniacs Dubplate Connection, which released their debut album Plays and Sings the Blues in 2009. They performed shows in Sweden and the U.S.A. to support the album. The other three members of Dubplate Connection are M√•rten Tiljander, Linus Dielemans, and the mysterious Southside Slim. David left the band ahead of the North American tour and once again started to play with his old colleagues from Mynjun under the monicker of Tutorial & later somn. By 2009, David was active in at least two extreme metal bands Braathum (named after an ancient mansion in David's possession) and the restarted version of Mynjun named Tutorial and later somn. There are also rumors that he is about to finish lyrical works that for around seven to eight years he has been working on writing. (book released July 2017). In the year 2009, David graduated as a professional Sommelier at Vink√§llan Wine School in Stockholm. Since 2015 he has worked with wine imports and presents lectures and tastings professionally. In the summer of 2018 he was hired as a resident taste-leader at a local craft brewery named Fj√§derholmarnas Bryggeri. He used to run a podcast with metal musicians, being beer geeks and other interesting persons named \\"The Death Metal Sommelier & the nerds of the beast\\" and performs his special spoken word performances \\"death metal poetry\\" reading from his debut book \\"Ornament of the Ominous Demoniac - the coagulated blood of David\\" released in 325 copies in July 2017 and his up and coming works as well as work in the Swedish wine industry and occasionally still deejays at mostly metal shows and bars like the Stockholm Extreme Metal Club Fredagsmangel. He also runs his blog site, http://thunderdoomsociety.com ==bloodofjupiter== Since 2011 David renamed his band bloodofjupiterurl=http://bloodofjupiter.com after his interest in astronomy and wine (the name refers to Tuscan grape Sangiovese in an astrophysical occult way of spelling putting the three words into one). The band released various rehearsal demos and a live recording (also to be released on cassette in 2019)on the internet. At Halloween 2020 the band will release their debut album \\"Eternal Damnation\\" recorded at Studio Humbucker in February and April 2020. The album features seven songs approx 56 minutes and is mixed and mastered by Robert Pehrsson. The band is listed to play festivals such as the reputable Eindhoven Metal Meeting on December 10th, 2020 at Effenaar in Eindhoven, The Netherlands, and J√§rf√§lla Metal Fest outside of Stockholm May the 29th 2021. ==References== Category:Swedish heavy metal bass guitarists Category:Opeth members Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century bass guitarists ","title":"David Isberg"},{"id":"2557613","text":"The Cornell Daily Sun is an independent daily newspaper published in Ithaca, New York by students at Cornell University and hired employees. The Sun features coverage of the university and its environs as well as stories from the Associated Press and UWIRE. It prints on weekdays when the university is open for academic instruction as a tabloid-sized daily. In addition to these regular issues, The Sun publishes a graduation issue and a freshman issue, which is mailed to incoming Cornell freshmen before their first semester. The paper is free on campus and online. Aside from a few full-time production and business positions, The Sun is staffed by Cornell students and is fully independent of the university. It operates out of its own building in downtown Ithaca. The Sun is currently the number one college newspaper in the United States, according to The Princeton Review. ==History== Building of The Sun in Ithaca, New York The Cornell Sun was founded in 1880 by William Ballard Hoyt to challenge Cornell's original and leading publication, the weekly Cornell Era (founded 1868). The Sun boasted in its opening paragraph: \\"We have no indulgence to ask, no favors to beg.\\" The paper incorporated and changed to daily frequency, earning its longstanding boast \\"Ithaca's Only Morning Newspaper.\\" In 1912 it added a second, \\"first collegiate member of the Associated Press.\\" Throughout its history, the publication has faced competition from The Cornell Review and the Ithaca Journal in the market for Cornell news and analysis. Common features include \\"Cornell's 161 Faces,\\" which highlights a diverse group of Cornell students and a Sex Column that appears every Thursday. Following the shift of its main competitor, the Ithaca Journal, from evening to morning daily publication in 1996, The Sun changed its traditional front page slogan which, after several iterations, now states \\"Independent Since 1880.\\" This period also marked a shift in The Suns content from national to local and university-related stories. In January 2003, the Cornell Daily Sun Alumni Association purchased the former Elks Lodge in downtown Ithaca, erected 1916. Led by Stanley Chess, the founding president of the Association, John Schroeder '74, and Gary L. Rubin '72, the alumni completely renovated the building over the next several months. Now called the Cornell Daily Sun Building, it has housed the paper's offices since June 2003 and is coincidentally located next door to the Ithaca Journals offices. In the fall semester of 2004, The Sun turned free and started featuring full-color front and back pages as part of a redesign in its layout. These moves were partially effected to boost circulation in response to Cornell's Student Assembly's decision to provide The New York Times and USA Today on campus for free to all undergraduate Cornell students. On September 17, 2005, more than 370 Sun alumni and guests gathered in Manhattan to celebrate The Sun's 125th anniversary. Speakers included Kurt Vonnegut '43, Carl Leubsdorf '59, Sam Roberts '68, Jay Branegan '73, S. Miller Harris '44, and Jeremy Schaap '91. The emcee was Stan Chess '69. A 130th anniversary dinner was held on September 25, 2010. ==Alumni== The Cornell Daily Sun Alumni Association, comprising former editors, managers and staff of the Cornell Daily Sun, exists to further journalism by Cornell University students.

MS-DOS and Commodore 64 versions were created by Sculptured Software. ==History== After the success of Crawford's game Balance of Power EA wanted to work with him, but could not acquire the rights to sequel the game from its publisher, Mindscape. Instead, they suggested he build on the tradition of his seminal Atari title Eastern Front. Rather than create a derivative game on the Western Front, Crawford elected to focus the game's design on fog of war and the personalities of American general George Patton and the German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. In real life the two were never involved together in a major confrontation, as Rommel was wounded in 1944 and later forced to commit suicide (due to his association with the anti-Hitler conspirators of the July 20 plot), before Patton had command in large-scale land operations. The game's AI, however, worked to be true to the strategies of each of the two generals. Patton vs. Rommel is set in and around the Normandy beachhead shortly after the D-Day invasion of June, 1944. American, Canadian and British forces are placed in the correct positions as the Allied advance started to bog down. The German forces of Rommel are likewise in place defending Caen and other cities. To win the game, the Allied player must advance farther and faster than the real-life Allied forces. For the Rommel-side player to win, he or she must defend more territory longer than the actual German defenders. If the German side can effectively counter and stall the Allied attacks and prevent a breakthrough, the Rommel player will usually win. This creates a dynamic where the Patton player must look for a way to create a hole in the German lines wide enough to push one or more armored divisions through into the German rear area. Since almost all of the German forces are concentrated at the front, the principle of fog of war means that units that are not within sight of enemy units \\"disappear\\" from the game map - and from the thinking of the enemy. When they suddenly reappear in a surprise attack from the rear they have an overwhelming advantage over the units they are attacking. In this way an Allied player can roll up a major element of the German line and achieve a victory. In real history the Allies eventually broke through and surrounded several German panzer and infantry divisions, which were decimated as they attempted to escape through the Falaise Gap. In the game this decisive victory requires practice and skill by the Allied player. ==Reception== Computer Gaming World described the game as \\"very playable\\", admiring its in-game advisors and simple movement scheme, even allowing units to queue actions that are remembered turn-to-turn. A 1991 survey of strategy and war games, however, gave it two and a half stars out of five, and a 1993 survey of wargames gave the game two stars. Crawford himself did not believe that the game would be popular, describing it in a 1987 interview as \\"not a great game. It is a good game, it is fun, but I don't feel it has greatness in its bowels ... Balance of Power I did for me [while] Patton Vs. Rommel is a game for the public\\". The game was very well received by war game enthusiasts but never became popular in a wider marketplace. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1986 video games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Mac OS games Category:DOS games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:World War II video games Category:Chris Crawford (game designer) games ","title":"Patton Versus Rommel"},{"id":"2557627","text":"Curved space often refers to a spatial geometry which is not \\"flat\\", where a flat space is described by Euclidean geometry. Curved spaces can generally be described by Riemannian geometry though some simple cases can be described in other ways. Curved spaces play an essential role in general relativity, where gravity is often visualized as curved space. The Friedmann-Lema√Ætre-Robertson- Walker metric is a curved metric which forms the current foundation for the description of the expansion of space and shape of the universe. ==Simple two- dimensional example== A very familiar example of a curved space is the surface of a sphere. While to our familiar outlook the sphere looks three-dimensional, if an object is constrained to lie on the surface, it only has two dimensions that it can move in. The surface of a sphere can be completely described by two dimensions since no matter how rough the surface may appear to be, it is still only a surface, which is the two-dimensional outside border of a volume. Even the surface of the Earth, which is fractal in complexity, is still only a two-dimensional boundary along the outside of a volume. ==Embedding== In a flat space, the sum of the squares of the side of a right-angled triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. This relationship does not hold for curved spaces. One of the defining characteristics of a curved space is its departure with the Pythagorean theorem. In a curved space :dx^2 + dy^2 eq dl^2. The Pythagorean relationship can often be restored by describing the space with an extra dimension. Suppose we have a non-euclidean three- dimensional space with coordinates \\\\left(x',y',z'\\\\right). Because it is not flat :dx'^2 + dy'^2 + dz'^2 e dl'^2 \\\\,. But if we now describe the three- dimensional space with four dimensions (x,y,z,w) we can choose coordinates such that :dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 + dw^2 = dl^2 \\\\,. Note that the coordinate x is not the same as the coordinate x'. For the choice of the 4D coordinates to be valid descriptors of the original 3D space it must have the same number of degrees of freedom. Since four coordinates have four degrees of freedom it must have a constraint placed on it. We can choose a constraint such that Pythagorean theorem holds in the new 4D space. That is :x^2 + y^2 + z^2 +w^2 = \\\\textrm{constant} \\\\,. The constant can be positive or negative. For convenience we can choose the constant to be :\\\\kappa^{-1}R^2 where R^2 \\\\, now is positive and \\\\kappa \\\\equiv \\\\plusmn 1. We can now use this constraint to eliminate the artificial fourth coordinate w. The differential of the constraining equation is :xdx + ydy + zdz + wdw = 0 \\\\, leading to dw = -w^{-1}(xdx + ydy +zdz) \\\\,. Plugging dw into the original equation gives :dl^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 + \\\\frac{(xdx+ydy+zdz)^2}{\\\\kappa^{-1}R^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2}. This form is usually not particularly appealing and so a coordinate transform is often applied: x = r\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\cos\\\\phi, y = r\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\sin\\\\phi, z = r\\\\cos\\\\theta. With this coordinate transformation :dl^2 = \\\\frac{dr^2}{1-\\\\kappa\\\\frac{r^2}{R^2}} + r^2d\\\\theta^2 + r^2\\\\sin^2\\\\theta d\\\\phi^2. ==Without embedding== The geometry of a n-dimensional space can also be described with Riemannian geometry. An isotropic and homogeneous space can be described by the metric: :dl^2 = e^{-\\\\lambda(r)}{dr^2} + r^2d\\\\theta^2 + r^2\\\\sin^2\\\\theta d\\\\phi^2 \\\\,. This reduces to Euclidean space when \\\\lambda = 0. But a space can be said to be \\"flat\\" when the Weyl tensor has all zero components. In three dimensions this condition is met when the Ricci tensor (R_{ab}) is equal to the metric times the Ricci scalar (R, not to be confused with the R of the previous section). That is R_{ab} = g_{ab} R. Calculation of these components from the metric gives that :\\\\lambda = -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ln \\\\left( 1 - k r^2 \\\\right) where k \\\\equiv \\\\frac{R}{2}. This gives the metric: :dl^2 = \\\\frac{dr^2}{1-k{r^2}} + r^2d\\\\theta^2 + r^2\\\\sin^2\\\\theta d\\\\phi^2. where k can be zero, positive, or negative and is not limited to ¬±1. ==Open, flat, closed== An isotropic and homogeneous space can be described by the metric: :dl^2 = \\\\frac{dr^2}{1-\\\\kappa\\\\frac{r^2}{R^2}} + r^2d\\\\theta^2 + r^2\\\\sin^2\\\\theta d\\\\phi^2. In the limit that the constant of curvature (R) becomes infinitely large, a flat, Euclidean space is returned. It is essentially the same as setting \\\\kappa to zero. If \\\\kappa is not zero the space is not Euclidean. When \\\\kappa = +1 the space is said to be closed or elliptic. When \\\\kappa = -1 the space is said to be open or hyperbolic. Triangles which lie on the surface of an open space will have a sum of angles which is less than 180¬∞. Triangles which lie on the surface of a closed space will have a sum of angles which is greater than 180¬∞. The volume, however, is not (4/3)\\\\pi r^3. ==See also== * CAT(k) space * Non-positive curvature ==Further reading== * == External links == * Curved Spaces, simulator for multiconnected universes developed by Jeffrey Weeks Category:Riemannian geometry Category:Physical cosmology Category:Differential geometry Category:General relativity ","title":"Curved space"},{"id":"2557630","text":"Conservatism in Canada is generally considered to be primarily represented by the modern-day Conservative Party of Canada in federal party politics, and by various centre-right and right-wing parties at the provincial level. The first party calling itself \\"Conservative\\" in what would become Canada was elected in the Province of Canada election of 1854. Far-right politics have never been a prominent force in Canadian society. Canadian conservative ideology is rooted in British \\"Tory-ism\\", rather than American liberalism. Stemming from the resettlement of United Empire Loyalists after the American Revolutionary War with traditionalist conservative views alongside pro-market liberalism ideals, is the reason that Canadian conservatives generally prefer the Westminster system of government. Originally, Canadian conservatism tended to be traditionalist. Conservative governments in Canada, such as those of Sir John A. Macdonald, Sir Robert Borden, R. B. Bennett, and John Diefenbaker, were known for supporting an active role for government in the economy of the creation of government-operated businesses (early Crown Corporations such as the Canadian National Railway) to develop and protect Canadian industries, protectionist programs such as the National Policy. Canadian conservatism thus mirrored British Conservatism in its values and economic and political outlooks. Canadian conservatives have generally favored the continuation of old political institutions and strong ties to the monarchy. In the latter half of the 20th-century, Canadian conservatism embraced neoliberal economic policies including free trade, seeking balanced budgets, and support of privatizations of Crown Corporations claimed to be better provided by the private sector. In this time division arose between the conservatives in Eastern and Western Canada as Western conservatives perceived Canada's federal parliament as being dominated by Eastern interests. This schism led to the creation of the Reform Party of Canada as a Western-based populist protest party promoting constitutional reform to balance the regions' interests and sought to expand into the East‚Äîespecially in Ontario‚Äîto displace the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. While the PCs and Reform had some similar economic policies, Reformers wanted deeper cuts to government services than the PCs and Reformers had strong social conservative stances whereas the PCs were more neutral on controversial social issues. The PCs faced an unprecedented collapse in the 1993 federal election and Reform surpassed the PCs as the largest conservative party in Canada's parliament. After several elections of neither party making significant gains, the two parties agreed to merge into the new Conservative Party of Canada in 2003. ==Schools== ===Blue tory=== Blue Tories are, in Canadian politics, Conservatives who are more free-market or liberal economically. Prior to the 1960s, these Conservatives were most identified with the Montreal and Toronto commercial elite who took positions of influence within the Progressive Conservative Party. Since the mid-1970s, they have been heavily influenced by the libertarian movement and the more individualist nature of American conservatism. Blue Tories tend to favour libertarian policies such as devolution of federal power to the provincial governments, a reduced role for government in the economy, reduction of taxation and similar mainstream market liberal ideals. The term Blue Tory does not refer to social conservatism. One example of a Blue Tory administration in Canada was the \\"Common Sense Revolution\\" provincial Progressive Conservative government of Ontario Premier Mike Harris. The Harris Tories were widely viewed as radical by Canadian standards in their economic policies and style of governance. Harris' government embarked on a number of initiatives, including cuts to education, welfare and Medicare, privatization of government services and health care, the sale of provincial highways and the forced amalgamation of municipalities. Provincial income taxes were also cut by 30% and corporate tax rates were nearly cut in half during the Harris mandate. Most Blue Tories are at least somewhat ideologically aligned close to the economic libertarian positions of the former Canadian Alliance and as such supported the merger between the PCs and the Alliance to form the new federal Conservative Party of Canada (CPC). Some notable Blue Tories include many prominent federal and provincial Progressive Conservatives such as former PC Party Leader and Attorney General Peter MacKay, Conservative Party leadership contender and former Treasury Board President Tony Clement, former Premier of Ontario Mike Harris, and former CPC leader Andrew Scheer. ===Red tory=== A Red Tory is an adherent of a centre-right or paternalistic-conservative political philosophy derived from the Tory tradition, predominantly in Canada, but also in the United Kingdom. This philosophy tends to favour communitarian social policies, while maintaining a degree of fiscal discipline and a respect of social and political order. It is contrasted with \\"Blue Tory\\" or \\"High Tory\\". Some Red Tories view themselves as small-c conservatives. In Canada, Red Toryism is found in provincial and federal Conservative political parties. The history of Red Toryism marks differences in the development of the political cultures of Canada and the United States. Canadian conservatism and American conservatism have been different from each other in fundamental ways, including their stances on social issues and the role of government in society.\\"Conservatism\\", The Canadian Encyclopedia The adjective \\"red\\" refers to the economically left-leaning nature of Red Toryism in comparison with Blue Toryism, since socialist and other leftist parties have traditionally used the colour red. In Canada today, however, red is commonly associated with the centrist Liberal Party. The term reflects the broad ideological range traditionally found within conservatism in Canada. Historically, Canadian conservatism has been derived from the Tory tradition, with a distinctive concern for a balance between individual rights and collectivism, as mediated through a traditional pre-industrial standard of morality ‚Äì which has never been as evident in American conservatism. Red Toryism derives largely from a classical conservative tradition that maintained that the unequal division of wealth and political privilege among social classes can be justified if members of the privileged class practiced noblesse oblige and contributed to the common good. Red Tories supported traditional institutions such as religion and the monarchy, and maintenance of the social order. This position was later manifest in their support for some aspects of the welfare state. This belief in a common good, as expanded on in Colin Campbell and William Christian's Political Parties and Ideologies in Canada, is at the root of Red Toryism. ===Libertarianism=== Libertarianism as a political philosophy is not considered to be a primary force in Canadian conservatism. This philosophy is represented mainly by the Libertarian Party of Canada, People's Party of Canada, and other small provincial parties. These parties have never been successful in having members elected. ===Social conservatism=== While social conservatism exists throughout Canada it is not as pronounced as it is in some other countries, such as the United States. It represents conservative positions on issues of culture, family, sexuality and morality. Despite the recent Conservative government having influential members who would be defined as social conservatives in its caucus, social conservatism is considered to have little influence on Canadian society and political policy. ==History== The conservative movement in Canada evolved from relatively informal pre- Confederation political movements or parties, gradually coalescing into the Conservative Party of Canada. This party was the dominant political force in Canadian politics from 1867 to 1935. Thereafter, the party (renamed the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in 1945) spent more time in opposition than in government. During the twentieth century rival \\"small-c conservative\\" movements appeared, most notably the federal Social Credit and Reform parties. Conservatism was divided (especially by region) until the merger of the Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance (the direct successor to the Reform Party) in 2003. ===Pre-Confederation=== In the early days of electoral politics in Canada, the term conservatives or Tories applied to those people who supported the authority of colonial governors and their advisers over the elected assemblies. These conservatives took their cues from British Tories, especially Burke. They supported royal privilege, and were avowedly anti-democratic. Tory supporters were often descended from loyalists who had fled the United States during the American Revolution and War of Independence. They were wary of emulating the US's \\"mob rule\\" and preferred a strong role for traditional elites such as landowners and the church in politics.How Canadian conservatism differs from the American version Online video conference by Conservative senator Hugh Segal: cerium.ca website. Many were Anglicans who supported keeping the Anglican Church of Canada as Canada's established church. In each colony, Tories contested elections as the personal party of the governor. Business elites who surrounded the governor also hoped to gain patronage. In Upper Canada this was the Family Compact, in Lower Canada the Chateau Clique. Opposition to the rule of these oligarchies resulted in the Rebellions of 1837. After the rebellions, Lord Durham (a Whig or liberal) issued his Report on the Affairs of British North America, a report to the British government that recommended that most powers in colonial governments be given from the governor to the elected assemblies. This new arrangement, called responsible government, mirrored earlier changes that had occurred in Britain. ====Responsible government==== After the failure of radical liberalism during the Rebellions of 1837, a new set of moderate liberals, led by Robert Baldwin in Canada West, Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine in Canada East and Joseph Howe in Nova Scotia rose to prominence. They campaigned for and won responsible government by creating broad coalitions that took in liberals, moderates, and conservatives.Stewart, 2007: 25 The only way for conservatives as a party to regroup was to accept the consequences of responsible government. They abandoned the idea of being the governor's party and embraced mass politics. At the same time the coalition that had won responsible government began to break up in the 1850s. This presented an opening for more moderate conservatives such as John A. Macdonald and George- √âtienne Cartier to claim the political centre.Stewart, 2007: 27 Their coalition dominated politics in the United Province of Canada, and when joined by liberal George Brown, provided the broad support necessary to negotiate Confederation with the Maritime Provinces. ===Post-Confederation=== ====Macdonald-Cartier era==== 1878 election The MacDonald-Cartier coalition's prestige was only strengthened by the creation of the new Canadian Confederation in 1867. Their coalition dominated the early politics of the new state. Their \\"National Policy\\" of high tariffs against the United States, and intense railway building, became the basis of a political dynasty that dominated Canadian politics from Confederation until Macdonald's death in office in 1891. The greatest strain in this coalition came during the Riel rebellions of 1869 and 1885, which inflamed French-English and Protestant- Catholic tensions in the country. After Macdonald's death, the coalition faltered. ====Interregnum==== The death of Macdonald left a large power vacuum in the Conservative Party, leading to the short tenure of John Abbott, who was the Protestant compromise choice. Abbott's government collapsed when his cabinet walked out on him, forcing him to resign and allowing for the selection of the first Catholic prime minister of Canada, John Sparrow Thompson. At just 45, he was expected to become the successor to Macdonald's legacy, but after only a year in office he died from a stroke. Two more short- serving Conservatives, Mackenzie Bowell and Charles Tupper, served out the end of the Conservative government, until the election in 1896 when the coalition of French and English Canadians fell apart and Laurier became the second Liberal prime minister of Canada. The Liberals would dominate for the next fourteen years until the emergence of Robert Borden. ===World War and Depression=== Robert Borden and Winston Churchill in 1912 Robert Borden's Conservative government led Canada into the First World War, with the Laurier- led Liberal in opposition. The government wanted to introduce conscription, and sought a coalition to pursue this policy. Most English-speaking Liberals joined the Tories to form a coalition called \\"Unionist\\" with the mostly-French speaking Liberal rump in opposition. After the war this coalition, now led by Arthur Meighen could not govern with a stable majority. In the 1921 election the Conservatives were relegated to third place, at the expense of the new Progressive movement based mostly in the Prairie West (see Western alienation). Once the Progressive movement had largely been subsumed into the Liberal Party of Canada, the Conservatives were once again in opposition, until the election of 1930, under the leadership of R. B. Bennett. But in the 1935 election the Conservatives were handed a major defeat by the Liberals, with a new right-wing party, Social Credit, placing a close third, again on the strength of Western alienation. ====Post-War==== Progressive Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker who served from 1957‚Äì1963. Throughout most of the last century, the Progressive Conservative Party (often abbreviated PC) dominated conservative politics at the federal level and in most provinces. Canada had many conservative Prime Ministers in the past, but the first to be elected under the Progressive Conservative banner was John Diefenbaker, who served from 1957‚Äì1963. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, with the rise of Conservative politicians in Canada such as Ralph Klein, Don Getty, Brian Mulroney, Preston Manning, Mike Harris and others, the objectives and values of Conservatives in Canada began to mimic those of fiscal conservatives in both the US and UK. With the rise in inflation and a large budgetary deficit in Canada from the Trudeau government, emphasis was put on \\"shrinking the size of government\\" (in part, through privatization), pursuing continental trade arrangements (free trade, creating tax incentives and cutting \\"government waste\\"). Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Joe Clark became Prime Minister with a minority government in 1979, but lost to a non- confidence vote after only nine months, and the Liberals again took power. After Pierre Trudeau's retirement in 1984, his successor, John Turner, called a federal election, which was won in a landslide by the PCs under Brian Mulroney. Mulroney succeeded by uniting conservatives from Western Canada with those from Quebec. During his tenure, the government unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate the status of Quebec through the failed Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords. During the government of Brian Mulroney (1984‚Äì1993), government spending on social programs was cut, taxes for individuals and businesses were reduced (but a new national tax appeared for nearly all goods and services), government intervention in the economy was significantly reduced, a free trade agreement was concluded with the United States, and Crown Corporations such as Teleglobe, Petro-Canada and Air Canada (some created by previous Conservative governments) were sold to both domestic and foreign private buyers (privatized). However, due to the failure of the Mulroney government to balance the budget and service debt, the federal debt continued to rise. It was not until the end of Mulroney's administration and the beginning of Jean Chr√©tien's Liberal government that the government's program of spending finally halted the growth in the federal debt. The government's willingness to affirm Quebec's demands for recognition as a distinct society was seen as a betrayal by many westerners as well as angering Canadian Nationalists mostly from Ontario. The Reform Party of Canada was founded on a strongly right-wing populist conservative platform as an alternative voice for these western conservatives. The Progressive Conservative Party lost a large base of its support toward the end of the Mulroney era. Brian Mulroney's failed attempts to reform the Canadian Constitution with the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords, and the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax lost him most of his support. Following Mulroney's resignation in 1993 and Kim Campbell's brief tenure, the Conservatives were reduced to only two seats in Parliament in the 1993 federal election. The Liberal Party was elected with a strong majority and the Reform Party gradually replaced the Tories as the major right-wing party in Canada. The Reform Party under Preston Manning would become the Official Opposition from 1997‚Äì2000. Throughout the 1990s, many social conservatives and Blue Tories in the PC Party began to drift slowly to the Reform Party and then in droves to the Reform Party's direct successor, the Canadian Alliance. This left the PC Party under the control of the moderate Red Tory faction. Despite taking what they believed to be more popular socially progressive approaches on certain issues, the PCs significantly fell in the popular vote from the 1997 to 2000 federal elections and were not able to greatly increase their representation in the House of Commons. The Reform Party and then the Canadian Alliance dominated the opposition benches. Support for both the Reform Party and the Progressive Conservatives was negligible in Quebec until the 2006 federal election, where the renewed Conservative party won 10 seats in Quebec. In the west, the Reform Party took most of the PC Party's former seats, but held much more socially or economically conservative views than the old party on most subjects (regarding, for example, homosexuality, religion in public life, gun control, and government intervention in the economy). The PCs retained moderate support in the Atlantic Provinces, would manage to regain a few seats. They also retained scattered support across the country. The result was that neither new party managed to approach the success of the Progressive Conservatives prior to 1993. In many ridings the conservative vote was split, letting other parties win: the Liberal Party under Jean Chr√©tien won three successive majority governments starting in 1993. During this period, either the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois or the Reform Party were the Official Opposition. After the 1997 federal election some members of the Reform Party tried to end the vote splitting by merging the two parties. A new party was formed, called the Canadian Alliance, and Stockwell Day was elected its leader. However, many PCs resisted the move, suspecting that Reform Party ideology would dominate the new party, and the new party garnered only a little more support than its predecessor. Meanwhile, the PC Party re-elected Joe Clark as their leader and attempted to regain lost ground. Day's tenure was marked by a number of public gaffes and apparent publicity stunts, and he was widely portrayed as incompetent and ignorant. Several MPs left his party in 2002. In 2003, when former Prime Minister Joe Clark retired after being brought back to improve the PC party's standings, Peter MacKay was chosen in a leadership contest to replace him. MacKay immediately created controversy within the party by entering into negotiations with Canadian Alliance leader Stephen Harper to merge the two parties. MacKay had been elected on a third ballot of the party's leadership convention as a result of an agreement that he signed with another leadership contestant, David Orchard, in which he promised never to merge the PC Party with the Alliance. Later on that year, the Progressive Conservative Party, which dated back to 1854 (though existing under many different names), merged with the Canadian Alliance. 96% of the Alliance's membership and 92% of the PC Party's riding representatives approved the merger. The contemporary Conservative Party of Canada was then created, and, in 2004, Stephen Harper was elected leader. Dissident Red Tories opposed to the merger would go on to form the minor Progressive Canadian Party. Under Stephen Harper, the platform of the Conservative Party emphasized the Blue Tory policies of fiscal restraint, increases in military spending, tax cuts and Senate Reform. The Harper-led Conservative Party has, however, come under fire, with many accusing them of adopting neoconservative policies. ===The Harper Conservatives=== ====Foreign policy==== Prime Minister Stephen Harper in 2012 While in Opposition, Stephen Harper voted in favour of Canadian military involvement in the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq he later admitted this had been a mistake. Conservative Party member resolutions express strong support for the state of Israel and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Harper also took aggressive action against perceived sponsors of terrorism such as Iran, closing the Canadian embassy and expelling the Iranian diplomats in 2012. Refugees and deportations of Iraq War resisters In 2012 the Conservative government introduced reforms to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act which limited refugee claims from those on a list of designated countries of origin, those considered safe by Canada for most persons. Other changes allowed for detention of mass arrivals, following the MV Sun Sea incident. These changes cleared an immigration backlog that had persisted for many years under the previous Liberal government, reducing the processing time from over 1000 days to less than 2 months. All 110 Conservative Party MPs voted against an opposition motion concerning conscientious objectors and the introduction of programs to allow objectors to seek refuge in Canada. On 13 September 2008, this refusal to set up a special program was reiterated by a Conservative Party spokeswoman after the first such conscientious objector (Robin Long) had been deported and sentenced to 15 months in jail. (See Canada and Iraq War resisters for details about two motions in Parliament concerning Canada and Iraq War resisters.) China Consistent in all recent Canadian governments is strong ties to China. In 2013, the Conservative administration approved the acquisition of Nexen by a Chinese firm. It also advanced, as of 2013, FIPA agreement, containing guarantees that Chinese buyer would have the legal right to sue Canada in private settlement of inhibition to its activities by that government (including provincial or municipal for whom the federal government would be liable). The actual extent or limit of these powers would not be publicly known and settlements would be private, in effect a \\"confidential lawsuit\\", for instance a future BC or Canadian government reversing a federal approval of the Northern Gateway pipeline. The powers surrendered were so drastic as to be criticized heavily from many quarters, even normally supportive financial press and are the subject of a current lawsuit. In other respects, Conservative MPs have sometimes been sharply critical of China particularly over human rights policies and especially treatment of the Falun Gong. These positions are not materially different than those of other parties. ====Parliamentary democracy==== Prior to winning election, Stephen Harper openly favoured the alternative vote method of selecting both MPs and Senators. As the successor of the Western Canada-based Canadian Alliance (formerly the Reform Party of Canada), the party supported reform of the Senate to make it \\"elected, equal, and effective\\" (the \\"Triple-E Senate\\"). However, party leader Stephen Harper advised the Governor General to appoint the unelected Michael Fortier to both the Senate and to the Cabinet on 6 February 2006, the day his minority government took office. On 22 December 2008 Prime Minister Harper asked the Governor General to fill all eighteen Senate seats that had been vacant at the time. It was earlier reported in The Toronto Star that this action was \\"to kill any chance of a Liberal-NDP coalition government filling the vacancies next year\\". The party introduced a bill in the parliament to have fixed dates for elections and, with the support of the Liberal Party, passed it. However, Ned Franks, a Canadian parliamentary expert, maintains that the Prime Minister still has the right to advise the Governor-General to dissolve the parliament early and drop the writs for an election. Transparency and accountability In 2006, the Conservatives campaigned strongly against Liberal abuses in the Sponsorship scandal and vowed to introduce several accountability measures that would hold even a majority government to account. These included a Parliamentary Budget Office whose first head Kevin Page found himself often sharply at odds with Harper government policy and issued several reports scathing of Conservative practices, even sometimes being described as the \\"sharpest thorn in Harper's side\\". Major media commentators often use Page's reports as a starting point for general criticisms of Harper's budgetary and transparency practices including comedic rants. While other accountability officers have been similarly ignored or critical, the influence and neutrality of the persons who were appointed, and the general public trust of their opinions, seems to be an indication of success on long-term transparency. The office is likely to continue under future administrations and be quite difficult to eliminate or ignore. By contrast, agency discipline and appointments to the Canadian Senate have tended to reflect a more cynical view that parties in power tend to forget transparency and accountability promises made when out of power. ====Domestic issues==== In its founding documents, the Conservative Party avowed principles of lower taxes, smaller government, more decentralization of federal government powers to the provinces, modeled after the Meech Lake Accord, traditional religious and cultural values and has in practice strongly supported Oil Sands and other controversial energy projects. The Party has also both avowed and introduced legislation to reduce some gun controls and some MPs openly favour the death penalty. Abortion The current Conservative government position on abortion is that a debate on abortion legislation will not take place in Parliament. Former party leader Stephen Harper stated that \\"As long as I'm prime minister we are not reopening the abortion debate\\". The appointment of Dr. Henry Morgentaler, an abortion-rights activist, to the prestigious Order of Canada, was deplored by some Conservative MPs. The Conservative government distanced itself from the award. The Conservative government excluded the funding of abortions in Canada's G8 health plan. Harper argued that he wanted to focus on non-divisive policies. This stance was opposed by the Liberals, NDP and international health and women's groups. The Archbishop of Quebec and Primate of Canada, Marc Ouellet, praised this decision, but urged Harper to do more \\"in defence of the unborn\\". In May 2010, 18 Conservative MPs addressed thousands of students at the anti-abortion 13th annual March for Life rally on Parliament Hill. Same-sex marriage Former party leader Stephen Harper has repeatedly stated that his government will not attempt to ban same- sex marriage in Canada. Same-sex marriage was recognized nationwide in Canada in 2005 with the Civil Marriage Act. Harper most recently restated this commitment after news broke that a lawyer with the federal Justice Department was of the opinion that foreign same-sex couples visiting Canada to get married who are from regions where same-sex marriage is illegal were not obligated to get divorced in Canada since their marriage in their home region was never legitimate. Harper corrected the record and restated that his government will not legislate nor attempt to legislate same-sex marriage. However, the Conservative Party of Canada's Policy Declaration states, \\"We support legislation defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman\\". The party had a free vote on whether the House wanted to reopen the issue of same-sex marriage, which was defeated. In March 2011, just ahead of the expected Canadian election, the Conservatives added one line about gay rights to the \\"Discover Canada\\" booklet for new immigrants which they had published in 2009: \\"Canada's diversity includes gay and lesbian Canadians, who enjoy the full protection of an equal treatment under the law, including access to civil marriage\\". The Minister of Citizenship, Immigration, and Multiculturalism, Jason Kenney, had previously removed mention of gay rights from the booklet published in 2009. Crime and law enforcement Before the majority was achieved in 2011, Conservatives promised to re-introduce Internet surveillance legislation that they were not able to pass, bundling it with the rest of their crime bills. They said they plan to fast track the legislation within 100 days after taking office.Canadian bill forces personal data from ISPs sans warrant ‚Äì https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/06/18/canada_isp_intercept_bills/ The Internet surveillance bill was later scrapped by the Conservatives and not put into law. Gun control While the gun rights issue isn't as pronounced by Canadian conservative groups as it is by Americans, it has recently received much attention and politicizing in the recent years. One of the biggest accomplishments of the Conservative Party was the passage of Bill C-19 in 2012, which abolished the long gun registry that was introduced by Liberal prime minister Jean Chr√©tien in 1993. This resulted in the mandatory destruction of records of people owning non-restricted firearms (shotguns and bolt-action rifles), except for the province of Quebec, where the bill is still being challenged and contested. This had been a long-standing goal and premise of the Conservative Party, and a defeat for gun control activists in Canada. In September 2014, Stephen Harper showed opposition to an RCMP ban of the Swiss Arms Classic Green Carbine, assuring to protect owners of the rifle from prosecution. He also stated that he supports the use of firearms for self-defense in rural areas where police protection isn't sufficient, as self- defense isn't considered a valid reason for attaining a firearms license. However, in spite of these pro-gun moves, Stephen Harper stated that he had no intention to promote an American-style vigilantism in Canada. In October 2014, the Public Safety Minister Stephen Blaney proposed Bill C-42, or the Common Sense Firearms Licensing Act which would ease the restrictions on gun owners but implement mandatory training courses for first-time owners. This proposed bill would allow easier transportation of firearms to a shooting range without having to notify a Chief Firearms Officer and ease the licensing process. This would also lift the ban on the Swiss Arms Classic Green Carbine, and allow the prime minister to override decisions made by the RCMP. Harper stated his support of these laws as well as the support for use of guns for self-defense in rural Canada, which drew immense criticisms from supporters of gun control and Liberal politicians. However, Harper rejected these claims, stating that police services are insufficient in rural areas, and that guns were a \\"responsibility\\" in Canada and not a right as in the United States. The bill passed a House of Commons reading. However, the bill has received criticisms from both gun rights and gun control advocates, with each claiming that the bill serves the opposites' agenda. Leaders of opposition parties also criticize the bill as merely a political tool used by the Conservative Party to gain votes. The law took effect on September 2, 2015 and is now law. ==Conservatism in Western Canada== The four Western Canada provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba have long been a hotbed for protest politics and political parties of the left and right. All four provinces have strong rural and Christian constituencies, leading to an active presence of the Christian right. Historically, the heavy presence of agriculture led to the emergence in the past of large left-leaning, agrarian farmer's based protest movements such as the Progressive Party of Canada and the United Farmers of Canada which supported free trade with the United States and increased social benefits. These movements were later absorbed by the Liberal Party of Canada, the Conservative Party of Canada (who became the progressive conservatives) and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). During the Great Depression, two radical protest movements appeared: the CCF in Saskatchewan advocated progressive social policies and reformist democratic socialism; while in Alberta, the Social Credit Party of Alberta formed a provincial government that favoured evangelical Christian conservatism, provincial control over natural resources, limited government intervention in the economy and a radical philosophy known as Social Credit based on providing dividends to the population to support small businesses and free enterprise. Provincial Social Credit parties went on to dominate the government of Alberta from 1934‚Äì1971 and British Columbia from 1951‚Äì1972 and 1975‚Äì1991. However, unlike the CCF, which morphed into the social-democratic New Democratic Party, the Social Credit Party would die out. Their popularity grew in Quebec, leading to Western supporters of Social Credit feeling isolated by the federal party's Quebec nationalism. The provincial Social Credit governments of British Columbia and Alberta would abandon Social Credit economic policies and followed staunchly conservative policies while maintaining ties with the federal Progressive Conservative Party of Canada as opposed to the federal Social Credit Party of Canada. In British Columbia, the BC Social Credit Party was replaced as the party of the centre-right by the British Columbia Liberal Party, and in Alberta the Alberta Social Credit Party were completely annihilated by the more moderate Alberta Progressive Conservative Party, leaving both parties as marginal political forces. In the 1980 federal election, the Social Credit Party of Canada lost all of its remaining seats and was forced to disband in 1989. Most of its Western members moved onto the ideologically similar Reform Party of Canada, founded by Preston Manning, the son of Alberta's former Social Credit premier, Ernest Manning. The Reform Party grew out of the province of Alberta and was fed by dissatisfaction with the federal Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney. Right-wing Westerners felt that Mulroney's liberal economic policies did not go nearly far enough, that his government was overly favourable toward the more populous provinces of Quebec and Ontario, that his policies on social issues such as abortion and the death penalty were too liberal, and that, like the Liberal Party of Canada, the Progressive Conservatives had allegedly come to not take Western Canada demands for provincial economic autonomy seriously enough. Though for most of the 1990s, the Tories enjoyed roughly the same electoral support as the Reform Party due to Canada's first-past-the-post system of elected representatives to the House of Commons, Reform dominated the position of Official Opposition. In 1999, the Reform Party was dissolved and joined by some right-wing members of the PC Party to create the Canadian Alliance, formally known as the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance; however, this new enlarged party was unable to attract any real support east of Manitoba and was dissolved in 2003, merging with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada to create the contemporary Conservative Party of Canada. This party, led by former Canadian Alliance leader Stephen Harper, won a minority government in the 2006 federal election, with 36% of the vote and 124 seats in the House of Commons out of 308. In Alberta, the Progressive Conservative dominated the government from 1971 to 2015, following slightly right-wing policies under premiers Peter Lougheed, Don Getty, Ralph Klein, Ed Stelmach and Alison Redford. Following the election of the Alberta New Democratic Party and Rachel Notley in 2015, efforts began to 'unite the right' with Jason Kenney elected as PC Leader. Kenney oversaw merger negotiations with Wildrose Party leader Brian Jean, culminating in ratification votes in July 2017 as the United Conservative Party, which elected Kenney leader in October 2017. In BC, the British Columbia Liberal Party (BC Liberals) have taken a rightward economic turn under Premier Gordon Campbell in competing with the centre-left British Columbia New Democratic Party to govern the province, filling the gap left by the electoral collapse of the BC Social Credit Party in 1991. In Saskatchewan, the center-right Saskatchewan Party formed its first government in 2007 after many years of Saskatchewan NDP rule. In Manitoba, the Progressive Conservative Party, led by Brian Pallister won a landslide majority government in the 2016 election, defeating incumbent Premier Greg Selinger and the 16-year reigning NDP government. ==Canadian conservative parties== ===Represented in Parliament=== *Conservative Party of Canada ===Not represented in Parliament=== *Progressive Canadian Party *Christian Heritage Party *People's Party of Canada ===Provincial=== *United Conservative Party of Alberta *Freedom Conservative Party of Alberta *British Columbia Liberal Party *British Columbia Conservative Party *Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba *Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick *Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador *Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia *Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario *Progressive Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island *Coalition Avenir Qu√©bec *Conservative Party of Quebec (2009-present) *Saskatchewan Party *Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan *Yukon Party ===Historical=== *Anti-Confederation Party *Canadian Alliance *Conservative Party of Quebec *Social Credit Party of Canada *British Columbia Social Credit Party *Reform Party of British Columbia *British Columbia Unity Party *British Columbia Progressive Conservative Party *Alberta Social Credit Party *Representative Party of Alberta *Alberta Alliance Party *Alberta Party *Alberta First Party *Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta *Wildrose Party *Manitoba Party *Union Nationale *Ralliement cr√©ditiste *Ralliement cr√©ditiste du Qu√©bec *Reform Party of Canada *Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan ===Largest=== *Upper Canada Tories before 1854 in Upper Canada / Canada West *Parti bleu in Lower Canada / Canada East *Liberal - Conservative Party 1854-1873 *Conservative Party of Canada 1873-1917 *Unionist Party of Canada 1917-1920 *National Liberal and Conservative Party 1920-1921 *Conservative Party of Canada 1921-1940 *National Government (Canada) 1940 *Conservative Party of Canada 1940-1942 *Progressive Conservative Party of Canada 1942-1993 *Reform Party of Canada 1993-2000 *Canadian Alliance 2000-2003 *Conservative Party of Canada 2003‚Äìpresent *People's Party of Canada 2018‚Äìpresent ==Conservative prime ministers== *Sir John A.

The service was launched on August 26, 1996. ==Channels and content== Canal Indigo PPV service consists of 11 standard definition channels and two high definition channels. Programming on Canal Indigo includes movies, concerts, sports, and other special events. Adult content is also available through Canal Indigo's Ol√©! T√©l√©vision service. ==History== Logo from 1996 to 2011 Canal Indigo started in 1996 with eight analogue channels using the Videoway system on Videotron. A few months after the launch of Videotron's digital cable, Indigo was running 39 channels, until January 1, 2005 at 8:41 pm when Indigo experienced a technical bug, leaving nine working channels. On June 1, 2005, Canal Indigo came back with 24 channels. On August 1, 2007, due to the growing popularity of Video On Demand, Canal Indigo was reduced to 12 channels. Canal Indigo was the monopoly provider of French-language pay-per-view programming in Canada until late 1999, when Bell ExpressVu (now Bell Satellite TV) launched its bilingual Vu! service, replacing Canal Indigo on that provider. On December 27, 2007 Shaw Broadcast switched all of its PPV feeds to its own proprietary PPV service displacing Canal Indigo from Shaw, Shaw Direct and any other system that receives their PPV feeds via Shaw Broadcast. Viewers Choice Canada Inc., operator of the namesake English-language pay-per-view service, was originally the largest shareholder and managing partner (40%) in Canal Indigo, with Cogeco, Groupe TVA, and TQS Inc. holding minority interests at 20% each. However, on March 20, 2008, Groupe TVA announced it would be purchasing Viewers Choice and the remaining stakeholders interests in the service. The sale was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) on July 18, giving Groupe TVA full ownership of the service.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2008-144 Groupe TVA launched a new 24/7 high-definition channel on November 1, 2008, and removed one SD channel. On December 1, 2009, the CRTC approved a corporate reorganization that would transfer Canal Indigo from Groupe TVA to fellow Quebecor Media division and cable provider Vid√©otron.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2009-738 In July 2014, Videotron indicated to the CRTC that it intended to change Canal Indigo into a bilingual (English / French) service, due to the planned shutdown of English- language provider Viewers Choice at the end of September 2014. Due to new standard conditions of licence for PPV providers being introduced in 2014, CRTC approval is no longer required to convert from a single-language service to a bilingual one. However, since Videotron operates almost exclusively in French-language markets, the company requested an exemption from the standard requirement for bilingual PPV services which would otherwise require it to operate a minimum of 15 English-language channels and 5 French-language channels, plus a separate barker channel in each language. Under Videotron's original proposal, Canal Indigo would offer at least 8 French-language channels and 2 English-language channels, plus a bilingual barker channel. The application was approved on September 30, on condition that Canal Indigo maintain the same ratio but with a minimum of 3 English-language channels (and thus 12 French-language channels). == References == ==External links== * Canal Indigo Category:French-language television networks in Canada Category:Pay- per-view television networks in Canada Category:Television channels and stations established in 1996 ","title":"Canal Indigo"},{"id":"2557644","text":"Bosaso District () is a district in the northeastern Bari region of Somalia.

She carried many names in the 54 years between her construction and her 1994 wreck: SS America (carrying this name three different times during her career); troop transport USS West Point; and SS Australis, Italis, Noga, Alferdoss, and American Star. She served most notably in passenger service as America and the Greek-flagged Australis. She was wrecked as the American Star at Playa de Garcey on Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands on 18 January 1994. The wreck has deteriorated and collapsed into the sea. Only a small section of the bow remains visible during low tide. == Construction (1936‚Äì1939) == America under construction America was laid down under the first Maritime Commission contract on 22 August 1938, at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. She was one of the few ocean liners, American or otherwise, that had her interiors designed by women‚Äîthe New York firm Smyth, Urquhart & Marckwald. The ornate decor from liners of the past was forgone in favor of more contemporary and informal design. The aim was to provide an atmosphere of cheerfulness and sophisticated charm. America was launched on 31 August 1939 and was sponsored by Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of then-President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt. The liner entered service as the flagship of the United States Lines on 10 August 1940, when she commenced her maiden voyage. ==Early career (1939‚Äì1941)== As originally designed, America could carry 543 in cabin class, 418 in tourist class, 241 in third class, and 643 crew. The interior accommodations were designed by architects Eggers & Higgins to be the utmost in contemporary American design, making use of stainless steel, ceramics, and synthetics. America was originally constructed with low funnels to give the ship a modern streamlined appearance. Very early in her career the height of the funnels was subsequently increased by 5 meters due to heavy soot deposits on the decks. This change greatly altered the appearance of the ship. Due to the European progress of World War II, in which the United States was still neutral, the ship's name, along with \\"United States Lines\\" and two American flags were painted in large size on both sides of her hull. At night, she sailed while fully illuminated. In addition, she did not immediately take to her intended North Atlantic service, instead sailing in safer waters. She was, however, quietly fitted with a degaussing cable for protection against naval mines on 3 January 1941. On 28 May 1941, America was called up to service by the United States Navy, while the ship was at Saint Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands. She was ordered to return to Newport News to be handed over to the Navy.America pre war , ss-australis.com ===Duquesne Spy Ring=== Two German spies, Franz Joseph Stigler and Erwin Wilheim Siegler, were members of her crew in 1941. While on the America, they obtained information about the movement of ships and military defense preparations at the Panama Canal, observed and reported defense preparations in the Canal Zone, and met with other German agents to advise them in their espionage efforts. They operated as couriers transmitting information between the United States and German agents aboard. Stigler worked undercover as chief butcher. Both remained on the America until the U.S. Navy converted that ship into a troop transport and commissioned her in the U.S. Navy as the USS West Point. Stigler and Siegler, along with the 31 other German agents of the Duquesne Spy Ring, were later uncovered by the FBI in the largest espionage conviction in U.S. history. Upon conviction, Stigler was sentenced to serve 16 years in prison on espionage charges with two concurrent years for registration violations; Siegler was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment on espionage charges and a concurrent two- year term for violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. ==US Navy service (1941‚Äì1946)== ===1941=== America being converted to USS West Point in Norfolk Ship Yards America was moored at Norfolk, Virginia, and acquired by the Navy on 1 June 1941 to be used as a troop transport. The ship was renamed the USS West Point (AP-23), the second U.S. Navy ship of the name. She entered the Norfolk Ship Yards on 6 June 1941 for conversion and on 15 June 1941, she was commissioned for service under the command of Captain Frank H. Kelley, Jr. By the time the conversion was completed, life-rafts covered the promenade deck windows, \\"standee\\" bunks could be found everywhere, several anti-aircraft weapons were installed, all of her windows were covered, she was painted in a camouflage gray colour, and her troop-carrying capacity was increased to 7,678. The USS West Point soon proceeded to New York City and, while anchored off the Staten Island quarantine station on 16 July, took on board 137 Italian citizens and 327 German citizens from the consulates of those nations in the United States which had been closed. West Point got under way at 1455 on that afternoon, bound for Portugal, and arrived at Lisbon on 23 July. While there, the ship was visited by Portuguese naval and diplomatic dignitaries; and she transferred supplies to the Coast Guard cutter , the \\"station ship\\" at Lisbon, Portugal. After her final Italian passenger had been disembarked on 23 July and the last German on 24 July, West Point commenced taking on 321 American citizens and 67 Chinese‚Äîconsular staffs and their families ‚Äì on 26 July. Returning to New York on 1 August, West Point discharged her passengers and headed south for an overhaul at Portsmouth, Virginia. She then participated in tactical exercises off the Virginia Capes from 26 to 29 August in company with and . On 3 November, she sailed from Virginia waters and arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 5 November. There, on 8 and 9 November, she embarked 241 officers and 5,202 men of the 55th Brigade, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment, and 100 men of a US Army Field Service company. On 10 November, West Point ‚Äì in company with five other transports: Wakefield, Mount Vernon, , , and ‚Äì got under way for India as Convoy HS-124. En route, they were joined by the aircraft carrier , the cruisers and , and a division of destroyers. Reaching Cape Town, South Africa, on 9 December, West Point and Wakefield were detached on 23 December to form Task Group (TG) 14.1, while Leonard Wood and Joseph T. Dickman formed TG 14.2. Escorted by the British heavy cruiser , the convoy proceeded uneventfully toward India until 0700 on the 27th, when TG 14.1 was detached to speed up and arrive at Bombay ahead of the other ships. Wakefield commenced discharging her embarked troops at 1900 at the Ballard Piers, completed her unloading, and shifted berths the next morning. West Point took Wakefields former berth while Joseph T. Dickman moored to unload her equipment and troops. ===1942=== Having completed her discharge by 31 December 1941, West Point anchored in the stream on the morning of 2 January 1942 and awaited further orders until 4 January, when British authorities asked Captain Kelley, of West Point, if his ship and Wakefield could be brought under draught to make passage for Singapore. Kelley responded that it could be done, but this would entail discharging ballast and expelling some of the ship's fresh water supply‚Äîthus endangering the ship's stability. Due to prevailing low-water conditions at Bombay at this point, neither West Point nor Wakefield could go alongside piers in the harbor to either load equipment or troops. Thus, the embarkation and loading procedures had to be carried out by the tedious process of embarking troops and loading supplies from smaller ships and lighters brought alongside. Wakefield embarked ‚Äì almost to a man ‚Äì the troops which she had brought from Halifax, a total of 4,506, while West Point embarked two-thirds of the troops which she had transported, in addition to some which had come out in other ships. All told, she carried some 5,272 men. West Point sailed for Singapore on 9 January, in a \\"15-knot\\" convoy, with Captain Kelley as the Convoy Commodore. In addition to the two American ships, three British transports ‚Äì Duchess of Bedford, Empress of Japan, and Empire Star ‚Äì made up the remainder of the van. Escorted by British light cruiser until this ship was relieved by light cruiser at 1630 on 22 January, the convoy's escort soon swelled to three cruisers and four destroyers as the convoy neared Java. Japanese submarine activities near the Indonesian archipelago prompted concern for the safe arrival of the valuable ships, hence a detour through the shallow, coral-studded Sunda Strait. Led by British cruiser , the ships slowed to , and streaming paravane gear, began the passage. An escorting destroyer steamed between each transport, as they steamed in single-column order. It was a dangerous passing, a small divergence from the charted course could mean a disastrous grounding. The screen's commander, Captain Oliver L. Gordon, R.N., commanding Exeter, desired to arrive at Singapore with as many ships as possible by dawn on 29 January, and thus split the convoy up, sending the faster vessels‚ÄîWest Point, Wakefield, and Empress of Japan‚Äîahead at increased speed under escort of cruisers HMS Exeter, , , and destroyers and . Proceeding to Singapore via Berhala Strait, Durian Strait, and Philips Channel, the group steamed through these bodies of water in bright moonlight which made navigational aids unnecessary. Upon their arrival off Singapore, the ships lay to in an exposed position, beyond the range of shore-based antiaircraft guns, until pilots could be obtained to bring the ships in. Since the naval base came under daily heavy air raids, the transports proceeded to Keppel Harbor, the commercial basin at Singapore, where they could discharge their troops and cargo. Securing abreast godowns (warehouses) 52, 53, and 54, West Point commenced off-loading equipment and disembarking her troops. All but 670 engineer troops, who had been ordered retained on board, were ashore before nightfall. Air raids, meanwhile, continued until midnight as the Japanese steadily pounded Singapore from the air. At each alert, the local workers working dockside would vanish, taking to the shelters and leaving the vital cargo still unloaded. As a result, the unloading was carried out by the crew of West Point, her embarked troops, and 22 local workers who were brought aboard to assist. On 30 January, seven Japanese bombers appeared over the city and were engaged by British Brewster Buffalo fighters. As the alert continued, 30 more Japanese planes appeared overhead, on course over Keppel Harbor. Several bombs fell on shore, eastward of West Point's moorings, while another stick fell in the water to the southward. In the interim, bombs hit other targets. A small tanker moored near Wakefield was sunk at dockside; bombs fell abreast Empress of Japan; and Wakefield took a direct hit forward which destroyed her sick bay, killed five men and wounded nine. The last bombs in this stick straddled West Point and showered her with shrapnel. As the raid lifted, West Point sent two medical officers and 11 corpsmen on board Wakefield, at the latter's request, to render medical assistance. Later that morning, Captain Kelley attended a conference with British authorities, who informed him that his ship was to be used to carry a contingent of Australian troops from Suez to Singapore and to transport refugees and evacuees to Ceylon. With the emergency \\"acute\\", Kelley agreed to take on board up to one thousand women and children and such additional men as the British desired to send. With the abandonment of the naval dockyard, untenable in the face of increasingly heavier Japanese bombardments from artillery and aircraft, several dockyard naval and civilian personnel and their families were assigned to West Point for evacuation. Most carried only hand baggage; had little, if any, money; but were all fortunate enough to escape the doomed city before its fall to the onrushing Japanese troops of General Yamashita. All told, some 1,276 naval officers, their families, dockyard civilians, civilian evacuees, a 16-man Royal Air Force (RAF) contingent, and 225 naval ratings made up the 1,276 people embarked by 1800 on 30 January. Clearing Singapore, West Point and Wakefield headed due west, escorted by HMS Durban. Overcast and squally weather covered their departure and permitted them to transit the Banka Strait unmolested by the seemingly omnipresent Japanese aircraft. Routed to Batavia, Java, to embark more refugees, West Point led Wakefield and Durban through the minefields and anchored in Batavia Roads at 0305 on 31 January. HMS Electra‚Äîwhich would be lost in the Battle of the Java Sea 27 February‚Äîcame alongside eight hours later and transferred 20 naval dockyard personnel, three women, five naval officers' wives, one Free French officer, and an RAF officer to West Point for passage to Ceylon. At 12:40 pm on 1 February, West Point‚Äîin company with Wakefield and under escort of Exeter, HMS Encounter, and ‚Äîgot under way. The destroyers eventually went off to perform other duties, and Exeter as well soon dropped away to escort another convoy, leaving the two big troopships on their own. While they were en route, disconcerting news came over the radio. Japanese I-boats (identified after the war as I-162 and I-153) had been active in the vicinity, sinking six ships between them. West Point acquired an extra passenger while en route; for, on 4 February, a baby boy was born on board. Colombo Harbor, Ceylon, where they arrived on 6 February, was so crowded that British authorities could not permit Wakefield to repair her damage there. The passengers, in turn, experienced much difficulty in arranging for suitable transportation ashore. In addition, neither transport could fully provision. British authorities requested the American ships to evacuate personnel to Bombay. Accordingly, West Point took on board eight men, 55 women, and 53 children, as well as 670 troops, for passage to India. Wakefield, despite her weakened condition caused by the direct hit on 29 January, embarked two naval ratings, six RAF personnel, and 25 men and one officer of a British Bofors gun detachment. The two ships departed Colombo on 8 February and, escorted by the Greek destroyer Vasilissa Olga, proceeded at . Captain Kelley later highly praised the operations of this sole escort. Although heavy weather was encountered en route, the Greek destroyer acquitted herself well, continuing to patrol her station \\"at all times at high speed ahead of our zig-zag.\\" After discharging her evacuees at Bombay, West Point parted company with Wakefield and proceeded to Suez where she picked up Australian troops who were being withdrawn from the North African Campaign to fight the Japanese in Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, one disaster after another had plagued the Allied forces. Singapore fell on 15 February; Java on 4 March. West Point carried her embarked troops to Australia and disembarked them at Adelaide and Melbourne before heading across the Pacific toward San Francisco. As the Allies built up for the long road back, West Point participated in the effort to aid America's allies in the southwest Pacific with massive contingents of troops. Accordingly, the transport carried men to Wellington, New Zealand, and arrived on 30 May. There, she received orders to return to New York; and she got under way from Melbourne on 8 June, bound for the Panama Canal. She entered the Atlantic on 26 June and arrived at New York on 2 July. After two voyages to the United Kingdom, West Point sailed for India, via the South Atlantic route, and arrived at Bombay on 29 November, before pushing on for Auckland, New Zealand, the following month. ===1943=== The transport returned via Noum√©a, New Caledonia, to San Francisco on 31 January 1943. She remained on the West Coast until 16 February, when she got under way for the South Pacific and retraced her route to Wellington, New Zealand, and Australian ports. She then continued west‚Äîcalling at Bombay, Massawa, Aden, and Suez‚Äîand stopped briefly at Cape Town en route to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Eventually arriving at New York on 4 May, the ship subsequently made two voyages to Casablanca, French Morocco before sailing for Bombay via the southern Atlantic route. Calling at Rio de Janeiro and Cape Town en route, the big transport continued, via Bombay and Melbourne, on for the West Coast of the United States. Soon thereafter, West Point began transporting troops to Australia and continued making voyages there and to Allied bases in the Central and South Pacific through the end of 1943. ===1944=== In 1944, the transport continued her vital workhorse duties, departing San Francisco on 12 January, bound for Noum√©a and Guadalcanal; and from San Pedro, California on 22 February, bound for Noum√©a and Milne Bay. She sailed from the latter port and steamed via the Panama Canal to Boston, Massachusetts, where she arrived on 12 June. She conducted five successive voyages to the United Kingdom before departing Boston on 6 December 1944 for Oran, Algeria; Casablanca, French Morocco; and Marseille, France. The transport left the Mediterranean on 26 December and proceeded to Norfolk, Virginia. ===1945‚Äì1946=== USS West Point arriving at New York with troops from Europe, July 1945 In 1945, West Point voyaged to Italian and French ports, via Oran or Gibraltar, staging from Hampton Roads, Virginia, Boston, or New York. After Germany surrendered, she took part in some of the initial \\"Magic Carpet\\" voyages, bringing home American troops from the European battlefronts. Following her last European voyage‚Äîto Le Havre, France‚ÄîWest Point was transferred to the Pacific Fleet. She departed Boston on 10 December 1945, transited the Panama Canal, and proceeded to Manila, Philippines via Pearl Harbor. Retracing the same route, she docked at pier 88 in New York on 7 February 1946 and soon got under way for Hampton Roads, where she was released from troop-carrying service on 22 February. Her last voyage under the name West Point was a short trip from Portsmouth to Newport News for reconversion to a passenger liner. There, six days later, she was officially decommissioned, and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 March and transferred to the Maritime Commission's War Shipping Administration. During her naval service she carried a total of over 350,000 troops which was the largest total of any Navy troopship in service during World War II. On one voyage in 1944 she was able to transport 9,305 people. Additionally the troop transport carried Red Cross workers, United Nations officials, children, civilians, prisoners of war, and U.S.O. entertainers. ===Awards=== During her service in the U.S. Navy, West Point earned the following awards: *American Defense Service Medal *European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal *Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal *World War II Victory Medal ==Postwar career (1946‚Äì1964)== America in Bremerhaven, 1958 America's postwar career was successful, if uneventful. Finally, she was able to sail the New York‚ÄìLe Havre‚ÄìBremerhaven‚ÄìCobh route that had been delayed by World War II. To many ship lovers, she was the most beautifully decorated liner to fly the American flag, smaller and more graceful than her much faster fleetmate, the , which debuted in 1952. The great disparities between America and United States prevented them from becoming true running mates like the and of the Cunard Line. After 1955, she continued to sail the US-Europe route through at least 1960, but also served tropical ports such as Bermuda and the Caribbean. She sailed on fourteen transatlantic voyages in 1962 and eight in 1963, but was laid up in Hoboken for five months starting in September 1963 as a result of industrial action. ==Chandris career (1964‚Äì1978)== Australis 1967 America was sold to the Greek-owned Chandris Group on 16 November 1964. At twenty-four, she was getting older and facing competition from both newer, faster ships and long-range, even non-stop, air travel. The postwar emigrant run from Europe to Australia had become a lucrative market for passenger ships unable to court the luxury trade. America, now renamed Australis (meaning \\"Australia\\", following the naming convention of Chandris liners), was refitted extensively. Some 350 additional cabins were installed and many existing cabins were given extra berths, increasing her passenger capacity from fewer than 1,200 to 2,258. Her maiden voyage was from Southampton on 21 August 1965 to Australia and New Zealand via Piraeus and Suez, returning to Southampton via the Pacific and Panama and Miami. Thereafter she sailed regularly from Southampton, occasionally Rotterdam, on this round-the-world route. On the closure of the Suez Canal in 1967, Piraeus was dropped as a port-of-call and she sailed southbound via Cape Town. On 22 October 1970, fire broke out in the galley, causing the air-conditioning supply units and exhaust systems to be cut off from the bridge and \\"B\\" deck port about 3:45 am. It was extinguished the following day, but the voyage was delayed due to repair work. On 11 July 1974, Australis was involved in a minor collision with the Australian aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne while in Sydney Harbour. Both ships were slightly damaged, but there were no casualties. She was the last liner providing a regular service to Australia and New Zealand from Southampton until her final voyage which left on 18 November 1977. After arriving at Auckland, she was laid up at Timaru on 23 December 1977. Ultimately, rising fuel costs, aging infrastructure, and the creation of long-range jetliners caused Chandris to pull Australis off the Australian run in 1978. ==Venture Cruise Lines career (June 1978 ‚Äì August 1978)== America in New York in 1978 Following a period of layup in Timaru, New Zealand,S.S. AUSTRALIS 1967 ‚Äì 1978 , Cabin 111 Australis was sold to Venture Cruise Lines of New York. Under this new ownership, the ship was renamed America once again in an attempt to capitalize on the ship's US heritageThe history of the America-West Point-Australis-American Star, SS Australis Homepage despite being registered as a Greek vessel. The ship's hull was painted dark blue and the funnels were repainted in a blue-and-red color scheme. America set sail on her first cruise on 30 June 1978.SS America Venture Cruises New York 1978 , ss-australis.com Her refit, however, had not been completed by the time of the sailing. The ship was in an extremely bad condition, with piles of soiled linens and worn mattresses and scattered piles of trash everywhere, together with a pungent smell of kitchen odors, engine oil, and the sounds of plumbing back-ups. In addition, water in overhead pipes leaked and dripped all over the decks. Along with these many maintenance issues, attempts to spruce the ship up led to other problems, such as the many layers of paint visible on the ship's outer bulkheads as well as on the lifeboat davits and the lifeboat gear. Additionally, the public rooms aboard were carelessly repainted, as seen from how the Americas stainless-steel trims were then scarred with paint-brush strokes. Due to overbooking and her state of incompletion, a number of passengers \\"mutinied\\", forcing the captain to return to New York, having only barely passed the Statue of Liberty. 960 passengers were offloaded upon docking. On a second sailing that day, an additional 200 passengers left via tender at Staten Island. America finally left for a five-day cruise to Nova Scotia on 3 July 1978. Upon arrival, she was met with $2.5 million in claims from passengers. Further issues saw the cancellation of all further sailings, and America was impounded on 18 July 1978 for non-payment of debts. America also received an inspection score of six out of a possible 100 points by the US Public Health Service. On 28 August 1978, America was ordered to be sold at auction by the United States district court. ==Second Chandris career (1978‚Äì1980)== SS Italis at Genoa in late 1979 Chandris Lines repurchased America for $1,000,000 and renamed her Italis. Her forward funnel had become severely corroded due to years of neglect and was removed as part of an ambitious plan to modernize her silhouette by adding streamlined superstructure above the bridge, but this 'new look' was never completed. She retained the dark blue hull adopted by Venture Cruise Lines. Italis first operated under Chandris as a hotel ship from 23 June to 20 July 1979 when she was chartered for the Organisation of African Unity Conference held in Monrovia, Liberia. She then carried out three 14-night cruises from Genoa and Barcelona to Egypt, Israel and the Eastern Mediterranean beginning on 28 July 1979. At the end of this series of cruises she was finally laid up in Elefsina Bay, Piraeus, Greece on 12 September 1979. ==Uncertain future at Piraeus (1979‚Äì1993)== Alferdoss/Noga in Eleusis, 1986 The ship was next sold to Intercommerce Corporation in 1980, and was renamed Noga. Intercommerce's intention was to convert the ship to a prison ship, to be anchored in Beirut; but this never happened. In September 1984, the ship was sold to Silver Moon Ferries and she was once again renamed, now carrying the name Alferdoss (meaning \\"paradise\\" in Arabic). However, the new name was not completely added (since the port bow was only renamed Alferdoss), so the name on the stern and starboard bow continued to show Noga. While under the ownership of Silver Moon Ferries, a burst bilge pipe led to flooding in the engine room and some crew quarters. Due to the quickly-occurring list, her starboard anchor was raised and her port anchor was cut away, and she was quickly beached to prevent her from sinking. After being pumped out and repaired, she was returned to her original location. In the late 1980s, the ship was sold for $2 million for scrapping. The scrap merchant made an initial deposit of $1 million, and began work. Following the demolition of the lifeboats and lifeboat davits, the scrappers defaulted on payments, and pulled out. Alferdoss/Noga would continue in this state until 1993.Alferdoss , ss-australis.com ==Wrecked at Fuerteventura (1994)== American Star the day after she ran aground on Fuerteventura in 1994 In October 1992, the ship was sold yet again, with the intention of being refitted to become a five-star hotel ship off Phuket, in Thailand. Drydocking at that time revealed that despite the years of neglect, her hull was still in remarkably good condition. In August 1993, she was renamed American Star, her propellers were removed and placed on the deck at the bow, the funnel was painted red, the bridge was painted signal orange just for the tow, and ladders were welded to starboard. She left Greece under tow on 22 December 1993, but the tow proved impossible due to inclement weather. She then returned to Greece for a few days until the weather calmed down. On 31 December 1993, American Star left Greece for the last time, under tow by Ukrainian tugboat Neftegaz-67. The hundred-day tow began. Shortly afterwards, American Star and Neftegaz-67 sailed into a thunderstorm in the Atlantic. The tow-lines broke and six or more crew-members were sent aboard the American Star to reattach the emergency tow-lines, which proved unsuccessful. Two other towboats were called to assist Neftegaz 67. On 17 January 1994, the crew aboard American Star was rescued by helicopter. The ship was left adrift. At 6:15 am on 18 January, the ship ran aground at Playa de Garcey, off the west coast of Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands. While discussions among the ship's owners, the towing firm, and the companies insuring the ship were going on, the ship was left to nature, with the forward part of the ship running aground on a sandbar. Within the first 48 hours of grounding, the pounding surf of the Atlantic broke the ship in two just past the second funnel. The ship was declared a total loss on 6 July 1994. The stern section collapsed completely to port and sank in 1996, while the bow section remained intact. The deterioration of the remains of American Star between 2005 and 2007. The stern broke off and sank in 1996, leaving only the bow section on the sandbar. Later, the ship developed a greater list to port, and the funnel detached and sank. More parts of the ship collapsed and the wreck is only visible during low tide. In November 2005, the port side of the bow section collapsed, which caused the liner's remains to assume a much sharper list, and the remaining funnel detached and fell into the ocean. The collapse of the port side also caused the hull to begin to break up and by October 2006, the wreck had almost completely collapsed onto its port side. In April 2007, the starboard side finally collapsed, causing the wreck to break in half and fall into the sea. Over the subsequent years, the wreck continued to collapse. At last report, a small section of the bow as well as the keel of the vessel was still visible at low tide. It was noted in 2013 that the wreck was no longer visible on Google Maps.

The meters typically display hours and tenths of an hour, but there are several ways in which the meter may be activated: # It can measure the time that the electrical system is on. This maximizes the recorded time. # It can be activated by oil pressure running into a pressure switch, and therefore runs while the engine is running. Many rental aircraft use this method to remove the incentive to fly with the master electrical switch off. # It can be activated by another switch, either an airspeed sensing vane under a wing (as in the Cessna Caravan) or a pressure switch attached to the landing gear (as in many twin engine planes). In these cases, the meter only measures the time the aircraft is actually flying. Metrics such as Time In Service and Turbine Actual Runtime are kept to monitor overhaul cycles, and are usually used by commercial operators under Federal Aviation Regulations Parts 135, 121, or 125. # It can be activated when the engine alternators are online (as in the Cirrus SR series). == General aviation use == For general aviation, Hobbs time is usually recorded in the pilot's log book, and many fixed-base operators that rent airplanes charge an hourly rate based on Hobbs Time. Tach Time is recorded in the engine's log books and is used, for example, to determine when the oil should be changed and the time between overhauls. Tach (tachometer) time differs from Hobbs Time in that it is linked to engine revolutions per minute (RPM). Tach Time records the time at some specific RPM. It is most accurate at cruise RPM, and least accurate while taxiing or stationary with the engine running. At these times, the clock runs slower. Depending on the type of flight, Tach Time can be 10-20% less than Hobbs Time. Many organizations such as flying clubs charge by Tach Time so as to differentiate themselves from fixed-base operators by the fact that 10-20% less time recorded makes it 10-20% cheaper to fly (if the hourly rate is the same). In the case where flying clubs use Tach Time, many will charge a dry rate, thus requiring the renter to pay for fuel on top of the hourly Tach Time rate. ==History== The Hobbs Meter is named after John Weston Hobbs (1889‚Äì1968), who in 1938 founded the company named after him in Springfield, Illinois which manufactured the first electrically wound clocks for vehicle use. World War II created the demand for aviation hour meters which led to the development of the original Hobbs Meter. The company was eventually renamed Honeywell Hobbs after being acquired by Honeywell International, who in 2009 announced plans to move manufacturing to Mexico. == References == Category:Timers Category:Aircraft instruments Category:Avionics ","title":"Hobbs meter"},{"id":"2557706","text":"Milt Josefsberg (June 29, 1911 ‚Äì December 14, 1987) was an American screenwriter. == Career == Milt Josefsberg's first big break came in 1938, when he was hired as writer on Bob Hope's radio program.Josefsberg, Milt: The Jack Benny Show (Arlington House Publishers, 1977), p. 52. , Five years later, in the summer of 1943, he left Hope and took over as one of four new writers on The Jack Benny Program on the radio.

He established an ¬£8m Centre of Excellence in Medical Engineering within the IBME,Centre of Excellence in Medical Engineering, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford and he has led the Technology & Digital Health theme in the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre since its inception in 2007.NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre Under his leadership, the IBME grew from 110 to 220 academic researchers and it was awarded a Queen‚Äôs Anniversary Prize for Higher Education in 2015 for ‚Äúnew collaborations between engineering and medicine delivering benefit to patients‚Äù.Queen's Anniversary Prize == Education == Tarassenko completed his BA in Engineering Science in 1978 at Keble College, University of Oxford. Later obtained his DPhil in 1985, also at the University of Oxford for his work on the early identification of brain haemorrhages in pre-term infants. == Career and Research == Together with Professor Alan Murray of University of Edinburgh, Tarassenko is the inventor of pulse-stream technique for analogue implementation of massively parallel neural networks.Murray, A.F. and Tarassenko, L., 1994. Analogue neural VLSI: a pulse stream approach. Chapman & Hall, Ltd. He gradually moved away from designing neural network hardware to developing new machine learning algorithms and applying them to problems as diverse as the automated re-heating of food and drinks in a microwave oven (implemented in the Sharp LogiCook oven) and the analysis of sleep disorders. This body of work was recognised in 1996 by the award of the IEE Mather Premium for innovation using neural networks. Tarassenko then went on to develop methods for learning how to characterise normality in safety-critical systems. With his research team, he designed the QUICK system, which was at the core of Rolls-Royce‚Äôs engine health monitoring strategy in the 1990s and the early 2000s.Nairac, A., Townsend, N., Carr, R., King, S., Cowley, P., and Tarassenko, L.

(eds): Encyclopaedia of Structural Health Monitoring, Wiley, 2009 As a result, he and his Rolls-Royce collaborators were awarded the Chairman‚Äôs Team Award for Technical Innovation in 2001 and the Sir Henry Royce High Value Patent Award in 2008. When he became the first Director of the Oxford Institute of Biomedical Engineering in 2008, Tarassenko focused his research on patient monitoring, both in and out of hospital. His work has had a major impact on the identification of deterioration in acute care and on the management of long-term conditions. He has been a pioneer in developing early warning systems for acutely ill patients. The machine-learning system (Visensia) which he designed for patient monitoring in critical care was the first such system to gain FDA approval (in 2008).OBS Medical In the last decade Tarassenko has led the engineering development of several digital health products including: (a) GDm-Health, a digital therapeutic for the management of gestational diabetes;GDm-Health on NHS Apps Library (b) SEND, a system for monitoring in-hospital patient vital signs and identifying deterioration early;SEND on NIHR Oxford BRC Wong D, Bonnici T, Knight J, Morgan L, Coombes P, Watkinson P.

It is situated approximately to the east of Howden and south east of York. The civil parish is formed by the village of Eastrington and the hamlets of Newland, Owsthorpe and Portington. According to the 2011 UK Census, Eastrington parish had a population of 1,147, an increase on the 2001 UK Census figure of 880. Eastrington lies within the Parliamentary constituency of Haltemprice and Howden an area that mainly consists of middle class suburbs, towns and villages. The area is affluent and has one of the highest proportions of owner-occupiers in the country. The village is served by Eastrington railway station (formerly \\"South Eastrington\\") on the Hull to Selby railway line, and was historically also served by North Eastrington railway station on the Hull and Barnsley Railway. Nearby Eastrington Ponds was designated a Local Nature Reserve in 2002 by the East Riding of Yorkshire Council. The village is served by a local shop and the Black Swan public house. In 1823 Eastrington was in the Wapentake and liberty of Howdenshire. At the time the King was the patron of Eastrington's Church of St Michael. A Methodist chapel and a free school existed. The village had a population of 375, with occupations including six carpenters, four farmers, two shopkeepers, a shoemaker, a blacksmith, a corn miller, a tailor, and the landlord of the Bay Horse public house. Also directory-listed was a school master and a yeoman. ==St Michael's Church== St Michael's Church St Michael's Church, Eastrington is at the centre of the village. A church at Eastrington is mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book, listed as part of the Howden manor, and in 1146 Eastrington was specifically mentioned as a chapel of Howden. Architecturally the church is a mixture of historical influences. The present chancel was probably in the original chapel. The walls are Norman with chamfered string courses both inside and out, as are the carved stone inside the building, steps on which the font stands and the gargoyles. Surviving records from accounts at Durham suggest that monks paid for some of the early medieval building work, while the north and south aisles were later additions and probably paid for by three local families - the Askes, Kayvills (or Cavilles) and Portingtons. In the Portington chapel, a \\"coffin shaped cross slab with lead filled design\\" can be found on the floor dated from the early 13th century, also a second cross slab carved in relief, dated from the late 13th century. There is a shield below the cross head, probably the Caville coat of arms. Architectural evidence suggests that much of St Michael's Church building surviving today was built during the 14th century. The windows of the chapel are typical of the 14th century and a tombstone recorded as being in the church in 1584 was inscribed with the words \\"Orate pro animabus Nicholai de Portington, militis, qui istam capellam fieri fecit\\" (Pray for the soul of Nicholas Portington, knight, who caused this chapel to be built). It is thought to be that of Nicholas Portington who was still alive in 1327. The church was designated a Grade I listed building in 1966 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. ==References== * ==External links== * * Category:Villages in the East Riding of Yorkshire Category:Civil parishes in the East Riding of Yorkshire ","title":"Eastrington"},{"id":"2557767","text":"Ether Ore is the latest solo album from one of the Chapman Stick frontrunners, Greg Howard.

They maintain cultural and personal ties with India -- through discipleship or inter-marriage -- and they use the Hindustani musical theories and terminology, for example raga (melodic form) and tala (rhythmic cycle). (all emphasis in original) Afghan ragas, in contrast to Indian ones, tend to be more focused on rhythm, and are usually played with the tabla, imported from India, or the native zerbaghali, daireh or dohol, all percussive instruments. An important characteristic of the Afghan ghazal is that, unlike the Indian talas and ragas it is based on, Afghan ghazal features the \\"repetitive use of fast instrumental sections interpolated between units of text\\", an element derived from Pashtun music. Afghan ghazal is viewed as a \\"light-classical\\" form of Indian music, which uses Persian texts consisting of a series of rhyming couplets, many written by spiritual poets like Bedil, Sa'adi and Hafez.

Trails are available for hiking, biking, and cross-country skiing. The park includes forested and wetland habitats; forested areas contain populations of woodpeckers, nuthatches, warblers and thrushes, while the lake and wetland areas host herons, ducks and kingfishers. The mature woodlands are noted for a particularly large number of pileated woodpeckers. For anglers, Chenango Lake includes trout, bass, perch and bullhead. Two kettle lakes, Chenango Lake and Lily Lake, are found within the park. The lakes were formed as glaciers receded at the end of the most recent ice age. The Chenango Valley State Park Golf Course is located within the park. The course, originally constructed as a 9-hole course by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s, was expanded to its current 18-hole size in 1967. ==See also== * List of New York state parks ==References== ==External links== * New York State Parks: Chenango Valley State Park * Chenango Valley State Park trail map Category:State parks of New York (state) Category:Parks in Broome County, New York Category:Golf clubs and courses in New York (state) ","title":"Chenango Valley State Park"},{"id":"2557806","text":"This list consists of notable members of the denomination called Church of Christ, Scientist.

It featured a 2.7-megapixel image sensor, 4.5-frames-per-second continuous shooting, and accepted the full range of Nikon F-mount lenses. The camera body strongly resembled the F5 and had the same general layout of controls, allowing users of Nikon film SLR cameras to quickly become proficient in using the camera. Autofocus speed on the D1 series bodies is extremely fast, even with \\"screw-driven\\" AF lenses. Although Nikon and other manufacturers had produced digital SLR cameras for several years prior, the D1 was the first professional digital SLR that displaced Kodak's then-undisputed reign over the professional market. Unusual for a DSLR, the D1 uses the NTSC color space instead of the conventional sRGB or Adobe RGB color spaces. The resulting color on the D1 can be a bit unorthodox, but methods of correcting and/or compensating for the color problem are readily available. == D1H and D1X == Nikon D1x. Uniquely for the D1 range, the D1x had a grey stripe on the handgrip (not pictured) The D1 was replaced by the D1H and D1X on February 5, 2001. The D1X offered higher resolution with a 4,024 x 1,324 - 5.3 effective megapixels sensor (3,008 x 1,960 interpolated image output), and continuous shooting of 3 frames per second for up to 21 consecutive shots. The D1H was oriented towards fast-action photography, keeping the same 2.7 megapixels image sensor as the D1, but pushing the frame rate to 5 frame/s for up to 40 consecutive shots. Both the D1H and D1X use the sRGB/AdobeRGB color spaces, which is an improvement over the original D1. ==Development and sensor design== Development began on the D1 in 1996, when digital imaging was in its infancy in the consumer market. At that time the major market leader for DSLR cameras was Kodak, who produced their own image sensors and assembled digital cameras under the brand Kodak DCS. The DCS cameras were based upon 35 mm SLR cameras, replacing the film back with one incorporating a CCD sensor. This in turn was connected to a power supply and image processing and storage unit that was either carried separately or attached to the base of the camera body. While these cameras offered the convenience of digital imaging to normal photographers, their appeal was limited by huge price-tags and issues with sensor size, resolution, and performance in comparison to film. Nikon therefore stood to gain a significant market advantage if they could manage to offer a digital camera that had been designed from the ground up. The goal was ambitious; Nikon sought to produce professional-grade cameras using large high-resolution sensors for only a few thousand dollars at a time when the Kodak DCS 460, based on a Nikon F90X and provided with a 6 megapixel 27.6 √ó 18.4 mm CCD sensor, was retailing for over US$30,000. Price was just one of the hurdles encountered; engineers also had to consider how to design and mass-produce a high-resolution and high- sensitivity sensor that could be powered by batteries and sustain a continuous frame-rate suitable for journalistic use. Initially no major sensor manufacturer was prepared to produce the sensor for Nikon, believing that the predicted sales volumes were completely unrealistic. Eventually though a source was located and prototype designs entered production. Several years of refinement followed - working to reduce power use and improve read speeds - until a design was perfected. The final design that was used in the D1 was for a 23.7 √ó 15.6 mm CCD producing images with a final resolution of 2000 √ó 1312 pixels (approximately 2.7 megapixels), and this was the figure used for marketing the camera. The sensor was praised for its high base sensitivity of ISO 200, its excellent signal-to-noise ratio especially at base sensitivity, and its capacity for continuous shooting at five frames per second. At the time, Bj√∏rn R√∏rslett famously stated that the camera spelled \\"The End of The Beginning (of the digital era) - The Beginning of The End (of the film era)\\". The development of the D1 is generally accepted as one of the major milestones in the development of the digital camera, and Kodak's initial market dominance was genuinely threatened for the first time. In a later \\"behind the scenes\\" interview published on the Nikon website it was revealed by the General Manager of Nikon's Imaging Development Management Department that the sensor developed for and used in the D1, and subsequently the D1H, actually used 10.8 million photosites rather than the 2.7 million that had previously been suggested. This allowed multiple photosites to be grouped together into units that formed the final pixels in the image, contributing to the sensor's high sensitivity and excellent signal-to-noise ratio. ==References== ==External links== ===Official sites=== * Nikon D1 Product Page ‚Äì Nikon Global Website * Nikon D1H Product Page ‚Äì Nikon Global Website * Nikon D1X Product Page ‚Äì Nikon Global Website ===Reviews=== * ByThom.com review of the D1, D1h and D1x * \\"The End of The Beginning - The Beginning of The End\\" A review of D1 by Bj√∏rn R√∏rslett * \\"Into the Night with Nikon D1X\\" by Bj√∏rn R√∏rslett * dpreview.com review of the D1 * dpreview.com review of the D1h * dpreview.com review of the D1x * photo.net review of the D1h * Lonestar.net review of the D1, D1h and D1x * imaging-resource.com review of the D1h Category:Cameras introduced in 1999 D1 D1 ","title":"Nikon D1"},{"id":"2557818","text":"Qawra (, ) is a zone within St. Paul's Bay in the Northern Region, Malta. It is located close to Buƒ°ibba and Salina, and it is a popular tourist resort, containing many hotels and restaurants. In around 1638, the Order of St. John built Qawra Tower at Qawra Point. A battery was built around it in 1715, while an entrenchment wall was added in the 1760s. Today, the tower and battery are a restaurant, and parts of the entrenchment can still be seen. The town is home to many water-sport activities, including banana boat, speed boat and jetski rides, as well as kayaking, snorkeling and diving. The area is also well known as the \\"touristy\\" area of Malta due to the many bars which show British football. Summer temperatures can be as hot as , with an average of over . Casinos, bars, and clubs are also a major part of this small town. Many people swim and bathe off the rocks, which provide ample space for sun bathing. It is popular with tourists who like to walk by the sea at night. == Parish == The parochial church of Qawra is dedicated to St Francis of Assisi. The parish incorporates both Qawra and the neighbouring locality of Bugibba in its geographical area. The parish feast is celebrated on 17 September which commemorates the impression of the stigmata on St Francis. The church in Qawra started operating as a parish on 8 December 2004 and the first parish priest was Fr Gorg Zammit, OFM conv. The architect of the church building was Richard England.

The Bully Kutta is a working dog used for hunting and guarding. The type is popular in the Punjab region of India and Pakistan, including Haryana and Delhi, as well as Tamil Nadu. == Name and description == Darasuram Temple in the Thanjavur district of India A Bully Kutta A Bully Kutta Bully Kutta literally translates to \\"heavily wrinkled dog\\". The word \\"Bully\\" comes from the root word of the Hindustani and Punjabi languages \\"Bohli\\" which means heavily wrinkled. \\"Kutta\\" means dog in the Hindi-Urdu language.Romanised School Dictionary - English and Urdu Calcutta 1863, page 43 The Sindhi mastiff resembles the mastiff, and is notable for its hardiness and size. The colour is black and white with some red in places. The tail curls up and is long and bushy, with the coat being long and thick.The Indian dog Waman Vishwanath Soman, Popular Prakashan 1963, page 85 Bully Kuttas have an average height of 2.7 ft (78.74 cm). ==History== The Bully Kutta originated in the Indian subcontinent, either in the Thanjavur and Tiruchi districts of Madras or the Sind region of medieval India. In Thanjavur, the Bully Kutta was a favorite pet of ruling families. The Mughal emperor Akbar owned a Bully Kutta, which he used for hunting. The Second International Dog Show at Islington Agricultural Hall, held on 28 May 1864 in London, showcased the Indian Mastiff among several other dog breeds. The previous year, Edward, the Prince of Wales, and Princess Alexandra, entered an Indian Mastiff in the same show, along with a Newfoundland, Russian Tracker and two Borzois. In 1884, Littell's Living Age said that historically, a \\"large Indian mastiff\\" was employed by kings \\"in the chase of wild beasts\\". == Temperament == Bully Kuttas have been described as intelligent, alert, responsive, energetic and aggressive. A well-known veterinary Dr. L.N. Gupta from Agra, India has stated that Bully Kuttas are a dominating canine and should only be handled by well-experienced owners. The American Humane Association has stated that \\"on tests conducted in 2009 by the American Temperament Test Society, bullies scored better than several breeds that are rarely associated with aggression, including beagles and collies.\\" However, this is misleading, as the ATTS test is not an aggression test, it tests \\"different aspects of temperament such as stability, shyness, aggressiveness, and friendliness as well as the dog‚Äôs instinct for protectiveness towards its handler and/or self-preservation in the face of a threat\\", and Beagles and Collies fail the test not due to aggression, but due to fear of hostile strangers.https://atts.org/tt-test-description/ == Use as a fighting dog == Bully Kuttas have been illegally used for dog fighting in Pakistan and India, including areas such as Delhi, Gurugram, and Noida. In June 2018, police in Indian Punjab filed First Information Report (FIR) for the first time against organizers of a dog fight. According to a specialist at Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, \\"imported animals are being crossbred to be more menacing\\". Many non-profit organizations are now working against illegal fighting and creating awareness among the people. == Popularity == The Bully Kutta is popular in the Punjab region of India and Pakistan. In India, breeders from several rural areas of Punjab and Sri Ganganagar in Rajasthan rear the Bully Kutta; however, it is not recognized by the Kennel Club of India. They have been part of many competitions in India. According to the Times of India, it has importance among Indian youth of having a macho image. ==References== ===Notes=== ===Citations=== == Further reading == * == External links == *Indian Mastiff - History *Bully Kutta - Canine Heritage Category:Dog breeds originating in India Category:Dog breeds originating in Pakistan Category:Dog fighting breeds Category:Hunting dogs ","title":"Bully Kutta"},{"id":"2557846","text":"John Silvester (1652 - 5 May 1722) held the Lordship of Birthwaite and Kexborough, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire, which he bought from Sir Francis Burdett in the late 16th or early 17th century.

The park is in the City of Saratoga Springs, near US 9 and NY 50. The grounds contain mineral springs, classical bath and spa houses, and the Saratoga Performing Arts Center. ==History== Towering trees line the Avenue of the Pines in Saratoga Spa State Park. The area, part of which became the park, drew interest from Mohawk and Iroquois Native American tribes for its hunting and mineral springs. The Native American name for the area was Kayaderosseras. The first recorded use of the springs was by Sir William Johnson during the French and Indian War, who was brought to Saratoga to recover from wounds. In the 19th century, the area became much visited for its purported medicinal effects. Entrepreneurs dug wells and bottled the mineral water for sale and gas companies sold the carbonation to soda fountains. In 1907, the stage was set to protect the springs in a lawsuit Frank Hathorn vs. Dr. Strong's Sanitarium, which showed that pumping on one well decreased the flow of water in wells across the city. The court certified the relationship between wells and when Dr. Strong stopped pumping, the flow of water in Mr. Hathorn's well resumed its natural flow. In 1908, as the springs were being depleted, the New York Assembly passed an injunction against pumping water; however the injunction was ignored. In 1909, governor Charles Evans Hughes signed into law a bill that made the springs of Saratoga a state reservation. In the 1930s, Reconstruction Finance Corporation funds were used to develop bath houses, research facilities and a drink hall. The Saratoga Reservation was designed with graded walkways intended to help rehabilitate those with heart conditions. After World War II veterans were welcomed as part of their readjustment and Holocaust survivors began using the baths as part of their healing process. The spa was named a state park in 1962. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987, for its natural and architectural features, and for its role as the subject of early conservation measures. See also In 2007, it was confirmed by state officials that the reportedly \\"pure\\" mineral water used in the public baths at the state park was actually mixed with tap water from a nearby source. ==Park features== ===Springs=== The Geyser Island Spouter in 2015. Detail of tufa deposits at the Geyser Island Spouter's base. The Saratoga Springs area has the only active spouting geysers east of the Mississippi River in the United States. The mineral springs for which the area is famous arise from fissures in the Saratoga Fault, which runs from Whitehall to Albany. The carbonated water that vents in springs and geysers is rich in minerals and salts. Two of the most visited springs today are Geyser Island Spouter and Orenda Spring, along Geyser Creek. Geyser Island Spouter, which sends a narrow plume of water into the air, first emerged in the early 1900s. Since that time, it has deposited minerals that grow a tufa deposit at the rate of per year. Orenda Spring has created a massive tufa dome, which continues to fossilize leaves and other debris as it grows. ====Springs in operation==== *Hathorne *Orenda *Hayes *Charlie *Geyser Island *State Seal *Polaris *Lincoln (Baths) *Shonts *Tallulah *Karista ===Venues and museums=== The entrance gates for the Saratoga Performing Arts Center.

The \\"Victoria Pool\\" is a smaller pool located near the golf course and surrounded by covered arcades. It was built when the original park buildings were constructed. The bath house was on the north end and the golf house was on the south end. Today the former golf house has been converted to a restaurant. The park also has tennis courts, two golf courses, picnic areas, horseshoe pits, softball fields, and volleyball courts.

As a boy he participated in the choir and attended the clerical school in Saint Nizier Parish. Querbes entered Saint Irenaeus Seminary and was ordained in 1816. He returned to Saint Nizier as a parochial vicar and became a skilled preacher. He became administrator of the clerical school at Saint Nizier. In 1822, Louis Querbes was named pastor of Vourles, a parish which had suffered during the Revolution. He took on the task of rebuilding the church and preaching to the faithful. He noted a lack of educational opportunities for the children there. ==The Congregation of the Clerics of St. Viator== ===History=== Father Querbes formed an association of catechists for rural schools: \\"The Catechists of Saint Viator\\". He chose Viator of Lyon, a fourth-century local saint who was a lector serving Bishop Just of Lyon, as patron. The religious Congregation of the Clerics of Saint Viator, made up of parochial clerics and lay catechists, was approved by Archbishop Gaston de Pins, Apostolic Administrator of Lyons, in 1831. Seven years later, he presented his society to the Pope, but counseled by advisors, he dropped the inclusion of lay members, as it would not have been approved. Father Querbes was ahead of his time in wanting to form a community of lay and religious members. On 21 September 1838, he received pontifical approval for the religious institute of the Parochial Clerics or Catechists of Saint Viator. The Viatorians opened schools and worked in parishes first in France and later in Canada and the United States. Father Louis Querbes died in Vourles 1 September 1859, but his work and charity continued after his death. At the death of its founder, the Congregation numbered between 250 and 300 members, including some fifty in Canada. They constituted four provinces: Vourles, Saint-Flour, Rodez, and Canada. ===19th century=== After the death of Father Querbes and up until about 1880, the movement continued to grow. In France, the typical Cleric of Saint Viator served in small rural parishes, where he was, according to the wishes of the founder, \\"the cantor, sacristan, catechist, table-mate, and companion\\" of the priest and the principal of the school. Afterwards, as the country entered an era of political turbulence, religious congregations that, up until that time, could direct public communal schools had to abandon them and open parish schools, which were free but poor. Members were obliged to do military service. Those entering novitiates became fewer and fewer. In 1900, there were approximately 500 French members out of the 760 members in the entire Congregation. Clerics of the Province of Canada went in a different direction, directing primary schools as well as secondary schools, accepting responsibility for a parish, and creating an Institution for the Deaf. The development of the Congregation proceeded based upon apostolic works. In 1897, a half-century after its founding, the Canadian chapter was composed of 215 members. In 1865, three Canadian members founded a school in Bourbonnais, Illinois, in the United States; this school later grew to become St. Viator College.[http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/frncdns/studies/dcb/3.htm \\"The Growth of French America During the Civil War\\"]. Frano-American History, Chapter 3. 2001. Claude B√©langer, Marianopolis\\"The College of St. Viator\\". The Journal, Jack Klasey Jun 23, 2018 A novitiate was opened, and in 1882, the members of the United States formed the Province of Chicago. At the end of the century, the Chicago Province was composed of about forty members. Until the beginning of the twentieth century, the members of France formed the predominant group in the Congregation. Except for the Chicago Province, the other provinces were engaged in apostolic works that fit into the same framework: elementary schools, some of which were small boarding schools, which represented the principal commitment of the Congregation; several secondary schools, which involved a small number of members; social works (orphanages in France, the Montreal Institute for the Deaf); and sacristan duties in several parishes. Small or medium-sized local communities predominated and consisted for the most part of religious brothers. ===1903-1908=== In May 1903, in France, the government decreed the closing of 11,000 schools and hospitals administered by religious congregations. Within the space of two months, the Clerics of Saint Viator of France saw their provincial houses, juniorates, novitiates, and residences for retired members closed and their personnel dispersed. All primary and secondary schools were affected; many of them disappeared. All properties of the Congregation were seized by the State; communities fell apart. Certain members went before tribunals and were sentenced to prison. Other members, especially those who were somewhat older, left for other countries. Belgium became a possible place of refuge for the members of the Province of Vourles, while Spain played the same role for those of the Province of Rodez. The Province of Canada indicated that, in case of necessity, it would welcome French confreres; 31 accepted Canada's hospitality. The provinces tried to re-establish themselves little by little. All the schools were now free and run by laypeople. To support themselves, the organization took part in gardening and farming operations, a tailor shop for religious garb, and sold objects of piety. In Brussels, Belgium, and Vitoria, Spain, new schools were opened. When World War I broke out, about half of the French members were drafted,; 29 of them were killed in battle. The time period corresponded with the disappearance of the French influence upon the Congregation. By 1907-1908, the number of North American members was greater than the number of European members. ===1920s-1960s=== From the 1920s until the 1960s, the number of Canadian members grew steadily and eventually constituted two-thirds of the Congregation's membership (1,146 out of 1,760 in the year 1960). Several classical secondary schools were set up, including in Joliette and Rigaud, as well as specialized institutions for the hearing impaired in Montreal and Quebec and for the blind in Montreal. This resulted in members moving east toward the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River, north toward the regions of Abitibi and T√©miscamingue, and west toward the Province of Manitoba. Several members, in 1931, went abroad to found a school in Manchuria. Also in 1931, the Brothers of Our Lady of the Fields was merged into the Clerics of Saint Viator. The Canadian Province was divided up, for a first time in 1938 (Montreal and Joliette) and for a second time in 1955 (Abitibi and Saint Lawrence). Over the years, Canadian members introduced the Congregation to Japan (1948), Taiwan (1953), Peru (1959), and Haiti (1965). In 1928 members of the Chicago Province petitioned for beatification of the organization's founder, Louis Querbes. [nyshistoricnewspapers.org/lccn/np00020005/1928-09-28/ed-1/seq-1.pdf \\"Clerics of St. Viator seek beatification of Fr. Querbes, founder\\"]. The Catholic Journal, September 28, 1928. The Great Depression took a toll on the Province; Viator College was unable meets its financial obligations and closed in 1938. Members of the Province of Chicago served in large educational institutions, universities, chaplaincies, and parishes. The Chicago Province founded a school in Bogot√°, Colombia, in 1961. A church is set up in Las Vegas, Nevada, where the Clerics taught at a newly opened high school.\\"Viatorians celebrate 50 years in valley\\". Las Vegas Sun, Sept. 17, 2005 The French provinces re-organized themselves gradually over time; their apostolic commitments remained unchanged. The became involved with parishes and collaborated with the diocesan clergy. In 1955, French members founded a school in Bouak√©, Ivory Coast. The Clerics moved into Spain, slowly at first but more solidly after 1920. In spite of the interruptions caused by the Civil War (1936-1939), the local communities in Spain formed a vice-province in 1937; ten years later, they became a full-fledged province. Starting in 1957, Spain founded several establishments in Chile. ===1960s-1970s=== Vatican Council II brought renewed emphasis on the questions and challenges that were present everywhere in the late 1960s. Problems within institutions and communities led many members to leave the Clerics of Saint Viator. Reflections that began at the 1969 and 1972 General Chapters resulted in the drafting of a renewed Constitution (1978) that refocused the organization on its mission and the religious life of the Clerics of Saint Viator. During the renewal process, the congregation decided to accept lay associates, both men and women, into the community. This had been part of Father Louis Querbes' original concept. The degree to which non-clerics participate varies among the local communities. ===2000s=== In 2010 and 2011, the Clerics organized and hosted a Youth Congress in Arlington Heights, Illinois. In 2012, a number of former students of the Montreal Institute for the Deaf operated by the Viatorians in Montreal Canada made public claims of sexual abuse by priests at the Institute. In 2016, the Viatorian operators of the institute, the Clerics of St Viateur, agreed to a $30 million (CAD) payment to settle the claims. The settlement was the largest settlement ever awarded for a sexual abuse case in Quebec history. As of 2018 the Clerics of St. Viator continue to provide education and shelter for youth.\\"Homes offer safety for young asylum seekers\\".

The film stars Joan Bennett and was produced by her husband Walter Wanger. The black- and-white film noir drama is about a woman who suspects her new husband, an architect, plans to kill her. ==Plot== The behavior of Mark Lamphere, an architect, turns strange shortly after his honeymoon with bride Celia, who begins finding out that Mark has many secrets. It turns out he was married before, his wife died suspiciously and they have a son. He also has a fiercely loyal secretary, Miss Robey, whose face is disfigured. Mark appears to be somewhat delusional and could be intending to murder Celia inside a room he keeps locked. The disturbed Miss Robey ends up setting fire to the house, whereupon Mark redeems himself in Celia's eyes by saving her life. ==Cast== * Joan Bennett as Celia Lamphere * Michael Redgrave as Mark Lamphere * Anne Revere as Caroline Lamphere * Barbara O'Neil as Miss Robey * Natalie Schafer as Edith Potter * Paul Cavanagh as Rick Barrett * Anabel Shaw as Intellectual Sub-Deb *Rosa Rey as Paquita * James Seay as Bob Dwight * Mark Dennis as David Lamphere ==Release== The film recorded a loss of $1,145,000.

When the film was first released, film critic Bosley Crowther, gave the film a mixed review, writing, \\"If you want to be tough about it‚Äîokay, it's a pretty silly yarn and it is played in a manner no less fatuous by the sundry members of the cast. But Mr. Lang is still a director who knows how to turn the obvious, such as locked doors and silent chambers and roving spotlights, into strangely tingling stuff. And that's why, for all its psycho-nonsense, this film has some mildly creepy spots and some occasional faint resemblance to Rebecca which it was obviously aimed to imitate.\\"Crowther, Bosley.

The species is endemic to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Six subspecies are currently recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here. ==Description== Rena humilis, like most species in the family Leptotyphlopidae, resembles a long earthworm. It lives underground in burrows, and since it has no use for vision, its eyes are mostly vestigial. The western blind snake is pink, purple, or silvery-brown in color, shiny, wormlike, cylindrical, blunt at both ends, and has light-detecting black eyespots. The skull is thick to permit burrowing, and it has a spine at the end of its tail that it uses for leverage. It is usually less than in total length (tail included), and is as thin as an earthworm. This species and other blind snakes are fluorescent under low frequency ultraviolet light (black light).Hulse AC (1971). \\"Fluoresence in Leptotyphlops humilis (Serpentes: Leptotyphlopidae)\\".

Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification. New York: Golden Press. 240 pp. . (Leptotyphlops humilis, pp. 136-137). ==Common names== Common names for R. humilis include western slender blind snake, western threadsnake, and western blind snake. ==Geographic range== R. humilis is found in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. In the US it ranges from southwestern and Trans-Pecos Texas west through southern and central Arizona, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah, and southern California. In Mexico its distribution includes the Mexican states of Baja California, Sonora, Sinaloa, Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, Chihuahua, Durango, Coahuila, Tamaulipas, and San Luis Potos√≠. The type locality given is \\"Valliecitas, Cal.\\" The type locality was restricted by Klauber (1931) to \\"vicinity of Vallecito, eastern San Diego County, California,\\" and by Brattstrom (1953) to \\"the Upper Sonoran Life Zone of the Vallecito area\\". ==Habitat and diet== Rena humilis lives underground, sometimes as deep as , and is known to invade ant and termite nests. Its diet is made up mostly of insects and their larvae and eggs. It is found in deserts and scrub where the soil is loose enough to work. ==Subspecies== {cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 border=1 style=\\"border-collapse: collapse;\\" !bgcolor=\\"#f0f0f0\\"Subspecies !bgcolor=\\"#f0f0f0\\"Authority !bgcolor=\\"#f0f0f0\\"Common name !bgcolor=\\"#f0f0f0\\"Geographic range - R. h. cahuilae Klauber, 1931 Desert blind snake  - R. h. humilis (Baird & Girard, 1853) Southwestern blind snake  - R. h. levitoni Murphy, 1975   - R. h. lindsayi Murphy, 1975   - R. h. tenuiculus (Garman, 1884)   - R. h. utahensis V.Tanner, 1938 Utah blind snake  - } ==References== ==Further reading== *Adalsteinsson SA, Branch WR, Trape S, Vitt LJ, Hedges SB (2009). \\"Molecular phylogeny, classification, and biogeography of snakes of the Family Leptotyphlopidae (Reptilia, Squamata)\\".

The rotor has typically not a winding but just straight connections in axial direction between the slip-rings (e.g. a copper tube encasing the rotor or rods embedded in the rotor). The field is uniformly perpendicular to the cylindrical rotor surface and does not change polarity over the 360-degree perimeter of the cylindrical part of the rotor. That means if the field is considered entering the rotor between the slip-rings it must leave the rotor though the rotor's end surfaces. It is not important that the magnetic field is generated from the stator; a similar field may be generated from the rotor with the same effect (the magnetic fields would not rotate with the rotor). Unipolar motors and generators are rarely built any more because of advancing technology. The voltage between the rotor connections (slip-rings) is normally low and the current then must be high to generate significant power. Current in the kiloampere range was applied for larger motors. The device also works in reverse as a generator if driven. It is useful for generating very large currents at low voltage. It does not appear to comply with a simple interpretation of Maxwell's equations in the sense that the magnetic field does not at any point pass through any closed winding to generate an electromagnetic effect. ==Other definition== DC motor A unipolar motor is also a type of small DC electric motor commonly found in small, portable cassette players. In this case, the 'unipolar' property refers to its winding that does not need to change current direction and therefore can be driven by a simple transistor (e.g. IGBT). It is also used in stepper motors.Physical Computing: Sensing and Controlling the Physical World with Computers, Dan O'Sullivan & Tom Igoe.

Without his hat he was completely bald. In the early cartoons he was moderately stout, but in the later ones he became increasingly portly. He often smoked a short cigar. The first panel of each strip generally had someone inconveniencing or annoying True, an innocent bystander or an animal. In the second panel he would then make an ill-tempered outburst. In early cartoons this was usually an uninhibited rant which expressed what other people wanted to say, but were too polite to. Sometimes it was accompanied by comments from bystanders in speech-bubbles (\\"that's the way I like to hear a man talk\\"; \\"I wish I could hand out one like that\\"). Later cartoons were more slapstick in character. True would exact his revenge by either berating or (if confronting a man) pummelling the offender. The only character who occasionally turned the tables on True was his wife, who appeared occasionally to berate or beat him for some unacceptable behavior. ==Adaptations== The American Bioscope Company made a series of silent short movies featuring Everett True, the first of which, Everett True Breaks Into The Movies, was released in 1916, starring Robert Bolder as Everett and Paula Reinbold as Mrs True. ==References== ==External links== * Barnacle Press: Outbursts of Everett True * The Outbursts of Everett True at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

It tells the story of a heroic effort to salvage a sunken ship, the titular Mary Ellen Carter, by some members of her crew. ==Original version== The song chronicles the efforts to salvage the ship, implying that it will be raised on the following day: The song ends with an inspirational message to people \\"to whom adversity has dealt the final blow\\": Never give up, and, \\"like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again!\\" The song appears on three of Rogers' albums: * Between the Breaks...Live! * Home In Halifax * The Very Best of Stan Rogers == Cover versions == The song has become a classic of the genre and many artists covered it even before Rogers' death, including Jim Post who began performing it in the 1980s, as did Makem and Clancy, and the English a cappella trio, Artisan, who went on to popularise their harmony version of it in UK folk circles throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and Portland, Maine‚Äìbased folk group Schooner Fare. Ian Robb recorded it with the other members of Finest Kind on his album From Different Angels. It was recorded by the seven piece Newfoundland band The Irish Descendants as part of the tribute album Remembering Stan Rogers: An East Coast Tribute, performed by a large number of acts at Rogers' favorite venue in Halifax, Dalhousie University. It was recorded by Williamsburg, Virginia‚Äìbased Celtic rock band Coyote Run as part of their self-titled Coyote Run album. According to liner notes with their 10 Years and Running retrospective album, Coyote Run's recording of the song was done with the same 12-string guitar that Stan Rogers himself had used when recording the song.

The worst storm in forty years blew up that night and the ship sank at about four o'clock in the morning on February 13. The ship's chief mate, 59-year-old Robert M. \\"Bob\\" Cusick, was trapped under the deckhouse as the ship went down. His snorkeling experience helped him avoid panic and swim to the surface, but he had to spend the night alone, up to his neck in water, clinging to a partially deflated lifeboat, and in water barely above freezing and air much colder. Huge waves washed over him, and each time he was not sure that he would ever reach the surface again to breathe. Battling hypothermia, he was tempted to allow himself to fall unconscious and let go of the lifeboat. Just then he remembered the concluding stanzas of \\"The Mary Ellen Carter\\". He started to sing it and soon was alternately shouting out \\"Rise again, rise again\\" and holding his breath as the waves washed over him. At seven o'clock that morning a Coast Guard helicopter spotted him and pulled him to safety. Only three men of the thirty-three who had been aboard survived the wreck. After his ordeal, Cusick wrote a letter to Stan Rogers telling him what had happened and how the song helped save his life. In response, Cusick was invited to attend what turned out to be the second-to-last concert Rogers ever performed. Cusick told his story in the documentary about Rogers, One Warm Line. ==Published versions== * Rise Up Singing pp. 203‚Äì204 ==References== * \\"June 2, 1983: Dundas singer-songwriter Stan Rogers dies in airline disaster\\" * , story of the wreck of the Marine Electric by Bob Cusick (via the Internet Archive) == External links == * Category:1979 songs Category:Maritime music Category:Songs about boats Category:Stan Rogers songs ","title":"The Mary Ellen Carter"},{"id":"2557958","text":"The Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature winners in the year 1981 (rank/prize, title of winning entry, name of author). __NOTOC__ ==English Division== Novel *Grand Prizes (Co-Winners): \\"Mass\\" by F.

The project for this book began in 1970 when Bruce Lee suffered a back injury during one of his practice sessions. During this time he could not train in martial arts. He was ordered by his doctors to wear a back brace for 6 months in order to recover from his injury. This was a very tiring and dispiriting time for Lee who was always very physically active. It was during his convalescence that he decided to compile a treatise on the system or approach to martial arts that he was developing; he called it Jeet Kune Do. The bulk of these writings would become the \\"core set of writings\\". Many of these writings were done during a single session which provided natural continuity. Lee had also kept various notes throughout the development of his combat philosophy and these would become the disparate notes used in the book. Many of these notes were \\"sudden inspirations\\" which were incomplete and lacked any kind of a construct. The combination of the \\"core set of writings\\" and the \\"disparate notes\\" would be known as the text Tao of Jeet Kune Do. In 1971, it was Lee's intent to finish the treatise that he started during his convalescence. However, his film career and work prevented him from doing so. He also vacillated about publishing his book as he felt that this work might be used for the wrong purposes. Lee's intent in writing the book was to record one man's way of thinking about the martial arts. It was to be a guidebook not a set of instructions or \\"How to\\" manual to learn martial arts. In 1975, after Bruce Lee's death, his widow Linda Lee Cadwell decided to make available the information her husband had collected. Lee's untimely death changed the perspective of releasing the information that Bruce Lee had vacillated about. The \\"core writings\\" and various notes were put together in a logical fashion by various editors. The main editor was Gilbert L. Johnson. Johnson along with Linda Lee, Dan Inosanto and other students of Bruce Lee helped him understand Jeet Kune Do well enough to editorialize and organize Lee's material into text. The book is dedicated to: The Free, Creative Martial Artist. Lee's wife, Linda Lee Cadwell holds the copyright to the book. The book is attributed to Bruce Lee as his notes and work were used to compile the book. Although Lee's material was utilized, it was not organized by him; therefore Bruce Lee was not strictly its author. ==Bruce Lee's autobiography== Tao of Jeet Kune Do was compiled posthumously from Bruce Lee's personal notes, some of which were in turn copied from Bruce Lee's personal library of martial arts and philosophical books. Ohara Publications has acknowledged Edwin Haislet, Hugo and James Castello, Roger Crosnier and Julio Castello as original sources. After the book's initial publication, additional passages were discovered to have been sourced from the works of D.T. Suzuki, Eric Hoffer, and other authors. Many of Bruce Lee's statements are derived from his own studies of various schools of philosophy and the martial arts, and are sometimes paraphrases of previous expressions by others which he wrote down for his own instruction into his own words. ==1975 1st edition== Cover of the 2006 Limited Edition Collector's Edition book with certificate of authenticity. In 1975 the Tao of Jeet Kune Do was first made available only in paperback. The book was first made available in hardback in 1976. Subsequent editions have been available in paperback form only except for the following; In 2006, Black Belt Magazine offered this book in hardback form, on a 500-copy Limited Collector's Edition; the book is personally signed by Bruce Lee's widow Linda Lee Cadwell and his daughter Shannon Lee. Copies of the hardback edition from such sources as eBay typically fetch high prices and usually do not include the much sought after dust jacket. ==See also== * Jeet Kune Do * Bruce Lee's Fighting Method * Bruce Lee Library * Chinese Gung Fu: The Philosophical Art of Self-Defense ==References== == External links == * Tao of Jeet Kune Do archived on the Internet Archive * Be Water, My Friend - Bruce Lee Category:1975 non-fiction books Category:Books by Bruce Lee Category:Jeet Kune Do Category:Philosophy books Category:Martial arts manuals ","title":"Tao of Jeet Kune Do"},{"id":"2557966","text":"Lobgesang (Hymn of Praise), Op. 52 (MWV A 18), is a 13-movement \\"Symphony- Cantata on Words of the Holy Bible for Soloists, Choir and Orchestra\\" by Felix Mendelssohn. After the composer's death it was published as his Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, a naming and a numbering that are not his. The required soloists are two sopranos and a tenor. An organ is needed too. The work lasts almost twice as long as any of Mendelssohn's purely instrumental symphonies. ==History== It was composed in 1840, along with the less-known Festgesang \\"Gutenberg Cantata\\", to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the invention of Johannes Gutenberg's movable type printing system. In 1842 Mendelssohn had published his Scottish Symphony as \\"Symphony No. 3\\", however a \\"Symphony No. 2\\" had never been published during Mendelssohn's lifetime. Possibly the composer's intention was to spare this number for his earlier Italian Symphony, which he premiered in 1833, but afterwards withheld for a revision that was never completed. The Italian Symphony was published posthumously as \\"Symphony No. 4\\". Decades after Mendelssohn's death, the editors of the old Mendelssohn complete edition entered Lobgesang as \\"No. 2\\" in the sequence of this symphonies for editorial reasons. However, there is no indication that this represented the composer's intentions. The new Mendelssohn- Werkverzeichnis (MWV), published in 2009 by the Saxonian Academy of Sciences and Humanities, no longer lists Lobgesang among the symphonies, but rather among the sacred vocal works.Grouping and overview of MWV numbers ==Structure== Structurally, it consists of three purely orchestral movements followed by 10Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, Lobgesang: eine Symphonie-Cantate nach Worten der heiligen Schrift; op. 52, p. 198-223. movements for chorus and/or soloists and orchestra, and lasts approximately 65‚Äì70 minutes in total. The English titles of the movements are: # Sinfonia: ## Maestoso con moto - Allegro ## Allegretto un poco agitato ## Adagio religioso # All men, all things, all that have life and breath (Chorus) # Praise thou the Lord, O ye Spirit (Soprano Solo and Semi-Chorus) # Sing ye Praise (Tenor Recitative and Aria) # All ye that cried unto the Lord (Chorus) # I waited for the Lord (Soprano Duet and Chorus) # The sorrows of Death (Tenor Aria) # The Night is Departing (Chorus) # Let all men praise the Lord (Chorale of Now Thank We All Our God) # My song shall be always Thy Mercy (Soprano and Tenor Duet) # Ye nations, offer to the Lord (Chorus) The now-standard harmonisation of Now Thank We All Our God was devised by Felix Mendelssohn in 1840 when he adopted the hymn, sung in the now-standard key of F major and with its original German lyrics, as the chorale to Lobgesang. ==Instrumentation== The symphony is scored for two sopranos, tenor, chorus, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, timpani, organ and strings. ==Text== 1\\\\.

The syndrome includes flushing and diarrhea, and less frequently, heart failure, vomiting and bronchoconstriction. It is caused by endogenous secretion of mainly serotonin and kallikrein. ==Signs and symptoms== Presentation of the carcinoid syndrome.Table 15-14 in: The carcinoid syndrome occurs in approximately 5% of carcinoid tumors and becomes manifest when vasoactive substances from the tumors enter the systemic circulation escaping hepatic degradation. If the primary tumor is from the gastrointestinal tract (hence releasing serotonin into the hepatic portal circulation), carcinoid syndrome generally does not occur until the disease is so advanced that it overwhelms the liver's ability to metabolize the released serotonin. * Flushing: The most important clinical finding is flushing of the skin, usually of the head and the upper part of thorax.E.Goljan, Pathology, 2nd ed Mosby Elsevier, Rapid Review series. * Diarrhea: It may be associated with abdominal cramping. This symptom is due to the action of serotonin, histamine, and gastrin * Abdominal pain: It is due to hepatomegaly, small bowel obstruction or lack of oxygen to small bowel. * Bronchoconstriction, which may be histamine or serotonin-induced, affects about 15% of those having carcinoid syndrome and often accompanies flushing, sneezing, and shortness of breath. * Carcinoid heart disease: About 19% to 60% of the those affected by carcinoid syndrome develops carcinoid heart disease. Serotonin induces fibrosis in valves of the right heart especially tricuspid valve. == Pathophysiology == Carcinoid tumors produce several vasoactive substances, most prominently serotonin. It is commonly thought that serotonin is the cause of the flushing, but this is only partially correct.Papaliodis, Dean, et al. \\"Niacin-induced ‚Äúflush‚Äù involves release of prostaglandin D2 from mast cells and serotonin from platelets: evidence from human cells in vitro and an animal model.\\" Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 327.3 (2008): 665-672. The flushing also results from secretion of kallikrein, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of kininogen to lysyl-bradykinin. The latter is further converted to bradykinin, one of the most powerful vasodilators known. Other components of the carcinoid syndrome are diarrhea (probably caused by the increased serotonin, which greatly increases peristalsis, leaving less time for fluid absorption), a pellagra-like syndrome (probably caused by diversion of large amounts of tryptophan from synthesis of the vitamin B3 niacin, which is needed for NAD production, to the synthesis of serotonin and other 5-hydroxyindoles), fibrotic lesions of the endocardium, particularly on the right side of the heart resulting in insufficiency of the tricuspid valve and, less frequently, the pulmonary valve and, uncommonly, bronchoconstriction. The pathogenesis of the cardiac lesions and the bronchoconstriction is unknown, but the former probably involves activation of serotonin 5-HT2B receptors by serotonin. When the primary tumor is in the gastrointestinal tract, as it is in the great majority of cases, the serotonin and kallikrein are inactivated in the liver; manifestations of carcinoid syndrome do not occur until there are metastases to the liver or when the cancer is accompanied by liver failure (cirrhosis). Carcinoid tumors arising in the bronchi may be associated with manifestations of carcinoid syndrome without liver metastases because their biologically active products reach the systemic circulation before passing through the liver and being metabolized. In most patients, there is an increased urinary excretion of 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid), a degradation product of serotonin. The biology of these tumors differs from many other tumor types. Ongoing research on the biology of these tumors may reveal new mechanisms for tumor development. == Diagnosis == With a certain degree of clinical suspicion, the most useful initial test is the 24-hour urine levels of 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid), the end product of serotonin metabolism. Patients with carcinoid syndrome usually excrete more than 25 mg of 5-HIAA per day. ===Imaging=== For localization of both primary lesions and metastasis, the initial imaging method is Octreoscan, where indium-111 labelled somatostatin analogues (octreotide) are used in scintigraphy for detecting tumors expressing somatostatin receptors. Median detection rates with octreoscan are about 89%, in contrast to other imaging techniques such as CT scan and MRI with detection rates of about 80%. Gallium-68 labelled somatostatin analogues such as 68Ga- DOTA-Octreotate (DOTATATE), performed on a PET/CT scanner is superior to conventional Octreoscan. Usually, on a CT scan, a spider-like/crab-like change is visible in the mesentery due to the fibrosis from the release of serotonin. 18F-FDG PET/CT, which evaluate for increased metabolism of glucose, may also aid in localizing the carcinoid lesion or evaluating for metastases. Chromogranin A and platelets serotonin are increased. Transthoracic echocardiogram shows valve thickening and reduction in mobility of the valves. Cardiac MRI is useful in showing ventricular anatomy and function. === Localization of tumour === Tumour localization may be extremely difficult. Barium swallow and follow-up examination of the intestine may occasionally show the tumor. Capsule video endoscopy has recently been used to localize the tumor. Often laparotomy is the definitive way to localize the tumour. Another form of localizing a tumor is the Octreoscan. A tracer agent of Indium 111 is injected into a vein where then the tumors absorb the radionuclide Indium 111 and become visible on the scanner. Only the tumors absorb the somatostatin agent Indium 111 making the scan highly effective. Primary site of a carcinoid cancer of gut; secondaries are also visible on the mesentery == Treatment == For symptomatic relief of carcinoid syndrome: * Octreotide (a somatostatin analogue which decreases the secretion of serotonin by the tumor and, secondarily, decreases the breakdown product of serotonin (5-HIAA)) * Telotristat ethyl (Xermelo) along with a somatostatin analogue in patients not responding to somatostatin analogue monotherapy. It is a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor and reduces the production of serotonin. * Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with lutetium-177, yttrium-90 or indium-111 labeled to octreotate is highly effective * Methysergide maleate (antiserotonin agent but not used because of the serious side effect of retroperitoneal fibrosis) * Cyproheptadine (an antihistamine drug with antiserotonergic effects) Alternative treatment for qualifying candidates: *Surgical resection of tumor and chemotherapy (5-FU and doxorubicin) *Endovascular, chemoembolization, targeted chemotherapy directly delivered to the liver through special catheters mixed with embolic beads (particles that block blood vessels), used for patients with liver metastases. === Uncertainties === Disease progression is difficult to ascertain because the disease can metastasize anywhere in the body and can be too small to identify with any current technology. Markers of the condition such as chromogranin-A are imperfect indicators of disease progression. == Prognosis == Prognosis varies from individual to individual. It ranges from a 95% 5-year survival for localized disease to an 80% 5-year survival for those with liver metastases. The average survival time from the start of octreotide treatment has increased to about 12 years. == See also == * Carcinoid * Neuroendocrine tumor * Small intestine neuroendocrine tumor * Kulchitsky cells * Apudoma * Serotonin Syndrome == References == ==Further reading== * * ==External links== Category:Paraneoplastic syndromes Category:Syndromes affecting the gastrointestinal tract ","title":"Carcinoid syndrome"},{"id":"2557992","text":"Caleb Smith State Park Preserve is a state park located in Suffolk County, New York in the United States.

The first Five Guys restaurant opened in 1986 in Arlington County, Virginia, and by 2001, the chain had expanded to five locations throughout the Washington, D.C. metro area. In early 2003, the chain began franchising, beginning a period of rapid expansion. In a year and a half, permits had been sold for over 300 franchised locations. As of 2016, Five Guys had over 1,500 locations open worldwide, with 1,500 locations under development. The company was the fastest-growing fast food chain in the United States, with a 32.8% sales increase from 2010 to 2011. ==History== Five Guys was founded in 1986 by Janie and Jerry Murrell; Jerry and the couple's sons, Jim, Matt, Chad, and Ben, were the original \\"Five Guys.\\" The Murrells had a fifth son, Tyler, two years later. Today, all five sons, the current \\"Five Guys\\", are involved: Matt and Jim travel the country visiting stores, Chad oversees training, Ben selects the franchisees, and Tyler runs the bakery. The first Five Guys was in Arlington's Westmont Shopping Center. Buns were baked in the same center by Brenner's Bakery. This location closed, in favor of another in Alexandria, Virginia, at the intersection of King and North Beauregard Streets, which closed on September 21, 2013. Countries with Five Guys (2018) More followed in Old Town Alexandria and Springfield, Virginia, making five by 2001. Their success encouraged the Murrells to franchise their concept the following year, engaging Fransmart, a franchise sales organization. Former American football player Mark Moseley, who had gone to work for Fransmart after his football career, played a key role in Five Guys' expansion and went on to become the company's director of franchise development after it ended its business relationship with Fransmart. In early 2003, the chain began franchising, opening the doors to rapid expansion which caught the attention of national restaurant trade organizations and the national press. The expansion started in Virginia and Maryland, and by the end of 2004, over 300 units were in development through the Northeast. Over the next few years, the chain rapidly expanded across the entire United States and into Canada, reaching over 1,000 locations by 2012. The first location outside North America opened in the United Kingdom in July 2013, in London on Long Acre in Covent Garden. The chain now has 113 restaurants open across the UK. Five Guys also has locations in the Middle East and has continued to expand in Europe. In late 2017, Five Guys opened its first restaurants in Germany, one in Frankfurt and one in Essen. Five Guys Enterprises has several affiliated companies that are not part of a consolidated group, but are under common ownership. Five Guys Operations was founded in 2012, and as of 2016, had an estimated $12.3 million in yearly revenue and approximately 259 employees. Five Guys Holdings was founded in 2007. Five Guys Foods UK Limited was incorporated on March 12, 2013. FGE International, FGO International BV, and FG Co√∂peratief U.A. are based in Amsterdam. FGH International C.V. is located in Bermuda. The company has a 39,900 square foot headquarters in Lorton, Virginia, overlooking the Occoquan and Potomac Rivers, that was specially designed to convey the corporate brand. According to the architect, \\"The lobby mimics the typical Five Guys restaurant with red and white tile, tall tables, Freestyle Coke machine and signature peanut boxes.\\" In 2020 the first Five Guys location with a drive-through window opened in Surfside Beach, South Carolina. The franchisee retained it from the former business in the building in light of COVID-19 pandemic safe practices. == Menu == A Five Guys restaurant in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Orchard, Singapore. The Five Guys menu is centered on customisable hamburgers offered with Kraft American cheese or applewood- smoked bacon, customisable kosher style hot dogs (Hebrew National all-beef franks), grilled cheese and vegetable sandwiches. Five Guys uses buns that are sweeter and \\"eggier\\" than normal buns. The hamburgers come in two sizes: regular and little. The regular comes with 2 patties and the little comes with 1 patty. Fresh-cut French fries are the sole side item, available salted only in \\"Five Guys style\\" or seasoned \\"Cajun style\\". The customer is also allowed to customise their burger with up to 15 free toppings. In the UK they consist of: Mayo, Lettuce, Pickles, Tomatoes, Grilled Onions, Grilled Mushrooms, Ketchup, Mustard, Relish, Onions, Jalape√±o Peppers, Green Peppers, HP Sauce, Bar-B-Q Sauce and Hot Sauce. Complimentary roasted in-shell peanuts are offered for on-site consumption at most locations, with signage alerting potential customers who may have a peanut allergy. Customers are not allowed to take peanuts outside the restaurant. For dessert, the chain sells milkshakes available with 10 different mix-ins. Customers can mix and match multiple flavors, and even add bacon to the shake. These mix-ins are: Vanilla, Peanut Butter, Malted Milk, Salted Caramel, Cherry, Banana, Oreo Cookie Pieces and Coffee. The company experimented with offering coffee, but this was discontinued due to quality concerns. Like other breakfast items, such as the BLT sandwich and bacon, egg and cheese sandwich, coffee is currently only offered in Five Guys's airport locations and its location near McPherson Square station. ==Restaurants== A Five Guys bacon cheeseburger. Bags of potatoes are sometimes stacked in customer spaces due to an occasional lack of storage space, or, in some franchises, for aesthetic reasons. Restaurants are decorated with white and red checkered tile throughout and generally use wooden tables along with counter-high level seating. ==Reception== Barack Obama orders lunch at Five Guys in Washington, D.C., 2009. Five Guys has received numerous awards in D.C. area publications, including \\"Number 1 Burger\\" by Washingtonian Magazine for seven years. Former US President Barack Obama is reportedly a fan, buying lunch for himself and his colleagues at the Washington Five Guys branch in 2011. Since franchising, it has also received awards in other cities. The chain has something of a cult following and remarkable brand loyalty. Five Guys has been rated one of the most talked- about burger brands online. As Five Guys continues to expand into the US West Coast, comparisons have been made with In-N-Out Burger, another generally similar fast food chain. Comparing the two chains in 2011, the Los Angeles Times noted that Five Guys' menu items are generally more expensive than In-N- Out's, they lack drive-throughs that In-N-Out is famous for, and are most often found inside shopping malls. The newspaper still conceded that by pricing its products higher, offering bigger burgers and building larger dining rooms, Five Guys could capitalize on the recent trend of mid-level places that offer more expensive products than fast food but cheaper than fancy restaurants. In 2011, Five Guys was ranked first in \\"Fast Food - Large Chains\\" and \\"Best Burger\\" in Zagat's annual Fast Food Survey. In 2012, Market Force Information, Inc. polled 7,600 fast-food consumers, and Five Guys ranked No. 1 in food quality and taste, service, cleanliness, and atmosphere. In 2016, Five Guys was ranked first in the burger, steak, chicken and grill category of a Market Force UK survey. ==References== ==External links== * Five Guys US * Five Guys UK Category:Restaurants established in 1986 Category:Fast- food hamburger restaurants Category:Fast-food chains of the United States Category:Fast-food franchises Category:Restaurants in Virginia Category:1986 establishments in Virginia Category:Fast casual restaurants Category:Restaurant chains in the United States ","title":"Five Guys"},{"id":"2558015","text":"Higginsville is an unincorporated community in Hampshire County, West Virginia, United States.

It combines the G series of modules previously published in 1978: Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl, and Hall of the Fire Giant King. All three were produced for use with the 1st edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules. In 1999, to recognize the 25th anniversary of TSR, the company released an updated version, Against the Giants: The Liberation of Geoff. Later in 1999, Wizards of the Coast published a novelization of Against the Giants by Ru Emerson. The plot of each of the three original modules focuses on a particular type of evil giant. Each can be played as a standalone adventure, or as a series. In Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, a tribe of hill giants have been raiding lands occupied by humans, and the humans hire the player characters to defeat them. Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl pits the player characters against the evil Jarl of the frost giants. Hall of the Fire Giant King concludes the series, this time against a group of fire giants. The first two modules disclose the existence of a secret force behind the giants, which in the third module is revealed to be evil drow elves. The plot involving the drow continues in four additional modules printed between 1978 and 1980. The modules were well received by contemporary critics. In 1978, they earned a 9/10 overall rating from a White Dwarf magazine reviewer, who was impressed that Gygax found time to write them while also working on the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D;) rulebooks. White Dwarf also reviewed the re-released G module series in 1982, giving it a 10 out of 10. The Queen of the Spiders supermodule, which consisted of the three modules combined with the subsequent modules in the \\"D\\" series and Q1 Queen of the Demonweb Pits, was voted the single greatest adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004, on the 30th anniversary of the Dungeons & Dragons game. ==Plot summary== Each of the original three modules is a dungeon crawl. The player characters focus on battling hill giants, frost giants, and fire giants, three of the original evil giant types used in Dungeons & Dragons. ===G1 Steading of the Hill Giant Chief=== The module begins with a prologue explaining that giants of different types have been raiding lands occupied by humans. Angered by this, the human rulers hire a group of adventurers (the player characters) to \\"punish the miscreant giants.\\" The players' party is informed that they must defeat the giants, or have their heads placed on the chopping block. The human nobles equip the party with weapons and horses, along with a guide and a map that shows the location of the hill giants. The players are informed that the hill giants are led by Nosnra, a sly hill giant chieftain who loves to set up ambushes; there is an unknown force binding together different giant groups. The player characters are informed that they may keep any spoils they find, but must return at once if they determine what \\"sinister hand\\" is behind the alliance. The bulk of the adventure takes place in two locations: the upper level fortress of the hill giants' lair, and the dungeon level beneath it. In the upper level there are halls, barracks and common rooms. These rooms house Chief Nosnra and other hill giants, ogres, and servants. The dungeon level consists of slave quarters, torture chambers, and caverns. These house troglodytes, bugbears, and carrion crawlers. The majority of the treasure can be found by searching the dungeons. The chief's treasure room contains a map of the glacial rift from Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl, and a magic chain that automatically transports the party there. ===G2 Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl=== This module starts in one of two ways. If the players have finished Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, they have been transported to the glacial rift via the magic chain. They will know that they are searching for some force behind the giant alliance. If the players are starting with Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl, then they have been hired by nobles to destroy the frost giants. Either way, a safe, hidden cave is easily found for a base of operations. As in Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, the bulk of this adventure takes place in two locations: an upper area consisting of caves and the rift floor, and a lower area consisting of natural caverns. In the upper area there are ice caves, barracks, and a dome of ice. These are inhabited by yeti, frost giants, ogres, and winter wolves. The dome of ice houses a remorhaz. In the lower area there are caverns that house the servants, serve as a prison, and contain the Jarl Grugnur and emissaries who have come to meet with him. The main inhabitants are frost giants and ogres. The prison contains an attractive storm giantess. There are also polar bears; pets of the jarl. After defeating the jarl, the adventurers have a chance to pull an iron lever which will transport them near to Snurre's hall from Hall of the Fire Giant King. ===G3 Hall of the Fire Giant King=== If this module is played as a continuation of the first two modules, the players know that they are searching for the force behind the giants' alliance; otherwise, they have been hired by nobles to destroy the fire giants. This module is twice as long as the previous two: sixteen pages instead of eight. Unlike the two previous modules where the giant's complex consists of two levels, the fire giant hall contains three levels. The giants live in a hot, smoky barren area made of rock; as in the previous module, the party is able to find a safe location for forays against the giants. The leader of the fire giants is King Snurre Iron Belly, and his hall is made of obsidian and natural caverns. The first (top) level includes the queen's rooms, barracks, and kennels. Creatures encountered here include fire giants, gnolls, and in the kennels, hell hounds. The second level is also made of obsidian rocks and natural caverns. It houses chambers of spiritual interest to the fire giants. There is a hall that houses the dead fire giant kings, and rooms for worship. There are also rooms that contain drow clerics. This is where the party learns that the drow are behind the giant alliance, led by Eclavdra, a high level drow fighter/cleric. The third level consists of natural caverns and contains a great treasure guarded by a red dragon. There are also more fire giants and drow; to exterminate the fire giants, the adventurers must penetrate deep into the active volcano where they live. If the DM wishes, there is a tunnel that leads deep into the earth; to the home of the drow. This allows the adventure to be continued in Descent into the Depths of the Earth. ==Publication history== Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl, and Hall of the Fire Giant King were written by Gary Gygax. In 1978, Steading of the Hill Giant Chief became the first adventure module published by TSR. Gygax wrote them to take a break between writing the original Monster Manual (1977) and Player's Handbook (1978). The covers for Steading and Hall featured drawings by David C. Sutherland III. David A. Trampier drew the Glacial Rift cover. Against the Giants's cover features a painting by Bill Willingham. Interior art was provided by David A. Trampier, Jeff Dee, David S. LaForce and Erol Otus. The \\"Giant\\" modules were set in the Greyhawk campaign setting, and formed the lead-in to an overall campaign that then continued on an odyssey into the Underdark. These adventures included the \\"Drow\\" series of modules, Descent into the Depths of the Earth, Shrine of the Kuo-Toa, and Vault of the Drow. The campaign finally culminated with module Queen of the Demonweb Pits. Steading and Glacial Rift were eight pages long, while Hall was 16 pages in length, and each featured an outer folder. The omnibus collection combination module Against the Giants was 32 pages long, and featured two outer folders. Against the Giants was revised and reprinted in the 128-page supermodule Queen of the Spiders in 1986 in combination with the three \\"Drow\\" series modules, and Queen of the Demonweb Pits. Hall of the Fire Giant King marked the first time that Dungeons & Dragons players encountered the drow; game statistics for the drow first appear in the module, although drow are mentioned in the 1977 edition of the Monster Manual.Gygax, Gary (1977,1978). Advanced D&D; Monster Manual. TSR. p.39. . At the time these modules were released, each Dungeons & Dragons module was marked with an alphanumeric code indicating the series to which it belonged. The earlier modules have module codes G1, G2, and G3 respectively, and the combined module's code is G1-3\\\\. The \\"G\\" in the module code represents the first letter in the word \\"giant\\". The Original TSR Product Codes for these 3 modules are 9016, 9017, and 9018 respectively. Released in 1999 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of TSR, Against the Giants: The Liberation of Geoff provided a set of adventuring materials that expanded on the original three modules. 1999 also featured a reprinting of the three modules made available in the Dungeons & Dragons Silver Anniversary Collector's Edition boxed set, with slight modifications to make it distinguishable from the original (for collecting purposes). The concepts and characters from Against the Giants have made appearances in other media. It was made into a novel of the same name by Ru Emerson for the Greyhawk Classics series. In May 2006, Wizards of the Coast's website released new versions of the maps for the Hill Giant Stronghold. In July 2006, they released new maps for the Fire Giant Hall. In 2004, Wizards of the Coast released a miniature figure of the eponymous King Snurre from Hall of the Fire Giant King, and in 2007, they released a large Frost Giant Jarl miniature inspired by Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl. In 2009, Wizards released the super-adventure Revenge of the Giants, an homage to Against the Giants, for the game's fourth edition. In 2012, Wizards re-released each module in Dungeon Magazine issues 197‚Äì200, updated for Fourth Edition by Chris Perkins, including a new fourth adventure, Warrens of the Stone Giant Thane. In 2017, Wizards re-released Against the Giants updated to 5th Edition rules as part of the Tales from the Yawning Portal collection. ==Reception== When combined as a single adventure with the rest of GDQ series, this module was voted the single greatest adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004, on the 30th anniversary of the Dungeons & Dragons game. According to Dungeon's editors, the drow remain popular villains in part because of their \\"exciting introduction\\" in the module. Judge Andy Collins felt the \\"hack-and-slash\\" classic was \\"packed with action\\" and has run the module more than any other. Judge John Rateliff said that Against the Giants was the module that showed gamers how to create a themed adventure with a mystery and clues that are periodically provided. Kurt Butterfield reviewed Hall of the Fire Giant King for The Space Gamer, commenting that \\"the scenario is well thought out and nicely detailed,\\" and includes \\"some intriguing special instructions given for deviously playing several of the intelligent inhabitants of the dungeon\\". Butterfield felt that the dungeon was not an easy challenge, especially with the strong and numerous monsters (such as the roughly eighty trolls on one level). In conclusion, he stated, \\"I advise all DMs who are looking for an exciting, worthwhile adventure for their players to pick this one up. You won't be disappointed.\\" Don Turnbull of White Dwarf magazine gave the three separate modules comprising the G-series 9/10 overall. Turnbull was impressed that Gygax was able to find time to write them while also creating AD&D;'s rules, saying \\"Things are really buzzing at TSR.\\" He felt the presentation of the modules was done well, with easily read maps, although he preferred the black and white maps of the first module to the blue and white maps of the later two. Turnbull found the module's level of detail to be an improvement over previous Dungeons & Dragons scenarios which gave the Dungeon Master (DM) too little information. The review declared the modules \\"very tough\\", stating that \\"the notes suggest nine characters or so, each of ninth level or better and each with two or three relevant magic items.\\" Turnbull commented on several points that he felt went unnoticed by the module's proofreader. The maps did not contain a scale, which he assumed was per square. It is unclear what triggers one of the traps in the first module. In the second module, an exit from map level one does not have an entrance marked on the second level map. Ultimately he found the errors minor, and easily fixed. Turnbull's most major criticism was that the adventure was aimed at parties of too high a level. Summing up, he said \\"No DM should be without them, for even if he never gets a chance to run them, they are a source of much excellent design quality.\\" Jim Bambra reviewed the re-released G module series very positively in issue 35 of White Dwarf magazine, awarding 10 out of 10. Bambra liked the reprinting of the modules, stating that \\"their printing under one cover has reduced the price at no detriment to the quality.\\" He noted that the original tournament characters are included, although they were not included in the original three separate modules, and that not all of them conform to the rules in the Players Handbook. Two spells were also added, which had been absent from the original modules. Bambra says that he \\"would suggest not playing these unless you have been playing for a few years, success depends more on player skill than on high character levels and DMing adventures of this level can be a nightmare unless you have had plenty of experience.\\" Anders Swenson also reviewed dungeon module G-1-2-3, for Chaosium's Different Worlds magazine. Swenson notes that the lower level of the hill giant steading \\"is a conventional underground dungeon, populated with slaves, guards, and the odd monsters\\", but that the relatively small space occupied by the revolting slaves seems unrealistic. Swenson also calls the well-constructed dungeon complex of the fire giants \\"a tough nut for the adventurers\\" as the giants are in a place constructed for defense; Swenson did feel that the scale of the map was too small. Swenson comments that the reprinting shows the progress TSR has made since these adventures were first published, such as how single products had become longer. Swenson does note that the individual room descriptions were lacking a consistent format, and that important monsters can become lost in the middle of a room's description. Swenson felt that, although the lower levels can degenerate into a random monster mix, the strong points of these adventures outweigh their flaws. Swenson concludes by stating that \\"Against the Giants is a solid adventure,\\" and that \\"this would be a worthwhile purchase\\". Dungeon Master for Dummies lists Steading of the Hill Giant Chief as one of the ten best classic adventures. Stephen Colbert, who played Dungeons & Dragons as a child, reminisced about these modules: \\"Those old \\"Giants\\" modules, those were tremendous. Those are some of my favorite memories: working my way through fire giant, frost giant, and storm giant castles.\\" Ken Denmead of Wired said the first module is a \\"pretty easy crash- and-grab,\\" the second contains \\"some really excellent treasure,\\" but the third is \\"the end-all, be-all of hack-fests\\". According to Denmead, the hill giant adventure does not prepare players for the later adventures. Describing the difficulty of battling the fire giants he said, \\"remember Bambi Versus Godzilla? You're Bambi\\". ==References== ==Further reading== * * ==External links== * * * Giants Series at the Acaeum.com * Against the Giants at the Pen & Paper RPG Database archive * Against the Giants: The Liberation of Geoff at the Pen & Paper RPG Database archive Category:1981 books Category:Greyhawk modules ","title":"Against the Giants"},{"id":"2558044","text":"Catherine Grace Gardner (born June 10, 1985 , in Waterbury, Connecticut) is an American actress.

After the intersection with I-195, Route 18 runs via surface streets parallel to Route 140 for a while, up to a connector road with Route 140 northbound. (Before its highway route was constructed, Route 140 followed County Road from Taunton until terminating at Route 18 in Freetown near the New Bedford line.) Route 18 then continues on a generally northerly direction. The highway goes through the East Freetown section of Freetown, Lakeville (with a three-mile (5 km) concurrency with Route 105 along Assawompset Pond), Middleborough, where the highway meets U.S. Route 44 and Route 28 at the Middleboro rotary just north of Interstate 495, beginning a six-mile (10 km) concurrency with Route 28 until the center of Bridgewater, East Bridgewater, Whitman, Abington, and Weymouth, ending at Route 53. ==History== The current routing of Route 18 was established in 1933 taking over what was the routing of Route 102 from Weymouth to Route 28 in Bridgewater (the remainder to Route 140 in Taunton became part of Route 104) running concurrently with Route 28 from Bridgewater to Middleboro, taking a new highway constructed in 1932 from Middleboro to Lakeville, running concurrently with Route 105 for a short distance before turning southwest and taking a route to end at Route 140 in Freetown. Around 1968 Route 18 arrived at its current terminus when extended further south along a highway parallel to Route 140 to end at U.S. 6. When first established in 1927, Route 18 ran on a different alignment from Route 123 in Rockland north to Route 3A in Hingham using Hingham Street in Rockland; Pond Street in Norwell; and Main, Short, Leavitt and East Streets in Hingham. In 1931 the Hingham portion became part of the circumferential Route 128 and the remaining parts in Norwell and Rockland had the Route 18 designation removed in 1932.Information from Massachusetts Road Maps of 1930, 1932, 1933 and 1968 downloaded from MassDOT's Historic Maps Gallery at http://massdot.maps.arcgis.com/apps/PublicGallery/index.html?appid=29085e10d60743cf9a37d62b5fe8b83d, downloaded 4/29/2016. ==Highway improvements== A major fault of Route 18 north of Bridgewater is its intersection patterns. At all lights north of Bridgewater center, the road widens to four lanes temporarily, before and after the intersection. While this helps alleviate backups at the lights and assists vehicles turning left off of the route, it creates bottlenecks after the intersection, where the two lanes re-merge into one. To improve this, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation's Highway Division will be widening the section of Route 18 from Highland Place in Weymouth to Route 139 in Abington from two to four lanes. The $26 million project was originally planned to begin in 2013, but had yet to break ground as of July 2014. ==Major intersections== ==References== * John F.

Location of the largest Seneca village of the 17th century, the site is in the present-day Town of Victor, southwest of the Village of Victor. The village was also referred to in various spellings as Gannagaro, Canagora, Gandagora, and Gandagaro. It consists of two areas: the Boughton Hill portion, the area of longhouses and burials, has been designated as a National Historic Landmark. It has been identified as the location of the Jesuit Mission of St. Jacques (or St. James), which was mentioned in the Jesuit Relations. The Fort Hill portion was the location of a fortified granary and consists of ; it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The complex is operated by the state of New York. ==History== ===Seneca traditions=== Trail of Peace Like many indigenous peoples, the Seneca cultivated the Three Sisters: staple crops of corn, beans, and squash. Women bred and cultivated different varieties of each staple, experimenting with a range of seeds. These crops were typically grown near each other, so that beans could climb the cornstalks, and the typically large leaves of squashes would prevent weeds from growing. Ganondagan was once the largest Seneca town; the Seneca nation was considered to occupy the western gateway of Haudenosaunee (Iroquois Confederacy) territory. This site is at the center of the story of the Peacemaker, who unified the five major peoples and created the Haudenosaunee confederacy. It survives to this day. Seneca oral tradition tells of a Huron man who arrived among the Mohawk speaking of the Gayanesshagowa (aka The Great Law of Peace). This prophet is known today as The Great Peacemaker. The Mohawk, Oneida, and Cayuga pledged to join his proposed confederation and, following a dramatic interlude, the Seneca agreed also. The discussion about how to bring in the Onondaga took place in the Ganondagan house of Jikonsase (or Jikonhsaseh), a Seneca woman elder now known as the \\"Mother of Nations.\\" She proposed a solution which eventually brought the Onondaga into the fold, for it gave them a prominent place in the confederacy. She lived in the vicinity of Ganondagan, and is buried nearby. Because of this tradition, the Seneca refer to Ganondagan as the \\"Town of Peace\\". They revere and protect the burial site of Jikonsase. The relation to their Great Law of Peace is more important than the attack that destroyed the village, for the people have carried forward their means of negotiating for solutions. Concepts of the confederacy may have influenced early American political thinkers, although they gathered similar ideas from English and European thinkers. ===Contact with Europeans=== In 1656, Jesuit Father Pierre- Joseph-Marie Chaumonot traveled from the Cayuga nation to the Seneca nation. Then, \\"Having assembled all the Elders of Gandagan, the principal village of Sonnontouan [the Seneca], and having bestowed the presents that are usually given as tokens of alliance, he commenced in a fervent and loud tone to explain the principal truths of the Gospel, which he sealed with the three finest presents of all, which he had reserved for this purpose.\\" By the close of 1668, the Jesuits had established a mission in each of the five Iroquois nations; the Seneca, and the Mission of St. Jacques, had been assigned to Father James Fremin. The Seneca finally forced the missionaries to leave in 1684, after rising tension with the French. In August 1669, Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and Father Ren√© de Br√©hant de Galin√©e, traveled to Ganondagan via Irondequoit. Galin√©e wrote: In 1677, Wentworth Greenhalgh, an English colonial government official, traveled to the Iroquois nations and secured them as allies for the British. One of his stops was at Ganondagan, which he referred to as Canagora and as Canagorah: Greenhalgh wrote that none of the Seneca towns were \\"stockadoed\\" (stockaded), and related the following incident: In 1678, Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and Father Louis Hennepin traveled to Ganondagan, which Hennepin called Tagorondies. Hennepin remarked on the presence of Jesuits Julien Garnier and Pierre Raffeix, and a \\"little Chapel made of Barks of Trees\\". About the inhabitants, he wrote: ===Destruction of Ganondagan=== On June 13, 1687, Marquis de Denonville led an army from Canada, which consisted of 832 colonial regulars, more than 900 Canadian militia, and some 400 Indian allies, to eliminate the Seneca as competitors in the international fur trade. The Seneca had been dealing with the English, and the French wanted to keep control of the lucrative fur trade. The conflict was part of what became known as the Beaver Wars, as the Iroquois also struggled to control their trade. Native American tribes fought each other, too, in trying to gain power in the fur trade. Denonville writes that on July 13, the French force, closing in on Ganondagan, were attacked by a Seneca force of 800, but after a short engagement \\"they soon resolved to fly.\\" Denonville described the French casualties as 5 or 6 killed and 20 wounded, while the Seneca casualties were 45 killed and 60 wounded. However, a British report, based on interviews of Seneca warriors, states that the Seneca force consisted of 450 people, including 350 boys, 100 men, and 5 women \\"who engaged as well as the men\\". The British report states that most of the villagers had been moved that day to Cajouge (Cayuga) and some to a lake to the south. \\"As soon as the women and children were fled, their fired their own Castles.\\" L'Abbe de Belmont wrote that the Seneca \\"came to reconnoiter us and then went to burn their village and take to flight.\\" Upon the French arrival at the village on the 14th, Denonville reports, \\"we found it burned\\" and a nearby fort abandoned. The French killed \\"a vast quantity of hogs\\", and, from the four Seneca villages they visited, destroyed 1.2 million bushels of stored and standing corn. The force turned west and destroyed the village of Totiakton (aka Tiotohatton or La Conception) before returning to their boats at Irondequoit.Published primary accounts of the French expedition include Jacques-Rene de Brisay de Nonville, \\"Narrative of the expedition of the Marquis de Nonville against the Senecas, in 1687,\\" trans.

Marshall, New York Historical Society Collections, 2d ser. 2, pt. 3 (1848): 149‚Äì92; and Louis-Henry de Baugy, \\"Journal du voyage de Monsier le Marquis de Denonville pour la guerre contre les Hyroquois, de l‚Äôann√©e 1687 le 23e may,\\" in Journal d‚Äôune exp√©dition contre les Iroquois en 1687.

After the battle, the community movement was checked by the disaster of the French invasion and turned eastward. The two villages of Gandagora and Gandougarae seem to have joined in this eastward movement and to have settled first at Canandaigua and later in the region east of Canandaigua Lake. During the American Revolutionary War, the Sullivan Expedition of 1779 attacked the Seneca in scattered towns at Geneva, Canandaigua and along Seneca Lake (New York) (see Kanadaseaga). ===Later use=== For more than a hundred years after the American Revolutionary War, the Seneca used this area for agriculture. In the 1930s, their chief Freeman Johnson began to work to preserve the property, as looters were stealing artifacts. In 1964 Boughton Hill was designated as a National Historic Landmark, and in 1987 the state historic park was established. The Seneca have made many contributions to the United States throughout its history. The political ideals which the Seneca had were contributed to the U.S. Constitution. The Seneca's matrilineal kinship system gave considerable power to women, as inheritance and property were passed through the maternal line. Children were considered born into their mother's family and clan, which determined their social status. In 1848 at Seneca Falls, New York, American women created a proclamation of rights to achieve similar power. They did not receive the vote until 1920. ===Today=== Longhouse under construction in 1997 Ganondagan, site of a major 17th-century Seneca village, has a reconstructed Seneca longhouse and a small visitors center. The original town site covered nine acres, with dwellings and stores, fields, and areas for livestock. This area was the location of nearly 150 longhouses, as well as the burial grounds of the people. The village was surrounded by extensive corn fields and a large, fortified granary was at the Fort Hill site. It was considered the \\"breadbasket\\" for the Haudenosaunee. The Seneca supplied many of the Iroquois with corn. The site includes miles of trails over more than 560 acres of property in the park. The Friends of Ganondagan have worked to preserve the Ganondagan land and Seneca cultural traditions. ==See also== *Albany Plan *Iroquois *List of New York State Historic Sites ==References== ==External links== *Friends of Ganondagan Category:Iroquois populated places Category:National Historic Landmarks in New York (state) Category:New York (state) historic sites Category:Seneca tribe Category:Archaeological sites in New York (state) Category:Museums in Ontario County, New York Category:Native American museums in New York (state) Category:Parks in Ontario County, New York Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ontario County, New York ","title":"Ganondagan State Historic Site"},{"id":"2558113","text":"Pyrrharctia isabella, the isabella tiger moth, banded woolly bear or just woollybear or woolly worm, occurs in the United States and southern Canada. The first European to describe it was James Edward Smith in 1797. == Appearance == The thirteen-segment larvae are usually covered with brown hair in their mid-regions and black hair in their anterior and posterior areas. In direct sunlight, the brown hair looks bright reddish brown. Adults are generally dull yellowish through orangish and have robust, scaly thorices; small heads; and bright reddish-orange forelegs. Wings have sparse black spotting. The isabella tiger moth can be found in many cold regions, including the Arctic. The banded woolly bear larva emerges from the egg in the fall and overwinters in its caterpillar form, when it literally freezes solid. First its heart stops beating, then its gut freezes, then its blood, followed by the rest of the body. It survives being frozen by producing a cryoprotectant in its tissues. In the spring it thaws. Larval setae do not inject venom and are not urticant; they do not typically cause irritation, injury, inflammation, or swelling. Handling larvae is discouraged, however, because their sharp, spiny hairs may cause dermatitis in some people. When disturbed, larvae defend themselves by playing possum (rolling up into balls and remaining motionless) and quickly crawling away.

Based on the caterpillars‚Äô wide range of food plants, this moth could be found almost anywhere that plants grow. == Related species == Singer et al showed that the larvae of a related moth, Grammia incorrupta (whose larvae are also called \\"woollybears\\"), consume alkaloid-laden leaves that help fight off internal parasitic fly larvae. This phenomenon is said to be \\"the first clear demonstration of self-medication among insects.\\" Within the same family, the larvae of the garden tiger moth (Arctia caja) are also known as woollybear caterpillars and consume an alkaloid diet similar to Grammia incorrupta. == In culture == === Folklore=== Canadian and U.S. folklore holds that the relative amounts of brown and black hair on a larva indicate the severity of the coming winter. It is believed that if a Pyrrharctia isabella brown band is wide, winter weather will be mild, and if the brown band is narrow, the winter will be severe. In a variation of this story, the color of stripes predict the winter weather, with darker stripes indicating a harsher winter. In reality, hatchlings from the same clutch of eggs can display considerable variation in their color banding, and a larva's brown band tends to widen with age as it molts. Another version of this belief is that the direction in which a Pyrrharctia isabella crawls indicates the winter weather, with the caterpillar crawling south to escape colder weather. There is no scientific evidence for winter weather prediction by Pyrrharctia isabella. ===Woollybear festivals=== Woollybear festivals are held in several locations in the fall. *Vermilion, Ohio, in October, begun in 1973, the Woollybear Festival features woollybear costume contests for children and pets and the Woolybear 500 caterpillar races. *Banner Elk, North Carolina, begun in 1977, features crafts, food, and races.

It was designed for industrial and light switching duties, often replacing steam locomotives that had previously been assigned these chores. This locomotive's specific 44-short ton weight was directly related to one of the efficiencies the new diesel locomotives offered compared to their steam counterparts: reduced labor intensity. In the 1940s, the steam to diesel transition was in its infancy in North America, and railroad unions were trying to protect the locomotive fireman jobs that were redundant with diesel units. One measure taken to this end was the 1937 so- called \\"90,000 Pound Rule\\" : a stipulation that locomotives weighing - 45 short tons - or more required a fireman in addition to an engineer on common carrier railroads. Industrial and military railroads had no such stipulation. The 44-ton locomotive was born to skirt this requirement. Other manufacturers also built 44-ton switchers of center-cab configuration. 276 examples of this locomotive were built for U. S. railroads and industrial concerns, four were exported to Australia in 1944, 10 were exported to Canada, 10 were exported to Cuba, one was exported to the Dominican Republic, five were exported to France, three were exported to India, six were exported to Mexico, five were exported to Saudi Arabia, one was exported to Sweden, two were exported to Trinidad, 10 were exported to Uruguay, and 57 were built for the U. S. Military. Many remain, in service and in museums. == Prime mover options == The locomotives were available with a choice of prime movers. Most were built with a pair of Caterpillar's D17000 V8 engines, but three other engines types were used. Nine were built with a pair of Hercules DFXD engines, and were sold to Chattanooga Traction (2) and Missouri Pacific Railroad and its subsidiaries (7). Ten were built with a pair of the slightly more powerful Buda 6DH1742, rated at each. The last four locomotives built had Caterpillar D342 engines, and were sold to Canadian National Railways (3) and the Dansville and Mount Morris Railroad (1). == Military version == During the Second World War GE produced a \\"Drop Cab\\" variant of the 44-ton locomotives for the US Armed Forces. These appeared similar to the standard 44-ton but had a lower cab for European clearances, and large boxes next to the cab, on the front right, and back left running boards, housing the air compressors (housed under the cab on standard versions). Most of these military variants were ballasted to an actual weight of 45 tons. A total of 91 Military 45-ton Drop Cabs were built with 31 of those sold to the Indian Railways. Additional narrow gauge drop cabs were built to a 47-ton rating for the military and export. Twelve Drop Cab 45-ton locomotives were bought by the Portuguese Railway (CP - Caminhos de Ferro Portugueses) in 1949, with the Iberian broad gauge of . Numbered 1101 to 1112, after some initial use as light road engines, they spent most of their lives as switchers at the southern region main stations. The series is withdrawn but one example is preserved at the National Railroad Museum (Funda√ß√£o Museu Nacional Ferrovi√°rio Armando Ginestal Machado) at Entroncamento. == Australia == Forty-seven locomotives were bought by the US Military, and four of them were exported to Australia. All saw service on the New South Wales Government Railways as the 79 class, before two of them were sold to Commonwealth Railways, becoming the DE class. == Preserved examples == === United States === *Arcade and Attica Railroad in Arcade, NY shifted all operations to diesel in 1941 with the purchase of 44ton No 110.

Churchill, relegated to the periphery of British politics by the late 1930s, lashes out against appeasement despite having almost no support from fellow parliamentarians or the British press. The novel includes many of the momentous historical personages of the day: Chamberlain, the ailing and pacifist Prime Minister; Churchill, the political outcast, whose pugnacity created opprobrium in the public eye; Joseph Kennedy, the U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James's; Guy Burgess, an alcoholic BBC journalist of later Cold War infamy; the machiavellian newspaper mogul Max Aitken (Lord Beaverbrook), and the stuttering and insecure King George VI, who personally detests Churchill and tries to persuade his good friend, Lord Halifax, to take the reins of leadership. Winston's War is the first in a series of novels by Dobbs about Churchill's wartime leadership. The sequel Never Surrender continues the storyline over the first few weeks of Churchill's premiership. ==References== Category:2003 British novels Category:Cultural depictions of Winston Churchill Category:Novels set during World War II Category:Novels by Michael Dobbs Category:HarperCollins books Category:Cultural depictions of George VI ","title":"Winston's War"},{"id":"2558198","text":"Edmund Landor Taylor (December 14, 1860 - September 9, 1934) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1913 to 1915, as a member of the Conservative Party. Taylor was born in Leeds County, Canada West (now Ontario), the son of Henry J. Taylor and Mary Redmond. He attended high school in Gananoque, and moved to Manitoba in 1881. Taylor continued his education, and attended the Winnipeg Collegiate Institute and the Manitoba Provincial Normal School, receiving a First Class Teacher's Certificate. He worked as the deputy register of Rock Lake County from 1881 to 1883, and worked as an educator from 1883 to 1886. In 1886, he began training as a law student with James Albert Manning Aikins, later the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba. He continued his studies in the firms of Tupper, Phippen & Tupper after 1892, and was called to the bar in 1895. He worked as a barrister-at-law after this time. Taylor was also a director of several companies. In 1902, Taylor married Una C. Preston. In religion, he was a Methodist. He was named a King's Counsel in 1907. He sought election to the House of Commons of Canada in a by-election for the riding of Winnipeg, held on April 27, 1894. This by-election was called after the previous election of Hugh John Macdonald was declared void. Running as the Conservative candidate, Taylor lost to Liberal Richard Willis Jameson by 1,115 votes. He campaigned for the Manitoba legislature in the Mountain constituency in the 1910 provincial election, and lost to Liberal candidate James Baird by 282 votes. He was elected to the legislature three years later in a by-election for the Gimli constituency, held on May 12, 1913. On this occasion, Taylor defeated Liberal candidate A. Eggerston by 842 votes. He served in the legislature as a backbench supporter of Rodmond Roblin's government. Taylor was re-elected for the constituency of St. George in the 1914 provincial election, defeating Liberal Skuli Sigfusson by 101 votes. He continued to serve as a government backbencher. The Roblin administration was forced to resign from office in 1915 amid a serious corruption scandal. A new election was called, which the Liberal Party won in a landslide. Taylor was not a candidate for re-election. Taylor died in Winnipeg in 1934. ==References== Category:1860 births Category:1934 deaths Category:Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba MLAs Category:Conservative Party of Canada (1867‚Äì1942) candidates for the Canadian House of Commons Category:Canadian Queen's Counsel ","title":"Edmund L.

The band's song, \\"Greenback Boogie\\", is the main theme song of the USA Network legal drama series Suits. ==History== Ima Robot formed in the late 1990s. In the early 2000s, the band signed with Virgin Records. The band's other original members were Timmy \\"The Terror\\" Anderson, Oliver \\"Oligee\\" Goldstein, Justin Meldal-Johnsen, and studio drummer Joey Waronker. Meldal-Johnsen and Waronker were sought-after musicians who had played with Beck before joining Ima Robot. On September 16, 2003, Ima Robot released their first full-length album, the self-titled Ima Robot. The album featured the singles \\"Dynomite\\" and \\"Song #1\\" (released in the UK only). In 2004, Waronker and \\"Oligee\\" left the band. Meldal-Johnsen followed in 2005, with former Oleander drummer Scott Devours. Tim Anderson's cousin, whom he had never met before Devours, auditioned and took over the drums. Filip Nikolic took over the bass and Andy Marlow started playing the keyboards. On September 12, 2006, they released their second album Monument to the Masses, which featured the singles \\"Creeps Me Out\\" and \\"Lovers in Captivity\\". In April 2007, the band won their independence from Virgin Records and continued to work unsigned under the management of Alexis Rivera of Echo Park Records. The song \\"Gangster\\" premiered on the band's MySpace on April 15, 2008, with its lyrics posted in a blog entry by the band. In 2010 the band announced the upcoming release of their new album, Another Man's Treasure, and released the song \\"Ruthless\\" on the Internet. Ebert remained frustrated with Virgin, saying in a 2016 interview with Transverso Media that, \\"pretty unironically I ended up feeling like a robot by the end of the process because of the major label thing.\\" During that period, they were being represented by the Werewolf Heart label. In June 2008, Lars Vognstrup joined the group, having previously played with Nikolic in the band Junior Senior. In 2009, Orpheo McCord (of Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros and of Fool's Gold), Jason \\"ComputerJay\\" Taylor, and Jonas Petri Megyessi joined the band. On January 6, 2011, the band played six songs live on KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic. This was the first time since Monument to the Masses tours that the new band lineup had played live. Ima Robot's B-side \\"Greenback Boogie\\" from the album Another Man's Treasure has been featured as the theme song of the USA Network legal drama, Suits, since 2011.

It is located in the City of Swan. The original Bullsbrook townsite is located slightly west of the current town, on the 17 km mark of the Midland Railway. Bullsbrook is also home to the RAAF Pearce airbase, a major training facility for the Royal Australian Air Force. The suburb is situated on the Great Northern Highway, 25 kilometres north of the Midland Strategic Regional Centre. It is well serviced by several major transport networks including the Great Northern Highway, Railway Parade and the Brand Highway to the north, Chittering Road to the east and Neaves Road to the west. Bullsbrook is also adjacent to the State rail network, providing an opportunity for the development of an intermodal freight transport hub. The site is further strengthened by linkage to the planned Perth-Darwin National Highway via Stock Road. Although traditionally a predominantly rural suburb, the release in 2008 of the Bullsbrook Commercial Centre offers great scope for expansion in the commercial and light industrial land use capability of Bullsbrook. In addition, the City of Swan is awaiting the State's approval of the draft Bullsbrook Townsite and Rural Strategy which would see further industrial, commercial and residential growth in Bullsbrook. ==History== Settlement of the area dates from the 1890s, following the construction of the Midland railway line and military land use commenced from 1935. The most significant development occurred from the 1970s, with further population growth in the early 1990s. Regarding the origin of the name, the Western Australian Department of Land Information states: ==Population== In the 2016 census, there were 5,185 people in Bullsbrook, 66.8% of people were born in Australia.

Lambert & Butler is mainly commercialised in the United Kingdom, having been exported to Luxembourg, Netherlands, Germany, France, Austria, Spain and Egypt.As of 2019, L&B; was is the leading cigarette brand in the United Kingdom.A history of Lambert & Butler ==History== Lambert & Butler cigarettes were launched in Clerkenwell in 1834 by Charles Edward Lambert (1814‚Äì1887) and Charles Butler (1813‚Äì1882), who were among the earliest British cigar manufacturers. Vintage Lambert & Butler \\"Weaver\\" brand They eventually started selling cigarettes which were being manufactured by John Wood & Son before Lambert & Butler started manufacturing it themselves in 1876 before merging with Imperial Tobacco in 1901. In the late-1800s, it accounted for 20% of total sales value and controlled a large piece of the market with an 1870 capital of ¬£87,200 and 1887 total capital of ¬£175,000, alongside major companies W.D. & H.O. Wills (now Imperial Tobacco) Cope Bros & Co, Hignett Tobacco, John Player & Sons and Stephen Mitchell & Son. In this time, the first largest company in the industry was Wills followed by Cope with Lambert & Butler a strong third and one of Lambert & Butler's most popular brands was Best Bird's Eye. In 1903, after merging with Imperial, an executive committee was formed with one of the members being Charles Lambert. Lambert & Butler also exported to Jamaica with brands Trumpeter and Needle Point. It established its own bonded warehouse in 1891 and was located on Bucknall Street near Long Acre in Westminster, London. Charles Lambert, who was called \\"the best judge of a Havana cigar\\" also ran a tobacco shop on Drury Lane. Lambert & Butler was also part of the \\"big six\\", with Wills, Taddy & Co, Cope Bros, Hignett Bros and John Player & Sons. Taking advantage of the rise in popularity of football cards in the 1920s and 1930s, Lambert & Butler released a set of association football trading cards in 1931. It consisted of a series of painted portraits that included West Ham's star centre-forward, Vic Watson. Nevertheless, the outbreak of World War II forced tobacco companies to cease production of cigarette cards. In 1958, the remaining L&B; factory was closed. Production continues at other Imperial Tobacco subsidiaries. The Drury Leane heaquarters were closed in 1961. The brand was relaunched in 1979 after an absence. In the late-1990s, their campaign was a distinguished Lambert with his calm butler, Butler, exchanging humorous quotes until the last one which had their faces blurred and the butler saying \\"It seems we've been outlawed, Sir\\". In 1999, Lambert & Butler owned 17% of the British cigarette market, 5% more than Benson & Hedges. Due to Imperial Tobacco not owning the trademark on the original name, Lambert & Butler is known in some countries as either L&B; or Great & British. It is among the popular and less expensive local brands and, as of 2007, Lambert & Butler King Size were the best-selling brand of cigarettes in the UK. In 2010, the Lambert & Butler brand got officially trademarked under the following words: \\"L&B; LAMBERT & BUTLER ORIGINAL\\". The brand appealed a file for registration on 17 July 2013 and got officially registered on the 22 July 2014. In 2016, the last factory that still produced cigarettes in Nottingham, United Kingdom which also produced Lambert & Butler cigarettes, closed its doors for the final time. Imperial Tobacco moved the production to either Poland or Germany, which would increase their profits to ¬£320,000,000. The record for most L&B; cigarettes smoked in 1 day is held by Ardoyne man Daniel Brown. He achieved a record of 264 on the 14th August 2020. ==Products== Lambert & Butler cigarettes are sold in silver full strength, silver superkings, gold (formerly lights) and menthol. \\"Glide Tec\\" Packs are also now for sale and fast becoming the standard pack for this brand. These packs have a small window on the front of the pack which allows the user to slide up the inner pack with their thumb. This lifts the lid of the outer pack, and the inner pack containing the cigarettes slides out to reveal the cigarettes. Glide Tec packs are available in the silver, gold and menthol king size variants. In 2002, following a European Union ban on descriptive labels on tobacco, Lambert & Butler renamed its Lights band to Gold and its Ultra Lights to Blue. In April 2012, Lambert & Butler Fresh Burst and Lambert & Butler Profile were added to the range. Lambert and Butler Fresh Burst cigarettes contain a capsule within the filter- tip, which when squeezed, pops and mentholates the cigarette. Lambert and Butler Profile Cigarettes are thinner in diameter, targeted at the busy smoker, who desires a cigarette which provides the same nicotine level as a standard size cigarette but in a smaller package, making the cigarette quicker to smoke. Fresh Burst and Profile are available in price marked or standard 20 packs. In February 2014, Imperial Tobacco announced they would expand their Lambert & Butler range with a new variant called L&B; Blue. It would be available from the 3rd of March 2014 onwards. In May 2015, a survey concluded that Lambert & Butler Kingsize was the most popular variant in the range in 2013 and 2014, followed by Lambert & Butler Gold, Lambert & Butler Menthol and Lamber & Butler White. In May 2020, Lambert & Butler Menthol, Lambert & Butler Crushball and Lambert & Butler Ice Burst were banned due to menthol cigarettes becoming outlawed across Europe, even the UK. ==See also== * Cigarette * Tobacco smoking * Association football trading card ==References== Category:Products introduced in 1834 Category:Imperial Brands brands Category:1834 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:British companies established in 1834 ","title":"Lambert &amp; Butler"},{"id":"2558282","text":"Houyi, as depicted in Xiao Yuncong's Illustrated 'Inquiry of the Heavens' (), published 1645 Hou Yi () is a mythological Chinese archer. He was also known as Shen Yi and simply as Yi (). He is also typically given the title of \\"Lord Archer\\". He is sometimes portrayed as a god of archery descended from heaven to aid mankind. Other times, he is portrayed as either simply half-divine or fully mortal. His wife, Chang'e (), is a lunar deity. ==Lore== In Chinese mythology, there were 10 suns. Initially the 10 suns would cross the sky one by one, but one day all 10 suns came out at once scorching the earth. Hou Yi was tasked by the mythical King Yao to rein in the suns. Hou Yi first tried to reason with the suns. When that didn't work, he then pretended to shoot at them with his bow to intimidate them. When the suns again refused to heed Hou Yi's warnings, he began to shoot at them one by one. As each one fell, they turned into 3 legged ravens. Finally only one sun was left and King Yao as well as the sun's mother asked for him to be spared for the prosperity of man. Hou Yi was also known for the slaying, maiming and imprisonment of several other mythical beasts such as the Yayu, Zaochi, Jiuying, Dafeng, Fengxi and Xiushe. He had been directed by King Yao to go after these creatures as they were all causing trouble for humans. Hou Yi was gifted the pill of immortality by the gods. One of Hou Yi's apprentices called Pang Meng () broke into Hou Yi's house in search of the pill of immortality while Hou Yi was out hunting. His wife Chang'e swallowed the pill before Pang Meng could get it. After eating the pill, Chang'e rose up to the moon. In another version, after Hou Yi shot down the suns, he was proclaimed as a hero-king by the people. Though, once he was crowned king he became a tyrant and subjugated his people. Hou Yi had also obtained immortality elixir from Xiwangmu to live forever. Chang'e was afraid that if he lived forever, that people would forever be victim to his cruelty. Therefore, Chang'e consumed the elixir herself and floated away. As she did, Hou Yi tried to shoot her down but failed. For her sacrifice, people have taken to honoring her during the Mid-Autumn Festival. ==Historical references== Hou Yi‚Äîusually conflated with the legendary figure in ancient sources‚Äîwas also a tribal leader of prehistoric China who according to the Bamboo Annals attacked the Xia during the first year of the reign of and occupied his capital Zhenxun while Taikang was hunting beyond the Luo River. Hou Yi was deposed by his lieutenant Han Zhuo in the eighth year of the reign of Taikang's nephew .

His mother died when he was young. His father was Iver Olsen, a craftsman and an amateur musician who played the organ at the local church. From a young age Olsen learnt to play the piano and the violin. At the age of five he composed his first small piece, and by the age of seven he sometimes stood in for his father playing the church pipe organ. In 1865 Olsen went to Trondheim as apprentice to a craftsman. He also studied composition and the organ from Fredrick and Just Lindeman, and sometimes substituted for Just as the organist in the Trondheim cathedral. In 1870, having given up his apprenticeship, he moved to Leipzig where he studied under Oscar Paul at the music conservatory until 1874. There he wrote his Symphony in G major, and began his opera Stig Hvide. In 1874 he became a teacher in Christiania (now Oslo), where he spent most of the rest of his life. He conducted the Christiania Artisans' Choral Society from 1876‚Äì1880, the Music Society orchestra from 1877‚Äì1880, and the freemason's orchestra from 1894‚Äì1908. From 1884 he was the music director of the Akershus 2nd Brigade. From 1899‚Äì1920 he was a music inspector. He had married Marie Hals, the daughter of piano manufacturer Karl Hals, in 1879. He died in Oslo on November 4, 1927. His interment was at Cemetery of Our Saviour. ==Music== Close-up of Ole Olsen's bust in Hammerfest Constitution Day, 2007 Olsen's operas were influenced by Richard Wagner. Another strong influence was the traditional Joik form of song, as he was involved in collecting folk tunes while in the military. These influenced the large number of military marches he composed, and the nationalist tradition was also represented in his stage works. His compositions include: * operas ** Stig Hvide (1872‚Äì76) ** Lajla (1893) ** Stallo (1902) ** Klippe√∏erne (1904‚Äì10) * oratorio ** Nidaros (1897) * cantatas ** Ludvig Holberg (1884) ** Griffenfeldt (1897) ** Broderbud (n.d.) * male chorus ** Fanevakt (n.d.) ** I jotunheimen (n.d.) * symphonic poems ** Asg√•rdsreien (1878) ** Alfedans * orchestral ** Symphony in G major ** Petite Suite for piano and strings (1902) ** Trombone Concerto (1905) ** V√¶ringetog ** Ritornell ** Romance **Tarantelle * others ** Svein Ur√¶d (1890) ** King Erik XIV (1882) ** piano pieces ** military marches ==Recordings== *(rel. 1991) Ole Olsen: Little Suite for piano & string orchestra; Piano works by 7 women composers ‚Äî Jorunn Marie Bratlie (piano), Norwegian Radio Orchestra, Christian Eggen (cond.) ‚Äî Norsk Kulturr√•ds Klassikerserie NKFCD 50024-2 *(rel. 2003) A Norwegian Rendezvous, Vol. 2: Music from the Romantic Period [includes Olsen's Suite for strings, Op.60; Miniature Suite, Op.68; Two anglaises; Vals lento] ‚Äî Kristiansand Chamber Orchestra, Jan Stigmer (leader) ‚Äî Intim Musik 81 *(rec. 2009) Ole Olsen: Asgaardsreien, Op.10; Symphony in G major, Op.5; Suite for string orchestra, Op.60 ‚Äî Latvian National Symphony Orchestra, Terje Mikkelsen (cond.) ‚Äî Sterling CDS 1086-2 *(rel. 2007) Shadow Songs [includes Olsen's Humoreske (No.2 of 3 Lieder); Paa Fjeldet, Op.7 No.1; Irmelin Rose, Op.56] ‚Äî Harald Bj√∏rk√∏y (tenor), ?

Alison James. The book is best known for its message about selfishness and sharing and for the distinctive shiny foil scales of the Rainbow Fish. Decode Entertainment turned the story into an animated television series of the same name, which aired on the HBO Family television channel in the United States and Teletoon in Canada from 1999 until 2000. ==Plot== The story is about The Rainbow Fish, a fish with shiny, multi-coloured scales. He has blue, green, purple, and pink scales. Interspersed with these colorful scales are shiny, holographic scales which are his favorites. The other fish from his gang also have scales, but only scales matching to their real colors. However, they wish that they had shiny silver scales like the Rainbow Fish. One day, a small blue fish (wishing he could have shiny silver scales) asks the Rainbow Fish if he could have one of his shiny silver scales. The Rainbow Fish refuses in a very rude manner. The small blue fish tells all the other fish that The Rainbow Fish was being rude, and as a result, the other fish do not want to play with him any more. His only remaining friend, the starfish, tells him to go visit the wise octopus for advice. When he goes to the cave where the wise octopus lives, he sees the octopus, who says that she has been waiting for him. She explains that the waves have told her his story. Then, she gives The Rainbow Fish her advice: He must share his scales with the other fish. She continues that he might no longer be the most beautiful fish after that, but he will discover how to be happy. The Rainbow Fish says that he cannot share his favorite scales, and the wise octopus disappears in a cloud of ink. When he encounters the little blue fish for a second time, The Rainbow Fish shares one of his precious silver scales and sees the little fish's joy. With that one shiny scale gone, he immediately feels much better. Very soon, the Rainbow Fish is surrounded by the other fish requesting scales and he shares one of his shiny silver scales with the each of them. Soon, everyone in the ocean, has one shiny scale, including The Rainbow Fish. The Rainbow Fish is finally happy even though he only had one shiny scale left. ==Theme== A Publishers Weekly reviewer called the book a \\"cautionary tale about selfishness and vanity\\". ==Book series== There are five other sequels in the Rainbow Fish book series: * Rainbow Fish to the Rescue: About the acceptance and integration of foreigners. * Rainbow Fish and the Big Blue Whale: About arguments and how to settle them. * Rainbow Fish and the Sea Monster's Cave: About irrational and rational fears. * Rainbow Fish Finds his Way: With the help of his new friends, Rainbow Fish finds his way back home. * Rainbow Fish Discovers the Deep Sea: About modesty and happiness. ==Short film== On March 25, 1997, an animated adaptation of the story book was released on VHS and DVD (known as The Rainbow Fish and Dazzle the Dinosaur). The home video releases also contain the film Dazzle the Dinosaur which is based on another book written by Pfister and published in 1994. The animated short film features a song called \\"Giving Makes You Special\\". In Dazzle the Dinosaur, the imaginary dinosaur named Dazzle is an egg (separated from another family and is at first an orphan). Although it is not specified what kind of dinosaur he is, he is possibly an Ouranosaurus (relative of Iguanodon; or in other words a dinosaur from the Iguanodontidae family). Then he adopts a young female Maiasaura from a Maiasaura family and herd. Her name is Maia the Maiasaura. In this story, they try to get the no-good Dragonsaurus (which terrified the Maiasauruses) to give them back their old home (which had once been in a cave). The duo (Dazzle and Maia) see a Brachiosaurus. Then they tell him the truth about their old home (their cave) which the Dragonsaurus had moved in to. When the Quetzalcoatlus takes Dazzle and Maia to the cave (which the Dragonsaurus had moved in) and tells them he and his flock leave at sunset. Because he is not staying around when the Dragonsaurus is awake (saying to them, \\"I am never again coming back to that cave once the Dragonsaurus comes around!\\"). The Dragonsaurus does give it back in the end, and Dazzle, Maia, and all the other Maiasauruses are able to return to their old home. The dinosaurs in this story are Brachiosaurus, Stegosaurus, Quetzalcoatlus, Deinonychus, Tyrannosaurus Rex, Ouranosaurus (that being Dazzle), and Dragonsaurus. ==Television series== The Rainbow Fish was adapted into a children's animated television series in 1999. However, the television series does not follow the plot of the book; rather it takes the character and the setting and creates a new story with them. Some characters were added and others embellished for the purposes of the show. In the series, the place where the fish live is called Neptune Bay (after Neptune, god of the sea). The fish attend school, which is aptly named \\"The School of Fish\\". There is a shipwreck called \\"Shipwreck Park\\" in the series that resembles the wreck of the RMS Titanic. It was produced by Decode Entertainment and EM.TV for Sony Wonder. 26 episodes were produced. ==References== ==External links== * http://www.marcuspfister.ch * A supplemental Rainbow Fish craft for young children * Rainbow Fish at VoiceChasers Category:1992 children's books Category:Picture books Category:Swiss children's literature ","title":"The Rainbow Fish"},{"id":"2558309","text":"The Walter F.

Algonquin was the fourth ship of her class which is sometimes referred to as the Tribal class or the 280 class. She is the second vessel to use the designation . Algonquin carried the hull classification symbol DDG. Algonquin was originally designed to be primarily an anti- submarine destroyer. The Iroquois-class destroyers were the first ships in the Royal Canadian Navy (other than the ) to carry multiple helicopters, and were the first ships to be powered entirely by gas turbines in a COGOG (Combined Gas Or Gas) arrangement. Algonquin underwent a major refit called the Tribal Class Update and Modernization Program (TRUMP) from 1987 to 1991 and emerged as an area air defence destroyer. She was assigned to Maritime Forces Pacific (MARPAC) and was homeported at CFB Esquimalt. ==Design== On 26 October 1987, Algonquin entered the Tribal Class Update and Modernization Project refit, dubbed TRUMP, at MIL-Davie, Lauzon. Labour problems and contract disputes delayed completion of the work until 11 Oct 1991. As a modernization concept, origins of the idea date back to the early 1980s. By the mid-1980s the Canadian Federal Government had decided on the necessity of upgrading the Iroquois-class ships and released a request for proposal, foreseeing complete refurbishment. The project resulted in a thorough refurbishment of the ship and modernization of mechanical, electronic and weapon systems. Litton Systems Canada was selected as prime contractor and project manager after submitting a detailed 4000+ page proposal which emphasized, maximum automation and software engineering This aspect of the ship was extremely important due to the desired high level of automation in real-time command and control functions on the refurbished ships. Software engineering military standards were fairly recent and not yet widely assimilated, so Litton had to exercise particular caution in the areas of software configuration management (SCM) and software quality assurance (SQA). Litton's Proposal to the Canadian Federal Government had a 250-page SCM and SQA policies section which was accepted without a single edit due to highly sensitive and farsighted work of the Advance Programs Division Technical Contract Team at Litton who established a massive and capable engineering force by 1988‚Äì89. The entire class underwent major retrofits in the early 1990s as a part of the Tribal Class Update and Modernization Project. These refits had the effect of re-purposing the ships for area air defence; following, Iroquois-class ships were also referred to as air defence destroyers. This resulted in an update of vessel designation from DDH (Destroyer Helicopter) to DDG (Destroyer Guided Missile). Their former anti- submarine role was largely assumed by the s. The main weapon of the new design was the Mk.41 VLS, firing 29 SM-2 Block III long-range anti-aircraft missiles. To provide room for the VLS, the original 5-in L54 gun was replaced with the smaller, but much faster firing, Oto Melara 76 mm gun, relocated from the deck to the bridgework above it. A Phalanx CIWS (Close-in Weapon System) was also added for self-defence. The torpedo tubes were retained, but the Limbo and Sea Sparrow systems were removed. The modernization also replaced the original Pratt & Whitney FFT-12 cruise turbines with newer 570-KF engines from Allison. The speed remained the same, as weight had increased to 5,100 tons full load. The original split funnel was replaced by a simpler single funnel, giving the ship a reduced heat signature due to cooler engine exhaust. ==Construction and career== Algonquins ship's bell Algonquin, named for the Algonquin people, was laid down on 1 September 1969 by Davie Shipbuilding at Lauzon, Quebec.

She was once again made flagship and took part in the naval blockade of the former Yugoslavia as part of Operation \\"Sharp Guard\\".UIC 7714 HMCS Algonquin Annual Historical Report 1993 On 2 July, Algonquin conducted the first of a total of 88 merchant vessel boardings as part of the blockade. On 27 July, the busiest day for Algonquin boarding parties, seven merchant ships were boarded in a 23‚Äëhour period. On 1 October, the ship completed her last boarding in support of the operation. On 5 October, Algonquin completed turnover of STANAVFORLANT to HMCS Iroquois and returned home. In 1994, the destroyer was reassigned to the west coast. On 2 July, Algonquin departed from Halifax en route to Esquimalt, British Columbia. Upon transiting the Panama Canal, the ship officially joined Maritime Forces Pacific. The ship arrived at Esquimalt on 5 August.UIC 7714 HMCS Algonquin Annual Historical Report 1994 In 1995, Algonquin took part in several naval exercises including COMPUTEX and MARCOT. She also conducted integrated training operations with the Battle Group (CVBG).UIC 7714 HMCS Algonquin Annual Historical Report 1995 In February 1996, Algonquin sailed to participate in FLEETEX 96-1A alongside Protecteur and the frigates and as part of the USS Carl Vinson Battle Group.

On 3 May, the task group rendezvoused south of Inchon, South Korea with the Republic of Korea ships Kyong Buk and Che Ju and HMCS Regina. The Canadian‚ÄìKorean TG proceeded for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii and from 22 May to 16 June participated in RIMPAC 96. The Canadian task group returned to Esquimalt on 27 June. She performed further naval exercises later in the year. During one of these exercises, Algonquin was tasked with an intelligence-gathering mission on a Russian merchant vessel in Canadian waters, escorting her to the entrance of Juan de Fuca Strait. In December, Algonquin prepared for a refit with scheduled completion of April 1998. Algonquin began her refit costing $25 million in mid-January 2007. The ship returned to service in May 1998. On 24 August 1999, the ship was doing trials with a private private MiG-21 aircraft when the aircraft crashed into the ocean. A fuel slick and debris was found in the search area but nothing more and after 24 hours the search was terminated. Later that week Algonquin, in consort with the Canadian Coast Guard, was tasked to intercept, track and board an illegal Chinese migrant vessel. The vessel was escorted to Gold River, British Columbia where 159 migrants were received by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for medical and legal processing.UIC 7714 HMCS Algonquin Annual Historical Report 1999 ===2000s=== Algonquin at Pearl Harbor in June 2000 The ship deployed for WESTPLOY 00 in April 2000. On departing Qingdao, Algonquin and Winnipeg conducted the first military exercise by a Western nation with China. In June, the ship participated in RIMPAC 00 with 54 ships and over 20,000 sailors from Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Korea and the United States.UIC 7714 HMCS Algonquin Annual Historical Report 2000 In 2001, Algonquin continued the duties of flagship for the Commander Canadian Fleet Pacific. As such, Algonquin took part in naval exercises and work-ups in a busy preparation period for Operation Apollo and conducted joint exercises with the Australian, New Zealand and United States navies.UIC 7714 HMCS Algonquin Annual Historical Report 2001 Algonquin continued the duties of flagship for the Commander Canadian Fleet Pacific. As such, Algonquin took part in Operation Apollo and completed a highly successful mission in the Gulf of Oman. She made port visits in Hawaii, Saipan, Guam, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong and United Arab Emirates. On 4 March, the destroyer deployed for the Gulf of Oman, in support of Operation Apollo, conducting her mission on 1 May through 4 September. On 14 October, the ship returned to Esquimalt, having been away for almost seven months in the Persian Gulf and logging . During the operation Algonquin hailed over 1,700 vessels and boarded 55. She carried out 96 inspections of 'go-fast vessels', and discovered and apprehended several suspected terrorists. Algonquin conducted a short port visit to Peddar Bay on 21 November, and returned to Esquimlat Harbour for a short refit period. From March to August 2003 Algonquin was under refit by Victoria Shipyards. She rejoined the Pacific Fleet as the flagship upon her return to service. In 2005, the ship participated in several naval exercises and visited San Francisco with Protecteur, Vancouver and in October. In 2008, Algonquin was turned over to Victoria Shipyards for refit, reentering service in 2009. On 30 August 2013, Algonquin was involved in a collision at sea with Protecteur while conducting towing manoeuvres en route to Hawaii. There were no injuries. The ship was able to return to her home port of Esquimalt, to undergo a full damage assessment. It was assessed that Algonquin suffered extensive damage to her port side hangar and remained alongside in Esquimalt. As a result of the collision, a planned deployment to the Asia-Pacific region was cancelled. ===Paid off=== Considering the relatively short service life remaining for Algonquin, which was scheduled to be retired in early 2019, and the cost of repairs, it was deemed that the expense of re-instating the ship to full operating capability would not be a responsible use of public funds. Therefore, on 19 September 2014 it was announced that Algonquin would be paid off. Algonquin was paid off on 11 June 2015. Algonquin, along with Protecteur, was sold for scrapping on 27 November 2015 to R.J. MacIsaac Ltd. of Antigonish, Nova Scotia. They will be towed to Liverpool, Nova Scotia where the work will be done. ==Lineage== The first ship in the RCN to bear the name Algonquin was a V-class destroyer, laid down in the United Kingdom as HMS Valentine but later commissioned in 1944 by the Naval Service of Canada as HMCS Algonquin. During the Second World War she saw much action while attached to the British Home Fleet, including taking part in an attack on the . Algonquin was also present on D-day during the invasion of Normandy and escorted convoys to Murmansk, Russia. She was paid off in 1946 at the end of the war, but was re-commissioned in 1953 after extensive modification to anti- submarine destroyer-escort standard. She was paid off for the final time in 1970. ==References== ===Citations=== ===References=== * * ==External links== * HMCS Algonquin (DDG 283) ‚Äì official website Category:Ships of the Royal Canadian Navy Category:Iroquois-class destroyers Category:1971 ships Category:Ships built in Quebec Category:Cold War destroyers of Canada ","title":"HMCS Algonquin (DDG 283)"},{"id":"2558324","text":"Doodlakine is a town east of Perth, Western Australia.

Index types include b-trees, bitmaps, and r-trees. In database management systems, a reverse key index strategy reverses the key value before entering it in the index. E.g., the value 24538 becomes 83542 in the index. Reversing the key value is particularly useful for indexing data such as sequence numbers, where each new key value is greater than the prior value, i.e., values monotonically increase. Reverse key indexes have become particularly important in high volume transaction processing systems because they reduce contention for index blocks. ==Creating data== Reversed key indexes use b-tree structures, but preprocess key values before inserting them. Simplifying, b-trees place similar values on a single index block, e.g., storing 24538 on the same block as 24539. This makes them efficient both for looking up a specific value and for finding values within a range. However, if the application inserts values in sequence, each insert must have access to the newest block in the index in order to add the new value. If many users attempt to insert at the same time, they all must write to that block and have to get in line, slowing down the application. This is particularly a problem in clustered databases, which may require the block to be copied from one computer's memory to another's to allow the next user to perform their insert. Reversing the key spreads similar new values across the entire index instead of concentrating them in any one leaf block. This means that 24538 appears on the same block as 14538 while 24539 goes to a different block, eliminating this cause of contention. (Since 14538 would have been created long before 24538, their inserts don't interfere with each other.) ==Querying data== Reverse indexes are just as efficient as unreversed indexes for finding specific values, although they aren't helpful for range queries. Range queries are uncommon for artificial values such as sequence numbers. When searching the index, the query processor simply reverses the search target before looking it up. ==Deleting data== Typically, applications delete data that is older on average before deleting newer data. Thus, data with lower sequence numbers generally go before those with higher values. As time passes, in standard b-trees, index blocks for lower values end up containing few values, with a commensurate increase in unused space, referred to as \\"rot\\". Rot not only wastes space, but slows query speeds, because a smaller fraction of a rotten index's blocks fit in memory at any one time. In a b-tree, if 14538 gets deleted, its index space remains empty.

Levant intersperses his reminisces about Hollywood in its heyday with one-liners and pithy quotes by himself and others. When asked about writing a book on Victor Herbert by a publisher, for example, Levant remarked \\"I wouldn't even read one!\\" Dorothy Parker, when Levant asked her if she ever took sleeping pills, supposedly answered, \\"In a big bowl with sugar and cream.\\" Witty, acerbic, and often self-deprecating, the book casually drops scores of famous names such as Levant's good friend George Gershwin, Arturo Toscanini, Otto Klemperer, William Faulkner, Harpo Marx, Irving Berlin, and Joseph P. Kennedy. It serves as both a Who's Who of Hollywood over three decades‚Äîskewering fellow musicians, actors, conductors, politicians, and gangsters--and a harrowing personal tale of neuroses and obsessions. Levant details in particular his harrowing time in psychiatric wards, his addictions to Demerol and paraldehyde; his experiences with electroconvulsive therapy, well-meaning but useless psychiatrists, and unscrupulous quacks; and how his long-suffering wife June and his three daughters endured his numerous eccentricities, superstitions, and hangups. :I was an inert, happy-go-lucky derelict who could :have been created by Gogol. :I have a sixth sense; I lack the other five. :When Jack Paar asked Levant what he did for exercise, Oscar answered, \\"I stumble and fall into a coma.\\" :When Oscar told his wife June that he was in the hospital again, she responded with \\"Gesundheit!\\" ==External links== *Posthumous treatment of Oscar Levant ‚Äì Commentary Magazine Category:1965 non- fiction books Category:Show business memoirs Category:G.

They may be the actual, or intended to simulate, the design used on antique vehicles or vintage sports cars. A \\"spinner wheel\\" in contemporary usage is a type of hubcap or inner wheel ornament, that spins independently inside of a wheel itself when the vehicle is in motion, and continues to spin once the vehicle has come to a stop. ==Original use== Two bladed spinner on a wire wheel AMC simulated wire wheel cover with spinner The spinner or \\"knock-off\\" originated with Rudge-Whitworth centerlock wire wheels and hubs, which were first patented in 1908. The spinner was a threaded, winged nut designed to keep the wheel fastened to the hub. They were screwed on and \\"knocked on tightly\\" using a hammer, hence the name \\"knock-offs\\". Most setups will feature right-hand threads on the left side of the vehicle, and left-hand threads (rotate clockwise to remove) on the vehicle's right side so the screw- on spinner would stay tightened as the auto was in forward motion. This style of \\"knock-off\\" wheel was common on road cars until the development of the lug nut method attaching the wheel. == Spinner hubcaps == The spinner hubcap was introduced into the commercial vehicle and passenger automobile market in the 1930s. Automotive designer Harley Earl expressed a brash philosophy behind his 1950s automobiles that included \\"glittering spinner hubcaps.\\" During the 1950s and 1960s automobile manufacturers offered simulated wire wheel covers for a look of luxury that featured criss-crossing spokes designed to look like the real wire wheels that were used on vehicles in the 1920s and 1930s. These \\"spinner-wheel covers\\" were available on standard as well as featured on custom cars, and lowriders quickly adapted them for their own vehicles. During the early-1960s, the simulated wire wheel covers returned, but with new look designed to emphasize sportiness with their radiating spokes and center \\"spinner caps.\\" These classic center spinner caps feature a rigidly mounted propeller-like center element, usually with two or three projecting \\"blades.\\" They were intended to simulate the knock-off hubs that were used on vintage racing vehicles and classic sports cars where a hammer or special wrench was used on the spinner to release or tighten the wheel to the hub. These spinner hubcaps were most often an optional appearance upgrade to the standard equipment hubcaps or full wheel covers that attached to stamped steel wheels. Top trim models sometimes included spinner wheel covers as standard equipment to appeal to youthful customers. In the late 1960s, U.S. Federal safety standards banned the use of protruding bar spinners on automobiles. ==Other uses== Dodge four-bladed \\"spinner\\" wheel cover The mid-1950s Dodge four-bladed \\"spinner\\" wheel covers became an icons for the era and also became an item popular to owners to customize their cars. Spinners were add on accessory marketed during the 1950s to decorate regular wheel covers for a custom look. Center spinner hubcaps were also available as original equipment from automakers. Custom wheels for lowriders also used naked ladies on wheel covers and these were the first to feature a floating or spinner-type wheel device. A bracket was used to mount to the spindle so while the lady stood still the wheel spun around. Similarly, the Rolls-Royce Phantom has anti-spinners -- the \\"RR\\" logo in the center of the hub is mounted on a spinner with an offset weight designed to ensure that the logo is always the right way up when the car is parked. The hubometers used on large trucks, buses, and trailers that appear to be stationary while the wheel is turning to accurately measure the actual distance covered. They are actually enclosed and float in a liquid with anti-freeze as to be functional in severe low temperatures without freezing. ==Modern concept == Rotating spinner wheel The modern spinner device is a decorative kinetic attachment to the wheel of an automobile. The spinner covers the center of a car's wheel and is designed to independently rotate by using one or more roller bearings to isolate the spinner from the wheel, enabling it to turn while the wheel is at rest. Legislative bills were proposed in several states to ban spinner type wheels and hubcaps that simulate movement even when a vehicle is stopped because they could be disconcerting to other motorists and present a safety hazard. Spinners were popular during the early-2000s within the hip-hop community of the United States. Since the mid-2000s, they are gradually fading out of vogue in popular culture. ==Music== The spinner-type automobile hubcaps were the inspiration for a Detroit-area R&B;/soul group, The Domingoes, to rename themselves The Spinners in the late 1950s. In 1960, Pat Davis recorded the song \\"Spinner Hub Caps\\". ==See also== *Custom wheel *Hubcap == References == Category:Automotive accessories Category:Automotive styling features Category:Auto parts Category:Vehicle modifications Category:American inventions ","title":"Spinner (wheel)"},{"id":"2558366","text":"How to Talk Minnesotan is a book by Howard Mohr, a former writer for A Prairie Home Companion.

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Vanuatu, formerly known as the New Hebrides, an island group in the South Pacific. Between 1906 and 1980, the islands were an Anglo-French Condominium. One of the outcomes of this arrangement was that both countries issued their own postage stamps for the islands, although towards the end of the Condominium, there were joint issues with the initials ER (Elizabeth II Regina) for the UK, and RF (R√©publique Fran√ßaise) for France. == British issues == Stamp of Fiji overprinted 'New Hebrides Condominium', 1908. A 1920 stamp of the New Hebrides surcharged \\"2d\\" by the British authorities on French version of the joint issues. The first British issues, in 1908 and 1910, were produced by overprinting stamps of Fiji with \\"NEW HEBRIDES / CONDOMINIUM\\". These were followed by a joint issue with the French authorities, inscribed \\"NEW HEBRIDES\\" over a design including the coats of arms of both France and Britain and denominated in British currency. These were in use for several years, but as the stocks ran out in 1920, the less-popular values had to be surcharged \\"1d.\\" and \\"2d.\\". New stamps in different colours came in the following year, but further surcharges became necessary again, in 1924. 1925 saw another joint issue of nine values similar to the 1911 stamps, but this time both pence and centime denominations appeared on the same stamp. The British version had the pence (or shilling) denomination on the right side, and was printed on the \\"multiple crown and script CA\\" watermark paper, while the French version had the centimes on the left, was inscribed \\"NOUVELLES HEBRIDES\\", and printed on paper watermarked \\"R F\\"; otherwise they appeared identical. The dual denomination scheme broke down when the value of the French franc declined, and for the next stamp issue, in 1938, the two administrations had simplified matters by using the same currency of \\"gold francs\\". The twelve values of the 1938 issues all depicted the same \\"beach scene\\", including huts, palm trees, a canoe, and a volcano in the distance. The stamps were inscribed \\"NEW HEBRIDES\\" at the top and \\"CONDOMINIUM\\" at the bottom. A standard Commonwealth 75th anniversary of the UPU issue followed in 1949, and a definitive issue in 1953. 1956 saw a set of four values commemorating the 50th anniversary of the condominium, and another set of definitives in 1957. Subsequent issues were mostly the common issues of the Commonwealth, with New Hebrides-specific issues appearing from 1967 onwards. == French issues == The first issues of the French, also in 1908 and 1910, were overprints on the stamps of their colony New Caledonia, in 1908 reading just \\"NOUVELLES HEBRIDES\\" and in 1910 adding \\"CONDOMINIUM\\". The joint issue of 1911, inscribed \\"NOUVELLES HEBRIDES\\" with denominations in centimes, was at first printed on British paper, then in 1912 on French paper watermarked \\"R F\\". As with the British, surcharged provisionals became necessary in 1920. French issues of 1925 and 1938 were analogous to their British counterparts, but in 1941, the 1938 stamps were overprinted \\"France Libre\\" to signify that the Free French Forces were in control instead of Vichy France. Postwar issues were generally consistent with British versions, differing primarily in being inscribed in French. ==Vanuatu== Modern stamps have been issued under the name Vanuatu since independence in 1980. ==Local stamps== 1897 Australasian New Hebrides Company 2d stamp. In 1897 a local inter-island postal service was started by the Australasian New Hebrides Company for which two local stamps were issued.

(Oral tradition and an erroneous state historical marker claim the town changed hands 56 times.) The story of the small town is emblematic of the many military campaigns that swept through western Virginia and, later, the new state of West Virginia. ==1861== *Union Col. Lewis \\"Lew\\" Wallace, in command of the 11th Indiana Zouaves, occupied Romney for a few hours on June 13. *The next day, Col. Ambrose P. Hill's Confederates occupied the town. *Confederate Col. John C. Vaughn of the 3rd Tennessee was apparently stationed in Romney, from which, under orders of A.P. Hill of the 13th Virginia Infantry, he attacked Federal forces at New Creek on June 18. *Confederate Capt. Turner Ashby established the headquarters of the 7th Virginia Cavalry at \\"Camp Washington\\" on the George W. Washington farm, \\"Ridgedale,\\" immediately north of Hanging Rocks and across the South Branch Potomac River from Wire Bridge. *In July, Col. A. C. Cummings of Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Jackson's command that had fought at the First Battle of Manassas occupied Romney. *In August, the Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser weekly newspaper in Romney ceased publication after its closure by occupying Union Army forces. *Confederate Col. Angus William McDonald was in command at Romney when it was attacked by Federals on September 23; McDonald had been advised by General Robert E. Lee on September 18 that the Federals were withdrawing from Romney. After feigning an attack through Mechanicsburg Gap, the Federals launched their main attack from Hanging Rock. On September 24, McDonald gave way before the stronger Federal force, but retook the town the next day as the disorganized enemy retreated across the South Branch bridge toward Keyser. Federal forces consisted of the 4th Ohio and 8th Ohio Infantry and some members of the Ringgold Cavalry under Capt. John Keys; Confederate forces were the 114th and 77th Virginia militia regiments. *On October 24, Federal Ohio and Virginia infantry (with some light artillery and Ringgold Cavalry) attacked through Mechanicsburg Gap; on October 26 the Confederate defenders fled. There was a skirmish at Wire Bridge as part of this assault. It was as a result of this Federal success that Col. Benjamin F. Kelley issued his \\"Address to the People of Hampshire County and the Upper Potomac\\". For a time after this, Federals under the command of Col. Samuel H. Dunning of the 5th Ohio Infantry occupied Romney. ==1862== *On January 7, an advance guard of Confederates was defeated by about 2,000 Federals under Colonel Dunning at Blue's Gap. *On January 10, Federal troops under Frederick W. Lander evacuated Romney and Confederate cavalry under the command of Captains George F. Sheetz and E. H. Shans occupied the town; Brig. Gen. William W. Loring was placed in command and \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson returned to Winchester. This set the stage for General Jackson's resignation, which was declined. * On February 2 ‚Äì 4 Confederate General Loring evacuated Romney. *On February 7, after General Jackson had been forced to withdraw his units to Winchester, Federal forces under General Lander reoccupied the town and later broke up \\"the rebel nest at Bloomery Gap.\\" *Following apparent occupation by Confederates in the spring, Union Lt. Col. Stephen W. Downey of the 3rd Maryland Infantry, Potomac Home Brigade took command of Federal troops at Romney on March 3; in early May, Downey left his troops there and received a new command in Pendleton County. *From April 24 ‚Äì 28, the Federal Ringgold and Washington Cavalry were stationed in Romney. *During early 1862, Blenker's Federal division marched through Romney. *On June 13, the Federal Army occupies Romney after a brief skirmish with the Confederate Army. *From September 13 ‚Äì 15, Confederate Col. John D. Imboden occupied Romney for several days after a Federal withdrawal; he used the opportunity to set a successful ambush for Federal troops about two miles out of town. *On October 2 the 1st New York Cavalry passed through Romney. *On December 1 the Ringgold Cavalry skirmished with Confederates in Romney. *Captain Keys of the Ringgold cavalry was reported to have left Romney on December 22 for Winchester. *One week later, Brig. Gen. Robert H. Milroy and his cavalry escort passed through on his way to take command of Federal forces in Winchester. ==1863== *On January 8 (or 11), Col. James Washburn had been ordered by General Kelley to fall back to Romney with his entire Union force; by January 20, Washburn was in Romney with a force of about 1,400 men. Some remained until the middle of March. *On April 7, Federals attacked Confederate partisan cavalry commander \\"Hanse\\" McNeill near Purgitsville, one day after his successful action at Burlington when he had captured Lt. William F. Speer and eleven of the Ringgold Cavalry's foraging party. Romney was securely in Federal hands at that time and remained so until the Confederates moved into the Shenandoah Valley as part of their second invasion of the North (the Gettysburg Campaign). *On June 7, General Lee commanded Imboden's cavalry to move against Romney in order \\"to attract the enemy's attention in Hampshire County.\\" It is not clear exactly when Imboden took Romney again, for a Federal communication of June 13 implies that Romney was then being abandoned. Local tradition places Captain McNeill's Rangers in Romney around that time. *On June 19, the Ringgold Cavalry moved through Romney in one day. *On June 21, the Lafayette Cavalry came through Romney. *On July 22, Confederate scouts were reported to be moving in the direction of Romney following the assignment of General Imboden to the Valley District. After the retreat from Gettysburg, Confederates occupied the Shenandoah and South Branch valleys for a month or two until the Federals began to move in the area in large numbers. During the following months, Romney may have changed hands several times without official record. *On August 4, the Ringgold Cavalry again occupied the town. On August 6 or 7, General Kelley passed through Romney as he moved his headquarters from Hedgesville to New Creek. *On November 6, Campbell's Federal brigade left Romney. *On November 16, Confederate Captain McNeill with 170 cavalry captured 25 prisoners, 80 wagons, and 255 horses near Burlington; this occurred during a time when General Lee felt that Romney, Petersburg, and Martinsburg were too strongly held for a direct Confederate attack. Lt. Col. John P. Linton and his Federals passed through Romney several times on his way to and from Springfield. ==1864== *On January 5, Fitzhugh Lee passed through Romney, which Maj. Harry Gilmor and Captain McNeill had occupied a few days before; following their departure, Capt. Henry A. Meyers occupied Romney on January 8. Later in the month it was yet again recaptured by Confederates. *On February 3, a detachment of Thomas L. Rosser's unit (part of Jubal A. Early's command) entered Romney. In a complicated set of circumstances, Romney was occupied once or twice daily between February 1 and 3 inclusive. A detachment of the 8th New York Heavy Artillery was among the units involved. *Sometime after the middle of March, Union cavalry moved through Romney. *On May 10, Col. Jacob Higgins, commanding about 500 Federal cavalry, was surprised by detachments of Imboden's cavalry; he tried to rally his men \\"on the plains of Romney\\" but was pushed out of town. On May 11 Imboden departed. *About two weeks later, the Ringgold Cavalry again passed through town on a scouting mission. *About the middle of June, the Ringgolds passed through again. *On June 26, part of the Union 6th West Virginia Volunteer Cavalry Regiment scouted Romney. *On July 3, the 6th West Virginia Cavalry returned to Romney. *On July 4, Confederates rang the Hampshire County Courthouse bell in Romney to announce the approach of Federal scouts. During most of the month of July, McNeill and Harness were in the vicinity of Romney. *On July 10, Confederates again briefly occupied Romney. *On July 14, McNeill was again in Romney. *On July 20, the Federal 6th West Virginia Cavalry again was in town. *On August 3, Confederate general John McCausland, returning from his raid on Chambersburg, occupied Romney for two days. *On August 6, Confederate scouts stationed at Romney warned McCausland of an impending attack upon his forces by General Averell who came through Romney that day. Averell successfully attacked McCausland at Moorefield and took approximately 420 prisoners. *August 9, the 6th West Virginia Cavalry came through Romney; they did again on August 14 and August 17. *On August 28 McNeill was said to yet again be in Romney. *On November 6, Union scouts passed through town. *On November 26, members of the 6th West Virginia Cavalry camped in Romney. *On December 25 scouts from 22nd Pennsylvania Cavalry passed through town. ==1865== *On February 5, Union cavalry passed through Romney. *On February 21, the Confederate McNeill's Rangers, now under the command of Captain McNeill's son, lieutenant Jessee McNeill, passed through Romney going to and from Cumberland, where they carried out the daring kidnap of Generals George Crook and Benjamin Franklin Kelley. *Maxwell and Swisher's History of Hampshire County states that Romney was held for the last time by Confederate forces on April 15, when parts of the companies line(?) and Harness were in the vicinity of Romney. Local tradition states that McNeill's Rangers surrendered at Sycamore Dale near the Romney bridge in May. *Edward H. McDonald and George F.

Its usefulness in people infected by H. pylori is limited. It is used by mouth and rectally. Common side effects include constipation. Serious side effects may include bezoar formation and encephalopathy. Use appears to be safe in pregnancy and breastfeeding. How it works is unclear but is believed to involve binding to the ulcer and protecting it from further damage. Sucralfate was approved for medical use in the United States in 1981. It is available as a generic medication. In the United States the wholesale cost is about US$0.22 per dose. In 2017, it was the 218th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than two million prescriptions. ==Medical uses== Sucralfate is used for the treatment of active duodenal ulcers not related to the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as the mechanism behind these ulcers is due to acid oversecretion. It is not FDA approved for gastric ulcers, but is widely used because of evidence of efficacy. The use for sucralfate in peptic ulcer disease has diminished recently, but it is still the preferred agent for stress ulcer prevention. Sucralfate has also been used for the following conditions: * Active duodenal ulcer not related to NSAID use * Maintenance therapy for resolved duodenal ulcers * Gastric ulcer not related to NSAID use and gastritis due to GERD‚ÄîTriple combination therapy with lansoprazole + cisapride + sucralfate can significantly improve symptoms and quality of life and was more cost-effective than ranitidine combination group. * Aphthous ulcer and stomatitis due to radiation or chemotherapy‚ÄîThe 2013 guidelines of the International Society of Oral Oncology does not recommended sucralfate for the prevention of oral mucositis in head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy or chemoradiation due to a lack of efficacy found in a well-designed, randomized controlled trial. * Gastro-esophageal reflux disease during pregnancy‚ÄîFirst-line drug therapy combined with lifestyle and diet modification. * Stress ulcer prophylaxis‚ÄîThe use of sucralfate rather than H2 antagonists for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and measures to prevent aspiration, such as continuous subglottic suctioning, have been shown to reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Sucralfate is less effective for prophylaxis against gastrointestinal bleeding than either a PPI or H2-blocker. For that reason, it is not commonly used for stress ulcer prophylaxis. * Prevention of stricture formation‚ÄîSucralfate has an inhibitory effect on stricture formation in experimental corrosive burns and can be used in the treatment of corrosive esophageal burns to enhance mucosal healing and suppress stricture formation * Proctitis from ulcerative colitis * Rectal bleeding due to proctitis from radiation to treat cancers of the cervix, prostate, and colon. ** Grade 1 bleeding experienced immediate relief with sucrasulfate enema for 1 month. ** Grade 2 bleeding, sucrasulfate enema] and/or coagulation were effective. ** Grade 3 bleeding lasted for 1 year despite frequent transfusions and coagulation. ** Grade 2 and 3 rectal bleeding occurred in 8.5% of people. The most significant risk factor was the ICRU-CRBED. Prompt treatment with a combination of sucrasulfate enema and coagulation is effective in controlling Grade 1 and 2 rectal bleeding without the development of fistula or stricture. * Treatment of anastomotic ulcer after gastric bypass surgery * Sucralfate suspension is recommended by the US- based National Capital Poison Center (Poison Control) as an intervention for known or suspected button battery ingestions to reduce the risk and severity of injury to the esophagus prior to the battery's endoscopic removal. *Protection against ventilator-associated pneumonia - Reductions in gastric acidity and volumes increase bacterial overgrowth and the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Sucralfate may be considered to have the advantage over H2-blockers and PPIs in this regard because sucralfate does not change the pH of gastric fluid. A majority of meta-analyses found that sucralfate therapy decreased the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia compared to H2-antagonists. ==Side effects== The most common side effect seen is constipation (2-3%). Less commonly reported side effects (<0.5%) include flatulence, headache, hypophosphatemia, xerostomia (dry mouth), and bezoar formation. Use of this drug is not recommended for people with chronic kidney failure, as it might cause aluminium accumulation and toxicity. A few well- controlled studies have been carried out investigating the safety and efficacy of sucralfate in children and pregnant women (Pregnancy Category B). ==Mechanism of action== Sucralfate is a locally acting substance that in an acidic environment (pH < 4) reacts with hydrochloric acid in the stomach to form a cross-linking, viscous, paste-like material capable of acting as an acid buffer for as long as 6 to 8 hours after a single dose. It also attaches to proteins on the surface of ulcers, such as albumin and fibrinogen, to form stable insoluble complexes.

The dam is located approximately northwest of Orofino and impounds the Dworshak Reservoir for flood control and hydroelectricity generation. With a height of , Dworshak is the third tallest dam in the United States and the tallest straight-axis concrete dam in the Western Hemisphere. Lacking fish ladders, Dworshak Dam blocks fish passage and completely extirpated anadromous fish migration into the upper reaches of the North Fork Clearwater River and its tributaries in Idaho.https://www.fws.gov/dworshak/pdf/Dworshak%20Complex.pdf Construction of the dam by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) began in 1966 and was completed in 1973. ==History== The proposal for Dworshak Dam originated in a 1953 USACE survey of the lower Snake River drainage basin for suitable sites to develop reservoir storage and hydroelectric power generation. Dworshak was one of seven dam sites considered on the Snake, Salmon and Clearwater River systems. The final site for Dworshak Dam was chosen at a point on the North Fork of the Clearwater above its confluence with the larger Clearwater River. The project was authorized on October 23, 1962, as Bruces Eddy the name was later changed to honor Senator Henry Dworshak (1894‚Äì1962), who was instrumental in gaining congressional approval for the The dam was controversial from the start, because it would block fish migration and its reservoir would flood a large portion of the winter range of elk in the Clearwater River basin. The North Fork of the Clearwater River had an excellent run of steelhead trout and \\"may have been the finest population of large-size steelhead in the world\\". However, proponents of the project held that the construction of a fish hatchery would maintain the river's steelhead runs, and that the construction of the dam would render other dam projects in the Clearwater River basin unnecessary. Another big incentive for the project was flood control; supporters of Dworshak cited a devastating flood in 1948, when the Clearwater River reached a peak of ‚Äîeleven times its normal flow‚Äîas further reason for the construction of a large storage dam. While clearing and preparations at the dam site were underway as early as June 1965, actual construction did not begin until early 1966 with the excavation of a diameter diversion tunnel and the creation of a high cofferdam to divert the river around the dam site. Excavation of keyways in the canyon walls to provide future foundations for the concrete commenced in 1966, and continued through 1968. The first bucket of concrete was placed in early 1968, and by May 28, 1969, more than had been poured in the dam. Concrete placement was accomplished by a cableway system supported by three movable towers on the canyon rims, transporting buckets that each had a capacity of of wet concrete. The diversion tunnel was closed on September 27, 1971, allowing the reservoir to begin filling, and the last concrete was poured on the dam crest on January 27, 1973. Three generating units of the power plant were also installed in 1973, and by March 1, the reservoir had risen to a sufficient level to allow power generation to begin. The reservoir first reached full capacity on July 3, 1973. After the dam was completed, the USACE acquired of land adjacent to the reservoir (later expanded to ), and has since managed it for winter habitat of elk and white-tailed deer. Because Dworshak Dam is too high for a fish ladder to be economically feasible, the USACE constructed the Dworshak National Fish Hatchery (DNFH) at a cost of $21 million to mitigate losses of the North Fork steelhead run caused by Dworshak Dam. The hatchery is located on the small peninsula of land between the North Fork and the main Clearwater River directly above their confluence. Now operated by the National Fish Hatchery System, the fish hatchery actually went into operation in April 1969, four years before the dam was completed. The hatchery has a capacity of 6,000 adult fish, and releases about 3.4 million juveniles into the river system each year. The Dworshak Dam power station was designed to accommodate six generating units for purposes of peaking power production. However, this form of operation would cause excessively large flow fluctuations on the North Fork Clearwater River, and the main Clearwater River below their confluence at Ahsahka. A dam was to be built on the Clearwater River above Lenore to provide a forebay for smoothing out Dworshak releases, but due to opposition by local residents it was never built. Although it would have been fitted with a fish ladder, the Lenore dam would have affected steelhead and salmon migration to the entire upper Clearwater River and its tributaries, including the South Fork, Middle Fork, Lochsa, and Selway Rivers. In addition, the flooding caused by its -long reservoir would require the relocation of the Dworshak fish hatchery. The proposed fifth and sixth units of the plant were deauthorized in 1990, and the fourth unit was deauthorized in 1995. During initial filling of the reservoir, the dam developed several large vertical cracks on the upstream side ‚Äì some more than long ‚Äì due to the rapid change of water pressure from the rising reservoir. Workers had to drill diameter drain holes between the cracks and the dam's existing foundation drainage system, or \\"drainage gallery\\", at intervals, relieving the pressure on the dam's backside. In June 1980, the dam again experienced leakage problems when a crack opened on its upstream face, sending more than of water spraying across the downstream side of the dam. Seventy drainage holes were drilled into the crack to relieve pressure before the crack was permanently sealed by an aggregate of cement, volcanic ash, and sawdust. The cost of the repair exceeded $1 million. The suspension Dent Bridge was constructed upstream of the dam, and the deck truss Grandad Bridge was built upstream. ==Specifications== Dworshak Dam Dworshak Dam is a concrete gravity dam with a sloped downstream face and vertical upstream face, standing high from the foundations, above the riverbed and measuring long along its crest. The top of the dam is wide at an elevation of above sea level. The main body of the structure contains approximately of concrete. High water releases are controlled by a set of outlet works with four gates, capable of releasing , and a spillway controlled by two tainter gates. The spillway has a capacity of at maximum reservoir elevation. Dworshak Reservoir is the name of the lake formed behind the dam. At normal maximum water levels of above sea level, the reservoir stretches upstream, covering and containing of water with of shoreline. The hydroelectric plant located at the base of the dam is a long concrete structure and contains one 346,000 horsepower (hp) and two turbines that power one 220 megawatt (MW) and two 90 MW generators, respectively, for a total capacity of 400 MW. The rated hydraulic head for the powerhouse is , with a maximum of when the reservoir is full and a minimum of required for power generation. Up to of water can be released through the power plant at maximum capacity. The overload capacity of the two small units is 103.5 MW and for the large unit is 253.0 MW, for a total of 460 MW. If installed, Units 4, 5, and 6, each with a capacity of 220 MW, would bring the total generating capacity to 1,060 MW, making it one of the largest hydroelectric plants in Idaho. ==Operations== Dworshak Reservoir, seen nearly full in June 2003 The total usable storage capacity or active capacity of Dworshak Reservoir, including flood control, is . The inactive capacity (the portion of the reservoir's capacity below the power generating outlets and the lower river outlet works) is , and the dead pool (below the river outlet works) corresponds to a storage of . In addition, the reservoir has a surcharge capacity (above the spillway gates) of , bringing the maximum amount of water that can be retained behind the dam to . Most of the active capacity not used for flood control is utilized for power production. Because the Lenore dam on the Clearwater River was never built, Dworshak cannot be used as a peaking power facility. Thus, the power plant is operated as a base load plant, with a relatively constant release. Discharge rates from the dam only increase significantly during high water summers, when flooding requires the opening of the spillways. The power plant generates an average of 1.693 billion KWh each year. Water releases from Dworshak Dam are also controlled to optimize power generation at four downstream dams on the Snake River and four more on the Columbia River. Each winter, the level of Dworshak Reservoir is drawn down an average of to prepare for the North Fork's annual freshet, which once could reach more than after a heavy snowmelt. The reservoir is required to maintain a minimum of of winter flood-storage space, and dam releases are operated so that water levels reach a maximum of in July. However, annual flood control reservations vary with the amount of snowpack in the drainage basin above the dam. The annual flood-control drawdown generally begins in September and ends on April 1 of the following year; snowmelt floods are captured in the reservoir between April and July. Although the reservoir covers more than at full pool, the surface area decreases to at the lowest point of the drawdown. Flood storage space in Dworshak can be interchanged with other major dams in the Columbia River system, including large Columbia mainstem dams such as Grand Coulee, depending on varying flood control requirements in the Columbia Basin. Water releases from Dworshak are also timed to benefit Pacific salmon and steelhead migration in the Clearwater, Snake and Columbia Rivers. During late summer through the fall, large volumes of cold water are released through the dam's low level outlets to help cool water in downstream rivers, creating more suitable temperatures for these fish species. These environmental or \\"flow augmentation\\" releases significantly increase water levels during the late summer, with up to being released through the dam in August and in September. The temperature of the released water generally varies from . ==Tourism and economy== One of the major benefits touted by proponents of the Dworshak Dam was that it would provide recreation and associated economic benefits to local residents. The annual visitation to Dworshak is estimated at between 110,000 and 140,000 people, mostly during the summer high water months. Recreational activities include boating, water-skiing, camping, fishing, hiking and hunting; six boat ramps lie adjacent to the reservoir. Idaho's Dworshak State Park is located on Dworshak Reservoir about north of the dam. The uppermost arm of the reservoir extends into the Clearwater National Forest. A regional visitor center is located at Dworshak Dam, and tours are available of the dam itself. However, the large annual drawdown of the reservoir causes boat ramps and marinas to be out of reach for months each year and an unsightly \\"bathtub ring\\" to be visible along the shoreline. A study by the University of Idaho calculated that this mode of operation causes the loss of between $4.5‚Äì5.9 million of tourism revenues each year. The creation of a slackwater pool along of the North Fork formerly assisted logging operations in the region, although the scale of the lumber industry has decreased significantly since the 20th century. About 81 million board feet were transported on Dworshak Reservoir between 1988 and 1991; however, logs have not been barged on the lake since 1991. This is in part because of the implementation of a late-summer flow augmentation scheme that requires greater drawdowns of the reservoir, putting log-handling facilities well above the water level, and also because of the development of backcountry logging roads that allow more efficient transport by truck. It has been suggested that some of Dworshak's flood control space be shifted to Grand Coulee Dam in northern Washington in order to provide increased water for flow augmentation; this would carry the added benefits of improving recreation on the lake. ==See also== *List of largest reservoirs in the United States *List of the tallest dams in the United States ==References== ==Works cited== * * ==External links== *Dworshak Dam and Reservoir ‚Äì U.S. Army Corps of Engineers *Dworshak Visitor Center - U.S. Army Corps of Engineers *The Dworshak Dam Collection from the University of Idaho Library Digital Collections ‚Äì Digitized photographs and documents pertaining to the planning, development and construction of the Dworshak Dam, featuring documents and photographs detailing both the legislative and physical development of the dam.

This allows the index to remain small, even though the table may be rather large, and have extreme selectivity. Suppose you have a transaction table where entries start out with STATUS = 'A' (active), and then may pass through other statuses ('P' for pending, 'W' for \\"being worked on\\") before reaching a final status, 'F', at which point it is no longer likely to be processed again. In PostgreSQL, a useful partial index might be defined as: create index partial_status on txn_table (status) where status in ('A', 'P', 'W'); This index would not bother storing any of the millions of rows that have reached \\"final\\" status, 'F', and would allow queries looking for transactions that still \\"need work\\" to efficiently search via this index. Similarly, a partial index can be used to index only those rows where a column is not null, which will be of benefit when the column usually is null. create index partial_object_update on object_table (updated_on) where updated_on is not null; This index would allow the following query to read only the updated tuples: select * from object_table where updated_on is not null order by updated_on; It is not necessary that the condition be the same as the index criterion; Stonebraker's paper below presents a number of examples with indexes similar to the following: create index partial_salary on employee(age) where salary > 2100; ==Support== In SQL Server, this type of index is called a filtered index. Partial indexes have been supported in PostgreSQL since version 7.2, released in February 2002. SQLite supports partial indexes since version 3.8.0. MongoDB supports partial indexes in its latest release V3.2. MySQL as of version 8.0 does not support partial indexes. In MySQL, the term \\"partial index\\" is sometimes used to refer to prefix indexes, where only a truncated prefix of each value is stored in the index.

The name was applied to a program begun in 1977 to convert the older, mainly streamlined, cars from steam heating to head-end power. Head end power conversions were performed at Amtrak's Beech Grove Shops, outside of Indianapolis. The program was completed by the mid-1980s, and the fleet was fully retired by 2019. The last car was a former Great Northern Railway full-length dome car, which was manufactured in 1955 and retired in 2019 by Amtrak, due to the age and expense of maintaining the Great Dome Car. ==History== The rebuild cost $300,000 per car.

Heritage baggage and dining cars were used on the single-level trains serving the Eastern U.S. out of New York City through late 2017. The baggage cars from Amtrak's Viewliner II order, placed in 2010, fully replaced the Heritage versions: the last was delivered in December 2015. Twelve diners are also now in revenue service. In January 2018, due to high maintenance costs for the 60+ year old cars, Amtrak announced the retirement of the last five remaining \\"Pacific Parlour\\" Hi-Level lounge cars still in active service on the Coast Starlight, bringing an end to the era of Heritage Fleet equipment in regular revenue service. The last run using one of these cars was on February 4, 2018.

They asked Rheinmetall-Borsig to produce a new and more capable AT-gun. They first designed the Pak 37 in 1935, but the German authorities did not approve it because of its low capabilities. Rheinmetall-Borsig were forced to create a new gun under the designation Pak 38, which fitted a new and longer L/60 barrel and was approved for mass production in 1939. ==Service== Pak 38 5 cm Pak 38 Nijmegen Hunnerpark The Pak 38 was first used by the German forces during the Second World War in April 1941. When the Germans faced Soviet tanks in 1941 during Operation Barbarossa, the Pak 38 was one of the few early guns capable of penetrating the sloped armor of the T-34's hull at close range. The gun was also equipped with Panzergranate 40 APCR shots with a hard tungsten carbide core, in an attempt to penetrate the armor of the heavier KV-1 tank. Although it was replaced by more powerful weapons, it remained a useful weapon and remained in service with the Wehrmacht until the end of the war. The Pak 38 carriage was also used for the 7.5 cm Pak 97/38 and the 7.5 cm Pak 50 guns. Romania imported 110 Pak 38s in March 1943.

Jeongjo of Joseon (28 October 1752 ‚Äì 18 August 1800) was the 22nd ruler of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea (r. 1776‚Äì1800). He made various attempts to reform and improve the nation of Korea. He was preceded by his grandfather King Yeongjo (r. 1724‚Äì1776) and succeeded by his son King Sunjo (r. 1800‚Äì1834). Some say Jeongjo is one of the most successful and visionary rulers of the Joseon Dynasty ushering it into a Golden Age. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Born as Yi San (ÊùéÁ•ò), he was the son of Crown Prince Sado (who was put to death by his own father, King Yeongjo) and Lady Hyegyeong (who wrote an autobiography, The Memoirs of Lady Hyegyeong detailing her life as the ill-fated Crown Princess of Korea). His elder brother Crown Prince Uiso died in infancy. His mother Lady Hyegyeong's collection of memoirs serves as a significant source of historical information on the political happenings during the reigns of King Yeongjo (her father-in-law), King Jeongjo (her son), and King Sunjo (her grandson). In 1762, his father, Crown Prince Sado, was executed by King Yeongjo (Crown Prince Sado's father and Prince Yi San's grandfather) after long conflicts and Sado's years of mental illness. Crown Prince Sado opposed the ruling party Noron party. Eight years later Yi San asked to visit Sado's living quarter but his Grandfather King Yeongjo refused. So he refused to attend Crown Prince Sado's funeral. On February 21, 1764, Yi San became the adoptive son of Crown Prince Hyojang and Princess Consort Hyosun by the order of King Yeongjo.Ïù∏Ï†ïÏ†Ñ ÏõîÎåÄÏóêÏÑú ÏπúÌûà Ìñ•ÏùÑ Ï†ÑÌïòÎã§. Ïú°ÏÉÅÍ∂ÅÏóê Î∞∞ÏïåÌïòÍ≥† Ï∞ΩÏùòÍ∂ÅÏóê Îì§Î•¥Îã§ Crown Prince Hyojang was the elder half-brother of his father, Crown Prince Sado. Crown Prince Hyojang though, had died during his childhood. King Yeongjo made Yi San a part of Hyojang's family because he was concerned that Yi San, who was Sado's son and successor, would be opposed. The Noron faction protested Yi San's legitimacy as the royal successor under the claim that Yi San was the 'Son of a prisoner' or 'Son of a psycho' and thus ineligible to succeed the throne. This was a major source of vexation for King Yeongjo for an extended period. After 1762 to 1777, some members of Noron attempted to deport Jeongjo for his relation to Crown Prince Sado and open the path of succession for his half-brothers Prince Eunjeon, Prince Euneon and, Prince Eunshin. His grand uncle Hong In-han and Chung Hu-kyom, adopted son of Princess Hwa wan, were amongst them. When he was the Crown Prince, King Jeongjo met Hong Guk-yeongDigital Korean studies (Korean site) http://www.koreandb.net/koreanking/html/person/pki60022.htm (ÌôçÍµ≠ÏòÅ, Ê¥™ÂúãÊ¶Æ), a controversial politician who first strongly supported Jeongjo's accession and toiled to improve the king's power, but ended up being expelled because of his desire for power. Another helper was Kim Jong-su(ÍπÄÏ¢ÖÏàò, ÈáëÈçæÁßÄ), in spite of being a member of Noron. In 1775, one year before King Yeongjo's death, King Yeongjo was appointed regent for him. However, King Yeongjo did not give him any military power. Jeongjo spent much of his reign trying to clear his father's name. He also moved the court to the city of Suwon to be closer to his father's grave. He built Hwaseong Fortress to guard the tomb. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. ===Accession=== The era before his rule was in disorder as his father was killed by royal decree of his own father, King Jeongjo's grandfather. King Yeongjo's ultimate decision to execute Crown Prince Sado was greatly influenced by other politicians who were against the Crown Prince. After King Yeongjo's death and on the day that Jeongjo became the King of Joseon, he sat on his throne in the throne room and looked at everyone and said, \\"I am the son of the late Crown Prince Sado...\\"\\"Í≥ºÏù∏ÏùÄ ÏÇ¨ÎèÑÏÑ∏ÏûêÏùò ÏïÑÎì§Ïù¥Îã§\\" Ohmynews 2006.10.13. This was a bold statement that sent shivers down the spines of all the politicians who were complicit in his father's death. During his accession, he also issued a royal decree that his mother, Lady Hyegyeong, be a Dowager Queen since his father, her husband, was supposed to be the King before him. Thus, she became the Queen Dowager, the widow of Crown Prince Sado. From then on, King Jeongjo experienced many turbulent periods, but overcame them with the aid of Hong Guk-yeong, Kim Chong-su. In 1776, Hong Sang-beom, Hong Kye-neung and other some member of Noron was attempted of a military coup d'√©tat and kill him, but their plans was exposed early. Some assassins were secretly in royal palace but Jeongjo repulsed assassins and personally arrested a suspect. Jeongjo executed Hong Sang-beom, Hong Kye- neung, other some member of Norons, but put to death Prince Eunjeon, Hong In- han, and Chung Hu-kyom. In 1785 he erected Changyongyeong (Ïû•Ïö©ÏòÅ, Â£ØÂãáÁáü), this is the King's royal bodyguards. Before In 1782, Jeongjo selected by competitive examination some officers, who were then organized into the unit of Changyongyeong. Before this time was the Naekeunwe, royal bodyguards of Joseon dynasties created by Taejong of Joseon in 1407. But Jeongjo mistrusted the Naekeumwi, so he personally created Changyonegyeong. ===Renaissance=== King Jeongjo led the new renaissance of the Joseon Dynasty, but was initially stopped by continuing the policy of Yeongjo's Tangpyeong rule. He tried to control the politics of the whole nation to advance and further national progress. He made various reforms throughout his reign, notably establishing Kyujanggak (Í∑úÏû•Í∞Å), a royal library. The primary purpose of Kyujanggak was to improve the cultural and political stance of Joseon and to recruit gifted officers to help run the nation. Jeongjo also spearheaded bold new social initiatives, including opening government positions to those who were previously barred because of their social status. He had some knowledge of humanities and philosophy, Neo-Confucianism. One of the King's gentlemen, Kim Jong-su, imprinted onto the king and in tandem became a great father and a great teacher for him. He studied for a long time and read various books. Jeongjo had the support of the many Silhak scholars who supported Jeongjo's regal power, including Scholars Jeong Yak-yong, Pak Ji-won, Pak Je-ga and Yu Deuk-gong. His reign also saw the further growth and development of Joseon's popular culture. Jeongjo was resolutely selected for member of Soron and Namin party, reason selection background was checks and balances, strengthening of royal authority. He was opposed to new fashions in the composition style of Korean writing and personally taught composition to some intellectuals and bureaucrats called Munchebanjong(Î¨∏Ï≤¥Î∞òÏ†ï ÊñáÈ´îÂèçÊ≠£). ===Death=== In his final years, Jeongjo arranged for the marriage of his second son and successor Sunjo of Joseon to Lady Kim of the Andong clan, daughter of Kim Cho-sun, but did not live to see his son's marriage. In 1800, Jeongjo died suddenly under uncertain circumstances at the age of 47, without seeing much of his life's work come to fruition under his son, Sunjo.National Heritage ‚Äì Hwaseong There are many books regarding the mystery behind his death, and speculation as to the cause of his death continues even today. He is buried with his wife, Queen Hyoui, at the royal tomb of Geolleung (Í±¥Î¶â, ÂÅ•Èôµ) in the city of Hwaseong. == Family == *Father: King Jangjo of Joseon (13 February 1735 ‚Äì 12 July 1762) (Ï°∞ÏÑ† Ïû•Ï°∞)He is given the posthumous title, \\"Jangjo\\" (Ïû•Ï°∞) **Grandfather : King Yeongjo of Joseon (31 October 1694 ‚Äì 22 April 1776) (Ï°∞ÏÑ† ÏòÅÏ°∞) **Grandmother : Royal Noble Consort Yeong of the Jeonui Lee clan (15 August 1696 ‚Äì 23 August 1764) (ÏòÅÎπà Ïù¥Ïî®) *Mother: Queen Heongyeong of the Pungsan Hong clan (6 August 1735 ‚Äì 13 January 1816) (ÌóåÍ≤ΩÏôïÌõÑ ÌôçÏî®)Daughter of Hong Bong-han (ÌôçÎ¥âÌïú) and Lady Yi of the Hansun Yi clanQueen Heongyeong is also called \\"Lady Hyegyeong\\" (ÌòúÍ≤ΩÍ∂Å) **Grandfather : Hong Bong-Han (1713 ‚Äì 1778) (ÌôçÎ¥âÌïú) **Grandmother : Lady Lee of the Hansan Lee clan (1713 ‚Äì 1755) (ÌïúÏÇ∞ Ïù¥Ïî®) *Consorts and their Respective Issue(s): # Queen Hyoui of the Cheongpung Kim clan (5 January 1754 ‚Äì 10 April 1821) (Ìö®ÏùòÏôïÌõÑ ÍπÄÏî®)Daughter of Kim Si-muk (ÍπÄÏãúÎ¨µ) and Lady Hong of the Namyang Hong clan # Royal Noble Consort Ui of the Changnyeong Seong clan (6 August 1753 ‚Äì 4 November 1786) (ÏùòÎπà ÏÑ±Ïî®)Daughter of Seong Yun-u (ÏÑ±Ïú§Ïö∞) and Lady Im.

Historical sources disagree on whether he was of a Berber or an Arab origin. In July 710 CE, Tariq sent Tarif on a raid to test the southern coastline of the Iberian peninsula. According to legend he was aided by Julian, count of Ceuta, as a guide and emissary. Of this raid, Edward Gibbon writes: \\"One hundred Arabs and four hundred Africans passed over, in four vessels, from Tangier or Ceuta; the place of their descent on the opposite shore of the strait is marked by the name of Tarif their chief\\" which today is the city of Tarifa. They proceeded from there to reconnoiter the terrain along the coast as a possible entry point for a larger attack, traversing \\"eighteen miles through a hilly country to the castle and town of Julian; on which (it is still called Algezire) they bestowed the name of the Green Island, from a verdant cape that advances into the sea\\". There they were hospitably received by supportive Christians‚Äîperhaps Count Julian's kinsmen, friends, and supporters. The end result was a successful raid into an unguarded portion of Andalusia, followed by the safe return of the raiders with plunder and captives. This convinced Tariq that Iberia could be successfully invaded. Tarif subsequently accompanied Tariq ibn-Ziyad, when the latter launched the Islamic conquest of Hispania and defeated King Roderic in the Battle of Guadalete in 711. == References == * Edward Gibbon, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, vol. 9 (1776) * Ferrer-Gallardo, X., Albet-Mas, A., & Espi√±eira, K.

The module is described as a medium to high-level scenario which takes place in a castle surrounded by a strange gray mist. (preview) During their night's rest on their way to Glantri, the player characters are unexpectedly drawn into a large castle surrounded by an impenetrable, deadly mist. This is the result of a curse the wizard-noble Stephen Amber (Etienne d'Amberville) put on his treacherous relatives for murdering him. The only way to escape Castle Amber (or Ch√¢teau d'Amberville) is to explore the castle, putting up with the demented and at times insane members of the d'Amberville family and the other, often hostile, denizens, and open a hidden portal to the wilderness of the world of Averoigne, where the party can find the means to reach the inter-dimensional tomb in which Stephen Amber rests, in order to break the curse and return home. In this world, magic is frowned upon, and spellcasters may come to the attention of the Inquisition. ==Inspirations== The module's credits give special thanks to Clark Ashton Smith and Casiana Literary Enterprises, Inc., \\"for use of the Averoigne stories as inspirational material.\\" Castle Amber (Ch√¢teau d'Amberville) draws from the Averoigne stories of Clark Ashton Smith. The main non-player characters of the module, the Amber family (d'Amberville in French, as an option), are not actually in any of Smith's stories, and were created by the designer to provide a link to Averoigne. A selected bibliography is included at the rear of the module. In addition to the Averoigne references, there are individual encounters within the module that have allusions to stories written by others. One of the encounters in the module is an homage to (or copy of) the climax of Edgar Allan Poe's short story Fall of the House of Usher, involving a brother who can hear his dead sister, named Madeline in both cases, crying out from the grave where she was buried alive. The overall module has \\"a decidedly Edgar Allan Poe feel to it.\\" Another encounter calls to mind the title character and gruesome climax of Poe's Hop-Frog. Many of the creatures also had a \\"Lovecraftian\\" feel to them. ==Publication history== Castle Amber was the second module designed for use with the D&D; Expert Set. It was written by Tom Moldvay and published 1981 as a thirty two page booklet with an outer folder and a cover designed by Erol Otus. The module was developed by Dave Cook, Allen Hammack, Kevin Hendryx, Harold Johnson, Tom Moldvay, and Jon Pickens, and edited by Harold Johnson, Edward Sollers, and Steve Winter.Moldvay, Tom. Castle Amber, TSR, Inc., 1981 It features art by Jim Holloway, Harry Quinn, Jim Roslof, Stephen D. Sullivan, and Erol Otus. Mark of Amber was a sequel/remake of the original Castle Amber. It was reprinted in 1995 in the form of a boxed set, complete with an audio CD, map posters, and player handouts. It was part of the short lived Masters series. The Castle was renamed Ch√¢teau Sylaire. ==Reception== Castle Amber was ranked the 15th greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004, and was fondly remembered in Dragon Magazine the same year. In an earlier review in issue No. 35 of White Dwarf magazine, reviewer Jim Bambra rated Castle Amber 6 out of 10. Bambra saw the adventure as \\"an attempt to bring randomness back into D&D.;\\" Bambra considered Castle Amber a chaotic adventure and did not recommend it for purchase, noting that it \\"depends a lot on chance, leaving little room for skill, and at times can be deadly.\\" ==Further reading== * ==References== Category:Dungeons & Dragons modules Amber, Castle Category:Mystara ","title":"Castle Amber (module)"},{"id":"2558589","text":"Lisa Swayze DePrisco (born May 26, 1956) also known by her stage name, Lisa Niemi, is an American writer, director, actress and dancer.

Set in 1965, its plot concerns a wayward teenage girl who is sent to a New England all-girls private high school which holds an ominous secret related to the staff, history and woods surrounding the school. == Plot == In 1965, after burning down a tree in her yard, rebel teenager Heather Fasulo is sent to the boarding school Falburn Academy in the middle of the woods by her estranged mother Alice Fasulo and negligent father Joe Fasulo. The headmistress, Ms. Traverse, accepts Heather in spite of her father's bad financial condition. The displaced Heather becomes close friends with Marcy Turner, while they are maltreated by their abusive classmate Samantha Wise. During the night, Heather has a nightmare of a student named Ann, covered in blood, and hears voices that seem to be coming from the woods. The next day, Marcy tells Heather that Ann was taken to a mental institution after attempting to commit suicide, and that she'd been covered in blood. With the help of Marcy, Heather eventually learns to adjust to her new school, even having fun at times and making more friends. Ms. Traverse subjects Heather to special tests to see if she is \\"gifted\\", telling her that it is all part of her scholarship to the academy. The girls tell Heather a spooky story about the history of Falburn, which includes three young redheaded sisters who arrived at the school and turned out to be witches, killing the headmistress before leaving to the woods. Meanwhile, Samantha continues to torment Heather, who comes to despise her and fights back. Ann returns from the mental institution, and Heather finds her one day, rocking in her bed. Ann reveals that she is afraid she will be taken by the witches. She says she is cold, so Heather climbs on a trunk to try and close the open window over Ann's bed. A low fog rushes into the room and knocks Heather down, twisting her ankle, and she is taken to the infirmary. The next day, Heather finds Ann's bed empty, her place filled with dead leaves. She witnesses the headmistress lying to the police about Ann's disappearance, remarking that she is being taken care of. This leads her to become suspicious and she tries to talk to Marcy about it. But Marcy acts strangely, and is shadowed by one of the teachers. Soon after, Heather finds Marcy's bed empty and covered in leaves. Later, she is confronted in the woods by Samantha, who reveals that she has actually been trying to protect Heather with her antics. She tells Heather that the school is led by a coven of witches who want to take all of the girls away. Samantha explains that she has called Heather's father to help her escape and that the milk is poisoned. The girls are both caught by a school mistress, who promptly takes Samantha away. Samantha is later found hanging from a bedsheet in the cafeteria. When a police officer comes to investigate, Heather tells him of the missing students. The officer confronts the headmistress, but she claims that the girls ran away. Another mistress \\"leads\\" the officer into the woods to find the girls, where he is killed by the living vines of a tree. Heather's parents show up to take her home, though the headmistress tries to persuade them otherwise. On the way home, their car is mysteriously flipped and Heather is knocked unconscious. Alice is dragged out of the car by a living vine and kicks Joe in the head, knocking him out. Heather and Joe wake up in a nearby hospital. Before they can reach each other, Ms. Traverse has Heather dragged away, then slits her own hand and forces her black blood down Joe's throat, which puts him into a catatonic state. Heather returns to the school in despair. She drinks the milk that evening, but later vomits it back up, finding tree bark in it. Back at the hospital, Joe wakes up and vomits up Ms. Traverse's black blood, which also has tree bark in it. He quickly escapes and goes to find Heather. That night, Heather begins to hear voices again, and when she attempts to leave, a living vine captures her. When she awakens, she is wrapped in vines in a large foggy room, next to Ann and Marcy, who are also held captive. All of the teachers appear and reveal themselves to be witches. Ms. Traverse is their leader, and she explains that their spirits have been trapped in the woods all these years, and they need to inhabit the bodies of young women to escape their imprisonment. Heather appears to be the centerpiece of her plan because she has the strongest powers among the gifted students. Heather is coerced into completing the ritual, and the vines begin to mummify all of the girls in the school. Before it can complete itself, Joe breaks into the room with an ax and begins to kill the witches. Heather breaks free from the vines and grabs the ax, proceeding to chop all of the witches into pieces. Heather and Joe then leave with all of the girls, walking down the road into the daylight as the school burns in the distance behind them. The end of the movie states that Falburn Academy burned to the ground in 1965, while the surrounding woods were strangely left untouched. == Cast == ==Production== The Woods was shot in 2004 at Mels Cit√© du Cinema in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. ==Release== The Woods had its North American premiere at the Fantasia Film Festival in Montreal in 2006. The film's distributor, United Artists, planned for a theatrical release, but it was shelved after Sony Pictures bought out United Artists' parent company, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, in 2004. Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the film direct-to-DVD in the United States on October 3, 2006 following festival screenings. ===Critical response=== Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 69% of 13 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.5/10. Brian Holcomb of the independent film review website Beyond Hollywood wrote: \\"The Woods plays like a classic Lewton film of the 1940s, where the emphasis was on telling a good yarn without much ado and wrapping it up in a tightly wound 70 minutes.\\" Film journalist Nick Schager noted that the film \\"proves to be one of the most polished and inventive horror flicks of the still-ongoing year, a synthesis of classical supernatural and sexualized imagery that expands upon, rather than simply regurgitates, its celebrated predecessors,\\" and compared it to Suspiria (1977) and Carrie (1976). DVD Talks Scott Weinberg praised the film's performances as \\"uniformly excellent\\" and also praised the cinematography and musical score. == References == == External links == * * * Category:2006 films Category:2000s supernatural horror films Category:American films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:Boarding school films Category:English-language films Category:Films about witchcraft Category:Films directed by Lucky McKee Category:Films scored by John Frizzell (composer) Category:Films set in 1965 Category:Films shot in Montreal ","title":"The Woods (2006 film)"},{"id":"2558617","text":"Rwamagana is a city and capital of both the Rwamagana District and the Eastern Province in Rwanda == Description == Rwamagana lies approximately from Kigali, on the newly renovated road leading east towards Tanzania.

From the Crimean War until World War I, French Zouaves were also issued baggy red pajama pants inspired by those worn by North African and Turkish soldiers.

Edgecliff is surrounded by the suburbs of Double Bay, Woollahra, Paddington, Rushcutters Bay and Darling Point. The property prices are very high because it is close to the city and many homes provide views of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour). ==History== Edgecliff takes its name from its location because it literally sits on the edge of a cliff. The rocky cliff was extensively quarried in the early day of European settlement. The area was dominated for some time by the Glenrock property, on the north side of New South Head Road. Sir Edward Knox built Fiona in 1864 after having it designed by J. F. Hilly. It has been described as \\"a Classical Revival two-storey mansion\\" and was made of sandstone. Other elements of the estate included Glenrock, an Italianate residence designed by David MacBeath and built by John Marks circa 1870. There were also substantial gates of wrought iron and sandstone. The building was demolished when New South Head Road was widened, but the gates survived. Also on the estate was the Dower House, a Victorian Gothic Revival house of sandstone, built some time after 1842 by Whistler Smith. The estate is now the site of Ascham School, and the above items are on the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company of Australia, 1981, In September 1894 a cable tram service opened, which operated from King Street in the city to Ocean Street in Edgecliff.

The cars gripped the moving cable to advance and released it to stop. It operated until 1905 when the tram line was electrified.

The name is an acronym for Raketno-Yadernoe Napadenie (, \\"Nuclear Missile Attack\\"). The purpose of the operation was to collect intelligence on potential contingency plans of the Reagan administration to launch a nuclear first strike against the Soviet Union.Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin (2000). The Mitrokhin Archive: The KGB in Europe and the West. Gardners Books. .A Cold War Conundrum: The 1983 Soviet War Scare ‚Äî Phase II: A New Sense of Urgency by Benjamin B. Fischer The program was initiated in May 1981 by Yuri Andropov, then chairman of the KGB. ==Background== Andropov suffered from a \\"Hungarian complex\\" from his personal experience of the Hungarian Revolution in 1956 according to the historian Christopher Andrew. Andropov had, as the Soviet ambassador to Hungary, \\"watched in horror from the windows of his embassy as officers of the hated Hungarian security service were strung up from lampposts\\". Andropov remained haunted for the rest of his life by the speed with which an apparently all-powerful Communist one-party state had begun to topple. Leonid Brezhnev and Yuri Andropov, then Chairman of the KGB, justified the creation of Operation RYaN because, they claimed, the United States was \\"actively preparing for nuclear war\\" against the Soviet Union and its allies. According to a newly released Stasi report, the primary \\"Chekist work\\" discussed in the May 1981 meeting was the \\"demand to allow for 'no surprise.'\\" ==Operation== The Soviet defector Oleg Gordievsky divulged a top-secret KGB telegram sent to the London KGB residency in February 1983. It stated: \\"The objective of the assignment is to see that the Residency works systematically to uncover any plans in preparation by the main adversary [USA] for RYAN and to organize a continual watch to be kept for indications of a decision being taken to use nuclear weapons against the USSR or immediate preparations being made for a nuclear missile attack.\\" An attachment listed seven \\"immediate\\" and thirteen \\"prospective\\" tasks for the agents to complete and report. These included: the collection of data on potential places of evacuation and shelter, an appraisal of the level of blood held in blood banks, observation of places where nuclear decisions were made and where nuclear weapons were stored, observation of key nuclear decision makers, observation of lines of communication, reconnaissance of the heads of churches and banks, and surveillance of security services and military installations. RYAN took on a new significance after the announcement of plans to deploy Pershing II nuclear-armed missiles to West Germany. These missiles were designed to be launched from road-mobile vehicles, making the launch sites very hard to find. The flight time from West Germany to European Russia was only four to six minutes (approximate flying time from six to eight minutes from West Germany to Moscow), giving the Soviets little or no warning. On 23 March 1983 Ronald Reagan publicly announced development of the Strategic Defense Initiative. The Soviet government felt that the purpose of SDI technology was to render the US invulnerable to Soviet attack, thereby allowing the US to launch missiles against the USSR without fear of retaliation. This concern about a surprise attack prompted the sudden expansion of the RYAN program. The level of concern reached its peak after the Soviets shot down KAL 007 near Moneron Island on 1 September 1983, and during the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation exercise Able Archer 83. The Soviet Union believed that a United States first strike on the Soviet Union was imminent. Although Andropov died in February 1984, RYAN continued to be maintained and developed under the direction of Victor Chebrikov. Consultations held in August 1984 between the STASI's head of the Main Directorate of Reconnaissance, Markus Wolf and KGB experts discussed the early detection of potential war preparations in adversaries and indicated that the First Chief Directorate of the KGB was proposing to create a new division to deal exclusively with RYAN. 300 positions within the KGB were earmarked for RYAN of which 50 were reserved for the new division. Operation RYAN continued to be maintained until at least April 1989. ==See also== *Able Archer 83 *Deutschland 83 *Warsaw Pact Early Warning Indicator Project ==References== ==Further reading== * The Brink, Marc Ambinder, Simon & Schuster, 2018. * 1983: Reagan, Andropov, and a World on the Brink, Taylor Downing, Da Capo, 2018. *The Vicious Circle of Intelligence - Nate Jones, The National Security Archive *The Able Archer 83 Sourcebook - Nate Jones, The National Security Archive *Forecasting Nuclear War: Stasi/KGB Intelligence Cooperation Under Project RYAN - Bernd Schaefer, Nate Jones, and Benjamin B.

An American remake of the film is in development at Focus Features. Stephane Sperry is the producer. Matthew Michaud adapted the screenplay from the original film. ==Plot== Angelo Ledda, a former hitman for organized crime, agrees to a last killing, despite his recently developed Alzheimer's disease. He is to kill two people; on killing the first and recovering a package from the first victim, he then learns the second victim is Bieke, a twelve-year-old girl pimped by her father, who had been recently busted, but then killed by police trying to escape. Ledda refuses to kill a child. Resultantly, his employer, Seynaeve, has another hitman kill Bieke and orders him to kill Ledda. Ledda kills the hitman first but only after the hitman kills a prostitute who had befriended him. As a result, Ledda decides to kill Seynaeve. He also reviews the contents of the package, and discovers that his employer had Bieke and the first target killed to cover for several individuals who had used the services of the child. He decides to clean house by killing them all, several of whom are high-ranking government officials. Ledda's Alzheimer's condition (for which he takes an experimental drug) periodically impacts him throughout the movie, resulting in disorientation and his being seemingly forgetful of what he was doing for a brief period of time. It grows worse as the movie progresses. In his attempts to seek revenge upon his employers, Ledda contends with police pursuit. Two detectives in particular (Vincke, and Verstuyft) seem to be one step behind him. Ledda toys with the police, although he ends up with a gunshot wound to the arm from Verstuyft because of attempting to talk to Vincke at one point. Ledda kills all of his intended targets, except the last, a high-ranking government official, Baron de Haeck, who manages to get away because of Ledda's worsening Alzheimer's, which leads him to forget to put the firing pin in his silenced pistol when preparing for the hit. Ledda is captured by the police, and between his worsening mental condition, and his gunshot wound, is bed-ridden and in poor health. The prosecutor, Bracke, who is in the pocket of the Baron, tries to have a court-appointed psychiatrist kill Ledda, which results in Ledda making a hasty escape. Ledda ends up meeting the two detectives in a car, and gives them a clue as to the whereabouts of a tape from the safety deposit box which implicates the Baron in murder. The corrupt police close in and surround the car, placing all inside at risk. Ledda decides to sacrifice himself by making a run from the car, and is gunned down. The movie ends with the detectives finding the tape and watching the Baron getting arrested. ==Cast== *Jan Decleir ‚Äì Angelo Ledda *Koen De Bouw ‚Äì Det. Eric Vincke *Werner De Smedt ‚Äì Det.

She worked with Massive Attack in the early 1990s, and as a solo artist garnered five UK Top 40 hit singles. Her 1993 debut album, What Silence Knows, was shortlisted for the Mercury Music Prize. ==Career== ===Early work=== Nelson's first release was the 1983 single \\"Aiming at Your Heart\\", which was credited to Shara Nelson & The Circuit. She then released her debut solo single, \\"Can't Get Over You\\", in 1986 under the name \\"Shara\\". Nelson released two further solo singles in the 1980s, \\"Standing Invitation\\" as Sharon Nelson and \\"Love's Hit You\\" as Shara Nelson. In the late 1980s, she began working with the Bristol-based DJ/production team The Wild Bunch, from who a spin-off production team/crew would form, named Massive Attack. ===1990s=== Nelson's first release with Massive Attack was the single \\"Daydreaming\\" in 1990. As well as providing vocals, Nelson also co-wrote songs with Massive Attack, including the hit single \\"Unfinished Sympathy\\" which was included on the group's debut album, Blue Lines, in 1991. The single peaked at No. 13 on the UK Singles Chart and has been widely critically acclaimed, particularly in polls conducted by MTV2 and NME. A reviewer for the BBC has said that: \\"More than a decade after its release it remains one of the most moving pieces of dance music ever, able to soften hearts and excite minds just as keenly as a ballad by Bacharach or a melody by McCartney.\\" In total, Nelson co-wrote and provided vocals on four tracks on the Blue Lines album, including another hit single, \\"Safe From Harm\\" (UK No. 25). Nelson also recorded another track with Massive Attack entitled \\"Just A Matter of Time\\", which was exclusively included on a short film the group made of the same name. In July 1993, Nelson restarted her solo career with the hit single \\"Down That Road\\" which peaked at No. 19 on the UK Singles Chart. The single was released on Cooltempo Records and both Paul Oakenfold and Steve Osborne were involved in remixing the track. Nelson's debut album, What Silence Knows, was released in September 1993 produced and mixed by Mike Peden. It peaked at no.22 on the UK album chart, and was later certified Gold by the BPI for sales in excess of 100,000 copies. Nelson co-wrote all of the songs on the album, which included co-writes with Prince Be of P.M. Dawn, and Saint Etienne. Further singles from the album included \\"One Goodbye in Ten\\" (UK No. 21), \\"Uptight\\" (UK No. 19) and \\"Inside Out\\" (UK No. 34). The album was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize for Best Album in 1994. Also in 1994, Nelson was nominated for \\"Best British Female Solo Artist\\" and \\"Best British Breakthrough Act\\" at the Brit Awards. Nelson's second album, Friendly Fire also produced by Mike Peden was released in 1995, and contained the hit \\"Rough with the Smooth\\" which peaked at no.30 in the UK. The album was less successful than her previous release, and peaked at no.44 in the UK. She was again nominated for \\"Best British Female Solo Artist\\" at the 1996 BRIT Awards. In 1997, Nelson contributed to Shaken and Stirred: The David Arnold James Bond Project, performing the song \\"Moonraker\\" which had originally been sung by Shirley Bassey. In 1998, Nelson collaborated with Charles Webster's Presence project and released the single \\"Sense of Danger\\" which peaked at No. 61 in the UK Singles Chart. The track was included on the Presence album All Systems Gone which was released in early 1999, along with another track with Nelson on vocals entitled \\"Matter of Fact\\". Also in 1999, Nelson collaborated with Air Cuba and released the single \\"Black Island\\" on the 4AD label. She also collaborated with the UK artists BLIM and Chris Carter as Kasha on the track \\"U\\" which was released as a 12\\" single. ===2000s=== In 2002, Nelson released a track entitled \\"Realise\\", which was remixed and included on the mix compilation album 4 Vini: Forever Young. In 2003, Nelson collaborated with Adrian Sherwood on the track \\"Hari Up Hari\\", which was released as a 12\\" single. Sherwood was the founder of On-U Sound Records which released Nelson's first record 20 years earlier. Also in 2003, Nelson collaborated with Futurasound on the track \\"Right Now\\". In 2004, Nelson released her first solo single since 1996, the song \\"Nobody Else\\". Other tracks released around this time were \\"Push Me Away\\" with 10th Planet and \\"Say My Name\\" with Little Axe. In December 2007, Nelson was featured on a new single by NUfrequency entitled \\"Go That Deep\\", which included a remix by Charles Webster. Doug Wimbish released an album CinemaSonics on Yellowbird in 2008, where Nelson has contributed on a song \\"I Wanna Know\\" as a co-writer and a vocalist. ===2010s=== In 2011, DJ Pete Tong obtained a restraining order against Nelson following her 12 month community order and community service sentence for harassment of Tong and his wife. Several new tracks have been posted on Nelson's official website, including \\"Promise to You\\", \\"Different\\" and \\"If\\". In February 2012, NUFrequency released their debut album Connected, which includes a new extended version of \\"Go That Deep\\" featuring Shara Nelson. A newly remixed and remastered version of Massive Attack's Blue Lines was released in 2012. The album features Nelson on four songs, including the classics \\"Unfinished Sympathy\\" and \\"Safe From Harm\\". In September 2012, Nelson performed live for the first time in many years, sparking further rumours of an imminent comeback in 2013. She performed her hit \\"Unfinished Sympathy\\" (originally with Massive Attack) at the concert in aid of Cool Earth produced by Angelica Campion-Armstrong. Nelson contributed vocals to the track \\"Badger Swagger\\" by The Artful Badger in May 2013. The song was made in support of Team Badger and the \\"Stop The Cull\\" petition and was released in June 2013. Summer 2014 brought the release of a new single called \\"Promised\\", again in collaboration with NUfrequency. It was recorded in 2010 and released on Rebirth as a limited hand-stamped white label coloured 10\\" vinyl.

Nelson, Britton and John Power wrote and recorded the title track, \\"Looking\\", for the film Anti-Social. Nelson released a single on 27 April 2018 called \\"Looking (Meghan Markle's Theme)\\". Nelson is currently continuing work in the studio with Simon Britton and various collaborators for her next solo album with the first single due in 2020. ==Discography== ;Studio albums: *1991: Blue Lines with Massive Attack *1993: What Silence Knows (UK No. 22) *1995: Friendly Fire (UK No. 44) *1999: All Systems Gone (with Charles Webster's Presence) ;Collaborations and rare: *1983: \\"Aiming At Your Heart\\"/\\"Just As Long As We Have Love\\" (with The Circuit) *1984: \\"Savanna Prance\\" (with The Missing Brazilians), \\"In Another World\\" (with Voice Of Authority) *1985: \\"Love's Hit You\\" (vinyl-only solo single) *1985: \\"Love Mystery\\" (with Jah Wobble) *1986: \\"Can't Get Over You\\" (single as Shara) *1986: \\"Standing Invitation\\" (single as Sharon Nelson) *1989: \\"Je T'Aime\\" (with Dub Syndicate) *1991: \\"Safe From Harm\\"/\\"Unfinished Sympathy\\"/\\"Lately\\"/\\"Daydreaming\\" (with Massive Attack) *1994: \\"On The Shore\\" (with Saint Etienne), \\"Heart Of Stone\\"/\\"Welcome To The Suburbs\\" (with Dave Stewart) *1995: \\"Nobody Knows\\" (with Guru) *1996: \\"Good Intentions\\"/\\"Faraway Places\\" (with Groove Corporation) *1998: \\"Moonraker\\" (with David Arnold) *1999: \\"Sense Of Danger\\"/\\"Matter Of Fact\\" (with Presence), \\"Black Island\\" (with Cuba), \\"U\\" (with Kasha) *2002: \\"Be My Lighthouse\\" (with Bim Sherman), \\"Realise\\" (with Jason Sparkes) *2003: \\"Right Now\\" (with Futurasound), \\"Hari Up Hari\\" (with Adrian Sherwood) *2004: \\"Nobody Else\\" (vinyl-only single), \\"Say My Name\\" (with Little Axe) *2007: \\"Push Me Away\\" (with 10th Planet) *2008: \\"Go That Deep\\" (with NUfrequency), \\"I Wanna Know\\" (with Doug Wimbish) *2013: \\"Badger Swagger\\" (with The Artful Badger) *2014: \\"Promised\\" (with NUfrequency), \\"All Together Now\\" (with The Peace Collective) *2015: \\"Looking\\" (from the film \\"Anti-Social\\" OST) *2018: \\"Looking (Megan Markle's Theme)\\" solo single, digital release ==Awards and nominations== *1994: Nominated for Mercury Music Prize (Best Album ‚Äì What Silence Knows) *1994: Nominated for BRIT Award (\\"Best British Female Solo Artist\\" and \\"Best British Breakthrough Act\\") *1996: Nominated for BRIT Award (\\"Best British Female Solo Artist\\") ==References== ==External links== * *[ Allmusic profile] Category:Black British musicians Category:English dance musicians Category:Living people Category:Singers from London Category:1965 births Category:Massive Attack members Category:21st-century English women singers Category:21st-century English singers ","title":"Shara Nelson"},{"id":"2558673","text":"Ratz is a 2003 French-Canadian animated television series created by Richard Zielenkiewicz and St√©phane Melchior-Durand. The show stars two rats, Rapido and Razmo, aboard the S.S. Wanderer, a cheese ship without an (apparent) actual destination. The focus of the series is on the adventures of the two rats, including guarding the cheese, interacting with other stowaways and various ill-fated encounters with the crew. The rats themselves live in the hull of the ship in a lavish two-bedroom apartment. While being targeted at young children in France, the series has gained a small cult following of older ages in Canada, due to its original late-night airing time slot. The French version features the voices of the comedy duo √âric et Ramzy, while the English version features the voices of Terrence Scammell as Rapido and Rick Jones as Razmo. Unlike most animated programs designed for a younger audience, Ratz has (except for the episode \\"The Genie\\") no moral resolve at the end of each episode. The series debuted on March 7, 2003 on Teletoon in Canada before premiering on France 3 in France on September 21, 2003. It has also been broadcast on various other channels overseas, such as Animania HD in the United States, Cartoon Network in Latin America, and Toon Disney in the United Kingdom. The show is also notable for its positive portrayal of rats, unusual for Western and North American cultures, which often give its fictional rats selfish, antagonizing and evil characteristics. Also of interest is the pure blend of traditional animation and 3D animation, making it Canada's most expensive Teletoon show at the time, and the eclectic soundtrack by Herv√© Lavandier. Ratz was originally titled Rapido and featured a chunkier animation style; some websites (including Xilam's own website as well) still reflect this right after the 14 years of Wimsieland had the final episode on September 23, 1999. The show premiered its episode, \\"Cheese Connection\\" on September 21, 2003, and the series finale episode, \\"No Panic on Board, A Ratz Ending\\" aired on November 11, 2003. It has been broadcast since March 25, 2020 on the Netflix streaming service.. ==Ratboarding== An integral part of Ratz is the ratboard, a transportation device resembling a mousetrap with a jet engine strapped to the back (though in the episode \\"The Rat Exterminator\\", the rats do not recognize an actual mousetrap). The ratboard provides the rats with speedy travel in and around the ship. Rapido is very fond of his ratboard and enjoys challenging Razmo to races, often winning. Ratboards are also used to reach otherwise inaccessible places, provide speedy rescues, move things by tether or simply to impress guests. ==Characters== *Rapido is a jet set- wannabe with a huge ego to maintain. To get over his large self-doubts and low self-esteem, he acts condescendingly and often boasts having personal connections to various celebrities. Rapido is also a hypocrite, scolding Razmo sharply for engaging in an activity, then secretly pursuing the same later on. Rapido only has interest in himself and will not aide Razmo at all, unless the situation adversely affects himself. His interests include ratboard racing, celebrity magazines, fashion, house music, feeling important and wooing women. *Razmo is the shorter and stouter rat. He is a highly productive genius and mechanic, having invented the ratboard and being responsible for all mechanical and electrical issues. He is also forced to perform all chores as Rapido never lends a hand. This has led Razmo to become depressed, emotionally scarred and obsessive-compulsive. Razmo is also childish, sometimes speaking to a plush toy and wetting the bed. His interests include playing stringed bass, jazz, counting the cheese, inventing and making friends. In the original Rapido short, Razmo had a Deep South accent; the voice was changed to have a slight Brooklyn accent during production of Ratz. Oddly, Razmo is called \\"Ratz\\" (as in the name of the show) on the blurb for the show in Sky program guides. The crew of the S.S. Wanderer consists of three personnel: Benny the chef, Svetlana the engineer and The Captain. Neither of them is considered a villain in the series, though Benny is the one most enraged by the rats. Usually, the crew will return to their normal duties after brushing shoulders with Rapido and/or Razmo. Humorously enough, the crew's diet consists mostly of cheese, which Svetlana hates and Benny is allergic to (although Benny's allergies are not seen or discussed within the show). *The Captain is a Scottish seaman and veteran of the seas. He is the only person who knows the final destination of the cheese in the cargo hold. Over the years, he has gone from a rather serious captain to a rather goofy one, often falling into reverie or suggesting absurd courses of action during crises. All of his orders are directed towards the other two crew members. *Svetlana, the Russian engineer. She is responsible for keeping the S.S. Wanderer afloat and is usually found in situations requiring her massive size and strength. Despite her role on the ship, Svetlana attempts to act feminine whenever possible, which isn't very often. She is often talking to or conspiring with Benny. *Benny, the Japanese chef. Benny is the only one that will give cheese to the rats. Despite having five years of culinary arts under his belt, Benny is usually preparing souffl√©s or sushi for the rest of the crew. He is usually interrupted by Rapido and Razmo when he brings aboard a live animal to be slaughtered. ==Episodes== ==Merchandise== * Ratz has Region 2 DVDs out in France, released by Warner Home Video, containing eight episodes per DVD. * An album, A fond les bananes !, featuring √âric et Ramzy, has also been released in France. The show's theme song \\"Pas de panique √† bord\\", the record's opening track, was a minor hit in France. * In Fall 2004, Smoby Toys released the toy line based on the show such as velvet furred dolls, real working play sets and plushies just like the show of the same name.

However, it also make the legal tracking and technical categorization of a weapon more complicated as it can now be easily converted into a diverse variety of different forms.* For example, the Stoner 63 is a 5.56√ó45mm NATO-caliber modular small arm system using a variety of modular components, which can be configured as a rifle, a carbine, a top-fed light machine gun, a belt-fed squad automatic weapon, or a vehicle mounted weapon. == Quick-change barrel system == Another example of a modular firearm system is the increasingly popular quick barrel change systems, which is found on some new rifles like for example the Blaser R8, Roessler Titan and Sig Sauer 200 STR.

He is credited as being an early founder of the nation due to his role in early struggles for independence from Spain. ==Biography== Camilo Torres Tenorio Torres was born in Popay√°n, Viceroyalty of New Granada in 1766. He was the son of Francisco Jer√≥nimo Torres and Mar√≠a Teresa Tenorio. Torres studied in the Seminary of Popay√°n, where he met others of the leaders of the Colombian independence movement like Francisco Antonio Zea and his cousin, Francisco Jos√© de Caldas. He then moved to Santaf√© (now known as Bogot√°), to study jurisprudence in the Colegio del Rosario, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in Canonical Law in June of 1790, and a J.D degree in 1791. He decided to settle in Santaf√©, where he opened an attorney's office. Torres married Mar√≠a Francisca Prieto y Ricaurte in 1802 in Bogot√°. They had six children. Torres was part of a generation that had witnessed the Insurrection of the Comuneros in 1781, and had experienced the independence of the United States in 1776 and the French Revolution in 1789. Antonio Nari√±o had translated into Spanish the \\"Declaration of the Rights of Man\\" in 1794, and had spread the influence of these ideas all throughout Latin America. This translation led to Nari√±o being exiled, and many of the students in the Colegio del Rosario were in turn persecuted, including Torres. With the abdication of Ferdinand VII in Spain, Torres advocated the formation of a Junta, such as were being created in Spain, in support of the abdicated king. Torres also supported the creation of the Supreme Central Junta in 1809, particularly as it was supposed to include representation from the American colonies. This representation, however, was very small and insignificant, and this led to Torres writing his famous \\"Memorial de agravios\\" (Memorial of Affrents), where he complained about the lack of equality for American Spaniards and the scarce attention that the American colonies received from the Spanish crown. Torres, however, praised the Spanish authority and expressed his desire that the colonies would not secede. The dissolution of the Supreme Central Junta led to the creation of local juntas in many provinces in Latin America, which consolidated the thirst for independence of the American colonies. In Santaf√©, a Junta was established on July 20, 1810, which demanded the creation of an open council and independence from Spain. Among the deputies of such council was Camilo Torres, and he was one of the signers in the Act of Independence of the Supreme Junta of Santaf√©. Torres was also involved in finding some understanding with the Spanish crown. Antonio Nari√±o started publishing a small newspaper called La Bagatela in 1811, where he presented his centralist ideas for the government of the new country. This soon made him an antagonist of Torres, who instead supported federalist ideas that emphasized autonomy for the provinces. This conflict led to the formation of two political parties, the centralist one (the \\"pateadores\\" or kickers) represented by Nari√±o, and the Federalist one (or \\"carracos\\"), formed by Torres and representatives from other provinces. The federalist faction formed the United Provinces of New Granada in 1811, and Torres was appointed as President of its congress between 1812 and 1814, and then as President of the United Provinces between 1815 and 1816. During this period, Camilo Torres befriended Bol√≠var. The Province of Santaf√© had declared itself independent and adopted the name of Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca. The tensions between the centralist Cundinamarca province and the federalist United Provinces eventually led to a civil war that culminated in the surrender of the Cundinamarca province to the federalist troops commanded by Bol√≠var in 1814. This period of strife and chaos is called often la Patria Boba. Meanwhile, king Ferdinand VII of Spain had been restored to power and sent a large army to quell the rebellions and reconquer the lost colonies. The Spanish army, commanded by General Pablo Morillo led a violent, and successful military campaign that culminated in the capture of Santaf√© on May 6, 1816. Fearing Morillo's troops, Torres escaped to the small town of El Pital, near Neiva. He then tried to escape the country by boarding a ship to Argentina in the port of Buenaventura, but he was captured by the troops of Juan S√°mano after the ship departed without him and others in July, 1816. He was sent to Santaf√©, where he was executed by a firing squad for treason against the Spanish monarchy on October 5, 1816. After his death, all of his possessions were confiscated and his family was stranded in poverty. When Bol√≠var became president he decided to support them by donating part of his own stipend every month. Camilo Torres' face has appeared in the $2 and $50 Colombian peso banknotes. ==References== Category:1766 births Category:1816 deaths Category:Del Rosario University alumni Category:Presidents of Colombia Category:People of the Spanish American wars of independence Category:Colombian Roman Catholics Category:Colombian lawyers Category:Executed presidents Category:People executed by Spain by hanging Category:Executed Colombian people Category:People executed for treason against Spain Category:19th-century executions by Spain Category:People of the Latin American wars of independence ","title":"Camilo Torres Tenorio"},{"id":"2558742","text":"NRV may stand for: * Net realizable value of an asset * Norddeutscher Regatta Verein, a German yacht club * Not Really Vanished, computer compression algorithm in UPX * Valmet Nr I and Valmet Nr II Helsinki trams * Non Return Valve (check Valve) ","title":"NRV"},{"id":"2558743","text":"IG Culture IG Culture entry at www.discogs.com is a London musician and performer best known as a pioneer of the broken beat movement.

Credit for the concept of the vectograph is due to Joseph Mahler, cousin of composer and conductor Gustav Mahler. He immigrated to the US from Czechoslovakia in 1938 and was hired by the Polaroid Corporation, where he worked with its founder Edwin Land, to develop his idea into a practical process. An elementary vectograph is a polarizing filter sheet that encodes a photographic image as areas that polarize light more or less strongly, corresponding to the darker and lighter areas of the image. When the sheet is viewed by itself in ordinary light, a pale image becomes visible. When viewed through a uniformly polarizing filter sheet oriented in the same plane of polarization, the image is almost completely invisible. If either sheet is rotated 90 degrees about its axis, so that their planes of polarization are at right angles, the image becomes boldly visible. If two such images, made to polarize in opposite directions and each encoding one of the images of a stereoscopic pair, are superimposed and viewed through glasses containing appropriately oriented polarizing filters, each eye sees only one of the images and a single three-dimensional image is perceived by people with normal stereoscopic vision. Vectographs in their native form are transparencies, to be viewed by transmitted light or projected onto a suitable non-depolarizing screen, but by limiting the density of the images and backing the vectograph with a non-depolarizing aluminum-based paint, a print for viewing by reflected light can be produced. Vectographic prints and transparencies can serve many of the same purposes as their anaglyph equivalents, but with the visual advantage that they do not require the use of viewing filters which are of disturbingly different colors for each eye. However, while anaglyph images can be produced by virtually any photographic or mechanical printing process capable of producing a two-colored image, vectographic images require specialized materials and printing technologies, limiting their practical application. During World War II, stereoscopic aerial reconnaissance photographs were printed in the form of vectographs, both as reflective prints for use by troops in the field and as transparencies to be projected onto a screen for group viewing and discussion. (Google Books link) They Made America: From the Steam Engine to the Search Engine, Harold Evans, Gail Buckland, David Lefer Instructional use was made of projected vectograph slides illustrating three-dimensional coordinate systems. Although originally a monochrome \\"black-and-white\\" process only, experimental full-color vectographs were soon being made by Polaroid. During the 3D fad of 1953, vectographic 3D color motion picture prints that could be shown with ordinary unmodified projectors were expected to be a commercial reality, but the rapid waning of public enthusiasm for 3D discouraged those efforts. The original full-color process was apparently never put to any commercial use. Circa 2000, the Rowland Institute, once part of Polaroid and now part of Harvard University, introduced a modernized ink jet printer version of the technology under the name \\"StereoJet\\".StereoJet Color vectograph printing service for digital image files was offered to the public, but it was expensive and little-used. As of 2012 it is no longer available. The most common vectographs, if any examples of the process may be called common, are those in the booklets of \\"Ortho-Fusor\\" stereoscopic eye exercises first issued by Bausch and Lomb in the 1940s and available for many years. Also relatively common is the Titmus Fly Stereotest, a greatly enlarged stereoscopic image of a fly used by optometrists and ophthalmologists to determine if patients, especially young children, have normal stereoscopic vision. Currently available vectographic vision training aids, marketed under the registered trademark name \\"Vectogram\\", include a variety with the left-eye and right-eye images overlaid on separate transparent plastic sheets so as to be adjustable. Subjects include a quoits hoop, a spirangle, and a hyperstereoscopic view of the Chicago skyline. ==References== * Stereoscopy.com article about Vectographs * BBC article \\"Operation Crossbow: How 3D glasses helped defeat Hitler\\" Category:3D imaging Category:Ophthalmology Category:Stereoscopy ","title":"Vectograph"},{"id":"2558771","text":"Mikri Vigla (Greek: ŒúŒπŒ∫œÅŒÆ ŒíŒØŒ≥ŒªŒ±, \\"little lookout\\") is a small village on the Greek island of Naxos famed for its nearby beaches.

Uplands is a prominent example of a garden suburb designed in the early part of the 20th century. In 1907, the developers of Uplands, John A, Robert and Dawson Turner previously cattle and horse ranchers from Turner Valley Alberta and originally Scotland purchased the area for the sum of $275,000 and hired the leading landscape architect John Olmsted as the designer. Olmsted designed famous neighbourhoods and parks in North America. The Uplands of today is faithful to Olmsted's vision: an elegant neighbourhood with estate-sized lots, serpentine streets and the signature green, globed, ornate lamp posts. The houses are built to impress and the sprawling gardens are carefully manicured. For John Olmsted personally, of all his subdivision projects, Uplands was ‚Äúunquestionably the best adapted to obtain the greatest amount of landscape beauty in connection with suburban development.‚Äùhttps://brightonpress.ca/imagininguplands/ Uplands has a seaside setting and has within its boundaries the large Uplands Park.

Pawhuska was the most prominent chief and had the closest relationships with French traders, especially the powerful Chouteau family which operated under the rule of the Spanish government. The Osage frequently had skirmishes and battles with the Spanish and other Indian tribes. However, internal dissension weakened the Osage as they split into three main groups. In 1796, the group headed by Clermont (Claremore) and Pawhuska settled near Jean Pierre Chouteau's trading post on the Verdigris River in Indian Territory\\"The Chouteaus: Their Contributions to the History of the West.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma.

This is the home for both of Ankara's teams: Gen√ßlerbirliƒüi and Ankarag√ºc√º, although their shared stadium is in Altƒ±ndaƒü. 82% of the working population are civil servants or workers in the city of Ankara. There is also a large retired community, and a small but growing number of traders and shopkeepers. Ankara's largest industrial area, OSTIM Industrial Zone, is on the edge of the district too. The rural areas are used mainly for growing grains and pulses.

She was a consort and a favourite of Emperor Yuan. She was known to be a domineering woman who wanted her son on the throne, and, failing that, wanted (and eventually was able to see) her grandson on the throne as Emperor Ai. During Emperor Ai's reign, she exerted heavy influence on his reign and forcibly extracted empress dowager titles that she should not have properly possessed (since she was never an empress ‚Äì and Emperor Cheng's wife, Grand Empress Dowager Wang Zhengjun was still alive) ‚Äì which would bring her hatred from the Wang clan and eventually the desecration of her tomb after her death. == Family background == Consort Fu's father was from the Commandery of Henei (roughly modern Handan, Hebei) and died early. Her mother remarried a man named Zheng (ÈÑ≠) after her father's death. When Consort Fu was young, she was a lady-in-waiting for Grand Empress Dowager Shangguan. == Years as imperial consort == A scene in the Admonitions Scroll depicting Consort Feng (woman at centre) defending Emperor Yuan (man at right) from the bear. Consort Fu is depicted on the left, fleeing. It is not known when exactly Consort Fu became a consort to Emperor Yuan, but it is known that it happened during his years as crown prince ‚Äì but after his eventual wife Empress Wang became a consort of his. She and Consort Feng Yuan became his favorite concubines, and each of them bore him a son. Consort Fu's son was Liu Kang (ÂäâÂ∫∑), who later was created the Prince of Jiyang, then Prince of Shanyang, then Prince of Dingtao. As Consort Fu's position was inferior to that of Empress Wang, and her son younger than Empress Wang's son Liu Ao (later Emperor Cheng), Prince Ao was created crown prince. However, Consort Fu was not content for her son merely to be an imperial prince, and a succession struggle would erupt. As Crown Prince Ao grew older, Emperor Yuan became increasingly unhappy with his fitness as imperial heir and impressed with Consort Fu's son, Prince Kang. Several incidents led to this situation. One happened in 35 BC, when Emperor Yuan's youngest brother Prince Liu Jing of Zhongshan (‰∏≠Â±±ÁéãÂäâÁ´ü) died, Emperor Yuan became angry when he felt that the teenage Crown Prince Ao was insufficiently grieving ‚Äì particularly because Princes Ao and Jing were of similar age and grew up together as playmates ‚Äì and showing insufficient respect to Prince Jing. Prince Ao's head of household Shi Dan (Âè≤‰∏π), a relative of Emperor Yuan's grandmother and a senior official respected by Emperor Yuan, managed to convince Emperor Yuan that Crown Prince Ao was trying to stop Emperor Yuan himself from over-grieving, but the seed of dissatisfaction was sown. As the princes further grew, several things further led to an endearment between Emperor Yuan and Prince Kang. They shared affection and skills in music ‚Äì particularly in the playing of drums. Prince Kang also showed high intelligence and diligence, while Crown Prince Ao was known for drinking and womanizing. When Emperor Yuan grew ill circa 35 BC ‚Äì an illness that he would not recover from ‚Äì Consort Fu and Prince Kang were often summoned to his sickbed to attend to him, while Empress Wang and Crown Prince Ao rarely were. In his illness, apparently encouraged by Consort Fu, Emperor Yuan reconsidered whether he should make Prince Kang his heir instead. Only the intercession of Shi Dan ‚Äì who risked his life by stepping onto the carpet of the imperial bed chamber, an act that only the empress was allowed to do, at the pain of death ‚Äì led Emperor Yuan to cease those thoughts. When Emperor Yuan died in 33 BC, Crown Prince Ao ascended the throne (as Emperor Cheng). While both Consorts Fu and Feng were imperial consorts, an incident occurred that would cause Consort Feng to be greatly praised, at Consort Fu's embarrassment. In 38 BC, Emperor Yuan was watching a fight between wild animals, accompanied by a number of his concubines (but apparently not by Empress Wang). A wild bear broke loose and tried to get out of the cage. All of the noble men and women who accompanied Emperor Yuan, including Consort Fu, fled, but Consort Feng stepped towards the wild bear, which, however, was killed at the last moment by imperial guards. Emperor Yuan asked her why she did so. Consort Feng replied that she had heard that bears, once they had caught one person, would attack just that person and no one else; because she was afraid that the bear would attack the emperor, she was willing to sacrifice herself. Consort Fu became greatly jealous of the praise that Consort Feng received for this incident. == As princess dowager == After Emperor Cheng's death, Prince Kang went to his Principality of Shanyang. Consort Fu received the title of princess dowager. She was not content with this status, however, and continued to wish for her son to become emperor. In 27 BC, Prince Kang's principality was moved to Dingtao, and Princess Dowager Fu went with him. When Prince Kang's consort Consort Ding gave birth to his son Liu Xin, it was Princess Dowager Fu ‚Äì not Consort Ding ‚Äì who raised him, nurturing him to be particularly close to her and dominated by her. The fraternal relationship between Emperor Cheng and Prince Kang was quite affectionate, notwithstanding the succession struggle, and Prince Kang was often summoned to the capital Chang'an to accompany Emperor Cheng, who was sonless. Prince Kang was viewed by many as the potential heir ‚Äì a status that was greatly despised by Emperor Cheng's uncles from the Wang clan. Consort Fu was happy to see this situation develop. In 24 BC, however, under pressure from his uncles, Emperor Cheng was forced to send Prince Kang back to his principality, and it would appear that the brothers did not see each other again alive, as Prince Kang died in 23 BC and was succeeded by his son Prince Xin. Princess Dowager Fu continued to carry her title after her son's death (as Han Dynasty did not appear to have a title such as \\"grand princess dowager\\"), and she maintained a strong grip on her grandson, the person now that she wants to eventually become emperor. As Emperor Cheng continued to be sonless, in 9 BC, he considered making either his younger brother Prince Liu Xing of Zhongshan or his nephew Prince Xin his heir. Emperor Cheng became convinced that Prince Xin was more capable, and at the same time, Princess Dowager Fu was endearing herself to Emperor Cheng's wife Empress Zhao Feiyan, her sister and favourite of Emperor Cheng Consort Zhao Hede, and Emperor Cheng's uncle Wang Gen with lavish gifts, and so the Zhaos and Wang Gen both praised Prince Xin as well. Emperor Cheng made Prince Xin crown prince in 8 BC. Emperor Cheng, under the rationale that Prince Xin was now his adopted son and no longer Prince Kang's son, refused to allow Princess Dowager Fu and her daughter-in-law Consort Ding to see Prince Xin, but the more lenient Empress Dowager Wang allowed Princess Dowager Fu to see her grandson under the rationale that she was like a wet nurse. == Domination of her grandson's reign == Emperor Cheng died suddenly in 7 BC, and Prince Xin ascended the throne as Emperor Ai. Almost immediately, the issue of the roles of Princess Dowager Fu and Consort Ding (and what honour, if any, to posthumously bestow on Emperor Ai's father Prince Kang) would quickly erupt into a major controversy. Initially, Grand Empress Dowager Wang decreed that Princess Dowager Fu and Consort Ding see him periodically, every 10 days. However, Princess Dowager Fu quickly began to visit her grandson everyday, and she insisted that two things be done: that she receive an Empress Dowager title, and that her relatives be granted titles, like the Wangs. Grand Empress Dowager Wang, sympathetic of the bind that Emperor Ai was in, first granted Prince Kang the unusual title of \\"Emperor Gong of Dingtao\\" (ÂÆöÈô∂ÂÖ±Áöá) and then, under the rationale of that title, granted Princess Dowager Fu the title \\"Empress Dowager Gong of Dingtao\\" (ÂÆöÈô∂ÂÖ±ÁöáÂ§™Âêé) and Consort Ding the title \\"Empress Gong of Dingtao\\" (ÂÆöÈô∂ÂÖ±ÁöáÂêé). Several members of the Fu and Ding clans were created marquesses. Grand Empress Dowager Wang also ordered her nephew Wang Mang, the commander of the armed forces, to resign and transfer power to the Fus and the Dings. Emperor Ai declined and begged Wang Mang to stay in his administration. Several months later, however, there would be another direct confrontation between Wang Mang and now-Empress Dowager Fu. At a major imperial banquet, the official in charge of seating placed Empress Dowager Fu's seat next to Grand Empress Dowager Wang's. When Wang Mang saw this, he rebuked the official and ordered that Empress Dowager Fu's seat be moved to the side, which drew great ire from Empress Dowager Fu, who refused to attend the banquet. To soothe her anger, Wang Mang resigned, and Emperor Ai approved his resignation. After Wang Mang's resignation, the Wangs gradually and inexorably began to lose their power. At Empress Dowager Fu's behest, the Fus and the Dings were installed in their place. Empress Dowager Fu was not satisfied with what she saw was her inferior title (as only empress dowager, not grand empress dowager, and with the qualifier \\"of Dingtao\\"). Several key officials who opposed her move were reduced to commoner status without any other fault ‚Äì including the prime minister Kong Guang (Â≠îÂÖâ) and the prime inspector Shi Dan (Â∏´‰∏π) ‚Äì two of the top three officials of the administration. The third one, Empress Dowager Fu's cousin Fu Xi (ÂÇÖÂñú), who also opposed Empress Dowager Fu's actions notwithstanding his relationship with her, was removed from his position and sent back to his march. In 6 BC, Empress Dowager Fu would further display her power and at the same time cause the people to be even more disappointed in Emperor Ai. Emperor Ai's cousin Liu Jizi (ÂäâÁÆïÂ≠ê), the Prince of Zhongshan (Prince Xing's son), had a congenital heart disorder, and his grandmother Feng Yuan, the princess dowager, cared for his treatment and often worshipped gods to pray for his healing. Emperor Ai, up on hearing his cousin's illness, sent imperial physicians along with his attendant Zhang You (ÂºµÁî±) to go to Zhongshan (roughly modern Baoding, Hebei) to treat Prince Jizi. Zhang, however, was himself afflicted with a psychiatric condition (probably bipolar disorder), and when he got to Zhongshan, he suddenly, in a rage, left there and returned to Chang'an. Once he did and was ordered to explain his conduct, he made up a false reason ‚Äì that he had discovered that Princess Dowager Feng was using witchcraft to curse Emperor Ai and Empress Dowager Fu. Empress Dowager Fu and Princess Dowager Feng were romantic rivals when they were both consorts to Emperor Yuan, and Empress Dowager Fu decided to use this opportunity to strike at Princess Dowager Feng. She sent a eunuch, Shi Li (Âè≤Á´ã), to serve as investigator, and Shi tortured a good number of Princess Dowager Feng's relations (including her sister Feng Xi (È¶ÆÁøí) and her sister-in-law Junzhi (Âêõ‰πã), some to death, but still could not build a solid case against Princess Dowager Feng. Shi Li decided to show Princess Dowager Feng who was actually behind the investigation, by referring to the wild bear incident. Princess Dowager Feng, realizing that Empress Dowager Fu was behind the investigation, went back to her palace and committed suicide. In total, 17 members of the Feng clan died as a result of the investigations. This was immediately viewed as a political case, and officials and the people all became disappointed in Emperor Ai. In 5 BC, Empress Dowager Fu would finally get what she wanted. Emperor Ai removed the qualification \\"of Dingtao\\" from his father's posthumous title (thus making him simply \\"Emperor Gong\\"), and then gave his grandmother a variation of the grand empress dowager title (ditaitaihou (Â∏ùÂ§™Â§™Âêé), compared to Grand Empress Dowager Wang's title taihuangtaihou (Â§™ÁöáÂ§™Âêé)) and his mother a variation of the empress dowager title (ditaihou (Â∏ùÂ§™Âêé), compared to Empress Dowager Zhao's title huangtaihou (ÁöáÂ§™Âêé)), and there were therefore now four official empresses dowager in the capital, each with a full budget. Grand Empress Dowager Fu died in 3 BC, and was buried with Emperor Yuan ‚Äì an act that drew even greater hatred from the Wangs, because now there would be no place for Grand Empress Dowager Wang, Emperor Yuan's wife, to be buried after her death. Further, Emperor Ai granted her a posthumous empress title, which was viewed to be inappropriate and disrespectful to Grand Empress Dowager Wang. == Post-death developments == After Emperor Ai died in 1 BC, Grand Empress Dowager Wang quickly seized power from Emperor Ai's male favourite and probable lover Dong Xian, and summoned Wang Mang back to Chang'an to serve as regent to the new Emperor Ping ‚Äì the former Prince Jizi of Zhongshan. Wang Mang, bearing grudges against Grand Empress Dowager Fu and Emperor Ai, would immediately undertake several punitive actions against her posthumously. He had her title stripped, and further stripped her of her original title as princess dowager ‚Äì and had her referred merely as \\"the mother of Prince Gong of Dingtao\\" (while her daughter-in-law suffered a similar posthumous demotion to \\"Consort Ding\\"). Against Grand Empress Dowager Wang's initial sentiment of stopping the punitive actions at this point, Wang Mang went further. In 5, he persuaded Grand Empress Dowager Wang to allow him to disinter Consorts Fu and Ding's caskets and strip their bodies of jade burial shells, and then returned to Dingtao to be buried there. Their tombs were then completely flattened and surrounded with thorns. According to legend, when their tombs were opened up, great fires started, damaging their bodies and the burial items. ==Titles== * Her Imperial Highness Fu Jieyu ÂÇÖÂ©ïÂ¶§ * Her Imperial Highness Fu Zhaoyi ÂÇÖÊò≠ÂÑÄ * Her Imperial Highness The Princess dowager of Dingtao ÂÆöÈô∂ÁéãÂ§™Âêé * Her Imperial Highness Princess Dowager Du of Dingtao ÂÆöÈô∂ÂÇÖÁéãÂ§™Âêé * Her Imperial Majesty Empress Dowager Gong ÊÅ≠ÁöáÂ§™Âêé * Her Imperial Majesty The Empress Grandmother of the Emperor Â∏ùÂ§™Â§™Âêé * Her Imperial Majesty The Grand Empress Dowager ÁöáÂ§™Â§™Âêé * Empress Xiaoyuan Fu Â≠ùÂÖÉÂÇÖÁöáÂêé * Mother of Prince Gong of Dingtao ÂÆöÈô∂ÊÅ≠ÁéãÊØç Category:1st- century BC births Category:Han dynasty imperial consorts Category:Han dynasty empresses dowager Category:1st-century BC Chinese women Category:Chinese grand empresses dowager Category:Chinese concubines Category:Concubines Category:2 BC deaths ","title":"Consort Fu"},{"id":"2558854","text":"Ruckman is an unincorporated community farming community in Hampshire County in the U.S. state of West Virginia.

Notice that if a(x) and b(x) are constants rather than functions of x, we have a special case of Leibniz's rule: :\\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\left(\\\\int_{a}^{b} f(x,t)\\\\,dt \\\\right)= \\\\int_{a}^{b}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} f(x,t) \\\\,dt. Besides, if a(x)=a and b(x)=x, which is a common situation as well (for example, in the proof of Cauchy's repeated integration formula), we have: :\\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\left (\\\\int_{a}^{x} f(x,t)dt \\\\right )= f\\\\big(x,x\\\\big) + \\\\int_{a}^{x}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} f(x,t) dt, Thus under certain conditions, one may interchange the integral and partial differential operators. This important result is particularly useful in the differentiation of integral transforms. An example of such is the moment generating function in probability theory, a variation of the Laplace transform, which can be differentiated to generate the moments of a random variable. Whether Leibniz's integral rule applies is essentially a question about the interchange of limits. == General form: Differentiation under the integral sign == :Theorem. Let f(x, t) be a function such that both f(x, t) and its partial derivative fx(x, t) are continuous in t and x in some region of the (x, t)-plane, including a(x) ‚â§ t ‚â§ b(x), x0 ‚â§ x ‚â§ x1. Also suppose that the functions a(x) and b(x) are both continuous and both have continuous derivatives for x0 ‚â§ x ‚â§ x1. Then, for x0 ‚â§ x ‚â§ x1, ::\\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\left (\\\\int_{a(x)}^{b(x)}f(x,t)\\\\,dt \\\\right) = f\\\\big(x,b(x)\\\\big)\\\\cdot \\\\frac{d}{dx} b(x) - f\\\\big(x,a(x)\\\\big)\\\\cdot \\\\frac{d}{dx} a(x) + \\\\int_{a(x)}^{b(x)}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} f(x,t) \\\\,dt. This formula is the general form of the Leibniz integral rule and can be derived using the fundamental theorem of calculus. The (first) fundamental theorem of calculus is just the particular case of the above formula where a(x) = a, a constant, b(x) = x, and f(x, t) = f(t). If both upper and lower limits are taken as constants, then the formula takes the shape of an operator equation: ::\\\\mathcal{I}_t \\\\partial_x = \\\\partial_x \\\\mathcal{I}_t where \\\\partial_x is the partial derivative with respect to x and \\\\mathcal{I}_t is the integral operator with respect to t over a fixed interval. That is, it is related to the symmetry of second derivatives, but involving integrals as well as derivatives. This case is also known as the Leibniz integral rule. The following three basic theorems on the interchange of limits are essentially equivalent: * the interchange of a derivative and an integral (differentiation under the integral sign; i.e., Leibniz integral rule); * the change of order of partial derivatives; * the change of order of integration (integration under the integral sign; i.e., Fubini's theorem). == Three-dimensional, time- dependent case == Figure 1: A vector field F(r, t) defined throughout space, and a surface Œ£ bounded by curve ‚àÇŒ£ moving with velocity v over which the field is integrated. A Leibniz integral rule for a two dimensional surface moving in three dimensional space is :\\\\frac {d}{dt} \\\\iint_{\\\\Sigma (t)} \\\\mathbf{F} (\\\\mathbf{r}, t) \\\\cdot d \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\iint_{\\\\Sigma (t)}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{F}_t (\\\\mathbf{r}, t) + \\\\left[ abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F} (\\\\mathbf{r}, t) \\\\right] \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\right) \\\\cdot d \\\\mathbf{A} - \\\\oint_{\\\\partial \\\\Sigma (t)} \\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F} ( \\\\mathbf{r}, t) \\\\right] \\\\cdot d \\\\mathbf{s}, where: :F(r, t) is a vector field at the spatial position r at time t, :Œ£ is a surface bounded by the closed curve ‚àÇŒ£, :dA is a vector element of the surface Œ£, :ds is a vector element of the curve ‚àÇŒ£, :v is the velocity of movement of the region Œ£, :‚àá‚ãÖ is the vector divergence, :√ó is the vector cross product, :The double integrals are surface integrals over the surface Œ£, and the line integral is over the bounding curve ‚àÇŒ£. == Higher dimensions == The Leibniz integral rule can be extended to multidimensional integrals. In two and three dimensions, this rule is better known from the field of fluid dynamics as the Reynolds transport theorem: :\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\int_{D(t)} F(\\\\vec{\\\\textbf x}, t) \\\\,dV = \\\\int_{D(t)} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} F(\\\\vec{\\\\textbf x}, t)\\\\,dV + \\\\int_{\\\\partial D(t)} F(\\\\vec{\\\\textbf x}, t) \\\\vec{\\\\textbf v}_b \\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}, where F(\\\\vec{\\\\textbf x}, t) is a scalar function, D(t) and ‚àÇD(t) denote a time- varying connected region of R3 and its boundary, respectively, \\\\vec{\\\\textbf v}_b is the Eulerian velocity of the boundary (see Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates) and d Œ£ = n dS is the unit normal component of the surface element. The general statement of the Leibniz integral rule requires concepts from differential geometry, specifically differential forms, exterior derivatives, wedge products and interior products. With those tools, the Leibniz integral rule in n dimensions is :\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\int_{\\\\Omega(t)}\\\\omega=\\\\int_{\\\\Omega(t)} i_{\\\\vec{\\\\textbf v}}(d_x\\\\omega)+\\\\int_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega(t)} i_{\\\\vec{\\\\textbf v}} \\\\omega+\\\\int_{\\\\Omega(t)}\\\\dot{\\\\omega}, where Œ©(t) is a time-varying domain of integration, œâ is a p-form, \\\\vec{\\\\textbf v}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec{\\\\textbf x}}{\\\\partial t} is the vector field of the velocity, i_{\\\\vec{\\\\textbf v}} denotes the interior product with \\\\vec{\\\\textbf v}, dxœâ is the exterior derivative of œâ with respect to the space variables only and \\\\dot{\\\\omega} is the time derivative of œâ. However, all of these identities can be derived from a most general statement about Lie derivatives: :\\\\left.\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\right_{t=0}\\\\int_{\\\\text{im}_{\\\\psi_t}(\\\\Omega)} \\\\omega = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} \\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\Psi} \\\\omega, Here, the ambient manifold on which the differential form \\\\omega lives includes both space and time. :\\\\Omega is the region of integration (a submanifold) at a given instant (it does not depend on t, since its parametrization as a submanifold defines its position in time), :\\\\mathcal{L} is the Lie derivative, :\\\\Psi is the spacetime vector field obtained from adding the unitary vector field in the direction of time to the purely spatial vector field \\\\vec{\\\\textbf v} from the previous formulas (i.e, \\\\Psi is the spacetime velocity of \\\\Omega), :\\\\psi_t is a diffeomorphism from the one-parameter group generated by the flow of \\\\Psi, and :\\\\text{im}_{\\\\psi_t}(\\\\Omega) is the image of \\\\Omega under such diffeomorphism. Something remarkable about this form, is that it can account for the case when \\\\Omega changes its shape and size over time, since such deformations are fully determined by \\\\Psi. == Measure theory statement == Let X be an open subset of \\\\mathbf{R}, and \\\\Omega be a measure space. Suppose f\\\\colon X \\\\times \\\\Omega \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbf{R} satisfies the following conditions: #f(x,\\\\omega) is a Lebesgue-integrable function of \\\\omega for each x \\\\in X. #For almost all \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega , the derivative f_x exists for all x \\\\in X. #There is an integrable function \\\\theta \\\\colon \\\\Omega \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbf{R} such that f_x(x,\\\\omega) \\\\leq \\\\theta ( \\\\omega) for all x \\\\in X and almost every \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega. Then by the dominated convergence theorem for all x \\\\in X, :\\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\int_\\\\Omega f(x, \\\\omega) \\\\, d\\\\omega = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} f_x (x, \\\\omega) \\\\, d\\\\omega. == Proofs == === Proof of basic form === We first prove the case of constant limits of integration a and b. We use Fubini's theorem to change the order of integration. For every x and h, such that h>0 and both x and x+h are within [x0,x1], we have: : \\\\int_x^{x+h} \\\\int_a^b f_x(x,t) \\\\,dt \\\\,dx = \\\\int_a^b \\\\int_x^{x+h} f_x(x,t) \\\\,dx \\\\,dt = \\\\int_a^b \\\\left(f(x+h,t)-f(x,t)\\\\right) \\\\,dt = \\\\int_a^b f(x+h,t) \\\\,dt - \\\\int_a^b f(x,t) \\\\,dt Note that the integrals at hand are well defined since f_x(x,t) is continuous at the closed rectangle [x_0,x_1] * [a,b] and thus also uniformly continuous there; thus its integrals by either dt or dx are continuous in the other variable and also integrable by it (essentially this is because for uniformly continuous functions, one may pass the limit through the integration sign, as elaborated below). Therefore: :\\\\frac{\\\\int_a^b f(x+h,t) \\\\,dt - \\\\int_a^b f(x,t) \\\\,dt }{h} = \\\\frac{1}{h}\\\\int_x^{x+h} \\\\int_a^b f_x(x,t) \\\\,dt \\\\,dx = \\\\frac{F(x+h)-F(x)}{h} Where we have defined: :F(u) \\\\equiv \\\\int_{x_0}^{u} \\\\int_a^b f_x(x,t) \\\\,dt \\\\,dx (we may replace x0 here by any other point between x0 and x) F is differentiable with derivative \\\\int_a^b f_x(x,t) \\\\,dt , so by the mean value theorem there is some x' in [x,x+h] satisfying: :\\\\frac{\\\\int_a^b f(x+h,t) \\\\,dt - \\\\int_a^b f(x,t) \\\\,dt }{h} = \\\\int_a^b f_x(x',t) \\\\,dt We now take the limit where h approaches zero. For the left hand side this limit is: :\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\int_a^b f(x,t) For the right hand side, we use the uniform continuity of fx(x',t) to get: : \\\\int_a^b f_x(x,t) \\\\,dt since for uniformly continuous functions, one may pass the limit through the integration sign, as we now formally show: Since fx(x',t) is uniformly continuous at [x_0,x_1]X[a,b], for every Œµ>0 there is a small enough region of x, such that for every x' in it and for every t in [a,b]: :f_x(x,t)-\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon}{b-a} < f_x(x',t) < f_x(x,t)+\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon}{b-a} thus: :\\\\int_a^b f_x(x,t) \\\\,dt - \\\\epsilon < \\\\int_a^b f_x(x',t) \\\\,dt < \\\\int_a^b f_x(x,t) \\\\,dt + \\\\epsilon So indeed: \\\\lim_{x'\\\\rightarrow x} \\\\int_a^b f_x(x',t) = \\\\int_a^b f_x(x,t) And we thus prove the desired result: :\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\int_a^b f(x,t) = \\\\int_a^b f_x(x,t) ====Another proof using the bounded convergence theorem==== If the integrals at hand are Lebesgue integrals, we may use the bounded convergence theorem (valid for these integrals, but not for Riemann integrals) in order to show that the limit can be passed through the integral sign. Note that this proof is weaker in the sense that it only shows that fx(x,t) is Lebesgue integrable, but not that it is Riemann integrable. In the former (stronger) proof, if f(x,t) is Riemann integrable, then so is fx(x,t) (and thus is obviously also Lebesgue integrable). Let :u(x) = \\\\int_a^b f(x, t) \\\\,dt. \\\\qquad (1) By the definition of the derivative, :u'(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\frac{u(x + h) - u(x)}{h}. \\\\qquad (2) Substitute equation (1) into equation (2). The difference of two integrals equals the integral of the difference, and 1/h is a constant, so :\\\\begin{align} u'(x) &= \\\\lim_{h \\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\frac{\\\\int_a^bf(x + h, t)\\\\,dt - \\\\int_a^b f(x, t)\\\\,dt}{h} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\lim_{h \\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\frac{\\\\int_a^b\\\\left( f(x + h, t) - f(x,t) \\\\right)\\\\,dt}{h} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\lim_{h \\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\int_a^b \\\\frac{f(x + h, t) - f(x, t)}{h} \\\\,dt. \\\\end{align} We now show that the limit can be passed through the integral sign. We claim that the passage of the limit under the integral sign is valid by the bounded convergence theorem (a corollary of the dominated convergence theorem). For each Œ¥ > 0, consider the difference quotient :f_\\\\delta(x, t) = \\\\frac{f(x + \\\\delta, t) - f(x, t)}{\\\\delta}. For t fixed, the mean value theorem implies there exists z in the interval [x, x + Œ¥] such that :f_\\\\delta(x, t) = f_x(z, t). Continuity of fx(x, t) and compactness of the domain together imply that fx(x, t) is bounded. The above application of the mean value theorem therefore gives a uniform (independent of t) bound on f_\\\\delta(x, t). The difference quotients converge pointwise to the partial derivative fx by the assumption that the partial derivative exists. The above argument shows that for every sequence {Œ¥n} -> 0, the sequence \\\\\\\\{f_{\\\\delta_n}(x, t)\\\\\\\\} is uniformly bounded and converges pointwise to fx. The bounded convergence theorem states that if a sequence of functions on a set of finite measure is uniformly bounded and converges pointwise, then passage of the limit under the integral is valid. In particular, the limit and integral may be exchanged for every sequence {Œ¥n} -> 0\\\\. Therefore, the limit as Œ¥ -> 0 may be passed through the integral sign. === Variable limits form === For a continuous real valued function g of one real variable, and real valued differentiable functions f_1 and f_2 of one real variable, :\\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\left( \\\\int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} g(t) \\\\,dt \\\\right )= g\\\\left(f_2(x)\\\\right) {f_2'(x)} - g\\\\left(f_1(x)\\\\right) {f_1'(x)}. This follows from the chain rule and the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Define : G(x) = \\\\int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} g(t) \\\\,dt , and : \\\\Gamma(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{x} g(t) \\\\,dt . (The lower limit just has to be some number in the domain of g ) Then, G(x) can be written as a composition: G(x) = (\\\\Gamma \\\\circ f_2)(x) - (\\\\Gamma \\\\circ f_1)(x) . The Chain Rule then implies that : G'(x) = \\\\Gamma'\\\\left(f_2(x)\\\\right) f_2'(x) - \\\\Gamma'\\\\left(f_1(x)\\\\right) f_1'(x) . By the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, \\\\Gamma'(x) = g(x) . Therefore, substituting this result above, we get the desired equation: : G'(x) = g\\\\left(f_2(x)\\\\right) {f_2'(x)} - g\\\\left(f_1(x)\\\\right) {f_1'(x)} . **Note:** This form can be particularly useful if the expression to be differentiated is of the form: :\\\\int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} h(x)g(t) \\\\,dt Because h(x) does not depend on the limits of integration, it may be move out from under the integral sign, and the above form may be used with the Product rule, i.e. :\\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\left( \\\\int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} h(x)g(t) \\\\,dt \\\\right ) = \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\left(h(x) \\\\int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} g(t) \\\\,dt \\\\right ) = h'(x)\\\\int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} g(t) \\\\,dt + h(x) \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\left(\\\\int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)} g(t) \\\\,dt \\\\right ) === General form with variable limits === Set :\\\\varphi(\\\\alpha) = \\\\int_a^b f(x,\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx, where a and b are functions of Œ± that exhibit increments Œîa and Œîb, respectively, when Œ± is increased by ŒîŒ±. Then, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Delta\\\\varphi &= \\\\varphi(\\\\alpha + \\\\Delta\\\\alpha) - \\\\varphi(\\\\alpha) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\int_{a + \\\\Delta a}^{b + \\\\Delta b}f(x, \\\\alpha + \\\\Delta\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx - \\\\int_a^b f(x, \\\\alpha)\\\\,dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\int_{a + \\\\Delta a}^af(x, \\\\alpha + \\\\Delta\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx + \\\\int_a^bf(x, \\\\alpha + \\\\Delta\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx + \\\\int_b^{b + \\\\Delta b} f(x, \\\\alpha+\\\\Delta\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx - \\\\int_a^b f(x, \\\\alpha)\\\\,dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -\\\\int_a^{a + \\\\Delta a} f(x, \\\\alpha + \\\\Delta\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx + \\\\int_a^b [f(x, \\\\alpha + \\\\Delta\\\\alpha) - f(x,\\\\alpha)]\\\\,dx + \\\\int_b^{b + \\\\Delta b} f(x, \\\\alpha + \\\\Delta\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx. \\\\end{align} A form of the mean value theorem, \\\\int_a^b f(x)\\\\,dx = (b - a)f(\\\\xi), where a < Œæ < b, may be applied to the first and last integrals of the formula for ŒîœÜ above, resulting in :\\\\Delta\\\\varphi = -\\\\Delta a f(\\\\xi_1, \\\\alpha + \\\\Delta\\\\alpha) + \\\\int_a^b [f(x, \\\\alpha + \\\\Delta\\\\alpha) - f(x,\\\\alpha)]\\\\,dx + \\\\Delta b f(\\\\xi_2, \\\\alpha + \\\\Delta\\\\alpha). Divide by ŒîŒ± and let ŒîŒ± ‚Üí 0. Notice Œæ1 ‚Üí a and Œæ2 ‚Üí b. We may pass the limit through the integral sign: :\\\\lim_{\\\\Delta\\\\alpha\\\\to 0}\\\\int_a^b \\\\frac{f(x,\\\\alpha + \\\\Delta\\\\alpha) - f(x,\\\\alpha)}{\\\\Delta\\\\alpha}\\\\,dx = \\\\int_a^b \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial\\\\alpha}f(x, \\\\alpha)\\\\,dx, again by the bounded convergence theorem. This yields the general form of the Leibniz integral rule, :\\\\frac{d\\\\varphi}{d\\\\alpha} = \\\\int_a^b \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial\\\\alpha}f(x, \\\\alpha)\\\\,dx + f(b, \\\\alpha) \\\\frac{db}{d\\\\alpha} - f(a, \\\\alpha)\\\\frac{da}{d\\\\alpha}. === Alternative Proof of General Form with Variable Limits, using the Chain Rule === The general form of Leibniz's Integral Rule with variable limits can be derived as a consequence of the basic form of Leibniz's Integral Rule, the Multivariable Chain Rule, and the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Suppose f is defined in a rectangle in the x-t plane, for x \\\\in [x_1, x_2] and t \\\\in [t_1, t_2] . Also, assume f and the partial derivative \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x} are both continuous functions on this rectangle. Suppose a, b are differentiable real valued functions defined on [x_1, x_2], with values in [t_1, t_2] (i.e. for every x \\\\in [x_1, x_2], a(x) , b(x) \\\\in [t_1, t_2] ). Now, set : F(x,y) = \\\\int_{t_1}^{y} f(x,t)\\\\,dt , for x \\\\in [x_1, x_2] and y \\\\in [t_1, t_2] and : G(x) = \\\\int_{a(x)}^{b(x)} f(x,t)\\\\,dt , for x \\\\in [x_1, x_2] Then, by properties of Definite Integrals, we can write : \\\\begin{align} G(x) &= \\\\int_{t_1}^{b(x)} f(x,t)\\\\,dt - \\\\int_{t_1}^{a(x)} f(x,t)\\\\,dt \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= F(x, b(x)) - F(x, a(x)) \\\\end{align} Since the functions F, a, b are all differentiable (see the remark at the end of the proof), by the Multivariable Chain Rule, it follows that G is differentiable, and its derivative is given by the formula: : G'(x) = \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial x} \\\\left(x, b(x) \\\\right) + \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial y} \\\\left(x, b(x) \\\\right) b'(x) \\\\right) - \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial x} \\\\left(x, a(x) \\\\right) + \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial y} \\\\left(x, a(x) \\\\right) a'(x) \\\\right) Now, note that for every x \\\\in [x_1, x_2] , and for every y \\\\in [t_1, t_2] , we have that \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial x}(x, y) = \\\\int_{t_1}^{y} \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x}(x,t) dt , because when taking the partial derivative with respect to x of F , we are keeping y fixed in the expression \\\\int_{t_1}^{y} f(x,t)\\\\,dt ; thus the basic form of Leibniz's Integral Rule with constant limits of integration applies. Next, by the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have that \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial y}(x, y) = f(x,y) ; because when taking the partial derivative with respect to y of F , the first variable x is fixed, so the fundamental theorem can indeed be applied. Substituting these results into the equation for G'(x) above gives: : \\\\begin{align} G'(x) &= \\\\left(\\\\int_{t_1}^{b(x)} \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x}(x,t) dt + f\\\\left(x, b(x) \\\\right) b'(x) \\\\right) - \\\\left(\\\\int_{t_1}^{a(x)} \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x}(x,t) dt + f\\\\left(x, a(x) \\\\right) a'(x) \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= f\\\\left(x,b(x)\\\\right) b'(x) - f\\\\left(x,a(x)\\\\right) a'(x) + \\\\int_{a(x)}^{b(x)} \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x}(x,t) dt, \\\\end{align} as desired. There is a technical point in the proof above which is worth noting: applying the Chain Rule to G requires that F already be Differentiable. This is where we use our assumptions about f . As mentioned above, the partial derivatives of F are given by the formulas \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial x}(x, y) = \\\\int_{t_1}^{y} \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x}(x,t) dt and \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial y}(x, y) = f(x,y) . Since \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x} is continuous, its integral is also a continuous function, and since f is also continuous, these two results show that both the partial derivatives of F are continuous. Since continuity of partial derivatives implies differentiability of the function, F is indeed differentiable. === Three-dimensional, time-dependent form === At time t the surface Œ£ in Figure 1 contains a set of points arranged about a centroid \\\\mathbf{C}(t). The function \\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t) can be written as :\\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{C}(t) + \\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{C}(t), t) = \\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{C}(t) +\\\\mathbf{I}, t), with \\\\mathbf{I} independent of time. Variables are shifted to a new frame of reference attached to the moving surface, with origin at \\\\mathbf{C}(t). For a rigidly translating surface, the limits of integration are then independent of time, so: :\\\\frac {d}{dt} \\\\left (\\\\iint_{\\\\Sigma (t)} d \\\\mathbf{A}_{\\\\mathbf{r}}\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t) \\\\right) = \\\\iint_\\\\Sigma d \\\\mathbf{A}_{\\\\mathbf{I}} \\\\cdot \\\\frac {d}{dt}\\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{C}(t) + \\\\mathbf{I}, t), where the limits of integration confining the integral to the region Œ£ no longer are time dependent so differentiation passes through the integration to act on the integrand only: :\\\\frac {d}{dt}\\\\mathbf{F}( \\\\mathbf{C}(t) + \\\\mathbf{I}, t) = \\\\mathbf{F}_t(\\\\mathbf{C}(t) + \\\\mathbf{I}, t) + \\\\mathbf{v \\\\cdot abla F}(\\\\mathbf{C}(t) + \\\\mathbf{I}, t) = \\\\mathbf{F}_t(\\\\mathbf{r}, t) + \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\cdot abla \\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t), with the velocity of motion of the surface defined by :\\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\frac {d}{dt} \\\\mathbf{C} (t). This equation expresses the material derivative of the field, that is, the derivative with respect to a coordinate system attached to the moving surface. Having found the derivative, variables can be switched back to the original frame of reference. We notice that (see article on curl) : abla \\\\times \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F}\\\\right) = ( abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F} + \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\cdot abla) \\\\mathbf{v}- ( abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\cdot abla) \\\\mathbf{F}, and that Stokes theorem equates the surface integral of the curl over Œ£ with a line integral over ‚àÇŒ£: :\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left(\\\\iint_{\\\\Sigma (t)} \\\\mathbf{F} (\\\\mathbf{r}, t) \\\\cdot d \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\right) = \\\\iint_{\\\\Sigma (t)} \\\\big(\\\\mathbf{F}_t (\\\\mathbf{r}, t) + \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{F \\\\cdot abla} \\\\right)\\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\left( abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\right) \\\\mathbf{v} - ( abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v})\\\\mathbf{F}\\\\big)\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{A} - \\\\oint_{\\\\partial \\\\Sigma (t)}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F}\\\\right)\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{s}. The sign of the line integral is based on the right-hand rule for the choice of direction of line element ds. To establish this sign, for example, suppose the field F points in the positive z-direction, and the surface Œ£ is a portion of the xy-plane with perimeter ‚àÇŒ£. We adopt the normal to Œ£ to be in the positive z-direction. Positive traversal of ‚àÇŒ£ is then counterclockwise (right-hand rule with thumb along z-axis). Then the integral on the left-hand side determines a positive flux of F through Œ£. Suppose Œ£ translates in the positive x-direction at velocity v. An element of the boundary of Œ£ parallel to the y-axis, say ds, sweeps out an area vt √ó ds in time t. If we integrate around the boundary ‚àÇŒ£ in a counterclockwise sense, vt √ó ds points in the negative z-direction on the left side of ‚àÇŒ£ (where ds points downward), and in the positive z-direction on the right side of ‚àÇŒ£ (where ds points upward), which makes sense because Œ£ is moving to the right, adding area on the right and losing it on the left. On that basis, the flux of F is increasing on the right of ‚àÇŒ£ and decreasing on the left. However, the dot product v √ó F ‚Ä¢ ds = ‚àíF √ó v ‚Ä¢ ds = ‚àíF ‚Ä¢ v √ó ds. Consequently, the sign of the line integral is taken as negative. If v is a constant, :\\\\frac {d}{dt} \\\\iint_{\\\\Sigma (t)} \\\\mathbf{F} (\\\\mathbf{r}, t) \\\\cdot d \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\iint_{\\\\Sigma (t)} \\\\big(\\\\mathbf{F}_t (\\\\mathbf{r}, t) + \\\\left( abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\right) \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\big) \\\\cdot d \\\\mathbf{A} - \\\\oint_{\\\\partial \\\\Sigma (t)}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F}\\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\,d\\\\mathbf{s}, which is the quoted result. This proof does not consider the possibility of the surface deforming as it moves. === Alternative derivation === Lemma. One has: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial b} \\\\left (\\\\int_a^b f(x) \\\\,dx \\\\right ) = f(b), \\\\qquad \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial a} \\\\left (\\\\int_a^b f(x) \\\\,dx \\\\right )= -f(a). Proof. From the proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial b} \\\\left (\\\\int_a^b f(x) \\\\,dx \\\\right ) &= \\\\lim_{\\\\Delta b \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta b} \\\\left[ \\\\int_a^{b+\\\\Delta b} f(x)\\\\,dx - \\\\int_a^b f(x)\\\\,dx \\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\lim_{\\\\Delta b \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta b} \\\\int_b^{b+\\\\Delta b} f(x)\\\\,dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\lim_{\\\\Delta b \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta b} \\\\left[ f(b) \\\\Delta b + O\\\\left(\\\\Delta b^2\\\\right) \\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= f(b), \\\\end{align} and :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial a} \\\\left (\\\\int_a^b f(x) \\\\,dx \\\\right )&= \\\\lim_{\\\\Delta a \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta a} \\\\left[ \\\\int_{a+\\\\Delta a}^b f(x)\\\\,dx - \\\\int_a^b f(x)\\\\,dx \\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\lim_{\\\\Delta a \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta a} \\\\int_{a+\\\\Delta a}^a f(x)\\\\,dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\lim_{\\\\Delta a \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta a} \\\\left[ -f(a) \\\\Delta a + O\\\\left(\\\\Delta a^2\\\\right) \\\\right]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= -f(a). \\\\end{align} Suppose a and b are constant, and that f(x) involves a parameter Œ± which is constant in the integration but may vary to form different integrals. Assume that f(x, Œ±) is a continuous function of x and Œ± in the compact set {(x, Œ±) : Œ±0 ‚â§ Œ± ‚â§ Œ±1 and a ‚â§ x ‚â§ b}, and that the partial derivative fŒ±(x, Œ±) exists and is continuous. If one defines: :\\\\varphi(\\\\alpha) = \\\\int_a^b f(x,\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx, then \\\\varphi may be differentiated with respect to Œ± by differentiating under the integral sign, i.e., :\\\\frac{d\\\\varphi}{d\\\\alpha}=\\\\int_a^b\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial\\\\alpha}f(x,\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx. By the Heine‚ÄìCantor theorem it is uniformly continuous in that set. In other words, for any Œµ > 0 there exists ŒîŒ± such that for all values of x in [a, b], :f(x,\\\\alpha+\\\\Delta \\\\alpha)-f(x,\\\\alpha)<\\\\varepsilon. On the other hand, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Delta\\\\varphi &=\\\\varphi(\\\\alpha+\\\\Delta \\\\alpha)-\\\\varphi(\\\\alpha) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &=\\\\int_a^b f(x,\\\\alpha+\\\\Delta\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx - \\\\int_a^b f(x,\\\\alpha)\\\\, dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &=\\\\int_a^b \\\\left (f(x,\\\\alpha+\\\\Delta\\\\alpha)-f(x,\\\\alpha) \\\\right )\\\\,dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &\\\\leq \\\\varepsilon (b-a). \\\\end{align} Hence œÜ(Œ±) is a continuous function. Similarly if \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial\\\\alpha} f(x,\\\\alpha) exists and is continuous, then for all Œµ > 0 there exists ŒîŒ± such that: :\\\\forall x \\\\in [a, b], \\\\quad \\\\left\\\\frac{f(x,\\\\alpha+\\\\Delta \\\\alpha)-f(x,\\\\alpha)}{\\\\Delta \\\\alpha} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial\\\\alpha}\\\\right<\\\\varepsilon. Therefore, :\\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\varphi}{\\\\Delta \\\\alpha}=\\\\int_a^b\\\\frac{f(x,\\\\alpha+\\\\Delta\\\\alpha)-f(x,\\\\alpha)}{\\\\Delta \\\\alpha}\\\\,dx = \\\\int_a^b \\\\frac{\\\\partial f(x,\\\\alpha)}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha}\\\\,dx + R, where :R < \\\\int_a^b \\\\varepsilon\\\\, dx = \\\\varepsilon(b-a). Now, Œµ ‚Üí 0 as ŒîŒ± ‚Üí 0, so :\\\\lim_{{\\\\Delta \\\\alpha} \\\\rarr 0}\\\\frac{\\\\Delta\\\\varphi}{\\\\Delta \\\\alpha}= \\\\frac{d\\\\varphi}{d\\\\alpha} = \\\\int_a^b \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha} f(x,\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx. This is the formula we set out to prove. Now, suppose :\\\\int_a^b f(x,\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx=\\\\varphi(\\\\alpha), where a and b are functions of Œ± which take increments Œîa and Œîb, respectively, when Œ± is increased by ŒîŒ±. Then, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Delta\\\\varphi &=\\\\varphi(\\\\alpha+\\\\Delta\\\\alpha)-\\\\varphi(\\\\alpha) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &=\\\\int_{a+\\\\Delta a}^{b+\\\\Delta b}f(x,\\\\alpha+\\\\Delta\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx -\\\\int_a^b f(x,\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &=\\\\int_{a+\\\\Delta a}^af(x,\\\\alpha+\\\\Delta\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx+\\\\int_a^bf(x,\\\\alpha+\\\\Delta\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx+\\\\int_b^{b+\\\\Delta b}f(x,\\\\alpha+\\\\Delta\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx -\\\\int_a^b f(x,\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &=-\\\\int_a^{a+\\\\Delta a} f(x,\\\\alpha+\\\\Delta\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx+\\\\int_a^b[f(x,\\\\alpha+\\\\Delta\\\\alpha)-f(x,\\\\alpha)]\\\\,dx+\\\\int_b^{b+\\\\Delta b} f(x,\\\\alpha+\\\\Delta\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx. \\\\end{align} A form of the mean value theorem, \\\\int_a^b f(x)\\\\,dx=(b-a)f(\\\\xi), where a < Œæ < b, can be applied to the first and last integrals of the formula for ŒîœÜ above, resulting in :\\\\Delta\\\\varphi=-\\\\Delta a\\\\,f(\\\\xi_1,\\\\alpha+\\\\Delta\\\\alpha)+\\\\int_a^b[f(x,\\\\alpha+\\\\Delta\\\\alpha)-f(x,\\\\alpha)]\\\\,dx+\\\\Delta b\\\\,f(\\\\xi_2,\\\\alpha+\\\\Delta\\\\alpha). Dividing by ŒîŒ±, letting ŒîŒ± ‚Üí 0, noticing Œæ1 ‚Üí a and Œæ2 ‚Üí b and using the above derivation for :\\\\frac{d\\\\varphi}{d\\\\alpha} = \\\\int_a^b\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha} f(x,\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx yields :\\\\frac{d\\\\varphi}{d\\\\alpha} = \\\\int_a^b\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha} f(x,\\\\alpha)\\\\,dx+f(b,\\\\alpha)\\\\frac{\\\\partial b}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha}-f(a,\\\\alpha)\\\\frac{\\\\partial a}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha}. This is the general form of the Leibniz integral rule. == Examples == === Example 1: Fixed limits === Consider the function :\\\\varphi(\\\\alpha)=\\\\int_0^1\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{x^2+\\\\alpha^2}\\\\,dx. The function under the integral sign is not continuous at the point (x, Œ±) = (0, 0), and the function œÜ(Œ±) has a discontinuity at Œ± = 0 because œÜ(Œ±) approaches ¬±œÄ/2 as Œ± ‚Üí 0¬±. If we differentiate œÜ(Œ±) with respect to Œ± under the integral sign, we get :\\\\frac{d}{d\\\\alpha} \\\\varphi(\\\\alpha)=\\\\int_0^1\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial\\\\alpha}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{x^2+\\\\alpha^2}\\\\right)\\\\,dx=\\\\int_0^1\\\\frac{x^2-\\\\alpha^2}{(x^2+\\\\alpha^2)^2} dx=-\\\\frac{x}{x^2+\\\\alpha^2}\\\\bigg_0^1=-\\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\alpha^2}, which is, of course, true for all values of Œ± except Œ± = 0. This may be integrated (with respect to Œ±) to find :\\\\varphi(\\\\alpha) = \\\\begin{cases} 0, & \\\\alpha = 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\arctan({\\\\alpha})+\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}, & \\\\alpha eq 0. \\\\end{cases} === Example 2: Variable limits === An example with variable limits: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\int_{\\\\sin x}^{\\\\cos x} \\\\cosh t^2\\\\,dt &= \\\\cosh\\\\left(\\\\cos^2 x\\\\right) \\\\frac{d}{dx}(\\\\cos x) - \\\\cosh\\\\left(\\\\sin^2 x\\\\right) \\\\frac{d}{dx} (\\\\sin x) + \\\\int_{\\\\sin x}^{\\\\cos x} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} \\\\left (\\\\cosh t^2\\\\right )dt \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\cosh\\\\left(\\\\cos^2 x\\\\right) (-\\\\sin x) - \\\\cosh\\\\left(\\\\sin^2 x\\\\right) (\\\\cos x) + 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= - \\\\cosh\\\\left(\\\\cos^2 x\\\\right) \\\\sin x - \\\\cosh\\\\left(\\\\sin^2 x\\\\right) \\\\cos x. \\\\end{align} == Applications == === Evaluating definite integrals === The formula :\\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\left (\\\\int\\\\limits_{a(x)}^{b(x)}f(x,t) dt \\\\right) = f\\\\big(x,b(x)\\\\big)\\\\cdot \\\\frac{d}{dx} b(x) - f\\\\big(x,a(x)\\\\big)\\\\cdot \\\\frac{d}{dx} a(x) + \\\\int\\\\limits_{a(x)}^{b(x)}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} f(x,t) dt can be of use when evaluating certain definite integrals. When used in this context, the Leibniz rule for differentiating under the integral sign is also known as Feynman's trick or technique for integration. ==== Example 3 ==== Consider :\\\\varphi(\\\\alpha)=\\\\int_0^\\\\pi \\\\ln \\\\left (1-2\\\\alpha\\\\cos(x)+\\\\alpha^2 \\\\right )\\\\,dx, \\\\qquad \\\\alpha > 1.

To determine C_2 in the same manner, we should need to substitute in a value of \\\\alpha greater than 1 in \\\\varphi (\\\\alpha). This is somewhat inconvenient. Instead, we substitute \\\\alpha = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta}, where \\\\beta < 1. Then, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\varphi(\\\\alpha) &=\\\\int_0^\\\\pi\\\\left(\\\\ln \\\\left (1-2\\\\beta \\\\cos(x)+\\\\beta^2 \\\\right )-2\\\\ln\\\\beta\\\\right) dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\int_0^\\\\pi \\\\ln \\\\left (1-2\\\\beta \\\\cos(x)+\\\\beta^2 \\\\right )\\\\,dx -\\\\int_0^\\\\pi 2\\\\ln\\\\beta dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &=0-2\\\\pi\\\\ln\\\\beta \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &=2\\\\pi\\\\ln\\\\alpha. \\\\end{align} Therefore, C_{2} = 0 The definition of \\\\varphi (\\\\alpha) is now complete: :\\\\varphi (\\\\alpha) = \\\\begin{cases} 0, & \\\\alpha < 1, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2\\\\pi \\\\ln \\\\alpha, & \\\\alpha > 1. \\\\end{cases} The foregoing discussion, of course, does not apply when \\\\alpha = \\\\pm 1, since the conditions for differentiability are not met. ==== Example 4 ==== :\\\\textbf I = \\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2} \\\\frac{1}{(a\\\\cos^2 x +b\\\\sin^2 x)^2}\\\\,dx,\\\\qquad a,b > 0. First we calculate: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\textbf{J} &= \\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2} \\\\frac{1}{a\\\\cos^2 x + b \\\\sin^2 x} dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2} \\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\cos^2 x}}{a + b \\\\frac{\\\\sin^2 x}{\\\\cos^2 x}} dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2} \\\\frac{\\\\sec^2 x}{a +b \\\\tan^2 x} dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\frac{1}{b} \\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{a}{b}}\\\\right)^2+\\\\tan^2 x}\\\\,d(\\\\tan x) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{ab}}\\\\arctan \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{b}{a}}\\\\tan x\\\\right) \\\\Bigg_0^{\\\\pi/2} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &=\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2\\\\sqrt{ab}}. \\\\end{align} The limits of integration being independent of a, we have: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\textbf J}{\\\\partial a}=-\\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2} \\\\frac{\\\\cos^2 x}{\\\\left(a\\\\cos^2 x+b \\\\sin^2 x\\\\right)^2}\\\\,dx On the other hand: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\textbf J}{\\\\partial a}= \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial a} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2\\\\sqrt{ab}}\\\\right) =-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4\\\\sqrt{a^3b}}. Equating these two relations then yields :\\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2} \\\\frac{\\\\cos^2 x}{\\\\left(a \\\\cos^2 x+b \\\\sin^2 x\\\\right)^2}\\\\,dx=\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4\\\\sqrt{a^3b}}. In a similar fashion, pursuing \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\textbf J}{\\\\partial b} yields :\\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2}\\\\frac{\\\\sin^2 x}{\\\\left(a\\\\cos^2 x+b\\\\sin^2 x\\\\right)^2}\\\\,dx = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4\\\\sqrt{ab^3}}. Adding the two results then produces :\\\\textbf I = \\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\left(a\\\\cos^2x+b\\\\sin^2x\\\\right)^2}\\\\,dx=\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4\\\\sqrt{ab}}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{a}+\\\\frac{1}{b}\\\\right), which computes \\\\textbf I as desired. This derivation may be generalized. Note that if we define :\\\\textbf I_n = \\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\left(a\\\\cos^2 x+b\\\\sin^2 x\\\\right)^n}\\\\,dx, it can easily be shown that :(1-n)\\\\textbf I_n = \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\textbf I_{n-1}}{\\\\partial a} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\textbf I_{n-1}}{\\\\partial b} Given \\\\textbf{I}_1, this integral reduction formula can be used to compute all of the values of \\\\textbf{I}_n for n > 1. Integrals like \\\\mathbf{I} and \\\\mathbf{J} may also be handled using the Weierstrass substitution. ==== Example 5 ==== Here, we consider the integral :\\\\textbf I(\\\\alpha)=\\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2} \\\\frac{\\\\ln (1+\\\\cos\\\\alpha \\\\cos x)}{\\\\cos x}\\\\,dx, \\\\qquad 0 < \\\\alpha < \\\\pi. Differentiating under the integral with respect to \\\\alpha, we have :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{d}{d\\\\alpha} \\\\textbf{I}(\\\\alpha) &= \\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial\\\\alpha} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\ln(1 + \\\\cos\\\\alpha \\\\cos x)}{\\\\cos x}\\\\right) dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &=-\\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2}\\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\alpha}{1+\\\\cos \\\\alpha \\\\cos x}\\\\,dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=-\\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2}\\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\alpha}{\\\\left(\\\\cos^2 \\\\frac{x}{2}+\\\\sin^2 \\\\frac{x}{2}\\\\right)+\\\\cos \\\\alpha \\\\left(\\\\cos^2 \\\\frac{x}{2}-\\\\sin^2 \\\\frac{x}{2}\\\\right)} dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &=-\\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\alpha}{1-\\\\cos\\\\alpha} \\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\cos^2\\\\frac{x}{2}} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{1+\\\\cos \\\\alpha}{1-\\\\cos \\\\alpha} +\\\\tan^2 \\\\frac{x}{2}} dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &=-\\\\frac{2\\\\sin\\\\alpha}{1-\\\\cos\\\\alpha} \\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2} \\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sec^2 \\\\frac{x}{2}}{\\\\frac{2 \\\\cos^2 \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2}}{2 \\\\sin^2\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2}} + \\\\tan^2 \\\\frac{x}{2}} dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &=-\\\\frac{2\\\\left(2 \\\\sin \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2} \\\\cos \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2}\\\\right)}{2 \\\\sin^2 \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2}} \\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\cot^2\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2} + \\\\tan^2 \\\\frac{x}{2}} d\\\\left(\\\\tan \\\\frac{x}{2}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &=-2\\\\cot \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2}\\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\cot^2\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2} + \\\\tan^2\\\\frac{x}{2}}\\\\,d\\\\left(\\\\tan \\\\frac{x}{2}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &=-2\\\\arctan \\\\left(\\\\tan \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2} \\\\tan \\\\frac{x}{2} \\\\right) \\\\bigg_0^{\\\\pi/2}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &=-\\\\alpha. \\\\end{align} Therefore: :\\\\textbf{I}(\\\\alpha) = C - \\\\frac{\\\\alpha^2}{2}. But \\\\textbf{I} \\\\Biggl(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} \\\\Biggl) = 0 by definition so C = \\\\frac{\\\\pi^2}{8} and :\\\\textbf I(\\\\alpha) = \\\\frac{\\\\pi^2}{8}-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha^2}{2}. ==== Example 6 ==== Here, we consider the integral :\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi}e^{\\\\cos\\\\theta} \\\\cos(\\\\sin\\\\theta)\\\\,d\\\\theta. We introduce a new variable œÜ and rewrite the integral as :f(\\\\varphi) = \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} e^{\\\\varphi\\\\cos\\\\theta} \\\\cos(\\\\varphi\\\\sin\\\\theta)\\\\,d\\\\theta. When œÜ = 1 this equals the original integral. However, this more general integral may be differentiated with respect to \\\\varphi: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{df}{d\\\\varphi} &= \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial\\\\varphi}\\\\left(e^{\\\\varphi\\\\cos\\\\theta} \\\\cos(\\\\varphi\\\\sin\\\\theta)\\\\right)\\\\,d\\\\theta \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} e^{\\\\varphi\\\\cos\\\\theta} (\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\cos(\\\\varphi\\\\sin\\\\theta)-\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\sin(\\\\varphi\\\\sin\\\\theta))\\\\,d\\\\theta. \\\\end{align} This is the line integral of F(x,y)=(e^{\\\\varphi x}\\\\sin(ty),e^{\\\\varphi x}\\\\cos(ty))over the unit circle. By Green's Theorem, it equals the double integral over the unit disk of \\\\partial F_2/\\\\partial x-\\\\partial F_1/\\\\partial y which equals 0. This implies that f(œÜ) is constant. The constant may be determined by evaluating f at \\\\varphi = 0: :f(0) = \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} 1\\\\,d\\\\theta = 2\\\\pi. Therefore, the original integral also equals 2\\\\pi. ==== Other problems to solve ==== There are innumerable other integrals that can be solved using the technique of differentiation under the integral sign. For example, in each of the following cases, the original integral may be replaced by a similar integral having a new parameter \\\\alpha: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\sin x}{x}\\\\,dx &\\\\to \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-\\\\alpha x} \\\\frac{\\\\sin x}{x} dx,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2} \\\\frac{x}{\\\\tan x}\\\\,dx &\\\\to\\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/2} \\\\frac{\\\\tan^{-1}(\\\\alpha \\\\tan x)}{\\\\tan x} dx,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\ln (1+x^2)}{1+x^2}\\\\,dx &\\\\to\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\ln (1+\\\\alpha^2 x^2)}{1+x^2} dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\\\int_0^1 \\\\frac{x-1}{\\\\ln x}\\\\,dx &\\\\to \\\\int_0^1 \\\\frac{x^\\\\alpha-1}{\\\\ln x} dx. \\\\end{align} The first integral, the Dirichlet integral, is absolutely convergent for positive Œ± but only conditionally convergent when \\\\alpha = 0. Therefore, differentiation under the integral sign is easy to justify when \\\\alpha > 0, but proving that the resulting formula remains valid when \\\\alpha = 0 requires some careful work. === Infinite series === The measure-theoretic version of differentiation under the integral sign also applies to summation (finite or infinite) by interpreting summation as counting measure. An example of an application is the fact that power series are differentiable in their radius of convergence. == In popular culture == Differentiation under the integral sign is mentioned in the late physicist Richard Feynman's best-selling memoir Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! in the chapter \\"A Different Box of Tools\\". He describes learning it, while in high school, from an old text, Advanced Calculus (1926), by Frederick S. Woods (who was a professor of mathematics in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology). The technique was not often taught when Feynman later received his formal education in calculus, but using this technique, Feynman was able to solve otherwise difficult integration problems upon his arrival at graduate school at Princeton University: > One thing I never did learn was contour integration. I had learned to do > integrals by various methods shown in a book that my high school physics > teacher Mr. Bader had given me. One day he told me to stay after class. > \\"Feynman,\\" he said, \\"you talk too much and you make too much noise. I know > why. You're bored. So I'm going to give you a book. You go up there in the > back, in the corner, and study this book, and when you know everything > that's in this book, you can talk again.\\" So every physics class, I paid no > attention to what was going on with Pascal's Law, or whatever they were > doing. I was up in the back with this book: \\"Advanced Calculus\\", by Woods. > Bader knew I had studied \\"Calculus for the Practical Man\\" a little bit, so > he gave me the real works‚Äîit was for a junior or senior course in college. > It had Fourier series, Bessel functions, determinants, elliptic > functions‚Äîall kinds of wonderful stuff that I didn't know anything about. > That book also showed how to differentiate parameters under the integral > sign‚Äîit's a certain operation. It turns out that's not taught very much in > the universities; they don't emphasize it. But I caught on how to use that > method, and I used that one damn tool again and again.

If it was contour integration, they would have found > it; if it was a simple series expansion, they would have found it.

It belongs to Paroaria, a genus in the tanager family Thraupidae. ==Taxonomy== In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the red-capped cardinal in the supplement to his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in \\"America\\". He used the French name Le cardinal d'Am√©rique and the Latin name Cardinalis americanis. The two stars (**) at the start of the paragraph indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson in his Ornithologie. One of these was the red-capped cardinal. Linnaeus included a terse description, coined the binomial name Tanagra gularis and cited Brisson's work. The specific name gularis is Latin for \\"of the throat\\". The type locality has been restricted to French Guiana. This species is now placed in the genus Paroaria that was introduced by the French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1832. The genus Paroaria is classified in the family Thraupidae, unlike the cardinals proper which are in the Cardinalidae. The masked cardinal was formerly considered conspecific with the red-capped cardinal. The masked cardinal markedly differs from the red-capped cardinal by the black ear- coverts and the red (not black) lower throat and upper chest. Additionally, its lower mandible is typically whitish, but this is not entirely consistent, as it occasionally is pale flesh-coloured. This distinctive taxon was determined a different species, as suggested by the lack of hybridization with P. g. gularis in the limited area of overlap in southern Venezuela. There are two subspecies: * P. g. gularis (Linnaeus, 1766) (eastern Colombia to eastern Peru and through the Guianas to central Brazil) * P. g. cervicalis Sclater, PL, 1862 (north east Bolivia and south west Brazil ==Description== left The adult red-capped cardinal is long and weighs about . The nominate subspecies has a crimson head, blackish lores and ocular region, and shiny black upperparts, apart from a white partial collar extending up the neck sides from the white underparts. The throat is black, extending to a point on the upper chest. The upper mandible is black, while the lower is pale flesh-coloured. The legs are dark grey (almost black) and the iris is brownish-orange. In pattern the juvenile resemble the adults, but the upperparts are dusky-brown, the head is deep brownish-buff (darker on the cap), the bill is entirely black and the iris is pale, dull creamy-yellow. The song is a variable, often repeated series of suweet-chu notes, and the call is a sharp chep. ==Distribution and habitat== It occurs in lowlands of the Guianas, Venezuela, eastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador, eastern Peru, northern and eastern Bolivia and the Amazon basin in Brazil. In Brazil it is, except for populations in the relatively open lowlands of north-eastern Roraima and along the Branco River and lower Rio Negro, apparently largely absent from the regions north of the northern bank of the Amazon River, but these regions are generally very poorly known and its presence cannot be discounted, especially in the section between the lower Rio Negro and Rio Jari (the river on the border between Par√° and Amap√°). This is a bird of swamps, mangrove, v√°rzea and other semi-open areas near water. It is generally common, and even occurs in lightly wooded wet habitats in towns or cities (e.g. Manaus and Puerto Maldonado). ==Behaviour== The red-capped cardinal feeds on insects, rice and fruit. It is usually found in conspicuous pairs or family groups. If there is a well-marked breeding season, it extends over much of the year. The red-capped cardinal has been recorded to breed at least from June to September in northern South America but at Sacha Lodge at the Napo River (Ecuador) an adult was seen feeding a fledgling shiny cowbird (a brood parasite) in late March. This suggests that breeding can also occur as early as February/March. There is no indication for a difference in breeding seasons between the red-capped and the masked cardinals. They build a shallow open cup nest, some wide and high outside with a wide by deep cup, in a tree or some other secure spot. In Ecuador, a nest in the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve was built in the roots of a Macrolobium sp. standing in water, while one at Sacha Lodge was above ground in a tree. For nest material, it uses rootlets, thin twigs, and ferns. The clutch is two or three eggs. These have a background colour varying between whitish and dull olive and have dense dark brown flecks and blotches, heavier at the blunt end. They measure about . This species is parasitised by the shiny cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis). ==References== == Further reading== * ffrench, Richard; O'Neill, John Patton & Eckelberry, Don R.

The Ambracian Gulf, also known as the Gulf of Arta or the Gulf of Actium, and in some official documents as the Amvrakikos Gulf (), is a gulf of the Ionian Sea in northwestern Greece. About long and wide, it is one of the largest enclosed gulfs in Greece, and due to its ecological importance is one of the National Parks of Greece. The towns of Preveza, Amphilochia (formerly Karvassaras), and Vonitsa lie on its shores. ==Name== The gulf takes its name from the ancient city of Ambracia located near its shores. Its alternative name comes from the medieval (and modern) city of Arta, located in the same place as ancient Ambracia. ==Geography== The entrance to the gulf is through a -wide channel between Aktio (ancient Actium) on the south and Preveza on the north; a recent road tunnel connects the two. The gulf is quite shallow, and its shore is broken by numerous marshes, large parts of which form an estuary system. The Louros and Arachthos (or Arta) rivers drain into it; for this reason it is warmer and less salty than the Ionian, and a current flows from the gulf into the sea. It is rich in grey mullet, sole, and eel, and is also very famous for shrimps. Sea turtles and dolphins regularly make an appearance, while it contains lagoons very important for birds. ==History== Detailed map of the Ambracian Gulf, drawn by W. J. Cooling of the British Admiralty in 1830 The Ambracian Gulf was the site of the Battle of Actium, in which Augustus' forces defeated those of Mark Antony and Cleopatra. From Greek independence (Treaty of Constantinople, 1832) until the Second Balkan War (Treaty of Bucharest, 1913), the gulf formed part of the border between the Kingdom of Greece and the Ottoman Empire. The remains of numerous ancient cities lie on its shores: Actium at the entrance, where the famous Battle of Actium was fought in 31 BC; Nicopolis, Argos Ippatum, Limnaea, and Olpae. ==Transportation== Since 2002, the northern and southern sides at the mouth of the gulf are connected by the Aktio-Preveza Undersea Tunnel. The tunnel greatly shortens the travel distance across the gulf, which used to be possible only by ferry. ==References== ===Notes=== *James Wolfe, \\"Observations on the Gulf of Arta, Made in 1830\\" Journal of the Royal Geographical Society of London 3:77-94 (1833) at JSTOR * ==External links== *Preveza Weather Station SV6GMQ - Live Weather Conditions (in English and Greek) Category:Gulfs of Greece Category:Gulfs of the Ionian Sea Category:Ramsar sites in Greece Category:Landforms of Preveza (regional unit) Category:Landforms of Epirus (region) Category:Landforms of Aetolia- Acarnania Category:Landforms of Western Greece ","title":"Ambracian Gulf"},{"id":"2558894","text":"The Government Clerical Service Union (GCSU) is a trade union of clerical workers who work in the public sector in Sri Lanka. This was formed in the 1920s when Sri Lanka (Ceylon) was under British colonial rule. It is a politically independent trade union but the majority of the activists were Communists early in its history. ==History== ===British colonial era=== British colonialists who ruled Sri Lanka (Ceylon) from March 1815 educated the Sri Lankan people to work in the public sector because it was very difficult to bring sufficient administrative staff from the UK to administer the colony. The schools formed by Christian missionaries taught the English language to the students and they were employed in the public sector because of their knowledge of the English language. After 1815 the British colonial rulers started educating Sri Lanka's public workers about the administration rules and regulations. They also held examinations for the clerical workers to upgrade their working level. The famous manual among the public sector workers named Administration Rules and Regulations (ARR) is still used in Sri Lanka. An examination was held for the administration officers called the Ceylon Administrative Service (CAS) exam. After passing it they were graded as CAS officers. ===Before 1948=== In the 1920s the clerical workers of Sri Lanka formed a union to protect their workers rights. From beginning of the GCSU in February 1920 to the political independence of Sri Lanka in 1948 it has to struggle with British rulers in order to secure workers' rights and national independence. ===From 1948 to 1977=== After the political independence from British colonial rulers in February 1948 the GCSU became a more powerful force in Sri Lanka. Most of the GCSU members were members of Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) and Communist Party of Sri Lanka (CP-Moscow wing). Dr. N.M. Perera the leader of LSSP was openly supporting the activities of the GCSU by protecting workers' rights. ===After 1977=== After the year 1977, the situation for Sri Lanka's left-wing political movements was getting worse due to the former President of Sri Lanka Junius Richard Jayawardena's (J.R. Jayawardena) right- wing policies. But the GCSU still remained as a force among public-sector workers. ==Role of I.J. Wickrema== ===Most powerful union=== I. J. Wickrema was a promising leader of the GCSU in the 1960s. He led the GCSU during the \\"Golden era\\" in its history. The total number of members was around 30,000 out of 50,000 clerical workers in Sri Lanka in the 1960s. He organised branch committees of the union throughout the country, giving more strength to it. He was elected as secretary of the union and later became its President. During his period in office (1965‚Äì70), many incidents happened in Sri Lanka's politics and they reacted to the changes by taking the side of the worker. Anyone can refer to their official news paper \\"Red Tape\\" and get an idea of how they reacted to the changing political situation of the country. He introduced the Death donation scheme and the Retirement donation scheme from which its members benefited at a time of grief and in the later years of their lives. ===Building the headquarters=== Under I.J. Wickrema's leadership the GCSU started work to build their own headquarters in front of the \\"Lake House\\" (the office of the government news papers). Famous Sri Lanka's drama player Henry Jayasena staged dramas to raise funds for the new building. Former Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Mrs.Sirimavo R.D.

Wickrema left the union at the end of 1970 as he was appointed as a CAS officer. The 1977 government of Mrs.Sirimavo was over and the new United National Party government came into power under the leadership of Junius Richard Jayawardena. He was subjected to political revenge and his close relatives worked in the public sector were transferred to difficult areas. Finally he was sent to the CAS officers pool giving him mental agony and a year later he was retired. He died in late 1979 and his funeral march was organised under the banner of the GCSU. == GCSU martyrs == In June 1947 V.

The following year, he received a Teaching Credential from CSU in Hayward, then worked for his father's roofing company and as a fork-lift driver at Ward's before getting his first job with the Legislature on the staff of Assemblyman Robert W. Crown. In 1986, Lockyer graduated with a J.D. from University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law. (He returned to the classroom in 2009 as a non-tenured college professor, teaching undergraduate courses in American State Politics at the University of Southern California and the University of California at Irvine.) With his early legislative experience, Lockyer began his own political career as a School Board member of the San Leandro Unified School District, as chair of the Alameda County Democratic Central Committee, and California coordinator of Senator George McGovern's 1972 campaign for the Presidency. ==Personal life== Lockyer, who lives in Hayward and Long Beach, California, was married in April 2003 to public service attorney Nadia Lockyer, a former Alameda County Supervisor, with whom he has three children, a twelve-year-old son, and two twin sons, born in December 2015. By an earlier marriage, he also has an adult daughter who is an attorney at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ==Legislative career== Lockyer first won a State Assembly seat in a Special Election of September 4, 1973, following the accidental death of his political mentor, Bay Area Assemblyman Robert W. Crown. He served in the legislature for the next twenty-five years, more than half that time in the state senate, where, in 1994, he was chosen by his peers to be President Pro Tem, the most powerful position of the upper legislative house. In his spare time, Lockyer attended law school classes in Sacramento and received a law degree from the McGeorge School of Law, University of the Pacific. As legislator, Lockyer won close friends on both sides of the partisan aisle, including Jim Brulte, Republican Minority Leader of the state senate, who would long remember Lockyer's skill at compromise and consensus- building.,\\"What Ails California? What Went Wrong?\\", Travers Conference in Ethics and ACcountability, UC Berkeley, January 4, 2010, http://uctv.tv/search-details.aspx?showID=17859&subject;=pa and Democratic Speaker of the Assembly Willie Brown, who recalled that, by the time Lockyer left the legislature in 1998, \\"Capitol insiders took his prolific effectiveness for granted.\\"\\"Experts expound\\", Capitol Weekly, July 16, 2009 ===Environmental protection legislation and the Bay Trail=== As a freshman legislator in 1974, Lockyer wrote the first legislation to provide state funding for emergency oil spill decontamination. During his legislative career, as a close ally of environmental pressure groups like the Sierra Club and the Planning and Conservation League,Noted in Lockyer's 2002 campaign statement to the League of Women Voters, http://www.smartvoter.org/2002/11/05/ca/state/vote/lockyer_b/paper3.html he wrote other environmental laws, including the first state regulation of trucks hauling toxic substances on California roads and highways, which preceded federal policies adopted by the EPA. Lockyer considered his greatest environmental achievement to be his 1987 bill to create a Bay Trail,In campaign literature, Lockyer called this \\"one of the most far-sighted contributions to the San Francisco Bay Area\\" which he envisioned as an eventual 500-mile-long hiking and cycling path, a continuous recreational corridor, with adjacent bayshore parks and protected natural habitats, that would entirely encircle San Francisco and San Pablo Bays. Requiring city, county and regional cooperation, the Bay Trail marked its 20th year in 2009 with 293 miles so far open to hikers, bicyclists, joggers and walkers.Jason Sweeney, \\"Lockyer bill remembered as Bay Trail turns 20\\", Hayward Daily Review, June 4, 2009 As nominal \\"father\\" of the Bay Trail, a segment of the shoreline had been named in Lockyer's honor.San Francisco Chronicle, March 20, 2011, http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/Bill-Lockyer-s-name- gains-footing-for-Bay-Trail-2387968.php; https://www.flickr.com/photos/cold_iron/4590266033/ ===1984 \\"hate crimes\\" legislation=== In 1984, Lockyer sponsored the State's first \\"hate crimes\\" legislation which, as later amended, provided that \\"no person...shall by force or threat of force, willfully injure, intimidate, interfere with, oppress, or threaten any other person in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him or her by the Constitution or laws of this state or by the Constitution or laws of the United States because of the other person's race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, gender, or sexual orientation, or because he or she perceives that the other person has one or more of those characteristics.\\" Later, as Attorney General, Lockyer was responsible for coordinating enforcement of this statute by local law enforcement. \\"Final Report of the California Attorney General's Civil Rights Commission on Hate Crimes\\", http://www.ag.ca.gov/publications/civilrights/reportingHC.pdf ===1987 tort reform \\"napkin deal\\"=== On September 10, 1987, while Lockyer chaired the State Senate Judiciary Committee, he and Speaker of the Assembly Willie Brown met at Frank Fat's Restaurant in Sacramento with representatives of bitterly competing special interests ‚Äì insurance companies, trial lawyers, doctors and manufacturers ‚Äì to formalize their agreement to \\"the most sweeping changes in California's civil liability laws in decades\\". After many days of painstaking negotiations, these warring interests had accepted a compromise bill that included \\"a drastic restriction in product liability laws offset by fee increases for lawyers prosecuting medical malpractice cases. Doctors got promises that protections already in place against lawsuits would not be touched. Insurance companies won a reprieve from threatened regulations gaining momentum in the Legislature.\\" This compromise had already been worked out; the dinner was meant to ratify a future \\"peace pact\\" among all the concerned parties to abide by the compromise. Lockyer, who had acted as mediator during the earlier negotiations, scribbled the terms of the \\"pact\\" on a restaurant cloth napkin, and so ended a political war. The compromise bill was then ramrodded through the assembly and state senate on the last night of that year's legislative session, and was signed into law by Republican governor George Deukmejian.This account based primarily on James Richardson, \\"Willie Brown, A Biography\\" (University of California Press, 1996), Chapter 24. https://books.google.com/books/about/Willie_Brown.html?id=maHaVKxLAWgC Though it was only Lockyer's \\"theatrical touch\\" of writing the agreement on a napkin that made it especially memorable, the \\"napkin deal\\" became legendary in the State Capitol. Proudly reproducing the original napkin on a poster titled \\"Tort-Mania 1987\\", Lockyer and Brown regarded the special interests compromise and conciliation they had arranged as a great legislative accomplishment. \\"The public is better served\\", Lockyer said at the time, \\"when these groups are trying to mend rather than tear the fabric of society\\".James D. Richardson, \\"Willie Brown: Power, Money and Interest\\", http://aliciapatterson.org/stories/willie-brown-power-money-and-instinct, which displays Lockyer's \\"legendary\\" napkin. ===1997‚Äì98 \\"Welfare Reform\\" Budget and tax-cut \\"Mega-deal\\"=== Federal legislation signed by President Clinton in 1996 required California to enact ‚Äúwelfare-to-work‚Äù legislation to help welfare recipients move from government assistance to employment and ‚Äúself-sufficiency‚Äù. The resulting establishment of a new CalWORKs (California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids) program had a major effect on the state budget, propelling difficult negotiations between the Democratic legislature and conservative Republican governor Pete Wilson. As Senate President Pro Tem, Lockyer was a key negotiator in these private negotiations, which, he later recalled to journalist Daniel Weintraub, produced the State's ‚Äúlast... old-fashioned balanced budget,‚Äù,‚ÄùWhat Works‚Ä¶‚Äù, excerpted from Daniel Weintraub interview with Lockyer, Sacramento Bee, July 12, 2009 linked to a bi-partisan billion-dollar tax \\"mega-deal\\", a complex legislative package that cut state income taxes for middle class Californians.California Budget Project, \\"What's in the Tax 'Mega-Deal?', September 1997, http://www.cbp.org/pdfs/1997/970919Megadeal.pdf ==State attorney general== Elected attorney general in 1998 after 25 years as a legislator with a small, close-knit staff, Lockyer took on an executive position that demanded both policy direction and managerial acumen. The Department of Justice, of which he was ‚Äúchief executive officer‚Äù, had some 5,000 employees, 1200 of whom were attorneys handling a caseload of 100,000 lawsuits ‚Äì the equivalent, in the private sector of the seventh largest law firm in America.Chamber Associate ranking of firms by size, Much of the department's effort was as a service agency for the staggering demands of California's local law enforcement ‚Äì 90,000 officers at 70,000 police terminals expecting split-second response from a state telecommunications network that received three million inquiries a day; background and fingerprints checks of a million annual applicants for positions as police officers, teachers and day-care providers, and ‚Äúlive scan‚Äù of another million and a half fingerprints taken during booking arrest, plus searches connected with 750,000 outstanding warrants for wanted suspects. This required Lockyer to radically restructure and reinvigorate his department with high-tech efficiencies and policy innovations to modernize the relationship between the attorney general and the law enforcement community. Having grown up in the Berkeley 'Sixties atmosphere of anti-police rhetoric, Lockyer, now described by the press as the state's \\"Top Cop\\", insisted on attending memorial services for more than 50 officers killed in the line of duty during his years in office.‚ÄùBill Lockyer, Attorney General of California, 1999‚Äì2007‚Äù (Sacramento, 2008), Pg. 9 At the same time, Lockyer steered the Justice Department to a new legal activism that reflected his liberal values in such areas of litigation and regulation as civil rights and anti-trust enforcement and consumer and environmental protection. He became one of the two most prominent state Attorneys General in the nation, rivaled in media attention only by New York's Eliot Spitzer. The two men were personal rivals as well, once nearly coming to blows after \\"screaming expletives at each other\\" at a Los Angeles convention of the National Association of Attorneys General.Brooke A. Masters, \\"Spoiling For A Fight, The Rise of Eliot Spitzer\\" (2007), Pg. 282 That organization elected Lockyer its president in 2003. As attorney general, Lockyer sometimes had to defend official positions he found objectionable, such as asking the courts, in 2004, to invalidate San Francisco same-sex marriage licenses which conflicted with state law, though he personally supported the right of same-sex marriage which brought him under fire from both social conservatives and gay activists.\\"California Attorney General Is Pressed on Gay Marriage\\", The New York Times, February 25, 2004, https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/25/us/same-sex-marriage-california-california- attorney-general-pressed-gay-marriage.html On other occasions, the positions Lockyer defended matched his own, as when he defended California's 1996 legalization of medical marijuana against federal attacks by the Bush Administration. Lockyer found this particularly satisfying as he had come to strongly support \\"compassionate use\\" of Marijuana after living through his mother's and younger sister's deaths from leukemia.\\"Medical pot users honor Lockyer\\", AlamedaTimes-Star, February 25, 2004 ===Sex offenders, DNA testing, bullet coding=== In grappling with the sheer size and range of the state's law enforcement responsibilities, Lockyer confronted, with varying success, several challenges that required his department to give new high-technology support to law enforcement agencies. In 1996, the state legislature had passed California's version of \\"Megan's Law\\", which required authorities to make publicly available registration information provided to local Police by former child molesters, rapists and others sex offenders after being released from custody. But the public could only access this information about registered sex offenders living in their communities by visiting a Police station or calling a 900 toll-line number, until Lockyer's Department, with legislative approval in 2004, launched a public website allowing Internet users, by a simple search, to find personal details about more than 60,000 past sex offenders, and to locate, through an interactive map, such offenders living in their neighborhoods. The website faced initial complaints that, despite the State's efforts to prod local Police to provide accurate data,\\"Attorney General Lockyer Unveils Improvements to Megan's Law\\", March 15, 2002, http://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-lockyer-unveils- improvements-megans-law some of the information was outdated; and that, as the ACLU contended, there were too few restrictions to protect the civil liberties of those who had already paid their debt to society.Attorney General's office press release, September 13, 2004, http://ag.ca.gov/newsalerts/print_release.php?id=1137 But the website did draw enormous public interest, receiving over 186,000,000 \\"hits\\" from more than 16,000,000 individual users in its first year of operation.California Department of Justice, \\"California Sex Offender Information, 2005 Report to the California Legislature\\" Another large-scale bio-tech challenge was expansion of State Crime Lab facilities to process DNA genetic samples taken from convicted felons, aiming to create the largest state-run DNA criminal data-bank in the country. Since 1988, California law had required blood samples taken from felons convicted of specific sex and violent crimes, in the hope of reinvigorating often ‚Äúcold‚Äù investigations of unsolved crimes. When Lockyer took office, 100,000 of these blood samples were sitting in cold storage, still waiting to be analyzed and compared to DNA taken from crime scene evidence. In June 2001, Lockyer announced that with an expanded DNA Lab staff and new equipment, the backlog of unanalyzed blood samples had been entirely eliminated, leading to identification of suspects in homicide cases more than 15 years old. \\"State's DNA Lab Backlog Eliminated\\", Attorney General's Office, June 25, 2001, http://oag.ca.gov/news/press- releases/lockyer-states-dna-lab-backlog-eliminated But then a voter-approved measure of 2004 that allowed police to gather DNA, not just from convicted violent criminals, but from anyone arrested, even without charge or conviction, for any felony, violent or otherwise led Lockyer himself to express reservations. \\"I personally wouldn't have put arrests in the measure,\\" he said, adding that he would also have made it simpler for innocent people to get their information removed from the files ‚Äì a complaint of civil libertarians who raised the specter of innocent people being kept in the same database as convicted armed felons.Julia Scheeres, \\"Rough Reception for DNA Law\\", November 27, 2004, Wired This also proved an administrative nightmare, as the backlog eliminated in 2001 had reappeared as a new backlog of 287,000 by 2006, forcing new efforts, with inadequate financial resources, to meet the television-viewing public's rising expectations of law enforcement efficiency.Henry Weinstein, \\"Law Officials Decry DNA Lab Backlog\\", Los Angeles Times, September 15, 2006 After a Seattle company unveiled a new technology for \\"coding\\" individual bullets, Lockyer sponsored the first legislation in the country which would have required all handgun (but not rifle) ammunition sold in California to be engraved with a unique serial identification number. \\"We are losing too many of our young people to seemingly random shootings and anonymous killers,\\" said Lockyer. The bill \\"will strip criminals of their anonymity and give law enforcement evidence it can use to quickly and effectively solve more gun crimes.\\" The National Rifle Association and other gun rights groups ‚Äì already at odds with Lockyer over enforcement of State prohibitions against semi-automatic rifles ‚Äì strongly condemned the plan, saying criminals could easily obtain unmarked ammunition and that the whole process would create a costly enforcement bureaucracy. Manufacturers also opposed the measure as economically disastrous, since the engraving machines would cost up to half a million dollars each and would make virtually obsolete tens of millions of dollars in existing manufacturing equipment. The bill died in the legislature.California proposes requiring bullet ID numbers, Reuters  April 27, 2005 ===2000‚Äì01 California energy crisis=== Of the many actions taken by Lockyer's staff against corporate fraud and malfeasance, the most prominent were related to the California Energy Crisis that began in the summer of 2000, marked by rolling blackouts, brownouts and the billions of dollars in price hikes that appeared on consumers' electrical bills. It later emerged that the \\"crisis\\" stemmed in part from illegal practices by energy corporations such as the now-defunct Enron.\\"When Enron pushed, utility pushed back\\", San Francisco Chronicle, June 27, 2004 The exposure of these hidden offenses began in August 2000 when Lockyer created an Energy Task Force to launch the State's first investigation of alleged price gouging by power companies.\\"Bill Lockyer, Attorney General of California, 1999‚Äì2007\\" (Sacramento, 2008) Pp. 31, 66, 68, 69 The Wall Street Journal scoffed at million-dollar rewards offered by the Attorney General's office for information about illegal conduct by energy powers, dismissing the allegations as unsupported by clear evidence. But such probes eventually led to some five billion dollars in brokered settlements by Enron and a half dozen other corporations which admitted to \\"gaming\\" the State's deregulated energy system.The past work of Lockyer's Energy Unit is noted on the website of current California Attorney General Kamala Harris, http://oag.ca.gov/cfs/energy ===Enron and prison-rape remark controversy=== As Attorney General, Lockyer, during the Enron scandal of 2001, achieved some notoriety for his public quip, \\"I would love to personally escort [Enron CEO] Ken Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey'\\". This remark was widely condemned as an endorsement of prison rape. Lockyer later apologized for the statement in a letter to the Los Angeles Times, saying, \\"My anger over the activities of energy barons doesn't come close to my lifelong outrage at the crime of rape. ... I guess I let my anger get the better of me in talking about the mercenary corporate executives who are making life so miserable for millions of Californians.\\" ===Auto industry global warming lawsuit=== On September 20, 2006, Lockyer filed a lawsuit against what his office referred to as \\"the big six automakers\\" for their alleged contributions to global warming. Initial reaction was mixed, with some environmental groups being supportive, and an auto industry trade calling it a 'nuisance suit'. A similar suit in New York had been dismissed by a federal court. The California suit was dismissed on September 17, 2007, with the court saying that \\"The adjudication of plaintiff's claim would require the court to balance the competing interests of reducing global warming emissions and the interests of advancing and preserving economic and industrial development.\\" ===Hewlett-Packard scandal=== While Attorney General, in 2006, Lockyer and his staff conducted a criminal investigation into the Hewlett-Packard pretexting scandal to ascertain whether or not the investigators authorized by Chairman Patricia C. Dunn to discover the source of leaks from within the company illegally obtained the phone records of HP board members and journalists. Charges were subsequently brought against Dunn, which were dismissed by the court in 2007 (while Dunn was battling terminal cancer) in the \\"interests of justice\\". ===Landmark legal cases=== *Silveira v. Lockyer (Restrictions on semi-automatic firearms) *Lockyer v. Andrade (\\"Three-strikes\\" criminal sentencing) *Lockyer v. City and County of San Francisco (Same-sex Marriage) ===2003 gubernatorial recall election=== An initiative to recall newly re-elected Governor Gray Davis qualified for the ballot in July 2003, with a special election, scheduled for October, to include both a referendum on the recall itself and a list of candidates vying to replace Davis if the recall succeeded. With some arm- twisting by U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, all the potential Democratic candidates, including Lockyer, agreed not to run, in the hope that this would strengthen Davis' campaign to defeat the recall. At the start, it appeared that the strongest Republican candidate would be former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, who had unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for governor the previous year. Lockyer, at the start of August, publicly warned Davis and his political consultants against a repeat effort to sabotage Riordan's candidacy by negative attack ads: \\"If they do the trashy campaign on Dick Riordan ... I think there are going to be prominent Democrats that will defect and just say, 'We're tired of that puke politics. Don't you dare do it again or we're just going to help pull the plug.'\\"\\"California Democrats Warn Governor against Trash Talk\\", Sacramento Bee, August 1, 2003 Five days later, Arnold Schwarzenegger announced that he would run as a Republican in the recall election. Lockyer and Schwarzenegger had been casual friends since Lockyer's state senate years, when the actor had chaired the Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, and the two men had together toured charter schools in southern California. Later, Lt. Governor Cruz Bustamante announced he would become the only prominent Democrat to place his name on the recall ballot. On October 7, by a decisive vote, Davis was recalled, and Schwarzenegger was elected to replace him. Two weeks later, at a UC Berkeley post-mortem conference on the election, Lockyer made the surprise announcement that while he had voted against the recall, he had also voted for Schwarzenegger, the first time he had ever voted for a Republican in a state election. He explained that he was \\"tired of transactional, cynical, deal- making politics,\\" and that, for him, \\"Arnold represented... hope, change, reform, opportunity, upbeat problem solving\\". He added, \\"I hope I haven't been conned\\".\\"Top California Democrat Makes a Surprising Revelation: He Voted for Schwarzenegger\\", The New York Times, October 19, 2003; Daniel Weintraub, \\"Lockyer: I Voted for Arnold\\", Sacramento Bee, October 18, 2003 Many fellow Democrats and feminists reacted bitterly to Lockyer's surprise announcement, which proved damaging to his future political aspirations.Account of the California Democratic Party Convention, San Jose Mercury News, January 17, 2004. Rare praise of Lockyer's frank admission came from San Francisco radio talk show personality Ronn Owens, who hailed Lockyer's \\"courage\\" and \\"independence\\", Ronn Owens, Voice of Reason (2004), Pg. 125 ==State treasurer== ===2006 election=== By a year into Schwarzenegger's governorship, Lockyer increasingly felt the Governor's performance was disheartening, marked by inexperience, lack of strong political conviction, and personal braggadocio. In a 2005 interview, Lockyer criticized Schwarzenegger's leadership style as demonstrating an \\"arrogance of power\\" with the \\"odor of Austrian politics\\", alluding to the Austrian-born Governor's upbringing in a country with a \\"long history\\" of \\"elite...autocracy\\".Carla Marinucci and Marc Sandalow, \\"Lockyer, Angelides first Democrats in Governor's race\\", San Francisco Chronicle, March 16, 2005 Soon after the recall election, Lockyer, barred by term limits from seeking a third term as attorney general, began contemplating his own run for governor in the 2006 election. In January 2005, he tentatively announced his candidacy for governor: \\"the one and only office that has held abiding interest for me since I left the Legislature ... It's the job I want, not only because I think I'll be a great executive, but because I think that I can and will lead the best campaign you've ever seen, a winning Democratic campaign of ideas, ideals and inspiration to stake out a great future for California.\\"Sacramento Bee, January 23, 2005 Lockyer changed his mind four months later, saying that while he felt strongly about the need to improve education and transportation, and to address \\"the growing disparity\\" between the state's rich and poor, he was unwilling \\"to spend the next 10 years of my life\\" in the daily \\"partisan fighting\\" that plagued governors of both parties.San Francisco Chronicle, April 29, 2005 In June 2005, he announced he would instead run for state treasurer. He was elected to that office in November 2006. ===Climate change and renewable energy finance initiatives=== As treasurer (and ex officio trustee of CalPERS and CalSTRS, the two largest public employee pension funds in the United States) Lockyer tried to use the influence of his office in the aid of various environmental causes. These attempts included: * Expanding the \\"Green Wave\\" environmental initiative first proposed by Treasurer Phil Angelides in 2004 to a multibillion-dollar investment in renewable energyhttp://www.calpers.ca.gov/index.jsp?bc=/investments/environ- invest/home.xml * With statutory authority of the Treasurer's California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority (CAEATFA), exempting new \\"Zero Emission Vehicle\\" manufacturers, such as electric automobile startup Tesla Motors, from sales and use tax on the purchase of equipment used in California manufacturing.

As negotiations began to revise the state budget, Lockyer tried to convince U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to provide a guarantee for state bond payments. \\"A fiscal meltdown by California ... would surely destabilize the U.S., if not worldwide financial markets,\\" Lockyer wrote to Geithner on May 13.Kevin O'Leary, \\"Can the U.S. Afford to Let California Fail? Time, June 19, 2009 The Obama Administration declined the request. Earlier, Lockyer warned the legislative conference committee that private lenders would be leery of any more \\"smoke-and-mirrors accounting tricks\\" and that lawmakers would have to rely heavily on spending cuts to balance the budget: \\"It seems to me that the kind of budget we will require before the end of June is almost entirely cuts ... My suggestion to you is don't delay the pain. It's going to be awful, but just get it done. It's going to be worse if it doesn't get done.\\" Steve Wiegand, \\"Lockyer urges spending cuts to balance state budget\\", Sacramento Bee, May 22, 2009 Lockyer was also quoted as telling Democratic legislators that, \\"fair or not\\", angry voters blamed them for \\"12 years of flowing red ink\\". \\"Why don't you start with the realization that probably none of you are going to be back here next year?\\", after the 2010 elections. \\"You're not going to get reelected.

The company refused. But then Lockyer, working behind the scenes, helped arrange a new partnership at the NUMMI plant between Toyota and Tesla Motors, an electric car company, which he had assisted in the past through the Treasurer's \\"Green Wave\\" investment policies. ===2010 election=== Three of Lockyer's predecessors as state treasurer ‚Äì Jesse Unruh, Kathleen Brown, and Phil Angelides ‚Äì had lost gubernatorial campaigns, and Democratic pundits considered the treasurer's job a much \\"smaller bully pulpit\\" which did not provide a good springboard to higher office.Steven Maviglio, \\"Governor's Race: The Early Line on 2010\\", California Majority Report, November 8, 2006 Despite persistent rumors that Lockyer, who had earlier accumulated a $10 million political war chest, might be a \\"dark horse\\" possibility for governor in 2010,Calbuzz.com, March 29, 2009; The Christian Science Monitor, June 2, 2009; Steve Maviglio, California Majority Report, July 28, 2009; Calbuzz.com, August 14, 2009 he expressed no interest in mounting a campaign to succeed Schwarzenegger. When asked about the possibility, Lockyer stated that he saw no chance of winning a primary election battle with former governor Jerry Brown (his successor as attorney general), who eventually emerged as the unchallenged Democratic nominee and went on to win the general election. Lockyer also said he preferred spending time with his family. \\"You kill yourself being a Governor\\", he joked, \\"and then maybe you get a new aqueduct named after you\\".San Jose Mercury News, November 15, 2009 In an article probing Schwarzenegger's political unpopularity in his final months in office, George Skelton, after quoting Lockyer's reflection on the fickle electorate (\\"Our state voters have very high expectations of what government can do.

It is currently owned by the Samuel Smith Brewery. It became famous during a period spanning the 1920s to the mid-1950s as a meeting place for many of London's artists, intellectuals and bohemians such as Jacob Epstein, Nina Hamnett, Dylan Thomas, Augustus John, and George Orwell. It is named either directly or indirectly after the Fitzroy family, Dukes of Grafton, who owned much of the land on which Fitzrovia was built. The building was originally constructed as the Fitzroy Coffee House, in 1883, and converted to a pub (called \\"The Hundred Marks\\") in 1887, by W. M. Brutton. In the early years of the 20th century, Judah Morris Kleinfeld became licensee. He rebranded it the \\"Fitzroy Tavern\\" in March 1919. The licence then passed to his daughter and her husband Charles Allchild who ran it into the 1950s. His granddaughter Sally Fiber who worked behind the bar from a very young age eventually wrote a history of the pub \\"The Fitzroy: The Autobiography of a London Tavern\\" with the help of Clive Powell-Williams. Now re-published in September 2014 with up-dated content by Sally with help from DeSapinaud Productions. There are photographs on the walls of both Michael Bentine and Dylan Thomas drinking in the pub.

This project shows the largest panorama of London most recently produced from the top of the BT Tower. Since 2000 it has been the home of the Pear Shaped Comedy Club which runs every Wednesday in the downstairs bar. In 2018, the pub was given a pub design award by CAMRA for its recent refurbishment, in which its original Victorian appearance was retained and revived. Polished mahogany partitions with acid-etched glass were installed downstairs to recreate the original snugs, while wrought-iron pub signs in keeping with the originals were erected outside. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Camden Category:Doctor Who fandom Category:Fitzrovia Category:Tourist attractions in the London Borough of Camden Category:Pubs in the London Borough of Camden ","title":"Fitzroy Tavern"},{"id":"2558935","text":"Cicely Fox Smith (1 February 1882 ‚Äì 8 April 1954) was an English poet and writer. Born in Lymm, Cheshire and educated at Manchester High School for Girls, she briefly lived in Canada, before returning to the United Kingdom shortly before the outbreak of World War I. She settled in Hampshire and began writing poetry, often with a nautical theme. Smith wrote over 600 poems in her life, for a wide range of publications. In later life, she expanded her writing to a number of subjects, fiction and non-fiction. For her services to literature, the British Government awarded her a small pension. ==Early life== Cicely Fox Smith was born 1 February 1882, into a middle-class family in Lymm, near Warrington, England during the latter half of the reign of Queen Victoria. Her father was a barrister and her grandfather was a clergyman. Smith well might have been expected to have a brief education and then to settle down to life as a homemaker either for her family or her marriage partner. She was well educated at Manchester High School for Girls from 1894 to 1897, where she described herself later as \\"something of a rebel,\\" and started writing poems at a comparatively early age. In an article for the school magazine Smith later wrote \\"I have a hazy recollection of epic poems after Pope's Iliad, romantic poems after Marmion stored carefully away in tin tobacco boxes when I was seven or eight.\\" All of that early work is lost unfortunately. She published her first book of verses when she was 17 and it received favourable press comments. Wandering the moors near her home she developed a spirit of adventure. She would follow the Holcombe Harriers hunt on foot as a girl. She had a fierce desire to travel to Africa but eventually settled for a voyage to Canada. Smith likely sailed with her sister Madge in 1911 on a steamship to Montreal, where she would then have travelled by train to Lethbridge, Alberta, staying for about a year with her older brother Richard Andrew Smith before continuing on to British Columbia (BC). From 1912 to 1913 she resided in the James Bay neighbourhood of Victoria at the southern tip of Vancouver Island, working as a typist for the BC Lands Department and later for an attorney on the waterfront. Her spare time was spent roaming nearby wharves and alleys, talking to residents and sailors alike. She listened to and learned from the sailors' tales until she too was able to speak with that authoritative nautical air that pervades her written work. On 23 November 1913, Smith, with her mother and sister, arrived home in Liverpool aboard the White Star Line steamer Teutonic on the eve of World War I. She and her family then settled in Hampshire. ==Poet== She soon put her experiences to use in a great outpouring of poetry, some of it clearly focused on supporting England's war efforts. Much of her poetry was from the point of view of the sailor. The detailed nautical content of her poems made it easy to understand why so many readers assumed that Smith was male. One correspondent wrote to her as \\"Capt. Fox Smith\\" and when she tried to correct him he wrote back \\"You say you are not a master but you must be a practical seaman. I can always detect the hand of an amateur.\\" He was almost correct. She was familiar with life at sea as few armchair amateur would ever be. It was only when she was well established that she started routinely using the by-line \\"Miss C. Fox Smith\\" or \\"Cicely Fox Smith.\\" Smith initially had her poetry published in a variety of magazines and newspapers: Blackwood's Magazine, Blue Peter, Canada Monthly, Country Life, Cunard Magazine, Daily Chronicle, Grand Magazine, Holly Leaves, the Outlook, Pall Mall Gazette, The Daily Mail, The Dolphin, The London Mercury, The Nautical Magazine, The Spectator, The Sphere, The Times Literary Supplement, Westminster Gazette, White Star Magazine, The Windsor Magazine, The Week and The Daily Colonist (BC) and Punch for which she wrote many poems between 1914 and her death in 1954. She later re-published much of this poetry in her many books. In all, with the new edition, she published well over 660 poems. In June 2012, the first edition of The Complete Poetry of Cicely Fox Smith, edited by Charles Ipcar (US) and James Saville (UK), was published by Little Red Tree Publishing in the US, and contained all the poems known at that time. The second edition (2015) added 74 new poems, some published for the first time, thanks to the work of numerous researchers around the world, including Jake Wade and Danny McLeod. Included in the second edition is an important introduction by Marcia Phillips McGowan, PhD, (Distinguished Professor Emerita of English, Eastern Connecticut State University), in which she reclaims Cicely Fox Smith in the continuum of important women poets of the early 20 century. ==Later life== Other books by Smith included three romantic novels, numerous short stories and articles, as well as several books describing \\"sailortown.\\" She also published a book of traditional sea shanties that she had collected, and edited a collection of sea poems and stories primarily by other authors. In 1937 Smith finally realised a childhood dream by sailing around the coast of Africa, as a guest of the Union-Castle Mail Steamship Co. Ltd., stopping in the harbors along the way. She wrote of her experiences in All the Way Round: Sea Roads to Africa. In the 1940s she began writing children's sea stories with her sister Margaret (Madge) Scott Smith, other travel books, history books, a book about ship models, at least one biography titled Grace Darling, and contributed to and edited many collections. The fine art work of her older brother Philip Wilson Smith, known at the time for his etchings of Elizabethan architecture and oil paintings, illustrates many of her poetry and prose books. Her literary outpourings were such as to persuade the Government to award her, at the age of 67, a modest pension for \\"her services to literature.\\" Smith kept writing to the end of her life about many things and many places but always with the accuracy and knowledge of an expert. She even chose her own gravestone epitaph, an extract from one of Walter Raleigh's poems: Cicely Fox Smith died on 8 April 1954, in the town of Bow, Devon, where she'd been living with her sister Madge. ==Legacy== Over 70 of Smith's poems have been adapted for singing and have been recorded, primarily in the nautical folk song tradition. ==Publications== Books by C. Fox Smith include: *A Book of Famous Ships (Houghton Mifflin, New York ¬© 1924) *A Book of Shanties (traditional sea songs) (Methuen & Co., London ¬© 1927) *A Sea Chest: an Anthology of Ships and Sailormen (Methuen & Co., London ¬© 1927) *Adventures and Perils of the Sea (1936) *All the Way Round: Sea Road to Africa (1938) *Anchor Lane (1933) *Ancient Mariners: Some Salt Water Yesterdays (1928) *Country Days & Country Ways: Trudging Afoot in England (1947) *Fighting Men (Methuen 1916) *Full Sail (1926) *Here and there in England with the Painter Brangwyn (1945) *Knave-go- by: the Adventures of Jacky Nameless *Lancashire Hunting Songs, and Other Moorland Lays (J.

Most freshman residence halls are in the Washington Square area. Many of the upperclassmen halls are in the Union Square area. Until the Spring 2005 semester, NYU used a lottery system to determine eligibility for residence hall preference. Under this system, a student received one point for every semester they had lived in campus housing. Freshmen are freed from the lottery system and are by tradition placed in the halls closest to the main campus area. Therefore, historically, most of the students who lived in halls found far from Washington Square were sophomores. However, beginning in the fall 2006 semester, sophomores received priority housing, giving them first choice of residence halls. The purpose of this initiative was to keep the sophomore class together in the Union Square area. As a result, that year's junior class (class of 2008) and senior class (class of 2007) never benefited from having first choice, either as seniors under the old system or sophomores under the new system. The university operates its own transit system to transport its students, by bus or trolley, to campus. Undergraduate students were guaranteed housing during their enrollment at NYU if they declared a need on their admissions applications. Twenty-one buildings comprise NYU's undergraduate housing system. In general, NYU residence halls receive favorable ratings, and some are opulent. Many rooms are spacious and contain amenities considered rare for individual college residence hall rooms, such as kitchens and living rooms/common areas. All residence halls are staffed by 24-hour security staff, contain multiple resident assistants (RAs), and several halls contain faculty in residence. Unlike many other universities, NYU rooms all have their own bathrooms and thus no common bathrooms exist. Many residence halls have their own dining hall, and the university has meal choices to suit various diets. Almost all the residence halls have a laundry room that is open to resident students 24 hours a day. The price of using these facilities varies from hall to hall; as some halls are leased, NYU is unable to control the laundry prices. All the residence halls are governed by the Inter-Residence Hall Council (IRHC), an umbrella student council organization. Each hall elects student representatives to the IRHC, and those representatives meet with one another to form committees and vote on an executive board. The goal of this group is to create programs for university students and to act as a link to university administration. ===Recent hall construction=== In November 2005, NYU announced plans to build a 26-floor, residence hall on East 12th Street. The residence hall is expected to accommodate about 700 undergraduates and contain a host of other student facilities. It is to be the tallest building in the East Village.New dorm coming in 2009: 26-story residence hall to be built on 12th Street , NYU News, November 8, 2005 The plans caused anger among East Village and other New York City residents, as the new building would be built over the old St. Ann's Church.Not Subject to Review: As NYU plans towering dorm for 12th Street, East Village neighbors cry foul , The Village Voice, March 7, 2006 12th street dorm is currently in use as a freshman dorm as of August 2009. It is located between 3rd and 4th avenues, close to the Coral, Alumni, and 3rd North dorms. A small piece of the church's facade remains standing. NYU announced in February 2008 that it had purchased a high- end apartment building to use as a residence hall. The building was already under construction for some time, originally intended for overseas investors. This building, Gramercy Green‚Äîlocated at 23rd Street and 3rd Avenue‚Äîis in the heart of Gramercy and near to Madison Square Park. The rooms inside the building were partitioned to maximize the number of students. The building housed over 900 in its first year. In Spring 2009, Gramercy Green opened up a massive sub-cellar, which includes a fully functioning gym, a bike room, multiple television lounges, multiple study lounges, and a game room. ==Relations with local residents== There has been friction between the residents of the East Village and NYU.As NYU plans towering dorm for 12th Street, East Village neighbors cry foul, Kristen Lombardi, The Village Voice, February 28, 2006. Amongst brownstones and historic buildings, the school has built many large residence halls. NYU's destruction or purchase of many historic buildings (such as the Peter Cooper post office or St. Ann's Church, a rusticated-stone structure with a Romanesque tower that dated to 1847) have made it symbolic of change that many long-time residents fear is destroying what made the neighborhood interesting and attractive.Residents wary of changing physical, socio-economic landscape, Katla McGlynn, Pace Press, February 6, 2008. == Undergraduate Residence Halls == There are currently 23 buildings in New York University's undergraduate housing system. Many are home to special interest \\"explorations\\" communities. ===Freshman Halls=== Third Avenue North in the East Village. *Brittany Hall is a 17-story pre-war gothic high rise located at 55 East 10th Street at the corner of 10th and Broadway. The building was once a hotel and is now home to 566 freshman and 15 RAs. Comedy troupe the State was founded in Brittany in 1988.https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/08/16/the-state-what-we-really-learned- in-college/ ::;Special Interest Communities :::*Big Apple, Big Screen *Founders Hall is the newest addition to the system. It first opened for the Fall 2009 semester. It is located at 120 East 12th Street, houses over 700 students, and is known for its clean facilities, large windows, and extra large rooms. It is home to \\"The Meaning of Food\\", \\"NYU C.O.R.P.S.\\", \\"Global Citizen\\", and \\"Media Revolution\\" Explorations floors. *Goddard Hall is a small freshman hall located on 79 Washington Square East. This hall is regularly shown on NYU campus tours. Goddard houses 212 students and six RAs. In the fall of 2007, it became a \\"residential college\\". *Lipton Hall Formerly a law school residence, Lipton was one of the university's first residence halls. It is now exclusively for freshmen like most of the residence halls closest to the park. It is located at 33 Washington Square West. Lipton holds 700 students and 15 RAs. Lipton Hall was formerly known as Hayden Hall before its name was changed in June 2016. *Rubin Hall is located at 35 Fifth Avenue, across from Church of the Ascension (New York). Prior to its purchase by NYU in the 1960s, the building was the Grosvenor Hotel. It houses 688 students and 13 RAs. *Third Avenue North is the largest first-year residence hall at NYU and one of the largest in the United States, housing 952 freshmen. \\"Third North\\" is located at 75 Third Avenue (between 11th and 12th streets) and is split into three towers. Third North has 29 RAs and 1 RCA. *Weinstein Hall is the only pre-1980 residence hall that was built as a residence hall specifically for NYU students. It is located at 5-11 University Place. This freshman residence hall has a two level dining hall; the upper level's food court (which features a Jamba Juice and a Chick-fil-A Express) is known as \\"Upstein\\" and is adjacent to the kosher eatery. The lower level is known as \\"Downstein,\\" or \\"DS.\\" Weinstein houses 554 students and 30 RAs. Weinstein is notable for being the dorm in which Rick Rubin and Russell Simmons founded Def Jam Records. ===Mixed Freshman/Upperclassman Halls=== *Clark Street is an 11-story building located at 55 Clark Street in Brooklyn, housing over 400 students in exclusively traditional-style suites. The residence is contained in a building shared with Hotel St. George and operated by EHS, meaning that the residence houses students from universities around New York City. Due to the nature of the arrangement, Clark St. has many amenities that other Residence's at NYU lack, such as in-room TV's, a private gym, a private spa, etc. *Othmer Hall is an 18-story building located at 101 Johnson Street in Brooklyn Brooklyn, housing over 400 students in both traditional and apartment-style suites. The residence includes student lounges and study rooms on every floor with laundry facilities and vending machines located in its basement. The residence hall was acquired by NYU when it merged with Polytechnic University to form the NYU Tandon School of Engineering in 2015. Othmer Hall stands within the MetroTech Center, and directly adjoins the academic buildings that make up NYU Tandon, including Rogers Hall which holds Othmers primary dining hall: the Jasper Kane Caf√©. *University Hall is located in Union Square at 110 East 14th Street and was converted in the 2005-06 school year to all freshmen, and was then converted back to upperclassmen in fall 2009. For the 2012-2013 school year, it housed freshmen once more due to massive renovations at Brittany Hall. There was a small campus general store in the building, which in the Spring of 2006 was converted to a Dunkin' Donuts. \\"U-Hall\\" had a dining hall which was closed in 2005. The primary dining hall in U-Hall is currently operating in the general store located in \\"The Commons\\". University Hall holds 603 students and 14 RAs. ===Upperclassman Halls=== Palladium Hall on 14th Street. *Alumni Hall is located at 33 Third Avenue and houses exclusively single rooms, the only residence hall in the NYU system to do so. Alumni Hall is home to 452 residents and 12 Resident Assistants. Alumni staff and hall council are paired with the 7th Street dorm (this arrangement is commonly called the \\"7-A Partnership\\"). *Broome Street is located at 400 Broome Street and houses many sophomores and juniors. In whole, Broome holds 353 students and nine RAs. In the fall of 2007, it became a \\"residential college\\". *Carlyle Court is located at 25 Union Square West. It houses 736 students and 15 RAs - mostly sophomores. *Coral Towers is located at 129 Third Avenue. It, along with Carlyle Court, was once notable for having balconies to which the students no longer have access due to safety concerns. Coral holds 410 students and 13 RAs. *Gramercy Green is one of the newest residence halls in the system, located on the northeast corner of 23rd Street and 3rd Avenue (entrance on 3rd). Gramercy Green features a new addition to the University's residence halls: it has two Chaplains in Residence. Gramercy Green is a converted luxury condo building, which is why the residence boasts numerous amenities not held in traditional 'college dorms.' These amenities include a private gym, granite countertops, marble bathroom fixtures and floor to ceiling windows. *Greenwich Hotel is largely a sophomore residence hall and is located at 636 Greenwich Street. Greenwich holds 314 students and seven RAs. *Lafayette Hall is located at 80 Lafayette Street. \\"Laf\\" is the largest residence hall at NYU, housing 1000+ students. Most of NYU Greek's Life have 'houses' in the penthouse floors of this residence hall. *Palladium Hall is located at 140 East 14th Street and houses upperclassmen and Stern's full-time MBA students. It contains a dining area and an athletic center, which is open to the general NYU community. Palladium Hall is named after the night club, The Palladium, owned by Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager (both former owners of Studio 54) and formerly known as the Academy of Music. NYU purchased the land and built the Palladium Residence Hall in 2001. Palladium holds over 900 students with 22 RAs. *Second Street is a small residence hall with a large percentage of its residents being returning students. It is located at 1 East Second Street. Second Street has 282 residents and eight RAs. *Seventh Street is a small residence hall that houses mostly juniors and seniors. Its address is 40 East Seventh Street. It is known as the Green Dorm. Seventh Street is the smallest hall on campus, housing 82 students and two RAs, and so shares its staff and hall council with nearby Alumni Hall in what is commonly called the \\"7-A Partnership.\\" *13th Street is located at 47 West 13th Street. It has four RAs and 180 residents. As of Fall 2010, 13th street became the Senior House, a residence hall open to only seniors. == Formerly used as residence halls == *Cliff Street was located at 15 Cliff Street and was one of two undergraduate residence halls in the Financial District. Cliff Street housed 321 residents and six RAs. The contract NYU had with the landlord of Cliff Street ended in May 2008 and the building is no longer used by NYU. *Water Street formerly known as NYU at the Seaport, was an upperclassmen residence hall. Despite its distance from campus, many students favored it for the size of the rooms. With 1181 residents and 28 RAs, Water Street was the largest residence hall on campus. However, since the hall was leased and not owned by NYU, the university closed the hall in May 2009 and replaced the beds with a new residence hall recently constructed on East 12th Street (Founders Hall). == Graduate halls == *D'Agostino Hall is located at 110 West Third St. \\"D'Ag\\" is one of three residence halls for law school students. *130 MacDougal Street is a two building law school residence also known as the \\"Alcott Houses.\\" Students are not provided with cable, telephone, or internet services. *Hayden Hall is located at 240 Mercer Street.

It is the largest of the five residence halls for law school students. ==Notable residents== Brittany Hall * Adam Sandler * Dave Attell * Kristen Johnston * The State * Tabitha Soren * Tim Herlihy Carlyle Court *Sam Sheffler Goddard Hall *Donald Glover Rubin Hall * Alec Baldwin * Haley Joel Osment * Sarah Silverman Third Avenue North * Lady Gaga * Dylan and Cole Sprouse Weinstein Hall * Adam Savage * Bill de Blasio * Def Jam Recordings * John Waters * Philip Seymour Hoffman * Rick Rubin * Russell Simmons ==References== Category:New York University Category:University and college dormitories in the United States New York University residence halls ","title":"New York University residence halls"},{"id":"2558939","text":"A wheeze is a continuous, coarse, whistling sound produced in the respiratory airways during breathing. For wheezes to occur, some part of the respiratory tree must be narrowed or obstructed (for example narrowing of the lower respiratory tract in an asthmatic attack), or airflow velocity within the respiratory tree must be heightened. Wheezing is commonly experienced by persons with a lung disease; the most common cause of recurrent wheezing is asthma, though it can also be a symptom of lung cancer, congestive heart failure, and certain types of heart diseases. The differential diagnosis of wheezing is wide, and the reason for wheezing in a given patient is determined by considering the characteristics of the wheezes and the historical and clinical findings made by the examining physician. == Characteristics == === Wheeze === Wheezes occupy different portions of the respiratory cycle depending on the site of airway obstruction and its nature. The fraction of the respiratory cycle during which a wheeze is produced roughly corresponds to the degree of airway obstruction. Bronchiolar disease usually causes wheezing that occurs in the expiratory phase of respiration. As a rule, extrathoracic airway obstruction produce inspiratory sounds. Intrathoracic major airway obstruction produces inspiratory as well as expiratory sounds. Distal airway obstruction predominantly produces expiratory sounds. The presence of expiratory phase wheezing signifies that the patient's peak expiratory flow rate is less than 50% of normal. Wheezing heard in the inspiratory phase, on the other hand, is often a sign of a stiff stenosis, usually caused by tumors, foreign bodies or scarring. This is especially true if the wheeze is monotonal, occurs throughout the inspiratory phase (i.e. is \\"holoinspiratory\\"), and is heard more proximally, in the trachea. Inspiratory wheezing also occurs in hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Wheezes heard at the end of both expiratory and inspiratory phases usually signify the periodic opening of deflated alveoli, as occurs in some diseases that lead to collapse of parts of the lungs. The location of the wheeze can also be an important clue to the diagnosis. Diffuse processes that affect most parts of the lungs are more likely to produce wheezing that may be heard throughout the chest via a stethoscope. Localized processes, such as the occlusion of a portion of the respiratory tree, are more likely to produce wheezing at that location, hence the sound will be loudest and radiate outwardly. The pitch of a wheeze does not reliably predict the degree of narrowing in the affected airway. === Stridor === A special type of wheeze is stridor. Stridor ‚Äî the word is from the Latin, strƒ´dorSimpson JA, Weiner ESC (eds). \\"stridor, n. 2.\\" Oxford English Dictionary 2nd ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. OED Online Oxford University Press. Accessed September 10, 2005. http://dictionary.oed.com. ‚Äî is a harsh, high-pitched, vibrating sound that is heard in respiratory tract obstruction. Stridor heard solely in the inspiratory phase of respiration usually indicates an upper respiratory tract obstruction, \\"as with aspiration of a foreign body (such as the fabled pediatric peanut).\\" Stridor in the inspiratory phase is usually heard with obstruction in the upper airways, such as the trachea, epiglottis, or larynx; because a block here means that no air may reach either lung, this condition is a medical emergency. Biphasic stridor (occurring during both the inspiratory and expiratory phases) indicates narrowing at the level of the glottis or subglottis, the point between the upper and lower airways. ==See also== * Crackles (also called \\"crepitations\\" or \\"rales\\") * Rhonchi * Squawk (sound) == References == == Further reading == * == External links == * Audio Breath Sounds - Multiple case studies with audio files of lung sounds. * R.A.L.E.

It follows Lyle and Pammy Wynant, a young and affluent Manhattan couple whose casual boredom is overturned by their willing participation in chaotic detours from the everyday. ==Plot summary== Lyle works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and spends evenings seated close to the television, rapidly flipping channels, while his wife Pammy works at a \\"grief management firm\\" in the World Trade Center. While their marriage is free of problems and they have many friends, a cloud of ennui hangs over their domestic life. Pammy joins her friends Ethan and Jack on a trip to Maine, where they come to the realization that their collective nostalgia for simpler times and rural life is largely invented. Pammy begins a sexual relationship with Jack, who is in a homosexual relationship with Ethan, which ultimately ends in Jack's inexplicable self- immolation at a nearby junkyard. Meanwhile, in a divergent and concurrent storyline, Lyle witnesses the shooting death of one of his acquaintances, George Sedbauer, on the floor of the exchange. Through this event, Lyle becomes privy to a vague conspiracy of violent terrorists targeting Wall Street, and his curiosity draws him into their fold. His recruitment and participation are equally inexplicable, a function of the draw of revolutionary activity and respite from the boredom of his ordinary life. His engagement with the radicals, themselves devoid of any morality or particular ideology, becomes more absurd when he attempts to inform on them to equally ill-defined government agents, and begins having sexual relationships with two other conspirators. Lyle discovers that J. Kinnear, one of the shadow key figures in the terrorist network, is a double-agent himself and the web of essentially meaningless conspiracies appears to be endless and be the end in itself; pursued not for chaotic ends, but for the sake of imposing structural order on what the \\"players\\" view to be chaos. ==Main themes== In Players DeLillo precipitates many of the themes wrought by rampant consumerism in late twentieth century America that he would later explore in White Noise and Underworld. The notion of terrorist as societal actor, the appeal of fringe ideologies, and the utility of conspiracies first explored here would later be given more in-depth treatment in DeLillo's Mao II. ==External links== * Review of Players by Diane Johnson from The New York Times Book Review, September 4, 1977 Category:1977 American novels Category:Novels by Don DeLillo Category:Novels set in Maine Category:Novels set in New York City ","title":"Players (DeLillo novel)"},{"id":"2558985","text":"Professor Th√©ophile Mbemba Fundu was the Interior Minister of the Democratic Republic of Congo from 2001 until 2006.

Since the 1940s, it has become popular as a topping for white cake, especially at weddings. Although technically considered a pudding, the consistency of haupia closely approximates gelatin dessert and is usually served in blocks like gelatin. ==History== The traditional Hawaiian recipe for haupia calls for heated coconut milk to be mixed with ground pia (Polynesian arrowroot, Tacca leontopetaloides) until the mixture thickens. Due to the lack of availability of arrowroot starch, some modern recipes for haupia substitute cornstarch. Haupia is very similar to the European dessert blancmange. In the typical modern recipe, diluted coconut milk, sugar, and salt is mixed with arrowroot or cornstarch and heated until thickened and smooth, then poured into a rectangular pan and chilled as with gelatin. It is traditionally cut into small blocks and served on squares of ti leaf. A popular variation is haupia pie, where the haupia is set in a crust as one layer, then is usually accompanied with another layer of either chocolate or purple sweet potato. Some recipes for coconut desserts actually call for unflavored gelatin in place of the cornstarch, but it would be erroneous to call them haupia.

Originally released in Japan in August 2005, it was later made available in English in North America in February 2006. The game was created by a development team known collectively as \\"Project MelFes\\", which was composed of members of Namco's Tales Studio along with developers from the company's Tekken and Soulcalibur fighting game series. It features character designs from anime artist Kazuto Nakazawa and music from composer Go Shiina, as well as songs performed by Do As Infinity, Donna Burke, and Kanon. Its producers gave it the characteristic genre name . The game is set in a fantasy world covered in water, taking place entirely on a gigantic ship that is actually a remnant of an ancient civilization. Players assume the role of a young man named Senel, who must rescue his sister from individuals who believe her to be a prophesied savior, while the mysteries of his world begin to unravel before him. It received mostly mixed reviews upon its release in North America, with critics routinely commending the title's music while panning its derivative plot and tedious pace, and would sell approximately 397,000 copies worldwide. ==Gameplay== 3D-rendered characters are restricted to a two-dimensional plane. Tales of Legendia is a console role-playing game set in a fantasy world featuring three-dimensional characters and environments. The game is presented from a top-down perspective, and players must move their character through a number of locales, battle monsters, and interact with non-player characters to advance the story. Unlike previous games in the series where monsters were visible before being encountered, Tales of Legendia features randomized battles that occur every few steps while inside dungeons or other hostile areas. Like previous games in the series, Tales of Legendia was designed to focus on the interactions between the main cast. However, a unique feature to this game is the addition of a second series of scenarios after the player has completed the main story that focuses more on the individual characters themselves. Animated sequences also accompany certain story segments. The game features a variation of the series' Linear Motion Battle System, where players are able to freely move their characters around the battle area and engage enemies in real-time, known as the \\"X-LiMBS\\" (Crossover Linear Motion Battle System), which was specifically designed to resemble a traditional fighting game. Despite playable characters and enemies being rendered in 3D, battles are limited to a two-dimensional plane where combatants can only move forward, backward, or jump straight up into the air. In addition to normal attacks, players can attack enemies using special skills called \\"Eres\\", which involve spending Tech Points (TP), and can be chained together to create combos. A total of eight playable characters can be recruited as the game progresses, with up to four of them making up a player's party at any time. As players attack enemies, they fill up a \\"Climax\\" gauge at the bottom of the screen that can be expended to freeze all enemies in place for a short period. Whenever battles are completed, players are awarded both experience points that allow characters to gain levels and grow stronger, as well as items called \\"Eres Stones\\" that allow them to purchase additional skills. ==Plot== ===Setting=== Tales of Legendia is set in a world covered mostly in water, with all the events of the game taking place aboard a massive, country-sized ship called the Legacy, a remnant of a highly advanced ancient civilization. The population is divided into two groups: the Orerines (\\"the people of the land\\") and the Ferines (\\"the people of the sea\\"), a race of fair-skinned, light-haired people with the ability to live underwater, with the tensions between them serving as the backdrop to the game's plot. In addition, a select portion of the population are known as \\"erens\\", people born with the ability to use special powers known as \\"eres\\", which are divided into two groups: crystal eres, which includes casting magic spells, and iron eres, which revolves around physical abilities. A fictional language known as Relares appears throughout the game, forming the basis for some location and character names. ===Main characters=== * is a 17-year-old martial artist and marine of the Holy Alliance who can use iron eres. Although strong-willed and passionately protective of his surrogate \\"sister\\" Shirley, his cold nature comes off as uncaring to those around him. He is voiced by Kenichi Suzumura in the Japanese version. His name comes from Cuban writer Senel Paz. * is a 15-year-old practitioner of crystal eres. She has a demure yet stubborn demeanor and is constantly chased by those who view her as the \\"Merines\\", the chosen one of the Ferines said to command great power. She is voiced by Carrie Savage in the English version, and Ry≈ç Hirohashi in the Japanese version. Her name comes from the 1849 novel Shirley by English author Charlotte Bront√´. * is a 28-year-old historian and local sheriff who can use crystal eres. The oldest character in the group, he is often looked to for leadership and advice, and is characterized as having a strict yet kind personality. He is voiced by Susumu Chiba in the Japanese version. His name comes from English writer William Shakespeare. * is a 17-year-old female knight from the prestigious House of Valens who uses iron eres. Her staunch determination to prove herself as a warrior worthy of her family name masks her true feminine nature. She is voiced by Heather Halley in the English version, and Masumi Asano in the Japanese version. Her name comes from the character Chlo√´ from the 1947 novel Froth on the Daydream by French author Boris Vian. * is a 16-year-old treasure hunter and practitioner of crystal eres. Uniformly cheerful and positive, she also possesses an insightful side and has a habit of creating nicknames for other members of the party. She is voiced by Kaori Mizuhashi in the Japanese version. Her name comes from American author Norma Field. * is the 17-year-old leader of a tribe of bandits and beast-tamers who wields a spear and uses iron eres. Despite his wild, uncouth exterior, he is a caring individual who looks after a large wolf-like creature named , and values family above all else. He is voiced by Kazuya Nakai in the Japanese version. His name comes from Romanian writer Moses Gaster. * is a cryptic 16-year-old ninja and practitioner of iron eres. He is characterized as being highly cynical and tends to liberally use cutting remarks, and has a talent for information gathering and analysis. He is voiced by Ryoko Shiraishi in the Japanese version. His name comes from American author Jay McInerney. * is a mysterious woman who wields magic water jugs and has the ability to use crystal eres. Despite being amnesiac, she is perpetually in high spirits and never strays from her calm demeanor, smiling almost constantly. She is voiced by Ayako Kawasumi in the Japanese version. ===Story=== The game begins as Senel and Shirley wash ashore on the Legacy after their boat is tossed in a storm. Shirley is soon kidnapped by a bandit named Moses, prompting Senel to team up with a local sheriff named Will and a female knight named Chloe to rescue her. Will explains that Shirley's arrival coincided with a pillar of light at the center of the ship, leading many to believe that she is the legendary \\"Merines\\", a person destined to lead the Ferines to prosperity.Will: That's right. It seems that the Merines was able to control this great ship using nothing but the power of his will. The reason Shirley is being pursued is because some people believe her to be a descendant of the Merines. After finding her at the thieves' hideout, she is captured yet again by a Ferines soldier named Walter Delques, who takes her away. When the group eventually catches Walter, he reveals that he was only protecting her from the real enemy: the Orerine Crusand Empire Army, led by a man named Vaclav Bolud, who promptly arrives and abducts Shirley himself. While in captivity, Shirley becomes friends with another captive, a young Ferines girl named Fenimore Xelnes.Fenimore: My name is Fenimore. My true name is Xelhes./Shirley: Xelhes...That means \\"blessing.\\"/Fenimore: Yes, though in my current situation, I'm not really in much of a blessing mood... What's your name? Senel and his team are joined by a treasure hunter named Norma as well as Moses, who has decided to atone for his earlier actions. Together, the team travels deeper into the ship, where they discover that not only does Vaclav have Shirley, but her older sister Stella, who Shirley and Senel believed dead three years earlier when the Empire's forces invaded their hometown.Vaclav: Stella never died! It's true, this girl stood before our army, risking her life to allow you and her sister to escape. However! She did not die. We captured her very much alive./Senel: No! Stella was alive! She...she wasn't dead after all... All this time... All this time I... After being forced to escape when they are confronted by Vaclav's underlings, the Terrors, the party regroups and meets an amnesiac women named Grune and boy named Jay who joins the team and accompanies them to the Legacy's bridge. They confront Vaclav once more, who plans to use Shirley and Stella's latent Merines powers to activate a giant laser cannon located on the ship to destroy the Ferines' village and later subjugate other countries around the world. Although the party is victorious, Vaclav sets the cannon to fire in his final moments, with Stella in turn awakening her powers just in time to fly into the path of the beam, sacrificing herself.Senel: Don't go, Stella! Weren't you looking forward to performing the Rite of Feriyen?! To us.../Shirley: Senel.../Senel: If you go on without me, how can I propose to you? Stella?...Hey! Shirley resolves to complete a ritual to fully become the Merines and fulfill her destiny, meeting with Walter and the Ferines leader Maurits Welnes. However, soldiers from the country of Gadoria attack during the ceremony attempting to kill her thinking she willfully sided with Vaclav, with Fenimore jumping in the way of one of their blades and dying instead. The traumatic event causes Shirley to be fully engulfed by Nerifes, the malevolent spirit of the ocean itself, before leaving with Maurits.Shirley: I am the Merines. I hear the voice of Nerifes, and I am the agent of its will./Senel: Shirley, what's wrong? This isn't like you!/Shirley: I said, do not call me by that name. I am no longer the person who pretended to be your sister. Senel and his friends go after her, passing through the deeper areas of the ship where they discover from fractured recordings that the Legacy was a colony ship from another world, and the Ferines came to the planet and made war with the Orerines 4000 years ago. Arriving at Maurits' stronghold, the party faces Walter, who reveals his jealousy over Shirley choosing Senel over him, and fights until his life gives out.Walter: Why...why you? Why...did the Merines...choose you? I was the one...who was supposed to protect her. Ever since...I was a child, that was my purpose...my mission in life. They learn from Maurits that it was in fact the Orerines, not the Ferines, who are the outsiders. He explains that the Orerines' terraforming technology upset the will of the sea so much that his people can no longer live in it, and wishes to use Shirley to flood the world and appease the ocean so that the Ferines can thrive once more.Maurits: Heh heh...Hah hah hah! You fools think we Ferines came from another world, don't you? The truth is quite the opposite! We were the first ones on this world! It was your ancestors who came afterward! After he is beaten and Shirley brought back to her senses, Maurits summons a physical manifestation of Nerifes itself, which is driven back by Senel and his friends. In the end, Maurits resolves to put aside old hatreds and work towards an era of peace between Orerines and Ferines as the characters return to their old lives.Maurits: Do not worry. We Ferines no longer have any reason to treat you Orerines as our enemy./Shirley: Ferines respect the will of Nerifes above all else./Maurits: Nerifes desires peace between the Ferines and Orerines. Therefore, we shall strive to accomplish that. ==Development== Preliminary development on Tales of Legendia began in 2000, after the release of Tales of Eternia, with many of its staff drawn from that of Eternia. Its development happened in parallel to Tales of Destiny 2 and Tales of Symphonia. While its exact development time is unknown, a report in Famitsu stated that its development lasted three years. It was first revealed in December 2004 in a teaser trailer featured on a pre- order bonus disc for the series' previous title Tales of Rebirth, which only referred to the game by its development codename \\"Project MelFes\\". On February 14, 2005, Namco posted silhouettes of two characters on their Tales Channel website, with the game's official reveal coming four days later. A tentative Japanese release date of sometime in 2005 was announced the following month, with an English North American release formally announced by the company in April for February 2006. In May 2005, Namco gave a finalized Japanese release date set for the following August. The game would make an appearance at the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles the following June. The game was developed by a team that consisted of staff members from previous Tales entries, as well as developers from the company's Tekken and Soulcalibur fighting game series. Producer Jun Toyoda explained that the goal was to create a role-playing game with the \\"exhilarating battle scenes\\" found in those titles, and to appeal to players who either felt that fighting games lacked a story or felt that traditional role-playing game combat was too \\"tedious\\". Although the game features three-dimensional characters, battle sequences were purposefully restricted to a two-dimensional plane to allow the developers to create large monsters without fear of them obstructing the player's view of the action. Character animation was handled by Yosuke Kadowaki, who had previously used the same motion-capture technology on Soulcalibur II. The scenario was written by Koki Matsumoto and Tsuyoshi Tanaka. The main story theme was \\"bonds\\", with the main priority being the overlapping stories of the main cast. Unlike previous Tales games where character art and design was mostly done by Mutsumi Inomata, Tales of Legendia features characters designed by anime illustrator and animator Kazuto Nakazawa, known for his prior work on the animated sequences from the 2003 film Kill Bill Vol. 1, as well as animated features such as El-Hazard and Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water. Tales of Legendia includes animated cutscenes produced by Japanese studio Production I.G., and contains more animation than any previous game in the series. ===Audio=== Tales of Legendia is the first main series title in the Tales franchise to not feature music by Motoi Sakuraba, with composition duties instead going to Go Shiina. The game features the opening theme song \\"Tao\\" performed by J-pop group Do As Infinity, as well as the ending theme \\"My Tales\\" performed in English by Donna Burke and Gab Desmond. Incidental vocal songs include performed in Japanese by Mayumi Sudou, \\"Hotarubi\\", performed in English by Donna Burke, performed by the Suzukake Children's Choir, and both and both performed by Kanon. In addition, some of the game's instrumental themes were performed live by the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra. An official soundtrack was released in Japan in August 2005 by Avex Trax, which includes two discs of select tracks from the game, and a third disc that includes a radio drama featuring members of the game's voice cast. Two follow-up drama albums called were released one year later in August and September 2006 respectively, with the second volume containing an additional 41 tracks not present on the previous official soundtrack release. Music from the game has been featured in video game concerts such as the Eminence Symphony Orchestra's A Night in Fantasia 2007 in Sydney, Australia, and Press Start -Symphony of Games- 2009 at the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Space. ==Reception== Tales of Legendia was mostly well received in Japan, earning a 32 out of 40 total score from Weekly Famitsu based on individual reviews of 8, 8, 8, and 8, as well as an 85 out of 100 average from Dengeki PlayStation magazine based on scores of 80, 80, 90, and 90. The game would go on to sell 342,779 copies in the region by the end of 2005, becoming the 30th best- selling software title of that year, with a total of 397,000 copies sold worldwide by December 2007. Elsewhere, Tales of Legendia received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. While IGN felt that the game's characterization and \\"addictive\\" battle system were its high points, the title was ultimately marred by a \\"run of the mill\\" story and \\"lackluster\\" battle AI. The website would find that the game's second half was more enjoyable overall, stating that \\"Legendia is definitely slanted towards more action-oriented role-players who don't mind breezing through an easy twenty hours before getting to the real tests of skill,\\" and although the voice acting was \\"rather stiff,\\" the translation was of good quality overall. GameSpot similarly praised the strong cast of characters, and the interactions between them, but complained of excessive random battles and backtracking through locations in the game. 1UP.com praised the game's story, stating that \\"despite the predictability of the overall narrative, the details are frequently surprising and consistently entertaining,\\" and additionally found that the game tended to flaunt convention in its characters: \\"Yet within this morass of overly familiar plot devices, Legendia tries to rise above its limitations by twisting conventions. The strongest combatants are female, and the burly man who wields a massive hammer plays the role of intellectual and healer.\\" However, the website criticized the game for its sometimes \\"frustrating\\" combat and playing too similarly to past Tales titles, and that it would primarily appeal to longtime fans of the series. In 2012, 1UP would include Tales of Legendia on its list of \\"Underwhelming RPGs with Overwhelming Soundtracks,\\" calling the game one of Go Shiina's strongest works and \\"one of the best and most moving RPG soundtracks to date.\\" The characters Chloe and Senel would rank 8th and 29th respectively in Namco Bandai's 2nd Top 30 character fan poll in 2005. Game Informer would also list Jay and Moses on their list of the best characters in the series that same year for \\"having some of the best banter in any Tales game.\\" ==References== ;Primary references ==External links== * *Official North American website (archive) *Official Japanese website Category:2005 video games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation 2-only games Legendia Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Tales of Legendia"},{"id":"2559025","text":"Abbey with lavender fields S√©nanque Abbey (Occitan: abadi√° de Senhanca, French: Abbaye Notre-Dame de S√©nanque) is a Cistercian abbey near the village of Gordes in the d√©partement of the Vaucluse in Provence, France. ==First foundation== It was founded in 1148 under the patronage of Alfant, bishop of Cavaillon, and Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Barcelona, Count of Provence, by Cistercian monks who came from Mazan Abbey in the Ard√®che. Temporary huts housed the first community of impoverished monks. By 1152 the community already had so many members that S√©nanque was able to found Chambons Abbey, in the diocese of Viviers. Apse of the abbey church The young community found patrons in the seigneurs of Simiane, whose support enabled them to build the abbey church, consecrated in 1178. Other structures at S√©nanque followed, laid out according to the rule of C√Æteaux Abbey, mother house of the Cistercians. Among its existing structures, famed examples of Romanesque architecture, are the abbey church, cloister, dormitory, chapter house and the small calefactory, the one heated space in the austere surroundings, so that the monks could write, for this was their scriptorium. A refectory was added in the 17th century, when some minimal rebuilding of existing walls was undertaken, but the abbey is a remarkably untouched survival, of rare beauty and severity: the capitals of the paired columns in the cloister arcades are reduced to the simplest leaf forms, not to offer sensual distraction. The abbey church is in the form of a tau cross with an apse projecting beyond the abbey's outer walls. Somewhat unusually, its liturgical east end faces north, as the narrow and secluded valley offered no space for the conventional arrangement. In the 13th and 14th centuries, S√©nanque reached its apogee, operating four mills, seven granges and possessing large estates in Provence. In 1509, when the first abbot in commendam was named, a sure sign of the decline of vocation, the community at S√©nanque had shrunk to about a dozen. During the Wars of Religion the quarters for the lay brothers were destroyed and the abbey was ransacked by Huguenots. At the French Revolution the abbey's lands were nationalized, the one remaining monk was expelled and S√©nanque itself was sold to a private individual. ==Second foundation== The site was repurchased in 1854 for a new community of Cistercian monks of the Immaculate Conception, under a rule less stringent than that of the Trappists. The community was expelled in 1903 and departed to the Order's headquarters, L√©rins Abbey on the island of St. Honorat, near Cannes. A small community returned in 1988 as a priory of L√©rins. The monks who live at S√©nanque grow lavender (visible in front of the abbey, illustration, right) and tend honey bees for their livelihood. It is possible for individuals to arrange to stay at the abbey for spiritual retreat. Two other early Cistercian abbeys in Provence are Silvacane Abbey and Le Thoronet Abbey; with S√©nanque, they are sometimes referred to as the \\"Three Sisters of Provence\\" (\\"les trois soeurs proven√ßales\\"). ==Gallery== == References == * Dimier, P√®re Anselme, 1982: L'art cistercien.

He was a key figure in the radical poster movement and was introduced to screen printing in Goulburn Street, Sydney. ==Early life== During the 1970s posters became an art form artists using the cheap posters as a political tool. The Earthworks Poster Collective, established in 1971, was the most active and well-known of these groups. Earthworks operated from the Sydney University Art Workshop, commonly known as the Tin Sheds, finally demolished in 2007. In 1978 Mackinolty designed a poster to commemorate Prime Minister Robert Menzies death, to reflect a working-class view on the Prime Minister, and the 'Pig Iron Bob' nickname that was given to him during the Dalfram dispute of 1938. The poster is part of the Di Holloway collection at the Sydney Powerhouse Museum Mackinolty used sharp, flat colours and increasingly professional techniques to produce posters such as \\"For the man who said life wasn't meant to be easy ‚Äì make life impossible\\". The poster is a multi-imaged send-up of former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. It was posted up at night around Sydney, helping to politicise a generation. ==Public service roles== With the dissolution of Earthworks Poster Collective in 1980, Mackinolty moved first to Townsville, North Queensland, as a community arts officer, and then to the Northern Territory of Australia. He worked as an art adviser to Aboriginal art centres in Katherine (Mimi Aboriginal Arts and Crafts, 1981‚Äì1985) and Mutitjulu (Maruku Arts, 1985). From then until 1990 he worked at the Northern Land Council in Darwin as a journalist, designer and field officer. He produced a number of posters in that period under the name Jalak Graphics, although most were printed at Redback Graphics in Wollongong and Sydney. Many used Aboriginal languages in their text. During the 1990s Mackinolty worked with others from Darwin under the banner of Green Ant Research Arts and Publishing. Mackinolty also accepted assignments from the CLP government including the euthanasia education program. He also acted as a go-between, liaising between the CLP government and the Jawoyn traditional owners of Katherine. Mackinolty was employed as an advisor to the Northern Territory Labor Government 2002‚Äì2009, under various ministers, then quit to work for the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory (AMSANT) as a policy worker, a position he held until 2013 when he left for an extended period in Europe and the Middle East. ==Journalist== As well as graphic design, Mackinolty worked as a correspondent for newspapers including the Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, The Australian and The Bulletin. Mackinolty has been an occasional correspondent for Crikey, particularly its arts section. He has also contributed articles to The Monthly magazine. ==Exhibitions== Work in the 1990s included a controversial exhibition of posters with colleague Therese Ritchie If you see this exhibition you'll know we have been murdered which was attacked by the then Country Liberal Party government (1998).

The show was a joint production of Canada's Global Television Network and the United States' USA Network, the two networks that aired the series in first run, in association with Barry & Enright Productions and Wink Martindale Enterprises. This was one of three original series that USA and Global co- produced in the 1980s, with a 1985 revival of Jackpot and 1986's The New Chain Reaction preceding it. Bumper Stumpers premiered on June 29, 1987 and aired concurrently on Global and USA until December 28, 1990. It was created by Wink Martindale, the second creation of his to make air (Headline Chasers, which Martindale launched in syndication in 1985 in the United States with himself as host, was the first) and developed by Mark Maxwell-Smith. Al Dubois, who at the time was a weather forecaster for Global, hosted the show with Ken Ryan serving as the announcer. The show was taped at the Global Television Studios in Toronto, Ontario. Reruns of the series were seen on Global in Canada from 1990 to 1995 and on Game Show Network in the United States in 1994‚Äì95 and 2000. Bumper Stumpers later aired on the Canadian specialty channel GameTV from October 1, 2012 until 2017, from January 8 to February 25, 2018 and again from February 4, 2019 to March 1, 2019. ==Main game== Bumper Stumpers featured two teams, one usually a returning champion pair. The teams' goal was to correctly solve the Super Stumper, a puzzle designed to resemble a vanity license plate that consisted of seven spaces. At the beginning of each game, host Dubois would tell the teams whom or what the plate belonged to, and the first space was revealed. In order to begin filling in the spaces in the Super Stumper, the teams played a series of jump-in questions. Bumper Stumpers used a game board consisting of seven monitors, and each jump-in question used the top row of two monitors. The teams would be shown two plates, one of which belonged to someone or something, and had to guess which of the two was the correct plate. For instance, a plate belonging to swashbucklers would read \\"PYR88\\" with the solution being \\"pirates\\" while one belonging to Bill Cosby would read \\"IIPI\\" with the solution being the title of his television series I Spy; consecutive letters or numbers in a plate were usually treated as plurals, so the two numbers at the end of the first plate would read as \\"eights\\" and not \\"eighty-eight\\" while the first two letters in the second would not be pronounced \\"eye-eye\\". In another example, a plate belonging to a saboteur would read \\"VTHKOLM\\" but be pronounced \\"fifth column\\", with the V serving its purpose as the Roman numeral five, while a plate with \\"H2O\\" in it would belong to something having to do with water due to it being the chemical symbol. Contestants could not buzz in until the jump-in was read or (later) a green indicator light was lit atop the game board. Once a contestant buzzed in, he/she had to choose a plate and if correct, his/her teammate was given ten seconds to decipher it. If the other member of the team could not decipher the plate, the opposing team received ten seconds to guess themselves. If the first teammate buzzed in and picked the wrong plate, the opponents received first guess. Originally, the player who buzzed in and correctly identified the plate to solve could decide to either let his/her partner play or challenge their opponents to solve the plate. That rule was dropped after far more contestants opted to play rather than pass. The winners of the jump-in chose one of the remaining blank spaces to fill in on the Super Stumper, then were given five seconds to try to come up with the solution. Coming up with the solution won the game. If a team could not solve the Super Stumper after all seven spaces were revealed, the opposing team had one final chance to solve it. Whichever team solved two out of three Super Stumpers became champion and won with a chance to win more in the bonus round. Originally, solving a Super Stumper won the team that did so and the right to play the bonus round. If a Super Stumper went unsolved, a new one was played for more and play continued until one of the teams solved one. The rules were later changed to have the bonus round played after a team won two games, and if the teams could not solve a Super Stumper, a shortened round was played. The teams chose spaces one at a time, starting with the team that won the previous jump-in, and did so until one solved the Super Stumper. ==Bonus round== This show had three bonus rounds throughout the run. ===Bonus round #1=== The first bonus round featured two separate rounds. The first half saw the players trying to identify up to seven plates within 30 seconds. Getting seven won and ended the round immediately. As long as the team identified at least one plate, they moved on to the second half of the round dubbed the Final Stumper. The Final Stumper was played with all seven of the game board's monitors, with the letters S-T-U-M-P-E-R displayed in them. The object was to bank a set amount of money without finding a stop sign, at which point the round ended. The Final Stumper was played two different ways. ====Format #1==== Hidden behind the seven monitors were various dollar amounts and stop signs. For each plate the team solved, a money amount was added to the board. The first amount added was , and depending on how many plates were solved up to five additional amounts would be added. was added to the board first, second, third, fourth, and an additional space was added last. The team could keep choosing as long as they kept revealing dollar amounts and could stop at any point. Revealing a stop sign ended the round and froze the team's winnings. If they managed to find at least $500, the money was doubled. A team could win a maximum of $1,800 in this portion of the round (, , = , multiplied by two), if not all seven license plates were solved. However, if a team should correctly solve all seven license plates, the team will win automatically. ====Format #2==== In the second format, each solve placed a different set of spaces on the board. The first placed on the board was marked \\"WIN\\", and the next five were the money amounts mentioned above. Accumulating $1,000 or more or finding the \\"WIN\\" space augmented the team's total to $2,000. This time, finding a stop sign bankrupted the team and ended the round. ===Bonus round #2=== In the second bonus round, the team was given 30 seconds and up to five plates to solve. Solving four of the five was worth . For the second half of the round, the team was given up to three additional plates to solve and could stop at any time with the money earned. If the team decided to play on, they were given seven seconds to study the plate. Coming up with a right answer doubled the money each time, with a team winning if they solved all three. Failing to come up with a correct answer ended the round and cost the team their bank, and the round also ended if the team failed to get four plates in the first half of the round. ===Bonus round #3=== The third Bumper Stumpers bonus round consisted of a series of five plates connected to a subject, with each plate serving as a clue to the subject's identity. This time, only one player from the winning team played the first half of the round. That player was given 30 seconds to decipher the plates, with given for each. Unlike the previous bonus round formats, Dubois did not give out clues to the plates. After the time was up, the player was given a choice: either stop with whatever money he/she had accumulated, or risk it to see if the other player, isolated backstage, could come up with the owner of the plates. If the team took the risk and the second player was able to identify the subject using the solved plates, the team's winnings would be tripled. Thus, the maximum amount a team could win was . Winning teams could stay on the show until defeated or winning five matches. ==Tournament of Champions== Near the end of the show's run, airing on USA in September 1990 and repeated in December 1990, a \\"Tournament of Champions\\" was held, with 16 undefeated teams returning to compete. The winning team received an additional $10,000, while $5,000 was awarded to the runners-up. ==ReferencesCategory:1987 Canadian television series debuts Category:1990 Canadian television series endings Category:Cable game shows Category:1980s Canadian game shows Category:1990s Canadian game shows Category:English-language television shows Category:Global Television Network original programming Category:Television series by Corus Entertainment Category:Television series by Barry & Enright Productions Category:Television series by Sony Pictures Television Category:Television series by Universal Television Category:Television series produced in Toronto Category:USA Network original programming ","title":"Bumper Stumpers"},{"id":"2559121","text":"Clinton Smith (born January 19, 1964) is an American former basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

It is around five miles north-north-east of Bury St Edmunds. Its parish church contains rare mediaeval wall paintings, including dragon-slaying and the Martyrdom of St Edmund. It had one public house called The Bull. The village shop, formerly a Wesleyan chapel, has been closed for some time, and is now a private residence. The centre of the village, surrounded by farms, is characterised by housing estates built through the 1950s to 1970s, with minor, more localised, expansion since. Local children attend primary school in nearby Honington. The local pub, The Bull, had been a central part of the village since the late 1800s, but has now closed, leaving it boarded up. Owners, brewers Greene King, intend to sell it as a pub, and have controversially dug up the local playing and football field, and are now in the process of developing a new housing estate. The former Village Shop, the other historic hub of the village and former Wesleyan Chapel, is now a private residence. Troston Hall, to the south of the village is a Grade II* listed late sixteenth-century manor house, accompanied by the Grade II listed Hall Farm to its immediate north. In total, there are an 16 listed buildings in the village. ==Governance & religion== The parish falls within the West Suffolk District Council ward of Pakenham & Troston, the Suffolk County Council electoral division of Thingoe North, and the parliamentary constituency of Bury St Edmunds, whose MP since 2015 is Jo Churchill of the Conservative Party.

Formed in 1976, the mainstay of the band has been vocalist Charlie Harper, originally a singer in Britain's R&B; scene. They were also one of the first street punk bands. ==Career== The U.K. Subs were part of the original punk movement in England. The band formed in 1976, initially using the name the Subversives. The band's founder, Charlie Harper, selected guitarist Nicky Garratt, bassist Paul Slack, and various drummers (eventually with Pete Davies became fairly stable) under the initial name \\"U.K. Subversives\\". The London-based band's early line-up changed frequently. Their style combined the energy of punk and the rock and roll edge of the then- thriving pub rock scene. The band had hit singles such as \\"Stranglehold\\", \\"Warhead\\", \\"Teenage\\", and \\"Tomorrow's Girls\\", with several of their songs managing to enter the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. The band played several John Peel sessions in 1978 for BBC Radio 1, and played some opening gigs for The Police, and recorded a set at The Roxy (a punk club), which was issued in 1980 as Live Kicks. They signed a recording contract with GEM Records in May 1979. Under GEM, the U.K. Subs recorded their most successful studio albums, Another Kind of Blues and Brand New Age. Their biggest selling album came with 1980's Crash Course. Crash Course was recorded at the Rainbow Theatre in London on 30 May 1980 during the Brand New Age tour. In 1979, Julien Temple wrote and directed a short film Punk Can Take It, a parody of wartime documentaries, that consisted mainly of the U.K.Subs playing live on stage. The film was released theatrically. In the 1980s with the addition of the new bassist Alvin Gibbs and drummer Steve Roberts, the songs took on a more heavy metal-influenced edge. In July 1982, they became the first Western band to perform in Poland since the imposition of martial law, and the suppression of the trade union Solidarity. Their concert was held in Gda≈Ñsk, and they were supported by Brygada Kryzys. Also in 1983 they came to Poland, where they played several concerts with new wave polish band Republika. In 1991, the U.K. Subs also had Lars Frederiksen (now of Rancid) on guitar for a 30 date UK tour. Decades after the disbanding of other late-1970s punk groups such as the Sex Pistols and The Clash, the U.K. Subs continue to perform. Successive U.K. Subs album titles start with consecutive letters of the alphabet, and the band announced on 24 October 2015 via their Facebook page, that the 26th album starting with the letter \\"Z\\" would be their last long playing record, although they would continue to release EPs. The band intend to fund the final album through Crowdfunding site Pledge Music, the official start date for their pledge campaign is 1 November 2015. The U.K. Subs song \\"Down on the Farm\\" was covered by Guns N' Roses on their 1993 covers album \\"The Spaghetti Incident?\\". The U.K. Subs joined the bill for the 2006 Fiend Fest. The band have toured with The Misfits, The Adicts, Osaka Popstar, Agent Orange, and The Ramones. The U.K. Subs song \\"Warhead\\" is played in the movie, This Is England. U.K. Subs are one of the regular bands to play the Rebellion Festival nearly every year since its origins as The Holidays in the Sun Festival in 1996. In 2007, drummer Jamie Oliver was a contestant on the UK quiz show Nothing But the Truth. Vocalist Charlie Harper was among the panel of witnesses. Oliver reached the ¬£5000 mark, but lost it all in a bid to double his winnings. In recent years, the band's work has been critical of British politician Nick Clegg, with the 2013 song \\"Coalition Government Blues\\" describing the Liberal Democrats' leader as \\"liking his perks\\". The band's 2015 album Yellow Leader was widely suspected of referring to Clegg, with yellow being the official colour of his political party. To celebrate 40 years since its release, Demon Records issued a special edition copy of Another Kind Of Blues in a box set of two 10\\" coloured vinyl on 13 April 2019. This was soon followed by the next album in succession, Brand New Age on 12 July 2019. Setting a trend for further releases in the catalogue. == Band members == Current *Charlie Harper- lead vocals (1976‚Äìpresent) * Alvin Gibbs- bass (1980‚Äì1983, 1988, 1996, 1999‚Äì2002, 2003‚Äìpresent) * Jamie Oliver- drums (2005‚Äìpresent) * Steve Straughan- guitar (2016‚Äìpresent) Former * Richard Anderson- guitar (1976‚Äì77) * Greg Brown- guitar (1977) * Steve Slack- bass (1976‚Äì77, 1983‚Äì1984) * Rory Lyons- drums (1976‚Äì1977) * Robbie Harper- drums, guitar (Rob Milne) (1977) * Steve J Jones- drums (1977, 1983‚Äì1984) * Nicky Garratt- guitar (1977‚Äì1983, 1988, 1996, 1999‚Äì2002, 2004‚Äì2010) * Paul Slack- bass (1977‚Äì1981, 2008‚Äì2010) * Robby Baldock- drums (1978) * Pete Davies- drums (1978‚Äì1980, 1984, 1991‚Äì1996, 2007, 2008) * Carlos Hyena- guitar (1978) * Ian (Tanner) Tansley- drums (1980 on Brand New Age Tour ‚Äì filling in for a sick Pete Davies) * Steve Roberts- drums (1981‚Äì82, 1987, 2002) * Adam Griffiths- bass (1981‚Äì1982) * Mal Asling AKA 'Sol Mintz'- drums (1982) * John Towe AKA 'Kim Wylie'- drums (1982‚Äì1983) * Captain Scarlet (David Lloyd)- guitar (1983‚Äì1984) * Tim Britta- guitar (1984) * Jim Moncur- guitar (1984‚Äì1987) * Tezz Roberts- bass (1984), guitar (1984‚Äì85, 1995, 2002), drums (1988, 1999) * John Armitage- bass (1984‚Äì1985) * Matthew \\"Turkey\\" Best- drums (1984) * Rab Fae Beith- drums (1984‚Äì1986) * Ricky McGuire- bass (1985‚Äì1986) * Mark Barratt- bass (1986‚Äì1987) * Darrell Barth- guitar (1986‚Äì87, 1989‚Äì91, 1999) * Geoff Sewell- drums (1986) * Knox- guitar (1987) * Alan Lee- guitar (1987‚Äì89) * Flea (Dave Farrelly)- bass (1987‚Äì91) * Dave Wilkinson- drums (1987) * Duncan Smith- drums (1987‚Äì88) * Belvy K- drums (1988) * Matt McCoy- drums (1988‚Äì92, 1993, 1995) * Andy McCoy- guitar (1988) * Leo Mortimer- drums (1989‚Äì90) * Karl Morris- guitar (1990‚Äì1992, 1993) * Jeff Moe- drums (1991) * Lars Frederiksen- guitar (1991) * Johan- guitar (1991) * Scott Snowden- guitar (1992) * Alan Campbell- guitar (1992‚Äì2004) * Brian Barnes- bass (1992‚Äì1994, 1996‚Äì2001, 2002‚Äì2004, 2008) * Greg Cahill- drums (1993 Canada, Argentina tours) * Dave Ayer- drums (1995‚Äì1997) *Gizz Butt- guitar (1996) * Phil Pain- guitar (1996) * Benjie Bollox- drums (1996) * Blitz- drums (1996) * Michael Richter- drums (1997) * Gary Baldy (Ostell)- drums (1997‚Äì99) * Carly Guarino- bass (1997) * Andy Frantic- bass (1997‚Äì99) * Pumpy- drums (1999‚Äì2000) * Tommy Couch- drums (1999‚Äì2000) * Gizz Lazlo- drums (1999, 2006) * Jason Willer- drums (2001‚Äì2006) * Simon Rankin- guitar (2001), bass (2001‚Äì2002) * Bones- bass (2002) * Criss Damage- drums (2002) * Darrah- drums (2002) * Jay- drums (2002) * Allistair Chesters- bass (2002‚Äì2007) *Pete Honkamaki- bass (2002‚Äì2003) * Clara Wiseman- bass (2005) * Jet- guitar (2005‚Äì2016) * Eric Baconstrip- drums (2005) * Peter 'Goldblade' Byrchmore- guitar (2006) * Chema Zurita- bass (2007‚Äì2011, 2016) * Jared Melville- drums (2008) * Peter Revesz- bass (2008) * Tony Barber- bass (2008) } ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== *Another Kind of Blues (1979) (UK No. 21) *Brand New Age (1980) (UK No. 18) *Diminished Responsibility (1981) (UK No. 18) *Endangered Species (1982) *Flood of Lies (1983) *Gross Out USA (1984) *Huntington Beach (1985) *In Action (1986) *Japan Today (1987) *Killing Time (1988) *Live In Paris (1990) *Mad Cow Fever (1991) *Normal Service Resumed (1993) *Occupied (1996) *Peel Sessions (1997) *Quintessentials (1997) *Riot (1997) *Sub Mission (1999) *Timewarp (2001) *Universal (2002) *Violent State (2004) *Work in Progress (10 January 2011) *XXIV (6 February 2013) *Yellow Leader (3 August 2015) *Ziezo (2 May 2016) *Subversions (22 June 2018) *Subversions II (28 June 2019) ===Compilation albums=== * Recorded 1979‚Äì1981 (1982) * Demonstration Tapes (1984) * Subs Standards (1986) * Raw Material (1986) * A.W.O.L.

Having sailed from the Port of San Blas Nayarit Mexico. ==Biography== Ayala was born in Osuna, Andaluc√≠a. He entered the Spanish navy on the 19 September 1760, and rose to achieve the rank of captain by 1782. He retired (on full pay on account of his achievements in California) on March 14, 1785. In the early 1770s, the Spanish royal authorities ordered an exploration of the north coast of California, \\"to Ascertain if there were any Russian Settlements on the Coast of California, and to Examine the Port of San Francisco\\". Don Fernando Rivera y Moncada had already marked the point for a mission in what is now San Francisco, and a land expedition to establish Spanish rule over the area, under Juan Bautista de Anza had been sent northwards. Ayala, then a Lieutenant was one of those assigned to the naval expedition. He arrived in Vera Cruz in August, 1774 and proceeded to Mexico City to receive orders from the Viceroy, Frey Don Antonio Mar√≠a de Bucareli y Ursua. Bucareli sent him to San Blas where he took command of the schooner Sonora, part of a squadron under the general command of Don Bruno de Heceta, in the frigate Santiago. The squadron sailed from San Blas early in 1775. However, when they were lying outside San Blas about to set out, the commander of the packet ship San Carlos, Don Miguel Manrique, was taken ill - some sources say that he went mad. Ayala was ordered to take command of this larger vessel, sailed back to San Blas to land the unfortunate Manrique, and rejoined the squadron after a few days' sailing. Ayala was designated to pass through the strait and explore what lay within, while the Santiago and Sonora continued northwards. The San Carlos took on supplies at Monterey, leaving there on 26 July and then proceeding northwards. Ayala passed through the Golden Gate on 5 August 1775, with some difficulty and great caution because of the tides. He tried a number of anchorages, finding that off Angel Island most satisfactory, but failed to make contact, as he had hoped, with Anza's party. Ayala put up a wooden cross where he landed the first night. The San Carlos remained in the Bay until 18 September, returning to San Blas via Monterey. Ayala's subsequent report to the Viceroy gave a full account of the geography of the bay, and stressed its advantages as a harbour (chiefly the absence of \\"those troublesome fogs which we had daily in Monterey, because the fogs here hardly reach the entrance of the port, and once inside the harbor, the weather is very clear\\") and the friendliness of the local Native American people. On August 12, 1775, Ayala gave the name Isla de Alcatraces, \\"island of the pelicans\\", and what is now Yerba Buena Island, \\"on account of the abundance of those birds that were on it\\". The name was transferred in 1826 to Alcatraz Island. The word \\"Alcatraz\\" comes from Spanish, which in turn was a probably a loan word from Arabic, ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ∑ÿ±ÿ≥ al-qa·π≠rƒÅs meaning \\"sea eagle\\". The pelicans native to San Francisco Bay are brown pelicans. ==References== ==External links== *Etext of \\"The March of Portol√†\\" and the Log of the San Carlos * Category:1745 births Category:1797 deaths Category:People from Osuna Category:Spanish explorers of North America Category:History of San Francisco Category:Spanish explorers Category:Spanish people of Basque descent Category:18th-century Spanish military personnel Category:18th-century explorers Category:Explorers of the United States ","title":"Juan de Ayala"},{"id":"2559156","text":"The Civil Reserve Air Fleet is part of the United States's mobility resources. Selected aircraft from U.S. airlines, contractually committed to Civil Reserve Air Fleet, support United States Department of Defense airlift requirements in emergencies when the need for airlift exceeds the capability of military aircraft. ==Background== During World War II civil air transport was widely used during the first two years of the conflict by mutual agreement between the Air Transport Association and the United States Army Air Forces until the Air Transport Command could acquire sufficient aircraft and train crews to handle the global air transport mission itself. After the war, the lessons learned were either forgotten or ignored when ATC was as severely demobilized like the rest of the U.S. military. In 1952, after aircraft were commandeered for the Berlin Airlift, CRAF was created as a more orderly way of serving emergency military needs. The Fleet has three main segments: international, national and aeromedical evacuation. The international segment is further divided into the long-range and short-range sections and the national segment into the domestic and Alaskan sections. Assignment of aircraft to a segment depends on the nature of the requirement and the performance characteristics needed. The long-range international section consists of passenger and cargo aircraft capable of transoceanic operations. The role of these aircraft is to augment the Air Mobility Command's long-range intertheater C-5s and C-17s during periods of increased airlift needs, from minor contingencies up through full national defense emergencies. Medium-sized passenger and cargo aircraft make up the short-range international section supporting near offshore airlift requirements. The aircraft in the Alaskan section provide airlift within U.S. Pacific Command's area of responsibility, specific to Alaska needs. The domestic section is designed to satisfy increased DoD airlift requirements in the U.S. during an emergency. The aeromedical evacuation segment assists in the evacuation of casualties from operational theaters to hospitals in the continental United States. These aircraft are also used to return medical supplies and medical crews to the theater of operations. Kits containing litter stanchions, litters and other aeromedical equipment are used to convert civil Boeing 767 passenger aircraft into air ambulances. ==Membership commitment and requirements== The airlines contractually pledge aircraft to the various segments of Civil Reserve Air Fleet, ready for activation when needed. To provide incentives for civil carriers to commit aircraft to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program and to assure the United States of adequate airlift reserves, the government makes peacetime airlift business available to civilian airlines that offer aircraft to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet. Department of Defense offers business through the International Airlift Services. For fiscal year 2005, the guaranteed portion of the contract was $418 million. Air Mobility Command (AMC) previously reported that throughout fiscal 2005 it planned to award more than $1.5 billion in additional business beyond the guaranteed portion of the contract. To join Civil Reserve Air Fleet, carriers must maintain a minimum commitment of 40 percent of its Civil Reserve Air Fleet capable passenger and cargo fleet. Aircraft committed must be U.S. registered and carriers must also commit and maintain at least four complete crews for each aircraft. Carriers with aircraft whose performance does not meet minimum Civil Reserve Air Fleet requirements are issued a certificate of technical ineligibility so they can still compete for government airlift business. Aviation safety is the paramount concern, and numerous procedures are in effect to ensure that the air carriers with which AMC contracts afford the highest level of safety to Department of Defense passengers. Prior to receiving a contract, all carriers must demonstrate that they have provided substantially equivalent and comparable commercial service for one year before submitting their offer to fly for the Department of Defense. All carriers must be fully certified Federal Aviation Administration carriers and meet the stringent standards of Federal Aviation Regulations pertaining to commercial airlines (Part 121). A Department of Defense survey team, composed of experienced AMC pilots and skilled aircraft maintenance personnel, performs an on-site inspection of the carriers. This team conducts a comprehensive inspection that includes carrier's aircraft, training facilities, crew qualifications, maintenance procedures, quality control practices and financial status to maximize the likelihood that the carrier would safely perform for Department of Defense. After passing this survey, the carrier is certified by the Commercial Airlift Review Board as DOD-approved before receiving a contract. AMC analysts then continue to monitor the carrier's safety record, operations and maintenance status, contract performance, financial condition and management initiatives, summarizing significant trends in a comprehensive review every six months. In addition to this in-depth review, there are several other surveillance initiatives. These include safety preflight inspections of commercial aircraft by Department of Defense designated inspectors, periodic cockpit observations on operational flights by highly experienced pilots from AMC's Department of Defense Commercial Airlift Division, and an increase in the frequency of on-site surveys. These initiatives and the surveys are further supplemented by an open flow of information on all contract carriers between AMC and the FAA through established liaison officers. ==Fleet== As of June 2014, 24 carriers and 553 aircraft are enrolled in CRAF. This includes 517 aircraft in the international segment with 391 in the long-range international section and 126 in the short- range international section. There are 36 aircraft in the national segment. These numbers are subject to change on a monthly basis.Air Mobility Command, Public Affairs Office; 402 Scott Drive, Unit 1-M-8; Scott AFB, IL 62225-5335 ==Activation== Three stages of incremental activation allow for tailoring an airlift force suitable for the contingency at hand. Stage I is for minor regional crises, Stage II would be used for major theater war and Stage III for periods of national mobilization. The commander, U.S. Transportation Command, with approval of the Secretary of Defense, is the activation authority for all three stages of Civil Reserve Air Fleet. During a crisis, if AMC has a need for additional aircraft, it would request the commander of USTRANSCOM to take steps to activate the appropriate Civil Reserve Air Fleet stage. Each stage of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet activation is only used to the extent necessary to provide the amount of civil augmentation airlift needed by Department of Defense. When notified of call-up, the carrier response time to have its aircraft ready for a Civil Reserve Air Fleet mission is 24, 48, and 72 hours after the mission is assigned by AMC. The air carriers continue to operate and maintain the aircraft with their resources; however, AMC assigns the aircraft missions. CRAF has been activated once as part of Operation Desert Shield and once as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. == Contracts == The U.S. Department of Defense regularly issues contracts and task orders within the Civil Air Reserve Fleet program. For example, on October 1, 2018, U.S. Transportation Command issued millions of dollars of task orders to members of the Civil Air Reserve Fleet. On October 1, 2019, U.S. Transportation Command again issued millions of dollars of task orders to members of the Civil Air Reserve Fleet for charter airlift services. Less than one year's worth of Civil Air Reserve Fleet operations (18 November 2015 through 30 September 2016) was worth roughly $357 million. == Membership == The following air carriers are members of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet: === Long-Range International === *ABX Air *Air Transport International *American Airlines *Amerijet International *Atlas Air *Delta Air Lines *FedEx Express *Hawaiian Airlines *Kalitta Air *National Airlines (N8) *Omni Air International *Polar Air Cargo *Southern Air *United Airlines *UPS Airlines *Western Global Airlines === Short-Range International === *ABX Air *Alaska Airlines *Amerijet International *Delta Air Lines *JetBlue Airways *Lynden Air Cargo *National Airlines *Northern Air Cargo *Sun Country *United Airlines *USA Jet === Domestic === *Allegiant Air *Everts Air Cargo *Southwest Airlines ==References== ==External links== Current CRAF information can be found at the U.S. Department of Transportation, Office of Intelligence, Security and Emergency Response: * Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program Allocations Category:Aviation in the United States Category:United States Department of Defense agencies ","title":"Civil Reserve Air Fleet"},{"id":"2559158","text":"Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are events resembling an epileptic seizure, but without the characteristic electrical discharges associated with epilepsy. They are of psychological origin, and are one type of non-epileptic seizure mimics. PNES are also known less specifically as non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD) and functional neurological symptom disorder. ==Signs and symptoms== People present with episodes that resemble seizures, and most have received a diagnosis of epilepsy and treatment for it. Most commonly the episodes in question are convulsive (whole body shaking) and resemble generalized tonic-clonic (‚Äúgrand mal‚Äù) seizures, but they can be less dramatic and mimic milder types of seizures (partial seizures, absence seizures, myoclonic seizures). ==Causes== The cause is by definition psychological, and can be categorized into several psychiatric diagnoses. In the vast majority of people, the production of seizure-like symptoms is not under voluntary control, meaning that the person is not faking; symptoms which are feigned or faked voluntarily would fall under the categories of factitious disorder or malingering. ==Risk factors== Most people with PNES (75%) are women, with onset in the late teens to early twenties being typical. A number of studies have also reported a high incidence of abnormal personality traits or personality disorders in people with PNES such as borderline personality. However, again, when an appropriate control group is used, the incidence of such characteristics is not always higher in PNES than in similar illnesses arising due to organic disease (e.g., epilepsy). Other risk factors for PNES include having a diagnosis of epilepsy, having recently had a head injury or recently undergone neurosurgery. ==Diagnosis== The differential diagnosis of PNES firstly involves ruling out epilepsy as the cause of the seizure episodes, along with other organic causes of non-epileptic seizures, including syncope, migraine, vertigo, anoxia, hypoglycemia, and stroke. However, between 5-20% of people with PNES also have epilepsy. Frontal lobe seizures can be mistaken for PNES, though these tend to have shorter duration, stereotyped patterns of movements and occurrence during sleep. Next, an exclusion of factitious disorder (a subconscious somatic symptom disorder, where seizures are caused by psychological reasons) and malingering (simulating seizures intentionally for conscious personal gain ‚Äì such as monetary compensation or avoidance of criminal punishment) is conducted. Finally other psychiatric conditions that may superficially resemble seizures are eliminated, including panic disorder, schizophrenia, and depersonalisation disorder. The most definitive test to distinguish epilepsy from PNES is long term video-EEG monitoring, with the aim of capturing one or two episodes on both video recording and EEG simultaneously (some clinicians may use suggestion to attempt to trigger an episode). Additional clinical criteria are usually considered in addition to video-EEG monitoring when diagnosing PNES. EEG-video monitoring will usually answer the following questions: # Is it epilepsy? # If not, is it psychogenic? # If not psychogenic, what other seizure mimic is it? # If epilepsy, what type? # If focal epilepsy, where is the focus? By recording the event in question on video and EEG simultaneously, a clear diagnosis can usually be obtained. Laboratory testing can detect rising blood levels of serum prolactin if samples are taken in the right time window after most tonic-clonic or complex partial epileptic seizures. However, due to false positives and variability in results, this test is relied upon less frequently. ===Distinguishing features=== Some features are more or less likely to suggest PNES but they are not conclusive and should be considered in the broader clinical picture. Features that are common in PNES but rarer in epilepsy include: biting the tip of the tongue, seizures lasting more than 2 minutes (easiest factor to distinguish), seizures having a gradual onset, a fluctuating course of disease severity, the eyes being closed during a seizure, and side to side head movements. Features that are uncommon in PNES include automatisms (automatic complex movements during the seizure), severe tongue biting, biting the inside of the mouth, and incontinence. If a person with suspected PNES has an episode during a clinical examination, there are a number of signs that can be elicited to help support or refute the diagnosis of PNES. Compared to people with epilepsy, people with PNES will tend to resist having their eyes forced open (if they are closed during the seizure), will stop their hands from hitting their own face if the hand is dropped over the head, and will fixate their eyes in a way suggesting an absence of neurological interference. Mellers et al. warn that such tests are neither conclusive nor impossible for a determined person with factitious disorder to \\"pass\\" through faking convincingly. ==Treatment== People with PNES have typically carried a diagnosis of epilepsy for roughly 7 years, so an understanding of the new diagnosis is crucial for their treatment, which requires their active participation. There are a number of recommended steps to explain to people their diagnosis in a sensitive and open manner. A negative diagnosis experience may cause frustration and could cause a person to reject any further attempts at treatment. Ten points recommended to explain the diagnosis to the person and their caregivers are: # Reasons for concluding they do not have epilepsy # What they do have (describe dissociation) # Emphasise they are not suspected of \\"putting on\\" the attacks # They are not 'mad' # Triggering \\"stresses\\" may not be immediately apparent. # Relevance of aetiological factors in their case # Maintaining factors # May improve after correct diagnosis # Caution that anticonvulsant drug withdrawal should be gradual # Describe psychological treatment Psychotherapy is the most frequently used treatment, which might include cognitive behavioral therapy, insight-orientated therapy, and/or group work. There is also some evidence supporting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants. Mental health professionals typically show little interest in this category of psychiatric diseases and people frequently find themselves stuck between psychiatry and neurology with no one to turn to for treatment. ==Prognosis== Though there is limited evidence, outcomes appear to be relatively poor with a review of outcome studies finding that two thirds of people with PNES continue to experience episodes and more than half are dependent on social security at three-year followup. This outcome data was obtained in a referral-based academic epilepsy center and loss to follow-up was considerable; the authors point out ways in which this may have biased their outcome data. Outcome was shown to be better in people with higher IQ, social status, greater educational attainments, younger age of onset and diagnosis, attacks with less dramatic features, and fewer additional somatoform complaints. ==Epidemiology== The number of people with PNES ranges from 2 to 33 per 100,000. Although the rate in the general population are difficult to determine, it remains the most frequent non-epileptic condition seen in epilepsy centers. At epilepsy centers PNES is found in 20-40% of inpatients. Like other somatic symptom disorders, PNES are most common in young adults and women. The number of people with PNES in those with functional neurological disorder is higher. ===Children=== PNES are seen in children after the age of 8, and occur equally among boys and girls before puberty. Diagnostic and treatment principles are similar to those for adults, except that in children there is a broader differential diagnosis of seizures so that other possible diagnoses specific to children may be considered. ==History== Hystero-epilepsy is a historical term that refers to a condition described by 19th-century French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot where people with neuroses \\"acquired\\" symptoms resembling seizures as a result of being treated on the same ward as people who genuinely had epilepsy. ==Society and culture== PNES rates and presenting symptoms are somewhat dependent on the culture and society. In some cultures, they, like epilepsy, are thought of as a curse or a demonic possession. In cultures with a solid establishment of evidence-based medicine, they are considered a subtype of a larger category of psychiatric disease. ==Terminology== Terminology varies somewhat, although PNES has become the most widely accepted term. The use of older terms including pseudoseizures and hysterical seizures are discouraged.Diagnosis and management of dissociative seizures, John DC Mellers, The National Society for Epilepsy, September 2005. In the English language, the word ‚Äúseizure‚Äù usually refers to epileptic events, so some prefer to use more general terms like \\"events,\\" \\"attacks,\\" or \\"episodes,\\" as the term ‚Äúseizures‚Äù may cause confusion with epilepsy. PNES may also be referred to as \\"non-epileptic attack disorder\\" or \\"functional seizures,\\" though those terms do not clearly indicate a psychological origin and therefore include other (non psychological) causes of epilepsy mimics. Within DSM IV the attacks are classified as a somatoform disorder, whilst in ICD 10 the term dissociative convulsions is used, classified as a conversion disorder. In DSM-5 PNES is also known as functional neurological symptom disorder and is classified as a conversion disorder, which falls under the diagnostic category of somatic symptom disorders. ==References== == External links == Category:Abnormal psychology Category:Disorders causing seizures Category:Seizure types ","title":"Psychogenic non-epileptic seizure"},{"id":"2559161","text":"The Ptsich, or Pciƒçofficial transliteration (, ) is a river in Eastern Europe.

The winner was selected by votes that are cast by chess journalists from across the world. The traditional voting procedure was to request hundreds of chess journalists from many countries to submit a list of the ten best players of the year. The voters were journalists who knew the game and followed it closely, and so the honor was highly prized. The award itself took the form of a bronze statuette representing a man in a boat. The prize was created and awarded in 1967 by Spanish journalist Jorge Puig, and the International Association of Chess Press (AIP). The awards were given from 1967 until 1988.

Known as Furry he first laid the foundations of State Security in 1959. ==Career== Ibarra was a founding member of the 26th of July Movement. Following the collapse of the Batista regime in Cuba, Ibarra attempted to organise Cuban military expeditions to help local revolutionaries overthrow the governments of Bolivia and Argentina. In December 1975, he was named the head of the first Cuban military mission to Angola. Ibarra reportedly drove to the Cuban and Angolan front lines to personally supervise the defence against National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) forces, backed by invading South African troops. Ibarra is a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba. He bears the title Hero of the Republic of Cuba, and holds the Order of M√°ximo G√≥mez in recognition of, in Fidel Castro's own words, \\"his extraordinary merits in the insurrectional struggle against the tyranny and the imperialist neocolonial domination, the struggle for the consolidation and defense of the socialist state, and the accomplishment of heroic internationalist missions.\\" == Victory of the Cuban Revolution == At the victory of the Cuban Revolution, in April 1959 Abelardo was appointed Chief of the Intelligence Directorate of the Rebel Army. He was part of Fidel Castro's support after the visit of the United Nations Organization. It is believed that it was Colom√© Ibarra who informed Fidel Castro in Havana that Hubert Matos would take up arms. In 1961, Efigenio Ameijeiras requested his support for the National Revolutionary Police, where he assumed the leadership of the Motorized Police, the same with which he fought during the Invasion of the Bay of Pigs. In 1962 he began to work in the Military Counterintelligence of the Armed Forces, fulfilling internationalist combat missions in Bolivia and Argentina, where he entered with a false Algerian passport to meet Jorge Masetti. In Bolivia, he bought a 4-hectare farm in Cochabamba, close to Emborozu, south of Tarijas and close to Argentina. He fought alongside Samuel Rodiles Planas and Ra√∫l D√≠az-Arg√ºelles in the Cuban military brigade in Algeria, participating in the same way in the preparation of the guerrillas that fought with Che Guevara in the Congo, former Zaire in addition to getting involved in the organization of guerrilla groups in Guinea-Bissau for the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde. Colom√© participated in the location of military and intelligence devices in South Yemen and Somalia, in addition to fulfilling infiltration and combat missions from Mexico and Central America to Venezuela. He was Division Chief in the Eastern Army, participating in Operation Mamb√≠ in 1968. He organized the Northern Army Corps in Holgu√≠n until his appointment as Head of the Directorate of Military Counterintelligence. In 1972, he was appointed Vice Minister of the Armed Forces with powers to replace Minister Ra√∫l Castro in his absence. In 1975, on the death of Ra√∫l D√≠az-Arg√ºelles in Angola, he was sent to combat replacing him against South African forces and UNITA. In 1976 he was Military Chief of all Cuban troops in Angola. Colom√© was Head of the 10th. Directorate of Military Intelligence. He was in charge of the espionage carried out between the socialist countries and members of NATO. Colom√© Ibarra was in charge of carrying out the investigations and arrests in the case of General Arnaldo Ochoa S√°nchez. After the trial against General Jos√© Abrantes, he was appointed Minister of the Interior until October 26, 2015 when he requested his resignation, in a letter sent to President Ra√∫l. The Council of State agreed to award him with the First Degree Order for the Service to the Fatherland for his standard career. ==See also== *Ministry of the Interior of Cuba ==References== * Pittsburgh Post Gazette, Cuba Commanados Bare Death Plot, 28 April 1964 * El Nuevo Herald; PURGA MASIVA EN LA HABANA SALEN DEL POLITBURO ROCA, VALDES, DEL VALLE Y GARCIA; 8 February 1986. * El Pais; Detenidos cinco ex altos cargos cubanos por no combatir el narcotr√°fico: El ex ministro del Interior, acusado de corrupci√≥n; 8 January 1989. * The Miami Herald; NEW MINISTER RANKS JUST BEHIND TWO CASTROS; 30 June 1989; Page 10 A. * The Washington Post; Castro Fires Top Official For Security;Cuban Drug Scandal Claims Interior Chief, 30 June 1989, Page A25. * El Nuevo Herald; Abelardo Colom√© Ibarra; 29 September 1999, page 27A * Philadelphia Inquirer; Raul Castro has his fans, also, Fidel Castro's brother, filling in as president, can count on a network of loyal military officers; 14 August 2006. * La Jornada (Mexico); Abelardo Colom√©, l√≠der hist√≥rico que al parecer se mantendr√° en el poder; 23 February 2008. * Frank O.

Erg makes his first live action appearance on the second season of the television series The Gifted as the leader of the Morlocks played by Michael Luwoye. ==Publication history== Erg's first appearance was in Power Pack #12 (July 1985), and he was created by Louise Simonson and June Brigman. The character subsequently appears in The Uncanny X-Men #195 (July 1985), X-Factor #10 (November 1986), Power Pack #27 (December 1986), X-Factor #11-12 (December 1986-January 1987), #15 (April 1987), Decimation: House of M - The Day After #1 (January 2006), X-Men: The 198 #1 (March 2006), X-Men: The 198 Files #1 (March 2006), X-Men #183 (April 2006), X-Men: The 198 #2-5 (April‚ÄìJuly 2006), and The Uncanny X-Men #487-491 (August‚ÄìDecember 2007). Erg appeared as part of the \\"Morlocks\\" entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #9. ==Fictional character biography== Erg was a member of the Morlocks, and was one of the few Morlocks to survive the Marauders' attack during the 'Mutant Massacre'. He was also one of the first mutants to seek a safe haven at the Xavier Institute following M-Day, when most mutants lost their powers. Erg, Mammomax, and Peepers were running from members of the murderous Sapien League. They had the institute in sight when they were taken down by a shock grenade and tasers. The Leper Queen orders her men to kill them. The League members set up three St. Andrew's crosses (which are \\"X\\" shaped) with braces to keep the crosses upright. Erg is tied to one of the crosses. Gasoline was poured on and a lit match tossed. Erg regains consciousness when the lower legs of the cross were blazing. He would have died if he hadn't been yanked off by Wolverine. The X-Man had been sitting in the Xavier estate woods, letting Colossus sketch him.\\"House Of M: The Day After\\" #1 (Jan. 2006) Erg remained at the Xavier Institute with many other mutants, some unwillingly, becoming something of a ringleader for the non-X-Men members of the 198. It was Erg's idea to raise a \\"198\\" flag, the number representing what was originally thought to be the number of mutants left in the world after the Decimation.\\"X-Men: The 198\\" #1 He was also one of a few mutants who attacked Sentinel Squad O*N*E (Office of National Emergency) because they want to leave the Xavier estate. Erg was also one of the unfortunate mutants who accepted having an electronic tag inserted in order to be allowed to go out on a supervised group trip to Salem Center. Dr. Cooper told the mutants that the tags were \\"...a harmless tracking device, inserted under the skin with a simple and painless surgical process\\". That was not true, as Erg later discovered, as the tags had the ability to generate disabling electronic pulses. Later, Mister M freed the chipped mutants of their devices. ===The Extremists=== During \\"The Extremists\\" arc, Erg reappeared alongside some of his fellow Morlocks under the leadership of Masque. Besides Erg, this group consisted of Bliss, Litterbug, the undercover Skids, and the captured Leech.Uncanny X-Men 488-491 (2007) ===Dark Reign=== Erg is shown as one of Norman Osborn's mutant prisoners after the riots in San Francisco.Dark Avengers #7 He later took refuge on Utopia, and participated in the fight against the attacking Nimrods.New Mutants #14 ==Powers and abilities== Erg is a mutant who is able to absorb all forms of energy and project them in blasts from his right eye, which he calls his \\"electric eye\\". ==In other media== *Erg has appeared in a few episodes of the X-Men: The Animated Series with his fellow Morlocks and fought the X-Men. *Erg has appeared in a few episodes of the television series, The Gifted. He is black, has a special eyepatch covers his left eye, and he has the trademark 'M' scar which was self-inflicted and used as a statement of Erg's mutant pride. It is also shown that Erg and his fellow Morlocks just want to live care-free in the tunnels, being neutral rather than for a certain side. In the episode, coMplications, mutants John Proudstar and Clarice Fong, go to the sewers to find Erg in order to get information on Lorna Dane and Andy Strucker. There, they meet the Morlocks, which Erg is the leader of. He asks Clarice to be a spy for the Morlocks and in return, he gives them the information they need. In the episode, afterMath, a bunch of mutants were released from a mental institution and need shelter. Clarice thinks Erg's Morlock Tunnels can help them. Erg is against this but Clarice gives him information and eventually talks him into taking the mutant refugees, as long as they inflict themselves with the 'M' scar. At the end of the episode, Erg gives Clarice her hero name: Blink. He later appears in subsequent episodes, \\"meMento\\", \\"hoMe\\", and \\"teMpted\\", whenever the Mutant Underground needs help or vice versa. ==References== ==External links== * Erg at Marvel.com Category:Characters created by Louise Simonson Category:Comics characters introduced in 1985 Category:Marvel Comics mutants Category:Marvel Comics superheroes Category:X-Men supporting characters ","title":"Erg (comics)"},{"id":"2559200","text":"Beautiful Dreamer is a fictional mutant character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

Dreamer appeared in the first season of The Gifted played by Elena Satine. ==Publication history== Beautiful Dreamer's first appearance was in Power Pack #12 (July 1985), and she was created by Louise Simonson and June Brigman. ==Fictional character biography== Dreamer, along with several other Morlocks, confronts the Power Pack, when the young team enters the New York City sewers to look for their lost school books. The empathic Annalee, mourning her deceased children, wishes to have Beautiful Dreamer alter the memories of Power Pack. The goal is to have the Power Pack believe Annalee is their mother. Two of the X-Men, Nightcrawler and Kitty Pryde, stop this plan.Power Pack #12 When the Morlock leader Callisto had left for a time, Masque decides to re-implement Annalee's desires. The Power Pack's parents have their memories altered and ultimately, three of the Pack. The last member, Energizer, summons help from the X-Men. Callisto returns in time to undo the plan and Beautiful Dreamer restores the minds of all affected.Uncanny X-Men #195 Beautiful Dreamer was among the few members of the Morlocks to survive the Marauders' \\"Mutant Massacre\\", during which most members of her community were killed.X-Factor (vol. 1) #9 She stays with X-Factor, for a while, along with her friends, Tar Baby, Ape, and Erg.X-Factor (vol. 1) #10 - 11 There was a brief conflict with another group of Morlocks, as all of them do not get along. Dreamer's group eventually returns to the sewers in an attempt to create a new life for themselves.X-Factor (vol 1) #12 Beautiful Dreamer is one of the 198 mutants who retained their powers after the events of M-Day.X-Men: The 198 Files #1 Beautiful Dreamer was one of the mutants who heard Cyclops's psychic call to come to San Francisco and was going there, but she was captured by Bastion's Purifiers and injected with the Legacy Virus. She was delivered by the Leper Queen to a Friends of Humanity anti-mutant rally held in Iowa, where the virus activated her powers to the extreme, killing all of the people attending the rally by making their brains \\"forget\\" to pump their hearts; she eventually died as well because of the virus.As revealed in X-Force (vol. 2) #12 ==Powers and abilities== Beautiful Dreamer possesses the ability to psionically alter the memories of others using her special \\"dream smoke\\" as a focus. ==In other media== Elena Satine portrays Dreamer in The Gifted * \\"Beautiful Dreamer\\" is played by Elena Satine in Fox's The Gifted series.http://www.cbr.com/the- gifted-trailer-casts-dreamer/ Like her comic book counterpart, she is a mutant with the ability to exhale pink smoke that allows her to read, take or implant memories into the minds of her targets. Her name in this continuity is Sonya Simonson and she is known by the alias \\"Dreamer\\", she is also in a relationship with John Proudstar/Thunderbird. In the episode \\"eXploited\\", she is murdered by rogue scientist Roderick Campbell, who works for Trask Industries. In the episode \\"X-roads\\", Sonya's death is avenged by her best friend, Lorna Dane/Polaris, who utilize her magnetic powers to cause an airplane (that Campbell was in) to crash, killing him. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Characters created by Louise Simonson Category:Comics characters introduced in 1985 Category:Female characters in comics Category:Marvel Comics mutants Category:X-Men supporting characters ","title":"Beautiful Dreamer (Marvel Comics)"},{"id":"2559210","text":"Direcci√≥n Nacional de Inteligencia Estrat√©gica Militar (National Directorate of Strategic Military Intelligence, DNIEM) is an Argentine intelligence agency part of the National Intelligence System, created by the 2001 Intelligence Reform Law 25.520.

Arthur B Alphin from A-Square in 1990, named after writer and hunter Peter Hathaway Capstick. It is based on a .375 H&H; Magnum case blown out and necked to accept a .475 inch (12 mm) bullet. With 500 grain (32 g) bullets, it can achieve 2400 feet per second (730 m/s) muzzle velocity from a 26\\" barrel. ==Overview== Although it is not very flat shooting because of slow velocities, it is flat enough for use out to 250 yards (230 m). It transmits an extreme amount of power at over 6,000 ft¬∑lbf (8,000 J) and is designed for use on dangerous game out to . Like other large cartridges, the high energy performance is accompanied by a large amount of recoil. The Capstick is very similar in dimension to the .470 Ackley, but where the Ackley uses a bullet, the Capstick uses a lighter bullet for a better trajectory. ==The cartridge== The .470 Capstick is a belted magnum with the same rim and belt size as a .375 H&H.; The case has a length of , and the overall cartridge length is . A cartridge drawing is shown below for dimensions. The .470 Capstick will fit in the same length action as the .375 H&H; Magnum and .458 Lott. Actually the .458 Lott is a good measuring stick for the .470 Capstick. The Capstick has a bullet that has 7% more cross sectional area than the .458 Lott, which, in theory, would result in more shock transfer to game and a larger wound channel.. As for powder capacity and velocity, they are similar, with the .470 Capstick having a slight edge in powder capacity and therefore a slight edge in theoretical velocity. However, for field use the .470 Capstick and .458 Lott should have identical performance because the differences between them are rather small. That being said, the differences in field results between the .458 Winchester Magnum and the .470 Nitro Express should be nonexistent, because both push a bullet at But some people have noted an observable difference in the way shot game behaves with those two cartridges, possibly due to the greater cross sectional area of the .474‚Äù bullet. If desired, the .470 Capstick can be used to create a ballistic twin to the .470 Nitro Express, pushing a bullet at while generating low pressure. For those who remember the .475 Ackley, it is similar to the .470 Capstick, except that the Capstick has a ghost shoulder which allows the cartridge to achieve excellent accuracy. Use of a ghost shoulder, rather than a continuous taper on the case wall, helps the cartridge to line up concentrically with the bore axis, contributing to accuracy. Although it is possible to use bullets in the .470 Capstick cartridge, the powder capacity is not sufficient to push at anything near without high pressure, so this is not the best bullet weight for the Capstick. bullets seem to be the best all- around compromise. With full power loads, recoil is significant but not difficult to control or become accustomed to. Recoil from the cast lead bullet load shown below is almost nonexistent. For plinking or light game hunting, pistol bullets are a candidate, but they generate almost as much recoil as bullets. The advantage of bullets is that they are inexpensive and will open up quickly on light game. In my rifle they also tend to hit at least higher than the bullets, creating an inconvenience for the hunter who wishes to use both bullets on the same hunting excursion. ==The rifles== Currently factory rifles in .470 Capstick are available from A-Square, from the Winchester Custom Shop and from Fuchs Fine Guns. However, that short list should not disappoint the reader because there are many options for building a nice custom rifle in .470 Capstick. Any action that can handle the .375 H&H; Magnum is a suitable candidate. The easiest conversion is a CZ550 that came from the factory in .375 H&H; Magnum, .458 Winchester Magnum or .458 Lott. All that has to be done is to replace the barrel with another in .470 Capstick. Barrels are available from Lothar-Walther and Pac-Nor. A 2nd recoil lug must be added to the underside of the barrel and inletted into the forearm of the stock. The 2nd recoil lug will spread recoil that the stock is exposed to, across a wider surface area to avoid splitting the stock. Glass or steel bedding is recommended. Some minor polishing or adjusting of the ramp and rails may be needed, and then the rifle is ready to shoot. The advantage of the CZ550 conversion is that they typically hold 5 rounds in the magazine box plus one in the chamber, and very little work is usually needed to get them to feed. A Winchester Model 70 Classic (claw extractor) can also easily be converted to .470 Capstick. In addition to the steps above, the magazine box spring must also be replaced with one that has a traditional Z-shape instead of the curly-Q style that the factory provides. The Winchester conversion may only hold 2 cartridges in the magazine box, unless you purchase an extra deep magazine box and bottom metal from Sunny Hill, Williams Firearms, Jim Wisner or Ted Blackburn. Use of an extra deep magazine box necessitates replacement of the stock with another stock having greater depth of wood. Alternatively, it may be possible to fit 3 rounds in a model 70 conversion with the factory magazine box if the follower is replaced with one having a lower profile, or if the follower is milled to shorten it. Another option is to rebuild a surplus military Mauser 98 action to be a .470 Capstick dangerous game rifle. This is a very involved project and includes replacing the magazine box/bottom metal, spring and follower and opening up the receiver to match it. Further, some machining of the new magazine box may be needed, since no one makes a magazine box expressly intended to hold 4 rounds of .470 Capstick. Proper feeding is not easy to accomplish and requires a big bore expert. The stepped feed rails plus a modified feed ramp, achieve smooth feeding of flat nosed solid bullets in this rifle. Any of these routes can result in a very functional and very accurate dangerous game rifle. Frankly speaking, there are not a lot of gunsmiths who know how to get a big bore to feed properly, making the CZ550 conversion very attractive because there is so little to do. ==In the field== The .470 Capstick is designed for use as a dangerous game cartridge but it has proven very useful on light game as well. The key is to select a bullet suitable for the game. If a bullet designed for use on cape buffalo is used on whitetails, it undoubtedly will not expand. For light game, Hawk bullets which expand quickly or pistol bullets may be best. When the .470 Capstick is loaded with a bullet to a muzzle velocity of and sighted in high at , it is only about a foot low at , giving it more effective range than many cartridges which are popular for deer and elk hunting. Another consideration in choosing a bullet for hunting is the velocity window of the bullet. For example, the Woodleigh soft point is designed to expand at .470 Nitro Express velocities (2150 fps), and if pushed to the potential of the .470 Capstick, the Woodleigh will tend to expand very quickly and sacrifice penetration. The Woodleigh soft nose was designed to expand at the lower velocities of the .470 Nitro Express, and the fact that it held together at all in the .470 Capstick is testimony to the Woodleigh‚Äôs toughness. Penetration was just over . ==See also== * List of rifle cartridges * 12 mm caliber ==References== * Category:Pistol and rifle cartridges ","title":".470 Capstick"},{"id":"2559238","text":"Mentha requienii, or Corsican mint, is a herb and species of mint, native to Corsica, Sardinia, and mainland Italy, and naturalized in Portugal and in the British Isles. It is a very low-growing species with bright green leaves and a strong minty aroma. ==Description== Corsican mint is one of the smallest members of the mint family. It grows to 3‚Äì10 cm tall, with small oval leaves 2‚Äì7 mm long and tiny mauve flowers in July and August that are insect pollinated. It has a strong aroma of peppermint. ==Distribution== Corsican mint is native to Corsica, Sardinia, France and Italy. It has become naturalised in other parts of the world and is regarded as an invasive species in south eastern United States. ==Use in the garden== Mentha requienii can be used in landscaping as a bedding plant, giving out a desirable mint smell when trodden on. Because it can indeed be walked upon without dying, it is sometimes used to line walkways, growing between stepping stones. Unlike most other cultivated mints, this plant stays diminutive and thrives in shady garden areas. However, if given too much moisture the leaves will rot. The best way to avoid this is to let the plant dry out between waterings, but not too much, because it is drought-sensitive. Baby's tears is used as a substitute in areas where Corsican mint is too fragile. Corsican mint, along with pennyroyal, is thought to be one of the best mints to grow as a companion to brassica plants like broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, et cetera. It repels certain pest insects, in part by obscuring the smell of the crop to be protected, and may also enhance flavor. ==Use in the kitchen== This plant is also used in cuisine, most famously as the flavoring in cr√®me de menthe. It is sometimes said to have a scent similar to pennyroyal. ==Other uses== In traditional medicine this plant has been used as an antiseptic, a carminative and a febrifuge. The smell of mint is disliked by rats and mice and this plant has been used for strewing on the floor to deter rodents. ==References== requienii Category:Flora of Europe Category:Plants described in 1833 Category:Medicinal plants Category:Herbs ","title":"Mentha requienii"},{"id":"2559243","text":"Superman Escape is an Intamin Accelerator Coaster at Warner Bros. Movie World on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. The ride opened on Boxing Day (26 December), 2005. It is the fourth roller coaster in the theme park. It accelerates from 0 to in two seconds. ==History== ===Construction and opening=== By June 2005, construction was well under-way for Superman Escape with the area cleared ready for the ride. The ride caused the removal of the Movie Magic Special Effects Show and the Looney Tunes Musical Revue (the latter of which was relocated to the Show Stage). By August 2005, the launch track was constructed in addition to support for the ride's first element, a top hat. At this time 43 pieces of track still remained to be constructed. During August the top hat was constructed as well as the first of two camel humps. By mid September the second camel hump was constructed. With the roller coaster's construction completed in October, the focus turned to theming and landscaping before the ride's official opening on 26 December 2005. ===Marketing=== During construction the ride was heavily marketed in print, television, radio, online, in-park and outdoor advertising. Warner Bros. Movie World launched teaser campaign entitled 01002. This line referred to the launch: 0 to in 2 seconds. A competition was run to determine who could decipher this code first. In-park advertising consisted of banners which read \\"It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Superman! Launching December 2005.\\". ==Characteristics== Superman Escape is an Accelerator Coaster manufactured by Intamin, a Swiss roller coaster firm. As with all Accelerator Coasters, the ride features a hydraulic launch. ===Trains=== In peak periods, Superman Escape operates with two trains. A single train features five cars, each seating riders in two rows of two. The trains are of an open design and feature over the shoulder restraints. When operating with both trains, the ride's capacity is 820 riders per hour. ===Statistics=== Superman Escape features of track. The initial launch sees riders accelerate from in 2 seconds. The ride reaches a height of with riders experiencing 3.2 times the force of gravity. A single cycle of the ride takes approximately 1 minute and 40 seconds. ===Theme=== As the name suggests, Superman Escape is themed after DC Comics' Superman character. The ride is located within a superhero hub at Warner Bros. Movie World which encompasses a variety of rides including Arkham Asylum ‚Äì Shock Therapy, Batwing Spaceshot, Green Lantern Coaster, and Justice League: Alien Invasion 3D. The theming in the show building prior to Superman Escape's launch was developed by local Gold Coast firm, FX Illusions. ==Ride experience== An overview of Superman Escape from inside the ride's footprint. The ride starts in a MRT (Metropolis Rapid Transit) subway station. Warnings of tremors make it essential to move to the next station. This move is done via a typical tire drive system. Many special effects follow such as gas mains bursting, a pumping station blowing resulting in a flood and collapsing walls. Then a blue streak is seen followed by Superman saying \\"Don't worry folks, there's only one way out of this mess. Heads back. I'll push you out of here. Fast. Superman fast.\\" This line is followed by the main launch. The train launches up the ride's top hat, followed by a heavily banked turn to the right. The train then speeds up and over the first camel hump before briefly entering the second story of the ride's station building for a sharp left hand turn. Upon exiting the building riders enter the second camel hump, which creates a headchopper effect with the first. The third banked turn wraps in parallel to the first, but crosses over it and into the brake run. At this point riders will hear John Williams' famous score from Superman. There was a gift shop after the ride where people could buy Superman merchandise and on- ride photos, however this has been replaced by automated photo booths where riders can save the photos and have them printed at the Photo Booth in the park. ==Awards== ==See also== *Warner Bros.

From 1870 he studied in Prussian gymnasia in Inowrazlaw (Inowroc≈Çaw), Posen (Pozna≈Ñ), Oppeln (Opole), Ratibor (Racib√≥rz), and in 1884 graduated from Saint Mary Magdalene Gymnasium in Pozna≈Ñ. He studied philosophy and literature in German universities in Leipzig and Breslau. During his studies he began having articles and poetry published, working with various Polish magazines. For his activities in socialist circles he was twice arrested by Prussian police and spent half a year in prison. After his release from prison, at the age of 28 Kasprowicz moved to Lw√≥w, where he spent the next 35 years of his life. He worked as a journalist and critic of literature and theatre, working for two years in the editorial department of the newspaper, the Polish Courier (Kurier Polski) and for the following four years (1902‚Äì1906) editorializing for the newspaper, the Polish Word (S≈Çowo Polskie). At the same time, with unusual productivity, Kasprowicz wrote and had published his own works and poetry, to critical acclaim. In 1904 he received a doctorate from Lw√≥w University for his treatise, the Lyrics of Teofil Lenartowicz (Liryka Teofila Lenartowicza). In 1909 at Lw√≥w University he became the head of the Department of Comparative Literature, a department founded for him to run. The largely self-taught Kasprowicz mastered the classical Latin and Greek languages, as well as French and English. His works included critically acclaimed translations of great literary works: * Greek (Aeschylus, Euripides) * English (Shakespeare, Marlowe, Lord Byron, Shelley, Keats, Tagore, Swinburne, Wilde, among others) * German (Goethe, Schiller) * French (Vauvenargues, Bertrand, Rimbaud, Maeterlinck) * Italian (d'Annunzio) * Norwegian (Ibsen) * Dutch (Heijermans) Nature gifted Kasprowicz with good health and a strong constitution. Stanis≈Çaw Lem wrote of him: \\"He had in his bearing the originality of a gypsy and the hustle of a journalist, which, over time, allowed him to earn the money he needed, gave him the good humour of a friend, and - even then - a professorial gravity.\\" He was - with a notable group of friends - a frequent guest at the pubs and wineries of Lw√≥w, especially the famous winery and wine bar of Stadtmueller still present at the market, number 34. His first marriage -- to Teodozja Szyma≈Ñska in 1886 -- dissolved after a few months. In 1893 he married Jadwiga GƒÖsowska. In 1899 she dramatically left him and their daughters for the writer Stanis≈Çaw Przybyszewski. In 1911, he was married again, this time to the much younger Maria Bunin, a Russian girl whom he met on a train from Rome to Naples while on one of his artistic travels. She was the daughter of the Tsarist general, Victor Bunin. In 1921-22 he was rector of Lw√≥w University. In the last twenty years of his life, Kasprowicz more and more frequently visited the Tatra Mountains. In 1923 he permanently settled in the villa, \\"Harenda\\", between Poronin and Zakopane, where he died on 1 August 1926. ==Works== * (1889) Poezje (Poems) * (1890) Chrystus (Christ) * (1891) Z ch≈Çopskiego zagonu (From Rustic Field) * (1894) Anima lachrymans i inne nowe poezje (Anima lachrymans and another new poems) * (1895) Mi≈Ço≈õƒá (The Love) * (1898) Krzak dzikiej r√≥≈ºy (The Briar's Bush) * (1901) GinƒÖcemu ≈õwiatu (To The Perishing World) * (1902) Salve Regina * (1908) Ballada o s≈Çoneczniku (The Ballad About Sunflower) * (1911) Chwile (Moments) * (1916) Ksiƒôga ubogich (The Book of The Poor) * (1921) Hymny (The Hymnal) ==Further reading== * Mortkowicz-Olczakowa, Hanna (1961).

It is slow-growing, evergreen to deciduous, and dioecious, with flowers that are wind-pollinated. It is native to southeastern Africa and Madagascar, where it generally occurs gregariously on rocky hillsides, particularly in hot and dry situations. It produces a hard, durable wood which is of economic interest. Its specific name commemorates W. H. Johnson, a 19th- century Director of Agriculture in Mozambique. Four related species which are native to Madagascar, are usually placed in genus Stachyandra. ==Uses== Its timber is of economical interest. The wood is extremely hard and durable. It is widely exploited in southern Mozambique, where it is known as simbirre. Here it is used for flooring, for which it is well-suited, and is commonly traded for pillars of huts and fences. South African tourist operators in Mozambique used it extensively for building structures near or in sea water. It is also traded as mecruss√© in Mozambique, but rarely so, presumably due to a lack of supply. ==Range and habitat== Within southern Africa, it occurs in Limpopo Province, Mpumalanga and Swaziland. It is commonly found at altitudes up to 1000 m. It forms dense shrub-like thickets and thrives in hot and dry climates with well drained soils, especially on rocky hillsides or along seasonal watercourses. ==Description== It is described as a medium-sized, evergreen tree growing up to 20 m high. It is characterised by a rough bark with a whitish, woolly, hair like covering on the new growth. The leaf blades are 3‚Äì9 √ó 2‚Äì7 cm and are oppositely paired at right angles. They are ovate to heart-shaped with both the apex and base rounded. The upper surfaces are shiny and are a green to blue-green color, beneath the surface is covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. ==Flowers== Flowering time is October‚ÄìNovember. Flowers axillary, unisexual and vary in both arrangement and appearance. Male flowers are yellow and are arranged in a 3-flower cluster up to 3 cm long. Central flowers are longer than the laterals with their pedicel being 1‚Äì1.3 cm long versus the lateral length of 5‚Äì6 mm. Sepals; greenish petals that the form the calyx of the flower differ in number; 5 in central flower and 2-3 in laterals. The bulbous base or receptacle of flower from which its organs grow are 2 cm long in central; 1.5 cm in laterals. Stamens up to c. 50 in central c. 35 in lateral, filaments of lowest stamens up to 1 mm long, anthers 3 x 0.5 mm covered in fine silky hairs in early development and then smooth, lacking hairs with maturation. Yellowish thecae of anthers. Female flowers are yellow and are at the end of a long, white hairy stalk. Pedicels are 1‚Äì1.5 cm long, extending to up to 3 cm long in fruit; sepals 7‚Äì8 √ó 2‚Äì2.5 mm and are an ovate- leaf shape, blunt tapering or sometimes split at apex, minutely ruffled with fine hairs on edge and base; otherwise smooth. Ovary is c. 3 mm in diameter, oval in shape, densely covered in fine white woolly hairs. Styles c. 7 mm long with fine hair covering, stigmas are globe shaped. ==Fruit== The fruit is bright green at first and ripens to a light yellow or reddish brown and is covered in fine bristle-like hairs. It is a 3-lobed capsule, 8‚Äì10 x 12‚Äì13 mm in size, and is easy to detach. The seeds are chestnut brown in colour, with a long, shallow, linear ridge.

The museum's collection contains more than 19,595 items, including 150 aircraft, and material from as far back as the 16th Century. Also displayed are more modern air and spacecraft, including the prototype for Concorde, and Swiss and Soviet rockets. The museum also has the only known remaining piece ‚Äî the jettisoned main landing gear ‚Äî of the L'Oiseau Blanc (The White Bird), the 1927 aircraft which attempted to make the first Transatlantic crossing from Paris to New York. On May 8, 1927, Charles Nungesser and Fran√ßois Coli aboard L'Oiseau blanc, a 450-hp Lorraine- powered Levasseur biplane took off from Le Bourget. The aircraft jettisoned its main landing gear (which is stored at the museum), which it was designed to do as part of its trans-Atlantic flight profile, but then disappeared over the Atlantic, only two weeks before Lindbergh's monoplane completed its successful non-stop trans-Atlantic flight to Le Bourget from the United States.

Retrieved 1 February 2010.Spencer et al, (2007) Wemyss, Kathy entry. Retrieved 1 February 2010. ==Biography== Wemyss was classically trained, due to her Salvation Army upbringing, but in the 1980s and 1990s performed in post punk and rock bands, playing live gigs in inner Sydney. Her groups include, Wet Taxis (1986‚Äì1988), Kings of the World (1988‚Äì1989), Chad's Tree (1989), The Jackson Code (1989‚Äì1990), Pressed Meat & The Smallgoods (1990) and The Blackeyed Susans (1991). For a rock musician she brought an unusual combination of talents - a classically trained voice; playing the trumpet (her signature instrument); the castanets; and more conventionally, the acoustic guitar. Her talent as a brass player led her to be invited to play with Midnight Oil on tour in the late 1980s. During the 1990s she was an integral member of The Jackson Code to which she brought all the talents mentioned above, along with her skills as songwriter. Her association with Midnight Oil was briefly revived when she was invited to play with them at the opening ceremony of the Sydney Olympics in 2000. In the early 2000s, she formed her own band called Wemo, for which she composed and sang all the material. Throughout this time she maintained an interest in the indigenous music and culture of the Torres Strait Islands. She became active in academic circles, completing a post-graduate degree at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music which combined her interests in music education, indigenous music and brass instruments. Her interest in the Torres Strait Islands finally led her to resettle there permanently in 2004. ==References== ;General * Note: Archived [on-line] copy has limited functionality. * Note: [on-line] version established at White Room Electronic Publishing Pty Ltd in 2007 and was expanded from the 2002 edition. ;Specific Category:Living people Category:Australian trumpeters Category:Australian violinists Category:People from Perth, Western Australia Category:Sydney Conservatorium of Music alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:21st-century trumpeters Category:20th-century trumpeters Category:21st-century violinists Category:20th-century violinists Category:21st-century Australian singers Category:20th-century Australian singers Category:21st-century Australian women singers Category:20th-century Australian women singers ","title":"Kathy Wemyss"},{"id":"2559322","text":"Bigga can refer to the following: ==Places== * Bigga, New South Wales, a village in Australia * Bigga, Shetland, an island in Scotland ==Organisations== * B.I.G.G.A. - British and International Golf Greenkeepers Association ==See also== * Biggar (disambiguation) ","title":"Bigga"},{"id":"2559332","text":"The Cornell Lab of Ornithology is a member-supported unit of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York which studies birds and other wildlife. It is housed in the Imogene Powers Johnson Center for Birds and Biodiversity in Sapsucker Woods Sanctuary. Approximately 250 scientists, professors, staff, and students work in a variety of programs devoted to the Lab's mission: interpreting and conserving the Earth's biological diversity through research, education, and citizen science focused on birds. Work at the Lab is supported primarily by its 75,000 members. The Cornell Lab publishes books under the Cornell Lab Publishing Group, a quarterly publication, Living Bird magazine, and a monthly electronic newsletter. It manages numerous citizen-science projects and websites, including the Webby Award-winning All About Birds.http://www.allaboutbirds.org ==History== The Cornell Lab of Ornithology was founded by Arthur A. \\"Doc\\" Allen who lobbied for creation of the country's first graduate program in ornithology, established at Cornell University in 1915. Initially, the Lab of Ornithology was housed in the university's entomology and limnology department.For the Birds , by Randolph Scott Little, 2003 Birder/businessman Lyman Stuart, donors, and landowners purchased or donated farmland in 1954 which was set aside for the sanctuary. Stuart helped finance the construction of the first Lab building in 1957. Lab founder Arthur Allen, with colleagues Louis Agassiz Fuertes, James Gutsell, and Francis Harper, had dubbed the area Sapsucker Woods after discovering the first breeding yellow-bellied sapsucker ever reported in the Cayuga Lake Basin. This woodpecker is now common in the area and is part of the Cornell Lab's logo. Today the Cornell Lab of Ornithology is housed in the Imogene Powers Johnson Center for Birds and Biodiversity which opened in summer 2003. ==Building and grounds== The Visitors' Center entrance hall with the observatory on the left The Sapsucker Woods Sanctuary contains more than four miles (6 km) of trails taking visitors around Sapsucker Pond, on boardwalks, through wetlands and forest. More than 230 species of birds have been recorded in the sanctuary. Approximately 55,000 people visit the sanctuary and public areas of the Cornell Lab each year. The Visitor Center is open daily from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. ==Organization== The Lab is an administrative unit within Cornell University. It has a separate 30-member Administrative Board that is appointed by the Cornell Board of Trustees. As of fiscal year 2010, the Lab has an annual budget of $20.5 million and income of $21.9 million. It has 18 senior staff, which includes eight holding Cornell faculty appointments. ==Citizen science== Collecting the observations of everyday birders for scientific use is a hallmark of the Lab. Bird watchers of all ages and skill levels help gather the data needed to capture the big picture about the distribution and abundance of birds. Nearly 600,000 people participate in the Lab's projects. The eBird database allows birders to track any of the earth's 10,585 bird species to a single scientific database. As of October 2020, almost 47.7 million checklists have been recorded, including observations of 10,511 species. The Cornell Lab's citizen-science projects take place in all seasons and include Project FeederWatch, NestWatch, Celebrate Urban Birds, Birds in Forested Landscapes, CamClickr, and two projects in partnership with the National Audubon Society: eBird and the Great (Global) Backyard Bird Count. The Cornell Lab operates many NestCams which capture live video of nesting birds in the spring. ==Research== Cornell Lab scientists, students, and visiting scholars are carrying on much original research in behavioral ecology, conservation, education, evolutionary biology, information systems, and population genetics. Cornell Lab engineers also develop hardware and software tools used in researching bird and animal communication and patterns of movement. In the Evolutionary Biology laboratory researchers are extracting DNA from living birds or specimens to uncover the relationships among species. In addition to many studies and published papers, the Cornell Lab's Conservation Science Department has produced land managers' guides aimed at conserving dwindling populations of scarlet tanagers, wood thrushes, and other forest birds. The Lab worked with Partners in Flight to identify rapidly declining species and produce the first North American Landbird Conservation Plan. Lab staff also worked with multiple partners to create the first-ever State of the Birds report in March 2009. The Lab's Neotropical Bird Conservation Program is gathering baseline data about bird populations in Mexico, where many North American birds spend their winters, and helping colleagues in other countries with conservation training and resources. The Cornell Lab of Ornithology led the scientific arm of the search for the ivory- billed woodpecker, overseen by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from 2004 to 2009. Lab scientists are currently involved with partners from industry, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations in setting research priorities to better understand the impact of wind power facilities on birds and bats. ==Bioacoustics research== The Lab's Bioacoustics Research Program (BRP) creates remote recording devices used by researchers in projects around the world. These autonomous recording units (ARUs) consist of a hard drive, housing, and microphone array that can be mounted in a forest or anchored to the ocean floor. ARUs have been used in the Elephant Listening Project in Africa, studies of whales, and in the search for the ivory-billed woodpecker. BRP has also developed sound-analysis software programs called Raven and Raven Lite. Engineers are working on programmable radio tags to track birds and other animals for longer periods of time and to follow bird migrations. ==Media archives== From its earliest days, the Cornell Lab has had a special interest in bird and animal sounds. Founder Arthur Allen and his students were pioneers in the field, recording the first bird songs on a film sound track. The Macaulay Library has since expanded and is now the world's premier scientific archive of natural history audio, video, and photographs. The library hosts over 14 million audio, video and photographs .http://macaulaylibrary.org Macaulay Library archivists continue to mount expeditions to collect wildlife sounds, images, and video from around the world to expand the archive. ==Information science== The Information Science unit creates the underlying structure that makes the Cornell Lab's citizen- science projects work. It also converts massive amounts of data into charts, maps, and tables. Computer programmers at the Lab built the infrastructure for the Birds of North America Online and are now coordinating the Avian Knowledge Network, an unprecedented effort to link bird data records kept at institutions all over the Western Hemisphere. As of October 2009, the AKN contained more than 66.5 million records, accessible to anyone. ==Cornell University Museum of Vertebrates== The Cornell University Museum of Vertebrates is also housed in the Johnson Center and holds 1,230,000 specimens of fish, 44,300 amphibians & reptiles, 45,000 birds, 3,200 eggs, and 15,000 mammals some now extinct. Students and scientists use the collections in their studies. ==References== ===Cited=== ===Other=== #Living Bird Magazine, Autumn 2003, ==External links== * Cornell Lab of Ornithology Ornithology Ornithology Category:Biological research institutes Category:Ornithological organizations in the United States Category:Research institutes in the United States Category:Nature centers in New York (state) Category:Tourist attractions in Ithaca, New York Category:1915 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Cornell Lab of Ornithology"},{"id":"2559343","text":"Non-epileptic seizures (NES), also known as non-epileptic events, are paroxysmal events that appear similar to an epileptic seizure but do not involve abnormal, rhythmic discharges of neurons in the brain. Symptoms may include shaking, loss of consciousness, and loss of bladder control. They may or may not be caused by either physiological or psychological conditions. Physiological causes include fainting, sleep disorders, and heart arrhythmias. Psychological causes are known as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Diagnosis may be based on the history of the event and physical examination with support from heart testing and an EEG. ==Terminology== The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) define an epileptic seizure as \\"a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.\\" (Free full text online). Convulsive or non- convulsive seizures can occur in someone who does not have epilepsy ‚Äì as a consequence of head injury, drug overdose, toxins, eclampsia or febrile convulsions. A provoked (or an un-provoked, or an idiopathic) seizure must generally occur twice before a person is diagnosed with epilepsy. When used on its own, the term seizure usually refers to an epileptic seizure. The lay use of this word can also include sudden attacks of illness, loss of control, spasm or stroke. Where the physician is uncertain as to the diagnosis, the medical term paroxysmal event and the lay terms spells, funny turns or attacks may be used. ==Signs and symptoms== *Convulsions *Crying out or making a noise *Stiffening *Jerky, rhythmic or twitching motions *Falling down *Loss of consciousness *Confusion after returning to consciousness *Loss of bladder control *Biting the tongue ==Causes== Possible causes include: *Syncope (fainting) **Reflex anoxic seizures *Breath-holding spells of childhood *Cataplexy *Hyperekplexia, also called startle syndrome *Migraine *Narcolepsy *Non-epileptic myoclonus *Opsoclonus *Parasomnias, including night terrors *Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia *Repetitive or ritualistic behaviours *Tics ==Diagnosis== A wide array of phenomena may or may not resemble epileptic seizures, which may lead to people who do not have epilepsy being misdiagnosed. Indeed, a significant percentage of people initially diagnosed with epilepsy will later heal. In one study, the majority of children referred to a secondary clinic with \\"fits, faints and funny turns\\" did not have epilepsy, with syncope (fainting) as the most common alternative. (Free full text online) In another study, 39% of children referred to a tertiary epilepsy centre did not have epilepsy, with staring episodes in mentally challenged children as the most common alternative. (Free full text online) In adults, the figures are similar, with one study reporting a 26% rate of misdiagnosis.

The museum, which features not only circus artifacts and exhibits, but also hosts daily live circus performances throughout the summer, is owned by the Wisconsin Historical Society and operated by the non-profit Circus World Museum Foundation. The museum was the major participant in the Great Circus Parade held from 1963 to 2009. ==History== Circus World Museum is located in Baraboo, Wisconsin, because Baraboo was home to the Ringling Brothers. It was from Baraboo in 1884 that the Ringling Brothers Circus began their first tour as a circus. Over six seasons, the circus expanded from a wagon show to a railroad show with 225 employees, touring cities across the United States each summer. Baraboo remained the circus's headquarters and wintering grounds until 1918, when the Ringling Brothers Circus combined with the Barnum and Bailey Circus, which the Ringling Brothers had bought out in 1908. The combined entity, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, was successful until 2017 when it took its final bow on Sunday May 21, 2017, in Uniondale, New York. In 1954, John M. Kelley, a former attorney for the Ringling Brothers, incorporated Circus World Museum with the intent of forming a museum of the Ringling Brothers Circus and circus history in general. By this time the popularity of circuses and other live shows was declining in favor of new media, such as television. After an initial period of organization and fundraising, the museum acquired a large site in Baraboo that included the former wintering grounds of the Ringling Brothers Circus. This site was deeded to the State Historical Society of Wisconsin (now called the Wisconsin Historical Society) to be used as the museum's location, and Circus World Museum opened to the public on July 1, 1959. Owned by the Wisconsin Historical Society, the museum sits on some of the land owned by the Ringlings, and includes eight of the ten remaining Ringling buildings on the grounds. Circus World Museum holds one of the largest collections of circus materials in the world, including circus wagons, posters, photography, and artifacts used by shows from all over the United States. The museum also has smaller collections of Wild West shows and carnival materials. ==Exhibits== Office in Ringlingville Wagon on display at Circus World Museum Circus World Museum encompasses several buildings holding numerous exhibits on circus history. Ringlingville consists of the remaining buildings of the original wintering grounds of the Ringling Brothers Circus, a National Historic Landmark. Buildings in Ringlingville include the Ring Barn, Elephant House, Animal House, Baggage Horse Barn, Winter Quarters Office, and Wardrobe Department. Tours of Ringlingville present information on the history of the Ringling Brothers Circus, as well as offering behind the scenes glimpses into the efforts taken by the circus while preparing for shows. The Irvin Feld Exhibit Hall is the museum's largest building, and houses exhibits on the history of the Ringling Brothers Circus, as well as other exhibits relating to general aspects of circuses and circus history. The Hippodrome is a permanent big-top which houses the museum's daily circus and magic show performances. The W.W. Deppe Wagon Pavilion houses a collection of fifty restored antique circus wagons. The C.P. Fox Wagon Restoration Center is used by the museum to refurbish Circus Wagons, and visitors to the building can view in wagon restorations that are in progress. The Robert L. Parkinson Library and Research Center is a research facility holding collections of circus-related books, photographs, archives, and periodicals. The library is open to the public at no charge while staff are present. ==Great Circus Parade== The Great Circus Parade, which featured historic circus wagons from the Circus World Museum, was held in Milwaukee in 1963, and in various cities between 1985 and 2005, primarily Milwaukee (1985‚Äì2003) and Baraboo, Wisconsin (2004‚Äì2005), and Chicago, Illinois. When held in Milwaukee, the parade entailed a two-day journey by train across Wisconsin, from Baraboo to Milwaukee, making brief stops at cities along the way. An encampment on Milwaukee's lake front allowed visitors to view the circus wagons up close, take elephant, camel, and zebra rides, and view historical circus artifacts. The parade itself took a three-mile route through downtown Milwaukee. It was on hiatus during the mid-2000s, but it returned to Milwaukee in 2009. The parade is expected to run every few years in the future. ==See also== *List of National Historic Landmarks in Wisconsin *National Register of Historic Places listings in Sauk County, Wisconsin ==References== ==External links== * Official site Category:Museums in Sauk County, Wisconsin Category:National Historic Landmarks in Wisconsin Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1884 Category:Circus museums in the United States Category:Wisconsin Historical Society Category:Mass media museums in the United States Category:Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus Category:History museums in Wisconsin Category:National Register of Historic Places in Sauk County, Wisconsin Category:Baraboo, Wisconsin ","title":"Circus World Museum"},{"id":"2559363","text":"The Yukon Legislature after the 1996 election.

Her best known work is The Rescuers series about two mice named Bernard and Miss Bianca, which was later adapted in two animated feature films ‚Äì The Rescuers and The Rescuers Down Under ‚Äì by Disney. == Life == Sharp was born in the district of Salisbury in the county of Wiltshire, England, although her family originated from northern Yorkshire. She spent part of her childhood in Malta, a period she later drew on for her novel The Sun in Scorpio.\\"The Sun in Scorpio by Margery Sharp\\", Leaves & Pages, February 5, 2014. In 1914 she returned to Britain and studied at Streatham High School. She read French at Bedford College, University of London. She then spent a year studying art at Westminster Art School. While studying she joined the British University Women's Debating Team and was a member of the first team to compete in the United States. Punch magazine began publishing her stories when she was 21. She went on to write for a number of American and British magazines, including Harper's Bazaar, Ladies' Home Journal and Good Housekeeping. Sharp's first novel, Rhododendron Pie, took her a month to write and was published in 1930. In 1938 she married aeronautical engineer Major Geoffrey Castle. During World War II she worked for three years as an Army Education Lecturer; during this time she wrote the novel Cluny Brown and worked on Britannia Mews, which described the bombing of London. In 1940 her seventh novel, The Nutmeg Tree, was adapted into a Broadway play, The Lady in Waiting. In 1948 the book was adapted into the Hollywood film Julia Misbehaves, starring Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon. One of her most popular novels, Cluny Brown, the story of a plumber's niece turned parlourmaid, was also made into a Hollywood film by Ernst Lubitsch in 1946, with Academy Award winner Jennifer Jones in the title role. The rights for the novel Britannia Mews were bought in 1946 by 20th Century Fox, and it was released as The Forbidden Street in 1949. The 1963 film The Notorious Landlady was based on her 1956 short story \\"The Notorious Tenant\\". In 1959 she published The Rescuers, and though written for an adult audience it became hugely popular with children. Sharp continued the series with a further eight books, illustrated by Garth Williams ‚Äì who had previously illustrated other children's classics such as Charlotte's Web and Stuart Little ‚Äì and Erik Blegvad. In 1977 Walt Disney Productions released the animated feature film The Rescuers, which had critical acclaim and financial success, followed by a sequel, The Rescuers Down Under, in 1990.

According to another source, he was of Hungarian ethnic origin, but the name \\"Hadik\\" is a diminutive from the Slovak appellative had (\\"snake\\"), the family was thus of Slovak extraction. Alternative theories also suggest his Tartar or Cherkess ancestry.In remembrance of Andr√°s Hadik , Military Intelligence Office of Republic of Hungary His father, Mih√°ly Hadik was a cavalryman. His mother, Franciska Hardy had a German background. Andr√°s Hadik volunteered for the Ghil√°nyi Hussar regiment when he was 20, and at 22 he was given the rank of officer and became the standard bearer in the Dessewffy Hussar regiment in the Habsburg army. Hadik fought in the War of the Polish Succession (1733‚Äì1738) and the Austro-Turkish War, 1737-1739. In 1738 Hadik was promoted to the rank of captain. ==Military successes== During the War of the Austrian Succession (1740‚Äì1748) he gained fame for his actions against the Prussians at the city of Neisse (Nysa, now Poland) using surprise attacks and tricks under the unwritten laws of the so-called \\"small war,\\" relying on the excellent training of his light cavalry hussars. During the war he served under Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine and was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. In 1744 he gained the rank of Commanding Colonel of his own hussar regiment, then near the end of the war in 1747 he attained the rank of General and was appointed commander of a cavalry brigade. Early in the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763), Hadik executed the most famous hussar action in history: when the Prussian King Frederick was marching south with his powerful armies, the Hungarian general unexpectedly swung his 5,000 force of mostly hussars around the Prussians and took their capital Berlin. The city was spared for a negotiated ransom of 300,000 thalers, which he distributed among his troops. For this feat, Hadik was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal. He was also awarded the Gro√ükreuz of the Maria Theresia Order. ==Legacy== Slovak National Academy of Defense of Marshal Andrej Had√≠k (2004‚Äì2008) was named after him. * Andr√°s Hadik.

It is a local station on the West Coast Main Line on the stretch between Wigan and . ==History== The railway line between Wigan and was opened by the North Union Railway (NUR) on 31 October 1838, and among the original stations was one at Euxton, close to the Bay Horse public house on the south side of Euxton Lane. The NUR was split up in 1888, part of it (including Euxton station) becoming wholly owned by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). Euxton station closed on 2 September 1895 at the behest of the Anderton Family. A 1913 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing railways around Preston, including Balshaw Lane & Euxton station (bottom right) A new station named Balshaw Lane and Euxton, between and and about south of the original Euxton station, was opened by the LNWR on 2 September 1905. Balshaw Lane & Euxton Station in 1964 Balshaw Lane & Euxton station was closed by British Rail on 6 October 1969 as part of the Beeching review of the UK railway network. Euxton also had a station at the Royal Ordnance Factory site, ROF Chorley, on the Preston to Manchester line which opened along with the factory in the 1930s; the station was named 'ROF Halt' and closed in 1965. As well as this another station on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company's line (Preston to Manchester) was built named 'Euxton Junction' which was near to the Pack Saddle Bridge. Access to this station was via a footbridge from next to today's gastro pub, 'The Railway at Euxton'. However, this station closed in 1895. ==The present station== Services from the former Balshaw Lane and Euxton station restarted on 15 December 1997. It was officially reopened in 1998, (the opening ceremony being performed by former Radio 1 DJ and, latterly, Radio Lancashire presenter and transport enthusiast, Andy Peebles), and was now named Euxton Balshaw Lane. It has two platforms on the slower north/south lines of the West Coast Main Line and is served by Northern Trains with trains to Blackpool North and Liverpool. Euxton Balshaw Lane does not have any full-time staff, PA system or ticket office, nor, unlike Horwich Parkway railway station, a station built around the same period, any clocks or display screens. The use of \\"Balshaw Lane\\" in the station's name was added, at the time of opening, at Lancashire County Council's behest (the main station's sponsor and funder) in view of the possibility, at some future stage, of the opening of a station on the site of the Royal Ordnance Factory at Euxton and to distinguish itself (and avoid a subsequent name change) from that station. It was expected that the station at the ROF site might be named either \\"Euxton\\" or \\"Euxton ROF\\". In fact, when Euxton's other railway station eventually opened in October 2011, on the Manchester-Preston route, it was called . ==Services== The station has a daily hourly service in each direction with 2 trains per hour in the weekday peaks.

In 1849, he joined a 3-man expedition under the command of James Richardson and Heinrich Barth (who later took command after Richardson's death). They set to leave Tripoli in the Spring of 1850 in order to help the British government forge relations with central African kingdoms and explore unknown territory there. They crossed the Sahara carrying a boat on the backs of camels, splitting up in 1851 with Overweg trekking by route of Zinder to Kukawa, rejoining expedition scientist (now leader) Heinrich Barth. After 18 months of exploring the Adamawa Emirate, Benue River, and finally completing his most notable feat of circumnavigating Lake Chad, he died of an unknown illness in Maduari, Chad after swimming in cold waters. Barth and Overweg were close friends. Barth wrote of Overweg's great talents as a scientist and observer, but his lack of discipline in keeping orderly notes, and his youthful disregard for his own safety doomed him to obscurity and an early death in the prime of his youth. ==References== Category:1822 births Category:1852 deaths Category:German explorers of Africa Category:German geologists Category:German astronomers Category:Scientists from Hamburg Category:University of Bonn alumni Category:Humboldt University of Berlin alumni ","title":"Adolf Overweg"},{"id":"2559441","text":"The Statesmen Quartet (also known as Hovie Lister and The Statesmen Quartet) were an American southern gospel music group founded in 1948 by Baptist Minister Hovie Lister. Along with the Blackwood Brothers, the Statesmen Quartet were considered the most successful and influential gospel quartet of the 1950s and 1960s and had a wide influence on artists during that time from the gospel, country, pop, and rock and roll genre. Along with hits spanning many decades, The Statesmen Quartet had many notable successes including being the first Gospel group to receive endorsement deals. Additionally, they made television commercials, appeared on numerous radio and TV shows, and were signed to RCA Victor before launching their own record label, Skylite Records, with The Blackwood Brothers. ==Formation (1948)== The Statesmen Quartet was founded in 1948 in Atlanta, Georgia by Hovie Lister, a Baptist minister and convention-style piano player. Lister constructed the quartet as a hand-picked group of the best singing voices in order to secure a prime time-slot on the new WCON radio station. The initial line-up included Bobby Strickland singing tenor, Mosie Lister singing lead, Bervin Kendrick singing baritone, and Gordon Hill singing bass. The group's name was lifted from the title of a newsletter published by Herman Talmadge, Governor of Georgia, with Talmadge's permission. The quartet made their debut on WCON in Atlanta in October, 1948. ==Broadcasting & recording (1948-1952)== After having several radio programs in the Atlanta, Georgia, area, The Statesmen \\"became the first Southern gospel quartet to have a nationally syndicated TV program, Singing Time in Dixie, sponsored by Nabisco.\\"McNeil, W.K., ed. (2010). Encyclopedia of American Gospel Music. Routledge. . P. 191 The group recorded 36 songs for Capitol Records from 1949 to 1953. They switched to RCA Victor in 1954, recording more than 30 albums during their years with that company. In 1968, they began recording for Skylite. Though most fans were inclined to support the group in terms of religious inspiration and/or entertainment, a 1964 profile of the group in Billboard magazine noted, \\"The Statesmen ... are known as a complex organization to the music industry.\\" In addition to the broadcasting and recording activities already mentioned, the article cited ownership of four gospel music publishing companies that \\"print and distribute song books and sheet music.\\"Billboard. July 25, 1964. Profile: The Statesmen Quartet. P. 26 ==Pinnacle years (1953-1957)== In 1952, The Statesmen Quartet entered into a business partnership with The Blackwood Brothers Quartet. The \\"Stateswood\\" team would dominate Southern Gospel music for the next two decades. Lister's vision of the premiere lineup came to fruition by adding Jake Hess on lead in 1948, James \\"Big Chief\\" Wetherington as bass in 1949, Doy Ott as baritone in 1951, and finally with Denver Crumpler as tenor in 1953, with Lister on piano and master of ceremonies. During the next years, The Statesmen Quartet achieved fame as one of the premiere groups of both Southern gospel and quartet music. With this lineup, The Statesmen began recording for RCA Victor and began starring in the Nabisco Hour national TV show as mentioned above. Popular songs of this period include \\"Get Away Jordan\\" and \\"Happy Rhythm\\". As early as 1950, The Statesmen used the phrase \\"Rockin' and rollin'\\" in a song, and Hovie Lister's frantic boogie-woogie piano, piano bench acrobatics, and hair shaken down in his eyes would have great influence on early rock and roll artists, particularly on Jerry Lee Lewis, who was a fan of gospel music and the Statesmen. On July 4, 1955, the Blackwood/Statesmen team traveled to Texas for an engagement that would feature several secular artists on the same program. Among them was Elvis Presley. Elvis was planning to sing his rock hits, but refrained out of respect of his gospel idols. The Statesmen exerted a powerful influence on young Elvis, who idolized and imitated Jake Hess' vocal styling and Wetherington's movements and gyrations on stage. In an interview with songwriter Bill Gaither, Hess remembered seeing young Elvis coming to Statesmen shows in Tupelo when Presley was only nine or ten. Hess said that the serious young Elvis would ask him, \\"How do you make a record?\\" or \\"How many suits you got?\\" On the Gaither Homecoming video \\"Oh My Glory\\", Hess recalls Presley attending Statesmen concerts and being invited up onstage to sing lead in his place on a couple of handpicked numbers. Phillip Goff, in The Blackwell Companion to Religion in America, provided a description of how The Statesmen began one live appearance. \\"Greeted by thunderous applause, the announcer approaches the microphone: \\"You're listening to the original Wally Fowler All Night Singing, November the sixth, right here in Nashville, Tennessee, nineteen hundred fifty-nine. This is the eleventh anniversary and the greatest crowd that's ever assembled for any program in the Ryman Auditorium is here tonight for the all night sing.\\" Goff's description related but one aspect of The Statesmen's showmanship. Francis Edward Abernathy wrote about lasting changes that the group introduced to the world of gospel quartets: The Statesmen Quartet added flourishes which entertained new audiences -- exuberant singing, arm waving, hand clapping, and electrifying performances. This was alien behavior for traditional convention quartets. But the new behavior attracted interest. The Statesmen became so popular that subsequent gospel quartets imitated their style.Abernathy, Francis Edward, ed. (1993). Corners of Texas. Texas Folklore Society. . P. 276. ==Rosie Rozell era (1958-1973)== In 1957, Crumpler died after seeking medical attention for what was at the time diagnosed as a heart condition, but was revealed to be diabetic shock. Former tenor Cat Freeman came back briefly, but was replaced in 1958 by former Oklahoma police officer Roland \\"Rosie\\" Rozell. The Rozell- Hess-Ott-Wetherington lineup recorded such classics as \\"Faith Unlocks The Door\\" and Rozell's signature songs \\"Oh What A Savior\\" and \\"There's Room at the Cross,\\" both songs becoming gospel music mainstays for decades after. In 1963, Hess left The Statesmen to form his own quartet, Jake Hess and The Imperials. Lister recruited Jack Toney to replace Hess. Before long, Toney's powerful voice helped The Statesmen to press on and continue with their success. Another setback occurred when Wetherington died suddenly of early heart disease on October 3, 1973, while attending the National Quartet Convention in Nashville. It was around this time that the group was losing stability on its own and more changes to the line-up were inevitable. ==Later years (1974-2001)== Later incarnations of The Statesmen would include tenors Sherrill \\"Shaun\\" Nielson, Willie Wynn, and Johnny Cook; lead singers Roy McNeil and Jim Hill; baritones Chris Hess, Biney English and Rick Fair; and bass singers Ray Burdett, Bob Caldwell and Doug Young. Over the years, Jake Hess, Jack Toney, Doy Ott and Rosie Rozell would rejoin The Statesmen at various times, most notably a couple years after Wetherington's death when Lister brought back Rozell, Hess, and Ott as \\"The Statesmen\\" sans bass. A comical pairing of this classic Statesmen \\"trio\\" with longtime Blackwood Brothers/Stamps Quartet bass singer J.D. Sumner at the 1977 National Quartet Convention in Nashville was the birth of the Masters V, which would include Rosie Rozell, Jake Hess, and Hovie Lister in its lineup. The Statesmen would continue to travel with rotating lineups through 1981, and began to tour again from 1992 to 2001, until Lister's health failed. Doy Ott was the first of the original group that had survived Crumpler and Wetherington to die, having suffered a cerebral hemorrhage in 1982 that left him comatose, although he did not die until four years later. Rozell died on February 28, 1995 at the age of 66; Lister died on December 27, 2001, at the age of 75 due to complications of lymphoma, and Hess succumbed to a long battle with heart disease on January 4, 2004 at the age of 76. ==Legacy and cultural impact== The Statesmen influenced both gospel and non-gospel artists alike. Elvis Presley was a fan of the group growing up and wanted to emulate them in his career and got the chance to perform with them. Jerry Lee Lewis also had a strong admiration for the group, but most notably Lister and his piano playing. \\"The Killer\\", as Lewis was called, credited Lister and the Statesman for developing his own style in performance. Carl Perkins and Larry Gatlin also cited themselves as fans of the group, while Tammy Wynette said on numerous occasions that Tenor Denver Crumpler was her \\"favorite singer, ever.\\" The group's appeal to early rock and roll fans also pre-dated the \\"rock around the clock\\" era and also had an influence on early Contemporary Christian Music. In his book They Heard Georgia Singing, former Georgia Governor and Senator Zell Miller said that Lister and his group \\"more than anyone else, put style and flair into gospel music. ... Hovie was first of all a minister, and he ministered with his music,\\" said Sen. Miller. \\"But he used to say religion did not need to have a long face, and he made religion upbeat.\\" Lister defended his musical style that was considered \\"worldly\\" by many churches by retorting \\"If it takes shaking my hair down, beating a piano like Liberace or Piano Red to keep these young people out of beer joints or the rear seats of automobiles, I'll do it. The devil's got his kind of entertainment. We've got ours.\\" The group was elected into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1998 and the Southern Gospel Music Hall of Fame the previous year in 1997. The group permanently folded and retired in 2002. ==Members== ===Line-ups=== { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: width: 375px; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid #E2E2E2;\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" border=\\"1\\" width=\\"99%\\" - ! width=\\"25%\\" valign=\\"top\\" bgcolor=\\"#E7EBEE\\"  1948 (Under the Name \\"The Statesmen\\") ! width=\\"25%\\" valign=\\"top\\" bgcolor=\\"#E7EBEE\\"  1948‚Äì1949 ! width=\\"25%\\" valign=\\"top\\" bgcolor=\\"#E7EBEE\\"  1949 -  valign=\\"top\\"  *Bobby Strickland ‚Äì tenor *Mosie Lister ‚Äì lead *Bervin Kendrick ‚Äì baritone *Gordon Hill ‚Äì bass *Hovie Lister ‚Äì piano, MC, group owner  valign=\\"top\\"  *Bobby Strickland ‚Äì tenor *Jake Hess ‚Äì lead *Bervin Kendrick ‚Äì baritone *Gordon Hill ‚Äì bass *Hovie Lister ‚Äì piano, MC, group owner  valign=\\"top\\"  *Bobby Strickland ‚Äì tenor *Jake Hess ‚Äì lead *Bervin Kendrick ‚Äì baritone *A.D.

The trail forms part of the Trans-Canada Trail, and intersects the Lochside Regional Trail. It is maintained by the Capital Regional District (CRD). The trail is a popular route both for commuting and recreation, including within urban areas of Victoria (Vic West and Burnside- Gorge). It is frequented by people walking, running, cycling, skateboarding and (in places) riding horses. It connects up with many other trails and parks in the area. The trail was created in 1987 on the former right-of-way of the Canadian National Railway, and runs through the communities of Sooke, Metchosin, Colwood, Langford, View Royal, Saanich, and Victoria as well as the unincorporated community of East Sooke. The trail surface is paved between the west terminus (Johnson Street Bridge) to Wale Road in Colwood, approximately 13 km, or one quarter of its total length. It connects to a multi-use path across the bridge and bike lanes along Pandora Avenue. In 1996 two important connecting links were opened. The rebuilt Selkirk Trestle across the Selkirk Water and the Switch Bridge over the Trans-Canada Highway. The trail was named after the local gas-powered passenger car (No. 15813) that ran on the line from 1922 to 1931. However, the name is disputed by the Sooke Region Museum and longtime Sooke residents who say that the term Galloping Goose was not used for the old rail line; it was applied by CRD marketing staff to the trail. Although maps show Leechtown as being the end of the trail, since 2007 this area is restricted as part of the Greater Victoria water supply. In 2010 a warning sign and locked gate greet hikers before the end of the trail. Leechtown is not accessible.

He discovered the ancient Sumerian city of Uruk in 1849. ==Biography== Loftus was brought up in Rye, East Sussex, and went to school at Newcastle Royal Grammar School. In Cambridge, where from 1840 he studied geology, he was a resident of Caius College. In 1845 he married Charlotte Thulbourne. From 1849 he served as geologist and naturalist with the British government's Turco-Persian Boundary Commission, under Colonel Fenwick Williams (Royal Artillery). The work of the mission gave Loftus and his friend Henry Adrian Churchill the chance to visit ancient sites and, in 1850, to excavate for a month at Uruk (Warka) and Larsa (Senkereh), discovering the Ziggurat of Ur. Briefly, in February to April 1851, Loftus was released from the work of the Commission to excavate at Susa on behalf of the British Museum, but was in June replaced by Hormuzd Rassam, together with whom Loftus subsequently explored the sites and collaborated on a report on the work at Susa. He is credited with the discovery of the Apadana, later excavated by the French amateur archaeologist Marcel-Auguste Dieulafoy. Engaged in 1853 by the newly founded Assyrian Excavation Fund to conduct excavations in Warka, Loftus worked at the site from January to April 1854, uncovering the famous coloured clay cone wall and some tablets written in cuneiform script. In October of the same year he transferred to Nineveh, and also worked at Nimrud, where in February 1855 he found the so-called \\"Burnt Palace\\" of the Assyrian king Assurnasirpal II and a hoard of exquisite ivories. In September 1856 Loftus was engaged as assistant geologist to the Geological Survey of India, but in India he suffered declining health and died at sea on the voyage back to Britain, aged 38. ==Works== *Travels and Researches in Chaldaea and Susiana in 1849-52 (1857) *Reports of the Assyrian Excavation Fund I and II, published in R.D.

It was founded by Modibo Adama, a commander of Sheikh Usman dan Fodio, the man who began the Fulani jihad in 1809. The capital was moved several times until it settled in Yola, Nigeria on the banks of the Benue River in Nigeria around 1841. At the time of Adama's death his realm encompassed parts of modern Nigeria and much of north Cameroon. It was technically part of the Sokoto Caliphate, and it had to pay a tribute to the leaders in Sokoto. ==Early history== The Fula first settled in the area in the 14th century.Canby, Courtlandt. The Encyclopedia of Historic Places. (New York: Facts of File Publicantions, 1984) p. 7 The nineteenth century Adamawa emirate lay south of Lake Chad, and east of Hausaland, within latitudes 6¬∞ and 11¬∞ North, and longitudes 10¬∞ and 14¬∞ East. The external limits are hard to fix in exact terms, because it is difficult to distinguish between people who the Fulani subjected to their rule, and those whom they simply raided for slaves, without establishing any form of administrative links. According to some estimates, by the late 19th century, slaves constituted about 50% of the population of the Ful…ìe-ruled Adamawa Emirate, where they were referred to as jeya…ìe (singular jeyado). Based on the region subjected to Fulani rule, the emirate stretched from areas south of the Adamawa plateau near Tibati, in the South, to the Diamare, in the north, from the slopes of the Bamenda-Adamawa- Mandara Highlands in the west, to Baya, Laka, Mundang and Musgum country in the east. Early British administrators reporting from Yola, put the surface area of Adamawa at between 35,000 and 40,000 square miles or between 90,650 and 103,600 square kilometers. As a result of European treaties in 1893 and 1894, parts of the Emirate can today be found in Chad, the Central African Republic, Nigeria and Cameroon, which retained about three-quarter of the total area of the Emirate. The altitude of much of the country lies at around above sea level. The Adamawa plateau itself however, called the Lesdi Hossere by the Fulbe, rises to a general elevation of , and forms the watershed, from which streams of water drain into the Benue river system, as well as into the inland basin of Lake Chad. Great altitudes of between 5,000 and 7,000 ft or between 1,525 and 2,150 meters above sea level are found, towards the western border region of the emirate with other regions of Nigeria and Cameroon, these are sections of the Cameroon-Bamenda-Adamawa-Mandara highland range which have record heights of about above sea level near the coast and steadily decreases northwards, to just around near Yola, the emirate's capital city. North of Yola, these range of highlands is continued by the Mandara Mountains at over , before finally tapering out around Balma, into the lake chad basin. The southern regions of the emirate is characterized by thin forest of broad leaved savannah woodland or orchard vegetation type. The country becomes more and more of open grasslands towards the north. The vegetation was a strong inducement to Fulani settlement in Adamawa, and during the jihad, it offered no serious obstacle to the extension of military power based on cavalry. The earliest Fulbe migrations into Adamawa was from Bornu country, but attempts by Kurt Str√ºmpell, the German colonial administrator at Garoua (1906-1910), to reconstruct routes of migration from oral tradition, reveals that many Fulani entered Adamawa, through Hausaland, as well as the Benue valley. These migrations moved in groups belonging to the same clans or sub-ethnic groups, and the numbers varied considerably, depending on the motives for migration. Some moved for only short distances, while others did so, over very long distances within a few generations. The principal Fulani clans, that entered Adamawa, were the Mbewe or Beweji, Ngara'en or FeroBe, WollarBe, Yillaga, Ba'en, and Kiri'en. Each subgroup claims to have their own peculiar characteristics, but common to all Fulani, are their distinct physical features: fair skin color, aquiline noses, thin lips, straight hair, and their language Fulfulde, which marks them off from the mass of the Sudanic people around them. ==Rulers== Rulers of the Adamawa Emirate, who took the title \\"Baban-Lamido\\": {class= style=\\"text-align:right;\\" - !style=\\"width:9em;\\"Start !!style=\\"width:9em;\\" End !!

It was formed in 1969 through a split in the People's Progressive Party (PPP) in the 1960s. The party was led by Brindley Benn and Victor Downer. Initially the party advocated a violent overthrow of the People's National Congress government, but later shifted to the right and entered into an alliance with pro-capitalist groups. ==Council of Landless People== In 1973, the WPVP supported the Council of Landless People who had attempted to retake ancestral lands that were being encroached upon by the state and the sugar industry. Two thousand people had occupied 200 acres of land. The police evicted them and burned their shacks, triggering a large protest movement. This campaign, backed by a coalition that included the People's Progressive Party, later won a partial victory when the Sugar Producer's Association returned some of the land to the original residents. ==Alliances== WPVP took part in the formation of the Working People's Alliance in 1974.

On 23 April 1995 Jones made his first- grade d√©but in Sydney, coming off bench to score a try in the Warriors' 40‚Äì4 win over the Parramatta Eels. The Warriors' halfback Greg Alexander missed Rounds 10 and 11 through injury which resulted in Jones taking over at halfback. Jones played well enough to retain the position and force Alexander to move to fullback upon his return. He also quickly established his place in the international scene, replacing Gary Freeman as the New Zealand national rugby league team halfback during the 1995 World Cup. Over the next several years Jones cemented his spot in both the Warriors and Kiwis, sticking with the Warriors despite the lack of success on and off the field. Between 1995 and 1999 he played over 100 consecutive first grade games for the Warriors. In 1999 he broke his arm playing for the Kiwis against Tonga, and as a result missed the first half of the 2000 NRL season, breaking his consecutive streak.Test half Jones given the green light to resume playing AAP Sports News, 15 March 2000 At the end of 2000 the Warriors were bankrupt and were sold for the second time in their short history. Jones was the first signing by the new franchise, with owner Eric Watson, and it was his signing that convinced many other players to re-sign with the club. It was under the new management where he first became club captain ‚Äì in 2001 co-captaining with Kevin Campion ‚Äì and although already considered in the top reaches of halfbacks in the NRL, he started to show he was on an equal par with the games' best halfbacks at the time. In the 3-year period 2001-03 he led the Warriors to 3 successive finals appearances. In 2002 the club not only won the Minor Premiership, but also reached the 2002 NRL grand final against the Sydney Roosters. Playing at scrum half back, Jones captained the losing side that evening but scored a great try in which he beat 3 Roosters defenders from 30 metres out to go over from dummy half. He was then selected to go on the 2002 New Zealand rugby league tour of Great Britain and France and won the George Smith Medal as player of the series against Great Britain. Also in 2002, Jones became only the second New Zealand player to win the Golden Boot Award for the best international rugby league player. thumb In his career, he has also represented New Zealand at two World Cups (1995 and 2000), three Tri Nations series (1999, 2005, 2006), and has played 41 games for the New Zealand Kiwis. He retired from the national team in 2004 while having a disappointing year at club level. However, on 15 October 2005 Stacey ended 2 years of international retirement, answering an SOS from Kiwis coach Brian McClennan intending only to play the Australasian section of the Tri Nations series. He then went on to play the rest of their round robin matches against Great Britain in England. Stacey Jones was an integral part of the New Zealand Tri Nations campaign. In the first match, he guided the Kiwis to their first win in Sydney in 50 years before being part of their narrow loss to Australia in Auckland. He set up 4 tries in the first match in England which the Kiwis won by 42‚Äì26. He then missed the fourth Kiwi game, instead returning to New Zealand to be with his wife for the birth of their son. In the 2005 Rugby League Tri-Nations Final, he continually kicked Bombs aimed at the Australian wingers that set up three tries in the Kiwis' 24‚Äì0 victory over Australia. Until then Australia had not lost a series in 27 years. Jones is widely regarded as the best New Zealand player of his generation. In New Zealand he had a video game named after him, Stacey Jones' Rugby League.Kiwi's Check Out Stacey Jones Rugby League Gameplanet, 17 October 2003 He currently still holds the record for most appearances (238 NRL games) and is the second highest try scorer (77) behind Manu Vatuvei (99). ===Les Catalans=== In April 2005 Stacey Jones announced he was leaving the Warriors, then his only professional club to join the new French addition to the Super League for the 2006 season Catalans Dragons. In doing so he became the last foundation member of the Warriors to leave the club. After the 2006 Rugby League Tri-Nations Final it was announced that Jones was retiring from international football however he returned for a final time against a 'Northern Union' side for New Zealand 'All Golds' to celebrate the centenary of New Zealand's national rugby league team who first toured England in 1907. Jones kicked five goals as the 'All Golds' won 25‚Äì18 at Warrington's Halliwell Jones stadium. Jones helped Catalans reach the 2007 Challenge Cup Final. In September 2007 he announced his retirement from the game and left the Dragons. ===Return to New Zealand=== Jones and Awen Guttenbeil coaching the Point Chev Pirates in 2010 Stacey Jones returned home and rejoined the New Zealand Warriors as their kicking coach for the 2008 season. As part of his release from the Dragons he was not allowed to play for any other club during the 2008 season. During the New Zealand 2008 election Jones publicly appeared with then Prime Minister Helen Clark and offered his support to the Labour Party campaign. In November 2008 he played for the All Golds again in New Plymouth against the New Zealand MƒÅori. The game served as both a testimonial to Ruben Wiki and a warm up for the 2008 World Cup. Participating in this game made Jones realise he still wanted to play rugby league. ===Warriors comeback=== On 7 November 2008 it was announced that Stacey Jones had re-signed as a player with the New Zealand Warriors on a one- year contract for 2009. He reportedly signed a contract worth over $220,000. In his March 2009 return game to the NRL, Jones set up two tries and guided his team to a 26‚Äì24 victory over Manly, reaffirming his nickname as \\"The Little General\\".Stacey Jones ignites Warriors‚Äô premiership dream The Roar, 23 March 2009 Despite being predicted to play mostly off the bench in 2009, the early release of incumbent halfback Nathan Fien in June saw Jones thrust into the familiar role of starting playmaker for the Warriors once again. Unfortunately, Jones' early good form did not continue and the Warriors struggled to a disappointing 14th placing on the ladder. In early September Jones announced that his comeback was over and he would not be returning for the 2010 NRL season. ==Coaching career== Jones as part of the Kiwis coaching staff in 2018 Following his retirement from professional rugby league, Jones took up a role as player-coach for the Pt Chev Pirates, alongside Awen Guttenbeil. He later worked as the Auckland Rugby League's Development officer.

Since 2004 it has been linked with Chorley Interchange bus and coach station. It is on the Manchester‚ÄìPreston line. ==History of the station== The current railway station is a modern version from the 1980s that was built on top of the original station. The level of the old platforms can be seen under the existing station's two platforms which are connected by underpass. The initial station was opened on 22 December 1841 by the Bolton and Preston Railway (which later became part of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway) and was subsequently served by the Lancashire Union Railway between St Helens, and from 1869. Passenger trains over this route (between Blackburn & Wigan) were however withdrawn in January 1960. Further work was done in 2016 and 2017 in connection with the electrification of the line between Euxton Junction and Manchester. A level crossing at the south end of the station has been removed. The signal box has been moved to Ribble Steam Railway at Preston . ==Current station facilities== Platform to platform connection is via a stepped subway. Wheelchair users may exit the station and use the sloped public footpath subway (Chorley FP 32) immediately to the south, this emerges at the foot of the Railway Pub, access is then via an entry off Friday Street. There are no toilets on the station and the nearest ones are in the bus station across the road. Chorley's rail services provide a link for the commuters of Lancashire to Preston, Manchester and Bolton. A chargeable railway car park is available to the south of the station. Ticket purchase & collection machines are available, one on Platform 2 (Manchester bound), and two in the ticket office. The ticket office is manned approximately 0630 - 1900. It was announced by the Department for Transport in December 2009, the line between Preston and Manchester, on which Chorley is situated, will be electrified \\"Rail Electrification Gets Green Light\\" The Guardian news article 9 December 2009 which should reduce journey times to Manchester by up to ten minutes.

A rail replacement bus service operated to and from Preston, whilst many trains were diverted via Wigan. This period of disruption was blamed for the decline in passenger usage shown in the figures right. The direct Scottish service had been reduced at the December 2013 timetable change when most trains were diverted via Wigan to join the newly electrified line over Chat Moss.Network Rail - WCML Route Utilisation Strategy Network Rail A small number of peak services still operated via Chorley using Class 185 units thereafter, but these ceased at the December 2014 timetable change.GB eNRT December 2014 Edition, Table 82 First TransPennine Express used to run the service from Manchester Airport to Blackpool North but this was passed on to the new Northern franchise on 1 April 2016.

The subways roofs were also replaced, and both platforms have been rebuilt and extended to accommodate longer trains when the line opens to electric trains. During the rebuild, a temporary platform 1 was installed south of the former level crossing with access from the car park and no passenger trains called at weekends (services again diverted via Wigan). The badly delayed electrification work on the route (now running two years late) has seen further timetable alterations and rail replacement buses at weekends since the May 2018 timetable change. Some northbound trains now terminate at either Buckshaw Parkway or Preston instead of running through to Blackpool, whilst weekend engineering possessions saw buses replacing trains until November 2018.

The depot is constructed fully underground and provides maintenance, stabling and operational facilities for the Circle line. It is located in Hougang, along Upper Paya Lebar Road, and is accessible via Kim Chuan Road. It used to be the first depot in Singapore to serve two independently operated MRT lines, until the adjacent Tai Seng Facility Building, became operational with the revenue operation of the Downtown line Stage 3 on 21 October 2017. ==History== To facilitate the construction of the depot, part of the Kim Chuan Village was acquired in September 2000 for the construction of the depot and the road viaduct. The Kim Chuan Road was permanently closed from Hougang Avenue 3 to Kim Chuan Drive on 27 June 2002. On 25 October 2002, part of the Hougang Avenue 3 was realigned and on 25 November 2002, part of the Kim Chuan Road was closed. The project cost S$297 million to construct and 2.1 million cubic metres of soil had to be excavated for its construction. Touted as the world's biggest underground depot, it officially opened on 4 March 2009, employing 300 staff members. The depot was used for the temporary storage and light maintenance of rolling stock for the Downtown line, before the completion of the Tai Seng Facility Building. It also provided a route in which Downtown line trains can be towed from the depot to its operational line via the Circle line tracks. Once the main depot, Gali Batu Depot was completed with stage 2 of the Downtown line, Kim Chuan Depot simply provides a route for newly delivered Downtown line trains to be transferred in to the Tai Seng Facility Building. == Design == The depot has a capacity to stable 70 trains and covers an area of more than 100,000 square metres, reaching a depth of 24 metres at some points. Specifically, the main depot floor is 800 metres in length, 160 metres in width and 23 metres in height. The facility contains the main operation control centre for the Circle line, maintenance facility, stabling areas, and ancillary facilities such as train wash and workshops. It also houses an automatic storage and retrieval system, a warehouse that stores spare parts for the rolling stocks and other equipments. The depot is connected to the adjacent Tai Seng Facility Building on the east side of the facility and is operated in tandem with the Tai Seng Maintenance Facility. The depot is accessible via an administration building along Kim Chuan Road, containing offices, a warehouse, a canteen and a 66 kilovolt substation is located above the depot. The remaining 3 hectares of land left empty will be used for light industrial use with buildings on it up to 9 storeys high. The depot is located between Tai Seng station and Bartley station on the Circle line and has 4 reception tracks: 2 tracks clockwise- bound towards Tai Seng station and 2 tracks anticlockwise-bound towards Bartley station. ==Extension== Construction site of the extension. On 29 October 2015, LTA announced the extension of Kim Chuan depot in tandem with the Circle line stage 6 extension. The extension called for the depot to be expanded underground to almost double its land area and stabling capacity from 70 to 133 trains. The integrated depot will also house 550 buses on the plot of land above the underground train depot. The Contract 821A for the construction of Kim Chuan Depot extension and its associated facilities was awarded to Woh Hup (Private) Limited at a sum of S$1.21 billion in September 2017. Construction began in 2018, with completion in 2025. The extension will be located along the northern perimeter of the Bartley Road East viaduct, north of the existing depot which is along the southern perimeter of the Bartley Road East viaduct. ==References== ==External links== * LTA page on Kim Chuan Depot * More Information on Kim Chuan Depot (Archived in The Internet Archive) * News article about Kim Chuan Depot from Channel News Asia * PDF Document ‚Äì LTA Technical Visit to Circle Line Underground Depot/Control Centre (Kim Chuan Depot) * Government C830 Project Office ‚Äì Kim Chuan Depot * Government CIRCLE LINE CONTRACT C821/C822 DIVISION (Kim Chuan Depot) * Government Speech/Press Release from Kim Chuan Depot Category:2009 establishments in Singapore Category:Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) depots ","title":"Kim Chuan Depot"},{"id":"2559524","text":"The K100 is a 9√ó19mm semi-automatic pistol designed and built by Grand Power s.r.o. in Slovensk√° ƒΩupƒça, Slovakia located approximately 11 kilometers east of Bansk√° Bystrica, Slovakia which is the region's major city. ==Development== The K100 was developed by Jaroslav Kuracina, a former weapons officer in the Slovak Army. Kuracina sketched drawings of the K100 as early as 1992, but manufacturing activities were highly restricted during the early post- Communist era. Kuracina would be forced to wait until 1996 to continue development of his design. In 2007 Grand Power announced a deal to produce 100,000 units for the U.S. market in partnership with Texas-based handgun manufacturer STI International Inc.STI International - GP6 The first pistols were exported in 2008. They were K100 Mk6 pistols under the commercial name GP 6. ==Design details== The P1 variant. Grand Power MK.12 K100 X-Trim in 9mm The K100 Whisper with threaded barrel and suppressor. Competition-oriented K100 Target. The K100 uses a rare locking system, similar in some ways to the Beretta Cougar, Px4 Storm, and Br√ºgger & Thomet MP9 which employs a rotating barrel lock, which in the K100's case is cammed by a cross pin. When the pistol is fired the barrel and slide move backward together for about 3/8 of an inch while the barrel is cammed clockwise (with respect to the shooter) by a flat, twisting, helical \\"cut\\" in the barrel extension. Once the barrel and slide have moved back to the point where the barrel has twisted about 45¬∞, the slide is free to continue traveling back while the barrel's travel is arrested by its interface to the frame via the barrel extension's square shoulders. On the K100, the Beretta's barrel extension cam cut, and transfer block's cam tooth, are replaced by a curled, twisting cut in the barrel extension, and a round, frame-embedded cross-pin respectively. As such, there is no transfer block (locking block) per se, and the barrel extension directly interfaces with the frame via the replaceable cross-pin. The design allows a low bore axis relative to the shooter's hand and avoids the use of the transfer/locking block typically found in rotating barrel pistols. Both of the Berettas, and the K100, have the archetypal square shouldered lock protruding from the otherwise round barrel, easily visible at the ejection port with the slide fully forward. This square shoulder is rotated in behind a solid column of steel running the length of the slide forward of the ejection port, and on the left side out of view, when the slide and barrel are fully forward in battery. This locks the slide forward in battery. Given that the MP9 uses the same basic locking mechanism, and has a cyclical rate of fire of 900 rounds/min, the rotating barrel lock has shown itself to be capable of very fast lock times. The thick walled barrel and other metal parts are treated by Tenifer QPQ technology. This hardens the metal components and increases resistance to corrosion. The standard K100 has a barrel length of and operates in both single- and double-action mode. The hammer must be manually decocked for carry in double-action mode with a chambered round. The safety can be applied with the hammer cocked, but can not be applied with the hammer in the forward position. The safety does not lock the slide. A decocking hammer group is available as an option on many models. The ergonomically shaped polymer grip frame houses a steel receiver which provides the rails the slide travels on as well as hardpoints required for the trigger mechanism. The slide spring guide, safety, trigger, and trigger guard are polymer. The pistol's toothy surface, and grooved grips, provide good grip even with wet hands. The K100 also features ambidextrous controls, supporting both left and right-handed users. Current production Grand Power pistols use a solid trigger guard and a new take down lever. They also have 4 user interchangeable grip backstraps to accommodate various hand shapes and sizes; this feature permits most shooters a comfortable and efficient grip on the firearm. ==Additional models== K22S/K22 X-Trim - Two .22lr versions of the K100. The K22S has fixed sights, and the K22 X-Trim has adjustable sights. Both are manufactured on the same steel chassis and grip of the center-fire models, and have steel not zinc alloy slides. They are stand alone firearms, and not conversion kits. Using a direct blowback system rather than the rotary lock up, the rimfire barrels are dovetailed and pinned into the steel chassis. P1 - 93 mm barrel and matching slide using the same frame. P1S - 93 mm barrel and matching slide using the subcompact P11 frame/grip. P1 Ultra - scalloped slide and exposed 93 mm barrel using the same frame. 40 g lighter than the P1. P11 - 85 mm barrel and matching slide with subcompact frame/grip and 12-round magazine. P9M - 93 mm barrel chambered in 9mm Makarov and matching slide using the same frame. X-Trim - A sporting version of the K100 with a scalloped slide and tighter fit. Target - An adjustable-sight version of the K100 featuring a micrometric adjustable rear and fiber optic front sight. X-Calibur - For 2012, a new model with a longer fluted bull barrel and scalloped slide was introduced. Felt recoil and front sight lift is noticeably reduced. P40/P45 - For 2013, a new larger grip frame sized to fit the .45 ACP cartridge was introduced. The P40 is chambered in .40 S&W;, 10mm Auto and .357 SIG. The P45 is chambered in .45 ACP. Using the same rotary locking barrel system, and the same 108 mm barrel length, the larger-caliber guns use many of the same proven components of the 9mm models. P40L/P45L - For 2014, a 127mm/5-inch barrel and corresponding slide model was added to the larger caliber line up. The P40L is chambered in .40 S&W;, 10mm Auto and .357 SIG. Q100 - A striker fired version of the K100 intended primarily for armed forces and self-defense. The Q100 has a 108mm barrel and the same modular grip as the K100. The initial version will be in 9x19. Q1/Q1S - A shorter slide and barrel than the Q100, either on the standard full sized grip (Q1) or combined with the subcompact grip shared with the P11 and P1S (Q1S). ==References== ==External links== * Grandpower Homepage * Instruction manual * Modern Firearms * Review of the STI GP6 (K100) from American Rifleman Category:Military of Slovakia Category:9mm Parabellum semi- automatic pistols ","title":"Grand Power K100"},{"id":"2559528","text":"Bishan Depot (Simplified Chinese: Á¢ßÂ±±ËΩ¶ÂéÇ; Traditional Chinese: Á¢ßÂ±±ËªäÂª†) is a depot located on the Mass Rapid Transit in Bishan, Singapore. It was completed in 1987 by American architect Vikas M. Gore and the 12,000 square metres maintenance area at cost of S$300 million. The depot comprises a storage yard with a capacity of 59 trains and has an area of 300,000 m¬≤. The depot also houses a central maintenance facility with train overhaul facilities for trains on the North South Line operated by SMRT. Bishan depot previously provided maintenance work for the East West Line too, prior to the opening of the Tuas Depot. It also acts as a training centre for newly recruited staff, and is where the faregate operation department is located. The depot is located between Ang Mo Kio station and Bishan station on the North South Line and has 3 reception tracks: 2 tracks northbound towards Ang Mo Kio station and 1 track southbound towards Bishan station. ==Installation and Upgrading Shed== The rolling stock workshop and Tracks 10-12, built enclosed are where various programmes are conducted. Only five trains can undergo installation works during each 3- to 18-week period. *Refurbishment of C151 sets (from 2006 to 2008 as well as 2010 to 2013), prior to the opening of Pioneer and Joo Koon, there are 94 trains in service at each time. It was increased to 96 in 2010, and finally to 106 in 2012. *Upgrading the signalling system (from 2014 to 2016) in all trains. It had increased the total cohort to 120 in 2014. With the new CBTC signalling system in place, 3 C651s were withdrawn from service and the whole of C651 refurbishment was scrapped. The majority of the C151Bs and all of the C151Cs were here. ==History== Nishimatsu-Lum Chang Joint Venture had won the contract 101 on 8 September 1984. On 4 July 1985, there was a MRT mishap where four workers were trapped within 15 minutes.15-minute scare for four trapped in MRT mishap The MRT had built rail tracks for testing trains in 1986 - 1987. On 11 February 2007, SMRT Organised the SMRT Cram Jam! cum Learning Journey and Charity Bazaar to raise funds for the SMRT Silver Tribute Fund. The Cram Jam took place in the morning seeking an entry into the Singapore Book of Records by cramming people inside a standard Kawasaki C151 car (car used: 2027), a Mercedes O405G Hispano Habit bus (bus registered: TIB1202K) and a Ssangyong Rodius/Stavic MPV cab. The Singapore Police Force crammed 550 officers inside the train car, 235 staff from SMRT were crammed inside the bus and 44 Girl Guides Singapore cadets crammed themselves into the cab. Games, carnival food and a 90-minute tour around the Bishan Depot were organised. A C751B MRT train was vandalised in an apparent security breach at Bishan Depot on 17 August 2011. The train was then put into service before the vandalism was discovered. The Land Transport Authority subsequently fined SMRT S$200,000 for failing to detect, in a timely manner, the graffiti on the train. On 15 July 2016, local and Australian media reported that between April and July 2015, two Americans Jim Harper and Danielle Bremner, posted a series of vandalism videos online under the pseudonyms Utah and Ether, with one video showing them committing the act at Bishan depot. Harper was arrested and jailed 6-months in May in Melbourne, Australia, while his partner is on the run. Another incident of a MRT train being vandalized happened on a C151A set on 5 May 2014. Police reports were made in the early hours of the morning when trains were being dispatched from the depot. A third case of vandalism took place on 8 November 2014 when two Germans, Andreas Von Knorre and Elton Hinz, spraypainted a cabin on a C151 train after breaking into the depot.

He moved to Virginia sometime between 1669 and 1673, and married Mary Isham (ca. 1659 ‚Äì 29 December 1735) a few years later.Emory G. Evans, A \\"Topping People\\": The Rise and Decline of Virginia's Old Political Elite, 1680‚Äì1790 (2009), pp. 18‚Äì19 His descendants include many prominent individuals including Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall, Paschal Beverly Randolph, Robert E. Lee, Peyton Randolph, Edmund Randolph, John Randolph of Roanoke, George W. Randolph, and Edmund Ruffin. Due to his and Mary's many progeny and marital alliances, they have been referred to as \\"the Adam and Eve of Virginia\\". ==Early years== William Randolph was baptized in Moreton Morrell, Warwickshire, England on 7 November 1650. He was the son of Richard Randolph (1620 ‚Äì ca. 1671) and Elizabeth Ryland (1625‚Äìca. 1669) of Warwickshire. Richard Randolph was originally from Little Houghton (also called Houghton Parva), a small village east of Northampton, where Richard Randolph's father, William, was a \\"steward and servant\\" to Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche (1556‚Äì1625), having previously served in that same capacity to Sir George Goring, a landowner in Sussex.Louis A. Knafla, 'Zouche, Edward la, eleventh Baron Zouche (1556‚Äì1625)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004); W. H. Kelliher, 'Randolph, Thomas (bap. 1605, d. 1635)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004) William was the fourth of seven Randolph children. Richard and Elizabeth moved to Warwickshire before the birth of their first child in Moreton Morrell in 1647. They lived within the \\"heart of Parliamentarian Warwickshire\\" throughout the end of the English Civil Wars. His family were among the Cavaliers who supported the king. In 1657, the last of their children was born in Moreton Morrell. The same year, Elizabeth's father was buried there. Then, the family moved to Dublin. His mother died there around 1669 and his father about two years later.\\"Visitation of Northampton 1681,\\" Publications of the Harleian Society 87 (1935), pp. 173‚Äì77 William's uncle, Henry Randolph (1623‚Äì1673), traveled to England and Ireland from Virginia in 1669, and sponsored William to emigrate to Colonial Virginia.Eckenrode, H.J. 1946., p. 31 He arrived without money and an axe. He arrived in an area replete with others whose families had also supported the king during the Civil War. His family had long been members of the court. William Randolph was in the colony by 12 February 1672 when he appears in the record as witness to a land transaction. ==Career== Coat of Arms of William Randolph The Chesapeake economy was centered around tobacco, grown within the English mercantile system for export to markets in Britain and Europe. Indentured servants and slaves supported the tobacco industry at that time. By 1674 Randolph imported 12 persons into the colony and thereby earned his first land patent. Over the course of his life, he imported 168 slaves and indentured servants to Virginia. In later years Randolph became a merchant and a planter, and co-owned several ships used to transport tobacco to England and goods back to Virginia. He established several of his sons as merchants and ship captains. He trained as a lawyer and was a partner with Peter Perry and Edward Hill, Jr. in the law firm Hill, Perry & Randolph in the 1680s. He held multiple official appointments.Malone, Dumas (Ed.). 1963., p. 372 At the local level, he became clerk of Henrico County Court in 1673 and held the position until he was asked to serve as a justice of the peace in 1683. He also served as sheriff and coroner.Kukla, Jon. 1981., p. 100 Randolph represented Henrico County in every assembly of the House of Burgesses from 1684 to 1698, was Speaker of the House of Burgesses in 1698, and was the Clerk of the House from 1699 to 1702. He fell ill in August 1702 and his son, William, took his place. Randolph resigned the clerkship completely in March 1703.Kukla, Jon. 1981., p.102 Randolph was a founder and one of the first trustees of the College of William & Mary. Randolph was a friend of William Byrd, and he served as an advisor to Byrd's sons during their political careers. He is mentioned in one of Byrd's diaries as \\"Colonel Randolph\\", his militia title. ==Property== Randolph was the founder of a dynasty of individuals who shaped commerce and governmental administration for years. They were \\"one of the most numerous and wealthiest\\" of the \\"first families\\" of the colony. Between Randolph and his heirs, they acquired tens of thousands of acres, including establishment of eleven large neighboring plantations that were worked by hundreds of slaves. ===Turkey Island=== Randolph acquired property by purchase, headright, marital interest and land grant. His early acquisitions were in the neighborhood of Turkey Island, located in the James River about 20 miles (32 km) southeast of present-day Richmond. Randolph began living at the Turkey Hill estate, which included the island and surrounding area, in 1670. That residence no longer exists. William Randolph's residence overlooked Turkey Island, and he is buried near the site of the house. Randolph's Turkey Island estate became the seat of the Randolph family. ===Curles Neck Plantation=== In 1676 a Virginia colonist, Nathaniel Bacon, rebelled unsuccessfully against the colonial government and his estate was forfeited. This was Curles, located near Turkey Island. Randolph made an assessment of the property for Governor Berkeley and was allowed to buy it for his estimated price, adding to Randolph's previous land holdings.Eckenrode, H.J. 1946., pp. 38‚Äì39 ===Tuckahoe and Dungeness=== Around 1700, when Randolph's political career was at its peak, he received land grants to almost of newly opened land near Richmond; a tract at Tuckahoe Creek and a plot at Westham. This land became the basis of the Tuckahoe and Dungeness Plantations, which were later founded by two of William Randolph's sons. ==Marriage and children== Mary Isham Randolph Randolph married a relatively wealthy widow, Mary Isham, around 1676. Her father was Henry Isham of Northamptonshire. Her father and mother, Katherine Banks, settled in Henrico County, Virginia within the Bermuda Hundred, which was across the river from Randolph's Turkey Island estate. William Randolph had nine children who survived into adulthood: *William Randolph II (born November 1681) married Elizabeth Beverley (the daughter of Peter Beverley, a Speaker of the House of Burgesses and Treasurer of Virginia) around 1705 and had five children who lived to adulthood. He was the grandfather of Beverley Randolph, the eighth Governor of Virginia. and Ann Bolling Randolph Fitzhugh. *Thomas Randolph of Tuckahoe (born ~June 1683) married Judith Churchill and/or Judith Fleming between 1705 and 1712. He was the great-grandfather of John Marshall, as well as the great-great-grandfather of Ann Cary (Nancy) Randolph, who married Gouverneur Morris, and her brother Thomas Mann Randolph Jr., who married Thomas Jefferson's daughter, Martha. *Isham Randolph of Dungeness (born December 1684) married Jane Rogers in 1717 and had nine children, including Jane Randolph (who married Peter Jefferson and was the mother of Thomas Jefferson), Mary Randolph (who was the mother of Charles Lilburn Lewis and grandmother of Isham and Lilburn Lewis), Ann Randolph (who was the mother of James Pleasants Jr., the 22nd Governor of Virginia), and Susannah Randolph (who married Carter Henry Harrison I and was the great-grandmother of Carter Henry Harrison III and great-great-grandmother of Carter Henry Harrison IV) ‚Äì both five-time mayors of Chicago. *Richard Randolph (born ~May 1686) married Jane Bolling, a descendant of Pocahontas, around 1714. He was the grandfather of the colorful Congressman John Randolph of Roanoke. *Henry Randolph (born ~October 1687) did not marry. *Sir John Randolph (born ~April 1689) married Susanna Beverley (another daughter of Peter Beverley) around 1718. He studied at the Inns of Court, practiced law in Williamsburg. John was the only native of Colonial America to receive a knighthood. He was the father of Peyton Randolph, President of the First Continental Congress, and John Randolph, a Loyalist. The latter's son, Edmund Randolph, served as a Virginia delegate to the Constitutional Convention and became the first U.S. Attorney General and was the great-great grandfather of Robert Williams Daniel, a banker who survived the Titanic disaster. *Edward Randolph (born ~October 1690) married Miss (Elizabeth?) Grosvenor around 1715. *Mary Randolph (born ~1692) married Captain John Stith, a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses and the son of John Stith, around 1712. Her son, William Stith, was the third president of the College of William and Mary; her son-in-law, William Dawson, was the second president of The College of William & Mary. Mary was the great- grandmother of Congressman William Johnston Dawson. Her second son, John Stith III, was the great-great-grandfather of Armistead C. Gordon and also Junius Daniel, Brigadier General of the Confederate States Army. *Elizabeth Randolph (born ~1695) married Richard Bland around 1711 and had five children, including Mary Bland (who married Henry Lee I and was the mother of Henry Lee II, the grandmother of Henry \\"Light-Horse Harry\\" Lee III, and the great- grandmother of Robert E. Lee), Theodorick Bland of Cawsons (who was the father of Congressman Theodorick Bland as well as grandfather to John Randolph of Roanoke), and the statesman Richard Bland (who was the great-great-grandfather of Roger Atkinson Pryor). The sons of William Randolph were each distinguished by the estates left to them.Fiske, John, and James Grant Wilson, 1900 ed., p. 174 Early generations of Randolphs married into several other gentry families, including Beverley, Bland, Dilliard, Fleming, Byrd, Fitzhugh, Carter, Cary, Harrison and Page. Later affiliations included members of the Lewis, Meriwether and Skipwith families. ==Death== Randolph died on 11 April 1711 at his Turkey Island plantation. Mary and two of their sons, Thomas and William, were executors of the estate that spelled out the manner in which his numerous land holdings were distributed to his sons. Profits from the Pigeon Swamp plantation were to pay off his debt of ‚Ç§3259 to Micajah Perry III's law firm before title was to be transferred in accordance with the will. ==Legacy== In their wealth and social status, the Randolphs were much like other families of the Chesapeake elite. If anything set them apart it was their participation in the political life of the colony, clearly traceable to William Randolph's example. Randolphs and close relatives formed the predominant political faction in the colonial government during the 18th century, with many members of the elected House of Burgesses and the appointed, and more exclusive, Council. Most of the Randolphs, like the rest of the Virginia gentry, strongly supported the Revolution. However, John Randolph (son of Sir John), in opposition to both his brother Peyton and son Edmund, remained loyal to Great Britain and left Virginia. Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, and 18-year-old John Marshall was at Valley Forge for the trying winter of 1777‚Äì1778. ==See also== * Randolph family of Virginia * Ancestry of Thomas Jefferson ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== *Colonial Wills of Henrico County, Virginia, Part One, 1654‚Äì1737, abstracted and compiled by Benjamin B.

Bernard was still alive at the time the play was first performed in the West End in 1989. Bernard wrote the \\"Low Life\\" column in The Spectator. The play's title refers to the magazine's habit of printing a one-line apology on a blank page when he was too drunk or hung-over to produce the required copy and a substitute article could not be found before the deadline for publication. Its premise is that Bernard has found himself locked in overnight at his favourite public house, the Coach and Horses, Soho, and uses the occasion to share anecdotes from his life with the audience. A highlight of the play is a trick involving a glass of water, a matchbox, and an egg which must remain unbroken at the end of the trick. This trick is more fully described in an obituary of Keith Waterhouse in The Guardian. Often remembered as a one-man show, but in fact packed with characters performed by a versatile supporting cast of four, Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell was a highly successful vehicle for its original star Peter O'Toole. The show opened in Brighton in September 1989, moved to Bath and made its triumphant London debut at the Apollo Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue in October. O'Toole also appeared in a later revival at the Old Vic. The Old Vic run was sold out and on 23 August 1999 the London Evening Standard published a 'Bluffer's Guide' to enable readers to pretend they had seen it: \\"thereby allowing dinner party conversations and watercooler debates to run their course unhindered by ignorance.\\" A filmed version of the stage play was shot at the Apollo Theatre with a live audience and was released in both full and abridged versions. O'Toole was followed in the part by Tom Conti who starred in a revival of the play until September 2006 at the Garrick Theatre in London. The part has also been played by James Bolam, Dennis Waterman, Robert Powell and more recently Simon Hill in the Frayed Knot Production of the play. A radio adaptation starring John Hurt was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 15 August 2015 and repeated on 18 February 2017 following the death of John Hurt. The play‚Äôs American premiere was in 1993 at the Kavinoky Theatre in Buffalo, NY. It starred David Lamb and was directed by Robert Waterhouse, the author‚Äôs son. (Keith Waterhouse attended the preview and gave a single note, about a sound cue. He cites it as his favourite ‚Äòout of town production‚Äô in his memoir, Streets Ahead.) The team reprised the production in 2004. In May 2019 the play was adapted as a one man show to be performed in the Coach and Horses, starring Robert Bathurst with the adaptation and direction by James Hillier. The production, running from May 7 to June 1, featured Saturday evening performances starting at midnight, followed by a traditional Soho \\"lock in\\" until 5:00 a.m. The sold out production was extended with additional performances. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1989 plays Category:British plays Category:Plays based on actual events ","title":"Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell"},{"id":"2559549","text":"The 1942‚Äì43 South African cricket season saw only two first-class games.

Starring Jia's muse, Zhao Tao, as well as Cheng Taishen, The World was filmed on and around an actual theme park located in Beijing, Beijing World Park, which recreates world landmarks at reduced scales for Chinese tourists. The World introduces new technologies like binoculars, coin-operated telescopes, digital cameras, mobile phones and digital services in the theme park as touristic tool to virtually travel around the world, emphasizing the globalization and convenience. It is a metaphor for Chinese society to experience the sense of mobility, but the knowledge is still limited domestically and the environment of simulation is seen as a sense of escaping from the real world. The World was Jia's first film to gain official approval from the Chinese government. Additionally, it was the first of his films to take place outside of his home province of Shanxi. The film premiered in competition at the 2004 Venice Film Festival on September 4, 2004, but failed to win the coveted Golden Lion, the festival's top award, which ultimately went to Mike Leigh's drama Vera Drake, but which Jia would win two years later with Still Life. The World also premiered in 2004 at the New York Film Festival and would go on to receive a limited release in New York City the following year on July 1, 2005. == Plot == The World tells the story of two workers at Beijing World Park: a performer, Tao (played by actress Zhao Tao), and Taisheng (Chen Taisheng), a security guard and Tao's boyfriend. As the film begins, Tao is visited by her ex-boyfriend, who is on his way to Ulan Batur. Taisheng meets Tao and the ex-boyfriend at a small diner and insists on driving him to the Beijing railway station. From this awkward introduction, the relationship between Tao and Taisheng grows increasingly strained. Taisheng, frustrated that Tao refuses to have sex with him, is also busy with fellow migrants from his home province of Shanxi. Chen Zhijun nicknamed \\"Little Sister,\\" is an introverted childhood friend of Taisheng's, who has just arrived at the park and came to him looking for a job. Taisheng manages to put him in touch with someone and he eventually finds work as a construction worker. Tao, meanwhile, meets one of World Park's Russian performers, a woman named Anna. Though Anna speaks no Chinese, and Tao no Russian, the two become unlikely friends. Anna confesses to Tao that she will quit her job and implies that she must prostitute herself in order to make enough money to see her sister, also in Ulan Batur (Tao, realizing only that Anna is upset, tries to comfort her). Later, while at a karaoke bar, Tao runs into Anna and confirms that Anna has indeed become a prostitute. Anna runs away and Tao cries, neither quite knowing what the other is thinking. Taisheng was asked by one of his associates to drive a woman named Qun to Taiyuan so that she can deal with her gambling brother, he eventually becomes attracted to her. The two often meet at Qun's small clothing shop. There, Qun tells Taisheng about her husband, who years before had left China for France. Since then, she has tried with some difficulty to obtain a visa to join him. Though he pursues her, Qun rejects Taisheng's physical propositions. Taisheng eventually convinces Tao to have sex with him, with Tao threatening that she will poison him if he ever betrays her. His life, however, quickly spirals out of control when \\"Little Sister\\" is killed in a construction accident. Sometime after the accidental death of Little Sister, Wei and Niu, two other performers at World Park, announce that they plan to wed, despite the fact that Niu is dangerously jealous and unstable. At the wedding, Tao discovers a text-message sent from Qun, who has at last received her visa, to Taisheng, saying that their meeting and relationship was destined. Believing that Taisheng has indeed betrayed her, Tao is devastated and cuts off contact with him while she house-sits for Wei and Niu. When Taisheng comes to visit her there, she ignores him. Sometime later, Taisheng and Tao have succumbed to the gas leak, presumably in their friends' apartment. As the film fades to black, Taisheng's voice asks, \\"Are we dead?\\" \\"No,\\" Tao's voice responds, \\"this is only the beginning.\\" ==Director== *Jia Zhangke, a Chinese film director and screenwriter, as a leading role of the \\"Sixth Generation\\" movement of Chinese cinema. *Jia's early films were considered as \\"underground\\" films. In 2004, Jia was allowed to direct his forth feature film, The World. *Notable films: Ash Is Purest White, Still Life, Xiao Wu, Mountains May Depart. ==Cast== *Zhao Tao as Tao, the film's heroine, a young woman and a performer at the Beijing World Park. *Chen Taisheng as Taisheng, a Shanxi-native who has lived in Beijing for three years. Taisheng has become something of a fixture for Shanxi migrants who come to him looking for a place to work. *Jing Jue as Wei, one of Tao's fellow performers. *Jiang Zhongwei as Niu, another performer and Wei's possessive and paranoid boyfriend. *Huang Yiqun as Qun, a native of Wenzhou, Qun operates a clothing shop, Taisheng's mistress. *Wang Hongwei as Sanlai, a friend of Taisheng's and another Shanxi native. *Ji Shuai as Erxiao, a Shanxi native and Taisheng's cousin, whom Taisheng has gotten a job as a security guard at World Park. Erxiao is later fired for stealing from the performers while they are on stage. *Xiang Wan as Youyou, another performer, Youyou carries on an affair with the park's director and parleys it into a promotion to troupe director. *Alla Shcherbakova as Anna, a Russian immigrant and performer at World Park. *Han Sanming as Sanming, a relative of Little Sister who comes to Beijing after his death to help his family collect compensation. Sanming reappears in Still Life, Jia's follow-up to The World, this time as a lead actor. ==Production== The World was a joint-production by Jia Zhangke's own Xstream Pictures, Japan's Office Kitano, and France's Lumen Films. It received additional financial support from the Shanghai Film Studio and several Japanese corporations including Bandai Visual and Tokyo FM, among others. The film's nascence began after Jia had lived in Beijing for several years in 2000. After two films based in his native province of Shanxi, Jia decided to make a film about his impressions of Beijing as a world city, after a cousin back home asked him about life in a metropolitan environment. Jia, however, would not began writing the screenplay until after the release of his next film Unknown Pleasures, in 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The screenplay took approximately a year to write, over which time the story slowly changed, such that it became harder to distinguish the fact that it took place in Beijing, and the focus of the setting shifted to that of any large city with many migrants in it. Filming of The World took place on location at the actual Beijing World Park, as well as at an older but similar park, Window of the World, that sometimes served as a stand-in and is located in the southern city of Shenzhen. The World sets the scene in a World park in Beijing, the capital of China, to present China‚Äôs desires and ongoing process of becoming a new global center,and the famous buildings from different countries of smaller sizes are to show a united and harmonious world. Jia is a migrant from Fenyang,Shanxi to Beijing, in his interview he said he ‚Äúwants to focus on my viewpoint on big cities‚Äù. This miniature of a world inside the park presents the migrants wave as a significant global issue.Yao, Sijia. (2019). Pessimistic Chinese Cosmopolitanism and Jia Zhangke's The World. The Comparatist 43, 147-158. doi:10.1353/com.2019.0008. == Legitimization == As Jia Zhangke's first film made with the consent of the Chinese Film Bureau, many felt that Jia's hand would be unduly restricted by Communist bureaucrats. As it turned out, Jia claimed that the main impact of government approval was the ability to screen abroad and at home without major obstacles; Jia stated that, Jia attributed the loosening of restrictions as part of the Film Bureau's overall liberalization and acceptance of so-called \\"outside directors.\\" Outside observers agreed with Jia's assessment, dismissing claims that Jia had compromised his principles and \\"sold out.\\" One definite result of working within the system, however, was that the film became much easier to produce, as Jia no longer had to worry about interference from the central government or from local officials. In Mainland China, directors who insisted on independent views and productions were banned from making films. Despite his director status being banned by the Chinese government in 1999, he persisted to make films. In 2004, he was the first banned director to be reinstated after years of campaigning. Advocations by the film industry were one of the reasons that led the Chinese government to reconsider the functions and role of moves as an economic tool. Jia‚Äôs first two films (Xiao Shan Go Home and Pickpocket) were primarily self-funded. He gained recognition after winning awards at Berlin, Vancouver and Nantes. His third film Platform received private funding from Pusan, and his next film Unknown Pleasure was also privately funded with support from international companies. Although raising funds was challenging for him, Jia was able to produce and control his films. When The World was being made, Jia finally received national funding from The Shanghai Film Group along with other companies around the world. The World is his first above-ground film, and with support and funding from China, he was finally approved and recognized as a filmmaker in China.Wong, C.H. (2011). Film Festivals: Culture, People, and Power on the Global Screen. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press. == Creative Team == Jia Zhangke's's primary creative team once again returned for The World, including cinematographer Yu Lik-wai, sound designer Zhang Yang, and production houses Office Kitano and Lumen Films. Also returning was editor Kong Jinglei, who had worked with Jia on Platform and would later work with Jia on Still Life and 24 City. With his core team in place, Jia also brought in several new young assistant directors. In the cast, Jia brought back Zhao Tao, who had starred in the Jia's previous ensemble pieces Unknown Pleasures and Platform, and would go on to star in both Still Life and 24 City. As usual, Jia also had a small part for his friend and classmate Wang Hongwei, who has been in nearly all of Jia's films since his starring role in the short film Xiao Shan Going Home in 1995, filmed while both were still attending the Beijing Film Academy. == Digital technology and realism == Unlike Unknown Pleasures, which only had diegetic music, music was an important feature to The World, which featured snippets of the dance performances that were the park's centerpieces. Music played such an important role that the film was almost considered by some to be a musical. Jia brought in the Taiwanese composer Lim Giong, who had previously worked with Hou Hsiao-hsien, to score the film using primarily electronic music. As stated by Jia, the artifice of the electronic music was to \\"signify the real emptiness of the lives of Tao and her friends. Life‚Äôs heaviness fades when confronted by the silky lightness of dance and music.\\" Jia then tied the music to the animated sequences of the film, wherein Tao's inner thoughts were given life, all to create an \\"Asian digital life.\\" The animated part reflects both the limiting and liberating potential of new technologies and reminds the world that ‚Äúanalog and digital media, realism and simulation, the local and the global, are in fact contemporaneous phenomena‚Äù, as the animation in the film blurs the boundaries between the reality and visual fantasy attractions. The world is shot in digital and is completed with its flash animation, cellphone as a motif, and electronic music. In fact, during the scene where Erguniang dies, the image of writings on the wall from Erguniang is not actually written on the wall but instead shown through a digital effect. According to Cecilia Mello, The World does not provide a clear division between the real world and the digital/artificial world. It rather \\"point[s] towards a confusion between both, corroborating the point made in the introduction about the coexistence of contraries, so typical of the reality of China's cities.\\"Mello, Cec√≠lia. The Cinema of Jia Zhangke: Realism and Memory in Chinese Film, Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, 2019. ProQuest Ebook Central, The circular discourse is not Jia's fundamental device on film making, but the reversal of the gaze. \\"The possibility to poke holes in the fictional system rests on the filmed subject's response to the enquiring gaze of the filming subject.\\" Based on the transition from the circular. discourse to the reversal of the gaze, Anna and Tao from the film as an example on the response to the enquiring gaze between each other. Two characters supposed to not communicate with each other due to the language difference, however, the gaze helped them to talk and feel each other's pains and worries. Outside the movie, the transition to the gaze can create an emotional appeal to audiences. Factual elements from Jia's movie resists the seduction of a seamlessly real fiction, \\"you cannot. reveal the world without the world also bearing witness to your presence.\\" == Social Issues and Realism == Jia used the created world as people's ideal life, people in the fictional world pretended to be happy. They did not recognize facts and truth between their relationships and real life, but they finally needed to accept the reality that broke their ideal life in the world. It not only demonstrated the phenomenon in the film, but also revealed the issue within the society. Jia used a film to describe a general social problem on the young generation in the society. == Animation == Jia Zhangke experimented with computer animation in The World instead of his preferred observational realism style, to reflect on the power as well as limits of the new technologies. In an interview, Jia mentioned that young people in China rely heavily on cell phones and computers these days. He wanted to explore this through the use of animation ‚Äî specifically, flash animation. With the help of the Chinese animation designer Wang Bo, the animations are used as a form of narration to render details of urban life into poetic illustrations of daydream. The animations are used with the intention of helping the characters articulate emotions that are difficult or impossible to express in words. Similarity, the virtual love notes are used to portray a shared, private space for the main couple in the film who are unable to achieve this in their daily lives. In this sense, digital technologies provide a temporary reprieve from the character‚Äôs harsh realities and allow for interpersonal communication. == Reception == Domestically, the film was apparently well received among the government officials responsible for its smooth passage through the bureaucratic machine. Abroad, the film was even better received. Four years after its American release, the review aggregators Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic gave the film rating of 71% (with 30 positive reviews out of 42) and a score of 81 (derived from 23 reviews), respectively. American critics found the film to be a stunning portrayal of the disaffected Chinese society navigating modern urban life with Entertainment Weekly calling the film \\"a glorious achievement\\", and The Chicago Reader hailing it as \\"a tragic, visionary work.\\" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, after The World's premiere at the New York Film Festival, that the film was a \\"quietly despairing vision of contemporary China with an almost ethnographic attention to detail\\" but perhaps had an overly \\"cavalier attitude to narrative momentum.\\" Variety also gave it a positive review, noting that the film \\"confirms [Jia] as one of the most interesting and insightful chroniclers of the new China.\\" Criticisms of the film generally revolved around the idea that the film was overly long and meandering (a common criticism of Jia's films, see, for example, Unknown Pleasures). Variety mentioned the overly long complaint in its review, as did the review by Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun Times (stating that \\"either you will fall into its rhythm, or you will grow restless\\"). Dargis, however, had fewer problems with the film's pace and instead felt that Jia's vision was overly insular, \\"mesmerized\\" by World Park with only fleeting glimpses of the city beyond. ===Top ten lists=== Released in 2005 in the United States, The World appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of that year. *1st ‚Äì Jonathan Rosenbaum, Chicago Reader *2nd ‚Äì Robert Koehler, Variety *6th ‚Äì Scott Foundas, LA Weekly *6th ‚Äì J.

With numerous Collaborative Research Centres (CRC) of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft it is one of Germany's most research-intensive medical institutions. From 2012 to 2020, it was ranked by Focus as the best of over 1000 hospitals in Germany. In 2019 and 2020 Newsweek ranked the Charit√© as fifth best hospital in the world and best in Europe. More than half of all German Nobel Prize winners in Physiology or Medicine, including Emil von Behring, Robert Koch and Paul Ehrlich, have worked at the Charit√©. Several politicians and diplomats have been treated at the Charit√©, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who underwent meniscus treatment at the Orthopaedic Department, Yulia Tymoshenko from Ukraine, and, more recently, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who has been receiving treatment at the hospital since his August 2020 poisoning. In 2010/11 the medical schools of Humboldt University and Freie Universit√§t Berlin were united under the roof of the Charit√©. The admission rate of the reorganized medical school was 3.9% for the 2019/2020 academic year. QS World University Rankings 2019 ranked the Charit√© Medical School as number one for medicine in Germany and ninth best in Europe. ==History== Historic and modern buildings at Campus Charit√© Mitte (CCM) Locations of the four campuses of Charit√© in Berlin Complying with an order of King Frederick I of Prussia from 14 November 1709, the hospital was established north of the Berlin city walls in 1710 in anticipation of an outbreak of the bubonic plague that had already depopulated East Prussia. After the plague spared the city, it came to be used as a charity hospital for the poor. On 9 January 1727, Frederick William I of Prussia gave it the name Charit√©, French 'charity'. The construction of an anatomical theatre in 1713 marks the beginning of the medical school, then supervised by the collegium medico-chirurgicum of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. In the 19th century, after the University of Berlin (today Humboldt University) was founded in 1810, the dean of the medical college Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland integrated the Charit√© as a teaching hospital in 1828. During this time it became home to such notable medical pioneers as Rudolf Virchow, known as \\"the father of modern pathology\\"\\"Virchow\\". The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. and whose name is given to the eponymous \\"Virchow's Method\\" of autopsy; the Swiss Psychiatrist and Neurologist Otto Binswanger, whose work in vascular dementia led to the discovery of Binswanger's Disease‚Äîso coined by his colleague Alois Alzheimer; Robert Koch, who identified the specific causative agents of Tuberculosis, Cholera, and Anthrax; and Emil von Behring, widely known as a \\"saviour of children\\" nobelprize.org (Retrieved by \\"The Internet Archive\\") for his 1894 discovery of a Diphtheria antitoxin at a time when diphtheria was a major cause of child death (among many others). In the 20th century, at the end of the Second World War the Charit√© had endured the Battle of Berlin, with Berlin having been taken by the Red Army on 2 May 1945. Though the majority of its original and pre-War structure was damaged or destroyed during the War, it nevertheless was used as a Red Army hospital. Subsequent to Victory in Europe, in the period of denazification and the Nuremberg trials, the Charit√© remained in the Soviet Sector of Berlin until the formation of the German Democratic Republic, the GDR‚Äî(German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik, DDR)‚Äîin 1949, more commonly called East Germany. Under the Communists, standards were largely maintained, and it became a showpiece for East Bloc propaganda during the Cold War. Finally, in 1990 with the Reunification of Germany, and in the years following, it once again became one of the world's leading research- and teaching-hospitals. ==Organization== Campus Charit√© Mitte (CCM) main building Campus Virchow Klinikum (CVK), German Heart Center Berlin (Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin) Campus Benjamin Franklin (CBF) The Charit√© has four different campuses across the city of Berlin with a total of 3,001 beds:Coordinates from Google Maps * Campus in Mitte, Berlin * Campus Benjamin Franklin (CBF) in Lichterfelde, Berlin * Campus Virchow Klinikum (CVK) in Wedding, Berlin * Campus Berlin Buch (CBB) in Buch, Berlin In 2001, the Helios Clinics Group acquired the hospitals in Buch with their 1,200 beds. Still, the Charit√© continues to use the campus for teaching and research and has more than 300 staff members located there. The Charit√© encompasses more than 100 clinics and scientific institutes, organized in 17 different departments, referred to as Charit√© Centers (CC): * CC 1: Health and Human Sciences * CC 2: Basic Sciences (First Year) * CC 3: Dental, Oral and Maxillary Medicine * CC 4: Charit√©-BIH Center for Therapy Research * CC 5: Diagnostic Laboratory and Preventative Medicine * CC 6: Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology and Nuclear Medicine * CC 7: Anesthesiology, Operating-Room Management and Intensive Care Medicine * CC 8: Surgery * CC 9: Traumatology and Reconstructive Medicine * CC 10: Charit√© Comprehensive Cancer Center * CC 11: Cardiovascular Diseases * CC 12: Internal Medicine and Dermatology * CC 13: Internal Medicine, Gastroenterology and Nephrology * CC 14: Tumor Medicine * CC 15: Neurology, Neurosurgery, Psychiatry * CC 16: Audiology/Phoniatrics, Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology * CC 17: Gynecology, Perinatal, Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine with Perinatal Center & Human Genetics Overall, 13 of those centers focus on patient care, while the rest focuses on research and teaching. The Medical History Museum Berlin has a history dating back to 1899. The museum in its current form opened in 1998 and is famous for its pathological and anatomical collection. ==Notable people== Rudolf Virchow, by Hugo Vogel Robert Koch and the beginnings of microbiology Paul Ehrlich and the introduction of antimicrobial chemotherapy at Charit√© Paul Ehrlich Emil von Behring Theodor Billroth operating Many famous physicians and scientists worked or studied at the Charit√©.

Since 2010/11 all new medical students have been enrolled on the New Revised Medical Curriculum Programme with a length of 6 years. Referred to the points needed in the German Abitur to get directly accepted, the Charit√© is together with Heidelberg University Medical School Germany's most competitive medical school (2020). 3,17% of all Charit√© Medical School students are supported by the German Academic Scholarship Foundation, the highest percentage of all public German universities. The Erasmus Exchange Programme offered to Charit√© Medical School students includes 72 universities and is the largest in Europe. Charit√© students can spend up to a year at a foreign medical school with exchange partners such as the Karolinska Institute, University of Copenhagen, Sorbonne University, Universit√† di Roma La Sapienza, University of Amsterdam, and the University of Z√ºrich. Students are also encouraged to participate in research projects, complete a dissertation, or join Charit√© affiliated social projects. In 2019, it was announced that the Berlin Institute of Health will become part of the Charit√©, marking a change in the German university system by making the Charit√© the first university clinic which will receive direct and annual financial support by the federal state of Germany. Together with private charity donors like the Johanna Quandt's private excellence initiative (BMW) or the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as financing by the State of Berlin, the new direct federal investments will become the third financial fundament for research at the Charit√©. In addition, it is part of the Berlin University Alliance, receiving funding from the German Universities Excellence Initiative in 2019. == International partner universities == * UK: Oxford University * UK: London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine * US: Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore * US: Northwestern University, Chicago * Canada: Universit√© de Montr√©al * Australia: Monash University, Melbourne * Japan: Chiba University * Japan: Saitama Medical School * Brazil: Universidade de S√£o Paulo * China: Tongji University, Shanghai * China: Tongji Medical College, Wuhan ==Einstein Foundation== The Charit√© is one of the main partners of the Einstein Foundation, which was established by the city and state of Berlin in 2009.

The tent house for Granske regiment. Now at Hadeland Folkemuseum. In the first years, on every Sunday after the sermon, the local regiment would drill outside the church. After 1774 this location was changed in favour of special exercise or parade grounds, with annual musters of 12 days. At these places the ‚Äútent houses‚Äù were built. Each larger farm or a number of smaller farms was obliged to supply one fully equipped soldier. This farm or group of farms was called a legd.

The regimental arsenal is relocated at Bagn Bygdesamling. Granske Kompagni had its exercise ground at Granavollen, Gran municipality. The regimental arsenal is now relocated to Hadeland Folkemuseum. ==Historical context== Northwestern Europe witnessed warfare on a scale not previously experienced during the period between 1558 and 1721. Military change was rapid and extensive in Norway, modifying the army structure and increasing the fortification of the borders and strong points. The burdens placed on the populace grew dramatically. The Norwegian regimental army was established during the Thirty Years' War, which consisted of a series of declared and undeclared wars based on religious and economic objectives that raged throughout central and northern Europe in 1618‚Äì1648. Denmark-Norway actively participated in the Thirty Year War (see Hannibal War) between 1625 and 1630. The French, English and Dutch opposed the Habsburg Empire. When the Empire attacked Danish possessions on the Baltic and in northern Germany, Christian IV of Denmark's troops joined, but were defeated by the army of the Catholic League. ==References== *The Northern Wars, 1558‚Äì1721 by Robert I.

later Hartulari; 10 June 1860 ‚Äì 12 January 1939) was a celebrated Romanian operatic soprano who had a three-decade-long career. Darcl√©e's repertoire ranged from coloratura soprano roles to heavier Verdi roles, including many in the Franco-Italian lyric repertory. Throughout her career she participated in several world premieres, creating the title roles in Puccini's Tosca, Mascagni's Iris, and Catalani's La Wally. Puccini reportedly considered her to have been \\"the most beautiful and exquisite Manon\\". Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo, regarded as the most comprehensive international performing arts encyclopedia, named Darcl√©e \\"world's greatest singer for 25 years\\". Darcl√©e was considered the equivalent, in the opera world, of Sarah Bernhardt. ==Early years== Darcl√©e was born Hariclea Haricli in BrƒÉila to a family with Greek roots. Her father, Ion Haricli, was a landlord in the Teleorman district. Her mother, Maria Aslan, was a relative of the noble Mavrocordatos family. The family lived for a while in the town of Turnu MƒÉgurele in southern Romania. She began her studies at Conservatoire of music in Ia≈üi, making her professional appearances as a concert performer in 1884. ==Career== Costume design for her role in the premi√®re production of La Wally Hariclea Darcl√©e as Manon in 1896, Saint Charles Royal Theatre, Lisbon She continued her studies in Paris under Jean-Baptiste Faure. She married a young officer, Iorgu Hartulari, and became known for a while as Hariclea Hartulari-Darcl√©e, Darcl√©e being the nom de th√©√¢tre she adopted when she made her debut at the Paris Op√©ra in 1888 as Marguerite in Charles Gounod's Faust. In 1889, she replaced Adelina Patti as Juliette in Gounod's Rom√©o et Juliette, to increasing acclaim. In 1890, Darcl√©e scored a great success in her La Scala debut as Chim√®ne in Jules Massenet‚Äôs Le Cid, and was immediately engaged by all the leading Italian theatres. Highlights of her later career in Italy from 1890 on included the world-premi√®res of the part of Odalea in Ant√¥nio Carlos Gomes' Condor at La Scala in Milan in 1891, the title-role in Alfredo Catalani's La Wally at the same theater in 1892, Luisa in Pietro Mascagni's I Rantzau at the Teatro della Pergola in Florence in 1892, and the title roles in Pietro Mascagni's Iris and Giacomo Puccini's Tosca, both at Teatro Costanzi in Rome in 1899 and 1900, respectively. Between 1893 and 1910 she appeared frequently in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Lisbon, Barcelona, Madrid, and Buenos Aires. She was very popular in Spain and South America, where she participated in many local premi√®res of new operas by Puccini, Mascagni, and Massenet. Among the many roles she portrayed are Gilda in Rigoletto, Oph√©lie in Hamlet, Valentine in Les Huguenots, Violetta in La traviata, Desdemona in Otello, Mim√¨ in La boh√®me, Santuzza in Cavalleria Rusticana, and the title roles in Manon, Manon Lescaut, Aida, and Carmen. The last performance of her career was as Juliette in Rom√©o et Juliette at the Teatro Lirico in Milan in 1918. ==Personal life== Darcl√©e's son was composer Ion Hartulari Darcl√©e (1886‚Äì1969), who was known particularly as a writer of operettas. Both she and her son are interred in Bucharest's Bellu cemetery. ==Legacy== Started in 1995, the Hariclea Darcl√©e Festival and International Voice Competition is held every two years in BrƒÉila. ==Repertory== Hariclea Darcl√©e sang 58 roles on 56 operas (32 operas of tradition, 12 in absolute premi√®re and 16 operas in important premi√®res) by 31 composers (12 composers of the tradition and 19 young composers with new operas interpreted in absolute premi√®re);

It did not win. The producers co-credited Lilley; however, the show lasted only one series before being spun off into a comedy/variety programme.

The BBC began showing the programme on BBC Three in June 2008. When asked about whether there would be a second series, Lilley stated, \\"I never thought about it in the beginning because it was always a one-off thing. I'm not into just cashing in and rolling off into a second series that is not as good. I really enjoyed making the show, so the thought of writing and going back there again is really fun and exciting, but I haven't made a decision on what to do next.\\" The characters from the show have gathered attention and praise from popular celebrities including Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, Lindsay Lohan, Ed Sheeran and Kylie Jenner. ===Angry Boys=== Lilley in 2012 The series Angry Boys aired on ABC in Australia and BBC in the UK in 2011 and HBO in the US in 2012.

Jonah had been introduced in Lilley's 2007 series Summer Heights High. At the conclusion of that series, Jonah was expelled from Summer Heights High School. In this series, his father, Rocky Takalua, has sent him back to his homeland of Tonga to live with his uncle and their family in order to get Jonah's life back on track. The six-part series was produced by Princess Pictures and Chris Lilley in conjunction with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The show was originally posted online on the ABC iView service, available for viewing by Australian residents, and on BBC iPlayer in the United Kingdom, from 2‚Äì4 May 2014, before airing on ABC1 from 7 May 2014 and BBC Three from 8 May 2014. In New Zealand MƒÅori Television screened the first episode on 29 July 2017, but then withdrew later episodes. === Lunatics === In March 2018, it was announced that Lilley had been signed by Netflix to create a 10-part series, with the titular character not yet disclosed. Filming begun at the Bond University campus on the Gold Coast, Queensland. On 10 April 2019, a trailer surfaced online showing a number of new characters. The show is called Lunatics and features a group of eccentric characters with different talents or oddities. Alongside the series order announcement, it was confirmed that Lilley would star in the lead role. Lunatics was released on 19 April 2019 exclusively on Netflix. Lunatics features six different characters, all played by Lilley, which include: fashion retailer Keith Dick; estate agent Quentin Cook; 7-foot college student Becky Douglas; 12-year-old Gavin McGregor, who is an heir to an earldom; ex-pornstar Joyce Jeffries; and South African Jana Melhoopen- Jonks, a celebrity pet psychic who is also a lesbian. Lilley collaborated with The Jonas Brothers and Paris Hilton with his Lunatics characters Keith Dick and Jana Melhoopen-Jonks. == Personal life == Lilley has been vegetarian since the age of five. He dated Milly Gattegno from The Faders DJ from 2014 to 2016. Lilley currently resides in Melbourne, Victoria. == Controversies == Lilley's series Summer Heights High gained significant controversy, criticism and media scrutiny for its portrayal of such issues as mental disabilities, homosexuality, sexual abuse, and racism. Even before Summer Heights High aired, some community groups complained about a \\"rape joke\\" and Mr G's inappropriate \\"touching\\" of a boy with Down syndrome. The Herald Sun reported that parents and some teachers have considered the possibility that the show is influencing children to misbehave at school. Students were reportedly imitating Jonah and Ja'mie, repeating lines that were bullying, racist, and homophobic. Education Union branch president Mary Bluett stated in response that the show was \\"clearly tongue-in-cheek\\". After episode three, in which a character called Annabel dies after taking ecstasy, the family of Annabel Catt, a girl who died taking drugs at the 2007 Good Vibrations Festival in Sydney, complained that the program had been lampooning Annabel's death. ABC apologised to the family, stating that the situation was purely coincidental and assured them that the filming of the episode in question had been completed eleven days before her daughter's death. ABC thereafter began to display a message before each episode stating that there is no link between the series' characters and people in real life. On 29 July 2017, Lilley was the subject of criticism after posting a remix on his Instagram account of a music clip entitled \\"Squashed Nigga\\", starring the character S.mouse from Lilley's 2011 TV show, Angry Boys. The music video featured an indigenous boy lying on the ground with his arms splayed. On 24 July 2017, the court case based on the death of Elijah Doughty had ended in controversy and was the subject of pro-Aboriginal protests. Just like the real case, Lilley's music video described an Aboriginal boy being run over and killed. It was reported that many who criticised Lilley's bad timing were blocked from his Twitter account, with Lilley later deleting his social media accounts. Lilley's series Jonah from Tonga was called \\"racist\\" and resulted in protests from academics and Tongan youth concerned at the inaccurate and demeaning portrayals of Tongan culture. There was also criticism of his use of brownface. The creators of the 2004 ABC TV documentary series Our Boys stated that Lilley drew inspiration for the Jonah character from their work. The subject of Our Boys recalled being \\"absolutely embarrassed, full of hate, angry and exploited\\" by the \\"racist\\" Jonah character that was based on him. The series' director, as well as a teacher at Canterbury Boys High School also felt that the character \\"exploited\\" the Tongan students who Lilley had met while visiting the school after seeing Our Boys on television in 2004. Many major US civil rights organisations wrote to HBO expressing their \\"deep concern\\" over Jonah From Tonga.

In 2003, soon after Hamish began writing for the Fox FM breakfast show (The Matt & Jo Show), the pair began hosting a Monday night late-night radio program called Almost Tuesday on the same station. The duo then hosted the Fox FM program, Almost Midday on Saturday mornings, which was so successful it was syndicated nationally across the Today Network. From 2006, they host the two-hour afternoon program, Hamish & Andy, formerly The Hamish & Andy Show, on the Today Network in all states and territories of Australia and in New Zealand. A weekly highlights package is also broadcast in Dubai. The duo have presented two radio specials on BBC 6 Music in the United Kingdom on 21 December 2009 and 26 January 2010. On Friday 11 June it was announced on the Christian O'Connell Breakfast Show that Hamish & Andy would be presenting three shows in London during July 2010 to cover Christian's holiday. Hamish and Andy signed a deal to present a series of shows to air on Absolute Radio Sunday evenings. ===The Hamish & Andy Show=== The duo have hosted a two-hour weekday show, The Hamish & Andy Show, since 2006. The show is broadcast in all the seven major cities of Australia, in the afternoon drivetime slot (and a compilation of the past week's best on Saturday mornings in New Zealand). The show is the highest-rated radio series in Australian history, with approximately two million listeners daily. The show is well known for its interstate and overseas trips. As of 2014, The Hamish & Andy Show has completed two domestic and two foreign caravan tours, Bass Strait sailboat trip, and trips to Afghanistan, Beijing, Japan, India, and the US, recording live on location. The program has won 14 Australian Commercial Radio Awards. The duo have released two compilation albums of segments from their daily radio show, Unessential Listening, in 2008 and Celebrating 50 Glorious Years in 2010. Both albums won ARIA Awards for Best Comedy Release. Blake and Lee announced in August 2010 that they would be cutting down their show to a single program each week from 2011 onward, in the Friday afternoon drive time slot. The final daily program aired on 3 December 2010. ===Business Brunch/Happy Hour=== As of January 2013, the pair moved their weekly drive show from Fridays to Mondays from 4 p.m, and added a one- hour show from 9 a.m. Tuesdays through Fridays. This second show is known as Hamish & Andy's Business Brunch, during which they cover every single topic in the world, one topic per show. The list of topics for every week is updated the week before and listeners are encouraged to contribute any 'expertise' or assistance to the discussion of any particular topic covered on the show. This arrangement lasted six months, until they shifted to a one-hour program at 3 p.m. every weekday afternoon called Hamish & Andy's Happy Hour. Similar to the Business Brunch, it address one topic each day, but this topic is merely a starting point for the day's conversation. ==Television career== Hamish & Andy have presented a number of television series and specials since 2003. They began on sketch shows but have found greater success in recent years with their travel diary-style programmes.

Blake reunited with Lee in 2004 when they were named hosts of a new Seven Network variety program, The Hamish and Andy Show, a show described as a successor to Big Bite. It premiered in 2004, and steadily built a moderate cult audience. However the show did not rate well and was cancelled after its initial run of six episodes. ===Rove and guest appearances=== Hamish Blake, with Andrew G√ºnsberg, appearing on Joker Poker in 2005. In 2005, they were recruited by comedian Rove McManus, to develop the satirical television comedy series, Real Stories, which aired on Network Ten in 2006. From 2007 to 2009, the duo appeared fortnightly on Rove in a mixture of pre-recorded segments and live appearances.

They appeared on UKs The Graham Norton Show in June 2010. ===Network Ten specials=== The duo have presented numerous televised clip show specials on Network Ten. Hamish and Andy: Re-Gifted at the end of 2008, and Hamish & Andy: Re-Gifted ‚Äì Another Very Early Christmas Special at the end of 2009, were both produced in conjunction with Roving Enterprises and consisted mostly of highlights of their fortnightly appearances on Rove. Their 2010 Hamish & Andy's Reministmas Special recapped their adventures during the year, mostly as part of their radio show. In addition to these, they produced three travel specials for Ten. Hamish & Andy's American Caravan of Courage in 2009 (another Roving Enterprises co-production) summarised their two-week road-trip across the United States. Similarly, 2010's Hamish & Andy's Caravan of Courage: Great Britain and Ireland recapped their next caravan trip made as part of their radio show. Their third travel special, Learn India with Hamish & Andy, aired as part of the network's lead-up to the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. ===Nine Network and Gap Year=== Following a series of media reports, the pair confirmed in February 2011 that they had joined the Nine Network on a two-year contract, to produce Hamish and Andy's Gap Year. The show first aired on 28 July 2011. The show premiered to strong ratings and has since gone onto three more seasons (Hamish & Andy's Euro Gap Year in 2012 and Hamish & Andy's Gap Year Asia in 2013 and Hamish & Andy's Gap Year South America in 2014). The pair also filmed a fifth Caravan of Courage adventure in 2012, in which they compared their home country, Australia, to their neighbours New Zealand in two 90-minute specials. In December 2016, the duo announced that 2017 would be their last year on radio, in order to focus on television. They also announced an as yet unnamed TV show to be aired on the Nine Network in mid 2017. The duo advertised on their website and radio show, for listeners to contribute \\"great stories\\" for \\"The Great Stories Project\\" which was the basis of their 2017 television show True Story with Hamish & Andy on the Nine Network. ==Other projects== Blake (centre) and Lee (right) played in the 2008 E.

Starting a conflict with the local inhabitants that took almost 800 years to solve, ending with the control of the Iberian peninsula by a coalition of the Christian kingdoms. In about the middle of that period, in the year 1231 (or 1232 by some accounts), a miracle occurred in the southeastern Spanish town of Caravaca de la Cruz. The town is set among the rugged sierras of Murcia, which at that time was still a Moorish kingdom under Zeyt-Abuzeyt. Being several generations away from the initial invaders, Zeyt-Abuzeyt was from a line of well-established Moorish monarchs and one of his duties was to protect the region from invasion by the Christians. The Christian Reconquesta took various forms; from fighting to gradual infiltration through missionaries. One such Christian missionary was Don G√≠nes P√©rez Chirinos de Cuenca. He was captured and taken before the Muslim king, who was curious about certain aspects of the Christian faith. In particular, he was interested in the Christian celebration of the Last Supper and asked the missionary to demonstrate the procedure. One can imagine the priest would be reluctant to do this ‚Äì in those days only believers were present during the sacrament. Nevertheless he agreed, and the king arranged for the necessary apparatus: an altar draped with a pall cloth, bread and wine, and some candles. One important element, however, was missing: the cross. The missionary explained that the presence of a cross was critical to the Eucharist and he could not continue without one. The king exclaimed: \\"So what is that?\\", pointing to something at the window. From the heavens, two angels appeared carrying a cross, which they placed on the altar and then disappeared. The priest continued with the Mass. According to Catholic belief, when the bread and wine are consecrated during Mass, they cease to be bread and wine, and become instead the body and blood of Christ. The empirical appearances are not changed, but the reality is. When missionary Don reached the consecration stage, the king saw a beautiful baby instead of the bread (Host). The king was so taken aback by this miraculous image that he and his family converted to Christianity and asked to be baptized into the Christian faith. Many believe that the cross delivered by the angels included a piece of the True Cross. This appearance of the Cross is remembered by the people of Caravaca each year in acts that constitute a real festive tradition supported by a legend with historical foundation recalled from the Middle Ages. Indeed, the May festivities in honor of the Blessed and Vera Cruz are a perfect combination of color, culture, religion and entertainment in which all citizens participate unconditionally, inviting visitors to share the celebrations. More than just a holiday, the fiestas of Moors and Christians of Caravaca are a cult of the past, a tribute to history. Because of these miracles and the relic of the True Cross, in 1998 Caravaca de la Cruz became the fifth Holy City (along with Santiago de Compostela, Santo Toribio de Li√©bana, Rome and Jerusalem) celebrating the Perpetual Jubilee in the Vera Cruz Sanctuary (Sanctuario de la Vera Cruz), where the Cross of Caravaca is kept. Centuries later, after Christopher Columbus set sail on his voyage of discovery (1492) Franciscan friars travelled to the Americas, taking copies of the Caravaca Cross with them. The design is still commonly seen in Central and South American churches and monasteries. Houses and business premises also have copies pinned to the wall like lucky charms, and may be surrounded by a lucky horseshoe.Fr. Martin Von Cochem (1896) 'Cochem's Explanation of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass', 2nd ed., New York: Benziger Brothers, 37-8. Available at: http://www.saintsbooks.net/books/Fr.%20Martin%20Cochem%20-%20Explanation%20of%20the%20Holy%20Sacrifice%20of%20the%20Mass.pdf (accessed 6/21/2011,1/19/2014dds). The Caravaca Cross shows a Corpus on a Patriarchal Cross, often flanked by two angels. The upper of the two bars on the Patriarchal Cross normally represents an inscription; the Caravaca Cross is unusual in that the arms of the corpus are nailed to the upper rather than the lower bar. The power of the Cross of Caravaca is in its original meaning and foremost representation of a religious value that was the maintaining starting point of other values. Without the religious symbolism, the Cross had not had the importance and character development in its history. Secular symbols usually do not cause the same force as religious symbols, which are the meeting place of a transcendent reality and other material. The Caravaca Cross is the symbol of a city, protecting and giving strength to all its people. It provides a deep feeling of community to all caravaque√±os, and it also reaches deep into the heart of the pilgrims who come to visit the Sanctuary. For almost eight centuries of pilgrims' worship it was guarded by the Knights Templar, and later by the Order of Santiago. The Cross also has other connotations and considerations. The historical experiences and experiences of identity accumulated over time have provided it with an emotional function for the local community and for many people elsewhere. == \\"Los Caballos del Vino\\" == Festivity of Caballos del Vino is a celebration \\"Unique, unusual and passionate\\" as defined by the writer Ballester on one of his books and is celebrated on 2 May. The horses come together to Moors and Christians, the Fiestas de Caravaca de la Cruz are held from 1 to 5 May in honor of the patron saint of the village, the Blessed and Vera Cruz de Caravaca. The horses came from Caravaca de la Cruz, on May 2 was done with the streets of the city with its splendid robes embroidered in silk and gold, and the spectacular career of the horses came on the slope of the castle.

Cruz Caravaca, Murcia Northwest particular corner. A display of fantasy and symbolism. Cult given the strength, value, beauty and the senses. The origins of the festival are lost in the mists of time blending between history and legend. The town passed to the Knights Templar who, in the 13th century, built the castle that still dominates the town today. At one time, the Knights Templar and townsfolk were under siege by the Muslim army and took refuge in the castle. It wasn't long before the water stored in the castle became unpotable and several of the refugees became ill. Scouts crept out of the castle at night to look for water but found the neighboring wells had been poisoned. In desperation, the scouts raced out of the castle on horses to find a safe source of water. They found some wine, loaded the wineskins on their horses and raced back to the castle. The wine was blessed in the presence the Caravaca Cross and served to those who had been debilitated by the bad water. They recovered immediately and the blessed wine was mixed with the toxic water in the storage tanks. The water became fresh and as a result, the Christians were able to resist the enemy. Today, an annual fiesta is held in the town to remember those events, which includes a ceremony to bless the irrigation water used by Caravaca farmers. Before offering and sprucing women to young men and horses richly embroidered robes and bouquets of flowers, considering, in this way, heroes and saviors of the situation. Since the Middle Ages, in more or less splendor, according to the times, the anniversary has been held annually. However, it is in the 18th century, in full Baroque, when the festival begins to appear as such, and during the Romantic Decim√≥nico playful when it reaches the structure it has today. The Celebration takes place during the morning of each Dos de Mayo, the eve of the Feast of the Cross, when Caravaca becomes the capital of joy, beauty and festive participation. Wine Horses begin at dawn with the washing and harnessing the horse, in over forty different locations in the city. Few spectators, most linked to the rocks or family have the privilege to attend the ceremony. In the early morning light group (formed by the horse and four horses), is preparing to recognize the streets within hours of the show will be the scenario. Fast runs and solemn presences begin to get followers who have not given up the rock around the passage of celebration. == Entertainment == Thuiller Theatre, built in 1843 on the old \\"Court of Comedy\\". In 2006, after being closed several months, completed the last renovation of the building, reopening to the public in April of that year with the play El hombre de Central Park, by Carlos Larra√±aga. Besides this theater, the Culture House and the cultural center built in the Church of the Society of Jesus are the places where cultural activity centers, film and artistic community.

Also referred to as \\"Tammany\\", he became a popular figure in 18th-century America, especially in Philadelphia. Also called a \\"Patron Saint of America\\", Tamenend represented peace and amity. A Tammany society founded in Philadelphia holds an annual Tammany festival. Tammany societies were established across the United States after the American Revolutionary War, and Tammany assumed mythic status as an icon for the peaceful politics of negotiation. ==Life and legend== Tamanend reputedly took part in a meeting between the leaders of the Lenni-Lenape nation, and the leaders of the Pennsylvania colony held under a large elm tree at Shakamaxon in the early 1680s. William Penn and Tamanend continued to sign seven more documents assuring each other, and their peoples, of peaceable understanding after the initial one in 1683. Tamanend is recorded as having said that the Lenni-Lenape and the English colonists would \\"live in peace as long as the waters run in the rivers and creeks and as long as the stars and moon endure.\\" These words have been memorialized on the statue of Tamanend that still stands in Philadelphia. It is believed that Tamanend died in 1701. Over the next century, many folk legends surrounded Tamanend, and his fame assumed mythical proportions among the people of Philadelphia, who began to call him \\"King Tammany,\\" \\"Saint Tammany,\\" and the \\"Patron Saint of America.\\" The people of Philadelphia organized a Tammany society and an annual Tammany festival. These traditions soon spread across America. Tammany's popular status was partly due to the desire by colonists to express a distinct \\"American\\" identity, in place of their former European nationalities. Tammany provided an apt symbol for this kind of patriotism. Because of Philadelphia's prominence during the American Revolution and subsequent decades, Tammany soon became a national symbol throughout much of the newly formed country. ==Legacy== ===Tammany Societies=== Tammany Hall on East 14th Street in Manhattan featured a white marble statue of Tamanend (located in the arch on top of the building). In 1772, the original Tammany Society was formed in Philadelphia (it was originally called the \\"Sons of King Tammany\\" but was later renamed the \\"Sons of St. Tammany\\"). Soon, Tammany societies were organized in communities from Georgia to Rhode Island, and west to the Ohio River. The most famous of these was New York City's Society of St. Tammany, whose members developed an influential political machine known as \\"Tammany Hall.\\" A white marble statue of Tamanend adorned the fa√ßade of the building on East 14th Street that housed Tammany Hall. ===Tammany Festivals=== By the early 1770s, annual Tammany Festivals were being held in Philadelphia and Annapolis. The festivals were held on May 1, replacing the May Day traditions of Europe but continuing popular folk traditions. For example, the Saint Tammany Day celebrated on May 1, 1771, in Annapolis had a may pole decorated with ribbons. People danced in American Indian style to music while holding a ribbon and moving in a circle around the pole. On May 1, 1777, John Adams wrote of the Tammany festival in Philadelphia during the American Revolutionary War. Adams, who was in Philadelphia attending the Second Continental Congress as a delegate from Massachusetts, wrote a letter home to his wife Abigail Adams, which said: > This is King Tammany's Day. Tammany was an Indian King, of this part of the > Continent, when Mr. Penn first came here. His court was in this town. He was > friendly to Mr. Penn and very serviceable to him. He lived here among the > first settlers for some time and until old age. ... The people here have > sainted him and keep his day.Lyman H. Butterfield, ed., Adams Family > Correspondence; Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1963-1973, II, pp. > 229‚Äì230. On May 1, 1778, General George Washington and the Continental Army held a Tammany festival while camped at Valley Forge. The \\"men spent the day in mirth and jollity...in honor of King Tammany\\" (Military Journal of George Ewing, 1928). After the end of the Revolutionary War, Tammany celebrations spread throughout the United States, including to Savannah, Georgia. Local societies promoted annual festivals, usually held on May 1. Tammany celebrations were such important events that, in 1785, George Washington appeared at the Tammany festival in Richmond, Virginia with Virginia governor Patrick Henry. The Tammany Society in New York City held its first festival in 1787. Developments since 2003 In 2003, two identical concurrent resolutions were introduced in the United States Congress (Senate Concurrent Resolution 39 and House Concurrent Resolution 123) that sought to establish \\"St. Tammany Day\\" on May 1 as a national day of recognition. The bills were referred for review to the Subcommittee on Civil Service and Agency Organization, which is a subcommittee of the House Committee on Government Reform. As of December 2006, the Subcommittee has yet to take any action on the bill. ===Dramatic and literary representations, and musical references=== *In 1794, Ann Julia Hatton's opera, Tammany: The Indian Chief premiered on Broadway and became highly popular. It featured the first major opera libretto written in the United States that had an American theme, and it was the earliest drama about ethnic Americans. The opera premiered at the John Street Theatre, New York, on March 3, 1794, featuring English actress and 'grande dame' of American theatre, Charlotte Melmoth. Melmoth refused to speak the opera's epilogue, as she disapproved of its patriotic sentiments. The New York Journal called on the public to boycott the opera as long as Melmoth was still in the cast.A Biographical Dictionary of Actors, Actresses, Musicians, Vol 10 *In 1826, Tammany was featured (as \\"Tamenund\\") in the conclusion of The Last of the Mohicans (1826), a novel by James Fenimore Cooper which became extremely popular in the antebellum United States. The novel was part of his Leatherstocking Tales, a series of works that explored the colonial past, with strong influence on American literary culture and the emerging nation's identity. (Tamenund is depicted as elderly, and a relic of the past, but in 1757 ‚Äî the year in which the novel is set ‚Äî he was in fact more than half a century dead.) *In 1912, James E. Gaffney, a member of New York‚Äôs Tammany Hall, purchased the Boston Rustlers baseball team and renamed them the Boston Braves, using Tamanend‚Äôs image as their primary logo. *In 1932, Boston was granted an NFL franchise which took the Boston Braves name and image from its landlord at Braves Field. When the team moved to Fenway Park in 1936, it renamed itself the Redskins in homage to their new landlord, the Boston Red Sox. The Redskins name and Tamanend image travelled with them when they moved to Washington, D.C. in 1937. The team has since changed their name. *A statue of an American Indian identified as Tamanend is shown outside Tammany Hall in the film Gangs of New York (2002). *The musician Joanna Newsom, in the song 'Sapokanikan' from her 2015 album Divers refers to both King Tamanend and Tammany Hall. ===Statues, monuments, and memorials=== 42nd New York Infantry Monument, Gettysburg Battlefield *Tamanend, an 1817 wooden sculpture by William Luke, was the figurehead of the warship USS Delaware. The ship burned during the American Civil War, but the figurehead was rescued and put on display at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. In the 1930s, a bronze replica was installed on campus in front of Bancroft Hall, where each day the Brigade of Midshipmen forms the Noon Meal Formation. The midshipmen later renamed the bronze replica for Tecumseh, a Shawnee leader, and the area surrounding it is now called \\"Tecumseh Court.\\" The original figurehead is in the U.S. Naval Academy Museum. *Tamanend, a 1995 bronze statue by Raymond Sandoval, is located at the intersection of Front and Market Streets, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The plaque notes that \\"Tamanend was considered the patron saint of America by the colonists prior to American Independence.\\" ===Namesakes=== *St. Tammany Parish (established c.1810) is one of nine Louisiana parishes (counties) named for \\"saints;\\" it is the only one whose namesake is not a Christian \\"saint\\" as recognized by the Roman Catholic Church. *Mount Tammany is the name of the prominence on Kittatinny Mountain on the northeast (New Jersey) side of the Delaware Water Gap. *\\"Tammany Regiment\\" was the nickname of the New York 42nd Infantry during the American Civil War.

The New Adventures were fully licensed novels carrying on from where the Doctor Who television series had left off. Jason was introduced in Dave Stone's novel Death and Diplomacy in 1996. ==Character history== Jason was born on Christmas Eve 1983 and grew up around London, although his father Peter was abusive towards him and his sister, leading Jason to eventually run away. In 1996, Jason was caught in an alien transportation beam, causing him to be deposited in a swamp on the planet t'Kao in the 26th century. After thirteen years, the first human being he saw was Bernice \\"Benny\\" Summerfield. They fell in love and got married, but after a turbulent relationship were soon divorced. When he first meets Benny, and they discuss their sex lives, Jason candidly discusses having slept with nine women, five men and a number of (to varying degrees) humanoid aliens. Jason became a romantic foil for the recurring character of Benny, with their marriage being the centrepiece for the New Adventure Happy Endings (by Paul Cornell), itself celebrating the whole New Adventures line as its fiftieth book. We see them as a happily married couple in Return of the Living Dad. However, when the BBC withdrew the Doctor Who licence, the New Adventures planned to continue with Benny as the lead character and an editorial decision was taken to split up Benny and Jason, as depicted in Eternity Weeps. The Benny-led New Adventures launched with Benny a single woman, but Jason remained an intermittently recurring character. He remarries in Deadfall, but his new wife does not appear again in the series. When the New Adventures came to an end, Jason was trapped in an alternative dimension regarded as the equivalent of Hell, but Benny's adventures continued with an ongoing series of novels and audio dramas by Big Finish Productions and, through an agreement with creator Dave Stone, Jason re-appeared. The character is portrayed by Stephen Fewell in the audio dramas. The Big Finish series has restarted Benny's relationship with Jason, but it is strongly implied in The End of the World that he has been killed. The Virgin Missing Adventures novel Burning Heart (also by Stone) hints that Jason and Benny may at one point have children. In the novel, the Sixth Doctor and Peri journey to the 32nd century and meet a man named Kane, who expected the Doctor to recognise him.

Thompson passes the time partying and drinking with the American Marines stationed on the island. Sergeant Tim O'Hara, nicknamed by Sadie as \\"Handsome\\", falls in love with her. Her wild behavior soon becomes more than the Davidsons can stand and Mr. Davidson confronts Sadie, resolving to save her soul. When she dismisses his offer, Davidson has the Governor order her deported to San Francisco, California, where she is wanted for an unspecified crime (for which she says she was framed). She begs Davidson to allow her to remain on the island a few more days ‚Äì her plan is to flee to Sydney, Australia. During a heated argument with Davidson, she experiences a religious conversion and agrees to return to San Francisco and the jail sentence awaiting her there. The evening before she is to leave, Sergeant O'Hara asks Sadie to marry him and offers to hide her until the Sydney boat sails, but she refuses. Later, while native drums beat, the repressed Davidson rapes Sadie. The next morning he is found dead on the beach ‚Äì a suicide. Davidson's hypocrisy and betrayal cause Thompson to return to her old self and she goes off to Sydney with O'Hara to start a new life.

The unglamorous role for Crawford, and bold story (religious hypocrisy being its main theme), caught Depression-era audiences off guard. Motion Picture Herald commented, > Because the producers have made such a strong attempt to establish the stern > impressiveness of the story, it is rather slow. In its drive to become > powerful, it appears to have lost the spark of spontaneity. ... Joan > Crawford and Walter Huston are satisfactory. Variety noted, > It turns out to be a mistake to have assigned the Sadie Thompson role to > Miss Crawford. It shows her off unfavorably. The dramatic significance of it > all is beyond her range. ...

Born in Victoria, British Columbia, he studied piano with Alberto Guerrero at the Toronto Conservatory of Music in 1945. He received a Mus.B. in 1947 and a Mus.M. in 1961 from the University of Toronto, Faculty of Music. From 1950 to 1951, he studied with Nadia Boulanger in Paris. He started teaching in the Faculty of Music at the University of Toronto in 1952. From 1970 to 1977, he was the dean of the faculty. He was founding director of the Institute for Canadian Music at the University of Toronto. He retired in 1990. He has written over 130 compositions covering stage, orchestral, chamber, solo and choral genres. In 1987, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada. ==Education== In 1945, after several years of studying piano at the Royal Conservatory of Music (RCM), Beckwith received a Royal Conservatory scholarship, which allowed him to study piano with Alberto Guerrero at the University of Toronto. His other professors included Leo Smith and John Weinzweig and it was here that he obtained his B.Mus. In 1950 he was awarded a second scholarship, this time from the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association. This scholarship allowed him to travel to Paris, where he studied composition under Nadia Boulanger. He has received five honorary doctorates from Canadian universities; McGill University (Quebec), Mount Allison University (New Brunswick), Queen's University (Ontario), University of Victoria (British Columbia) and the University of Guelph (Ontario). ==Career== After studying in Paris, Beckwith returned to Toronto to pursue further studies and became active as a performing musician, actor, critic, radio commentator, writer, lecturer and broadcaster. In 1952, he returned to the University of Toronto, but this time as a part-time lecturer at the Faculty of Music. He was then appointed full-time lecturer in 1955. He remained in this position for several years, and even served a term as the Dean of the faculty from 1970 to 1977. Beckwith was appointed the first Jean A. Chalmers Professor of Canadian Music and the first director of the Institute for Canadian Music at the University of Toronto. He retired in 1990 with plans to devote more time to composing. Some of his notable pupils include Brian Cherney, Gustav Ciamaga, Omar Daniel, John Fodi, Clifford Ford, Ben McPeek, James Rolfe, Clark Ross, Matthew Davidson, and Timothy Sullivan. While teaching, Beckwith remained active in several areas of the musical community. He wrote for the Toronto Star from 1959 to 1965 as an arts critic and columnist and planned a number of documentaries and music series for CBC radio. Beginning in 1981, he worked as a director for the Canadian Musical Heritage Society, which he had co-founded that same year. He prepared two of the Society's 25-volume series of pre-1950 Canadian-composed music. In 1986, the Anthology of Canadian music included a five-record set of his music. A collection of 25 of his music articles and talks was published by Golden Dog Press in 1997 under the title Music Papers. The Canadian Conference of the Arts awarded Beckwith with its Dipl√¥me d'honneur in 1996 and he was made an honorary member of the Canadian University Music Society in 1999. ==Composition== Beckwith has composed over 130 large works. While the majority of his works are settings of Canadian texts for voice, he also has many compositions for orchestral and chamber groups, as well as solo instrumental pieces and choral music. While some of his music explores 20th Century techniques, most of his compositions have themes that connect in some way to historical or regional Canada. He spent much of his time creating arrangements of Canadian folk songs, and has set around 200 of these songs, including Four Love Songs (1969) and Five Songs (1969‚Äì70). Most of these were set between the years 1981 and 1991 during his involvement with Music at Sharon (a summer concert series in Ontario). Beckwith collaborated with many Canadian writers when setting tect for voice, including James Reaney, Jay Macpherson, Margaret Atwood, and Dennis Lee. The longest of these collaborations was with James Reaney. ==List of works== As recorded in the Encyclopedia of Music in Canada at ===Stage=== *The Killdeer, incidental (Reaney). 1960, rescored 1961.

The current owner and operator of the lease is Mineral Resources Limited (MRL) who took over from Cliffs Natural Resources in July 2018. MRL currently mine the ore and transport it to the port of Esperance ==History== The first European to visit the area was Charles Cooke Hunt in 1864 who explored the Koolyanobbing range that is situated nearby. The next European to visit the area, in 1887 and later in 1891, was a gold prospector named Henry Dowd, who thought that the rocks in the area were of no value. He recorded his findings and stored them in a bottle that was buried next to a survey peg and which was found again in 1963 at what is now known as Dowd Hill. Iron ore was first mined at Koolyanobbing from around 1950. It was sent by truck to Southern Cross from where it was shipped by rail to Wundowie, where there was a state-owned blast furnace. The town was established to service a new iron ore mine in the 1960s at Dowd Hill. The town was gazetted in 1965.

It is a sequel to Dobbs's novel, Winston's War, which is based on the events surrounding the demise of Neville Chamberlain and the appointment of Winston Churchill as Prime Minister. ‚ÄúChurchill‚Ä¶ is the greatest human being ever to occupy 10 Downing Street‚Äù. So concludes Roy Jenkins in his definitive biography of the great wartime leader. Michael Dobbs, the author of this novel, states in an after note, ‚Äúthe world will never know the full debt of gratitude it owes to Winston Spencer Churchill‚Äù. Never Surrender begins with Europe in turmoil. The date is May 10, 1940. Germany has just completed its conquest of Denmark and Norway and has turned its attack to the west by invading France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The government of the United Kingdom is in chaos. Neville Chamberlain has stepped down or been forced from the Prime Minister's office. And the man nobody really wants, the highly unpopular Winston Churchill, has been chosen to succeed him. Within days of his taking office, the Low Countries have been overrun and the mighty French army is crumbling to crushing defeat in the face of Germany‚Äôs blitzkrieg. The governments of France and Belgium are about to capitulate. The British Expeditionary Force, transported to the continent during the months of ‚ÄúPhoney War‚Äù, have been cut off from their French allies and are scattered and stranded along the Channel coastline.

Trothmoot 2016 was held at Fort Flagler in Nordland, Washington. ==Objectives and organization== The Troth defines itself as a religious organization of Germanic Heathenry open to all the forms of the religion (Asatru, Urglaawe, Forn Sed, Theodism, and others) international in scope, with training clergy, promoting cooperation and community, and providing information and educational publications as objectives. The Mission Statement refers to the ancient virtues of \\"Boldness, Truth, Honor, Troth, Self-Rule, Hospitality, Industry, Self-Reliance, Steadfastness, Equality, Strength, Wisdom, Generosity, and Family Responsibility.\\" ==Publications== The Troth publishes a quarterly journal called Idunna, an annual Old Heathen's Almanac,Barbara Ardinger, Pagan Every Day: Finding the Extraordinary in Our Ordinary Lives.

The organization suffered a series of setbacks and disasters during the late 1980s to early 1990s. The leadership of both Thorsson and Chisholm became controversial because of their association with the Satanist Temple of Set. In 1988 to 1989, Rob Meek campaigned against the \\"Satanist infiltration\\" of the group. The √Åsatr√∫ Alliance in 1989 declared that there could be no association of √Åsatr√∫ and Satanism. In 1991, Thorsson and Chisholm sought for a new leader (Steersman) of the group, as it had become clear that they were too controversial to fill this position. The office of Steerswoman was eventually accepted by Prudence Priest in 1992. Internal controversy continued to plague the group, however, including accusations that Priest was intending to pass leadership back to Thorsson and attempting to marginalize the increasingly influential Stephan Grundy. As a consequence, Priest was ousted by William Bainbridge in 1995, who took over as interim Steersman. By the mid-1990s, the Troth, now led by William Bainbridge, had emerged as a stable organization with a wide spectrum of members situated \\"squarely within the Wiccan/neopagan community\\".Kaplan, Radical Religion, pp. 21-29. Bainbridge was followed by Diana Paxson (1999), Stefn Thorsman (2002), Mark Donegan (2005), Patricia Lafayllve (2008), Victoria Clare (2010), Steve Abell (2013) and Rob Schreiwer (2016). ==Approach within Heathenry== The Troth is prominent in the non-racialist, inclusive branch of modern-day heathenry.Mattias Gardell, Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism, Durham, New Hampshire: Duke University Press, 2003, , pp. 163-64: \\"To the abhorrence of spokespersons from the other two Norse pagan (ethnic and racist) perspectives, Ring-affiliated kindreds boasted Jewish, black, homosexual, and transsexual members, and had no problems with biracial marriages. . . . the Ring of Troth promotes the pagan revival without discriminating.\\"Kaplan, \\"Reconstruction\\", p. 214: \\"the gulf which separates the Alliance from the Ring of Troth\\"; p. 224: \\"the leadership of the Ring of Troth has been the most outspoken in their opposition to racialism.\\" The organization's statement of purpose and bylaws refer to \\"non-discriminatory groups and individuals\\" and specify that \\"Discrimination [based on criteria such as race, gender, ethnic origin, or sexual orientation] shall not be practiced by The Troth, its programs, departments, officers, or any affiliated group, whether in membership decisions or the conduct of any of its activities.\\"Troth By Laws ratified June 2011, About Us, The Troth, retrieved July 26, 2013.

It was presented as a companion piece to L'Allegro, a vision of poetic mirth. The speaker of this reflective ode dispels \\"vain deluding Joys\\" from his mind in a ten-line prelude, before invoking \\"divinest Melancholy\\" to inspire his future verses. The melancholic mood is idealised by the speaker as a means by which to \\"attain / To something like prophetic strain,\\" and for the central action of Il Penseroso ‚Äì which, like L'Allegro, proceeds in couplets of iambic tetrameter ‚Äì the speaker speculates about the poetic inspiration that would transpire if the imagined goddess of Melancholy he invokes were his Muse. The highly digressive style Milton employs in L'Allegro and Il Penseroso dually precludes any summary of the poems' dramatic action as it renders them interpretively ambiguous to critics. However, it can surely be said that the vision of poetic inspiration offered by the speaker of Il Penseroso is an allegorical exploration of a contemplative paradigm of poetic genre. ==Background== It is uncertain when L'Allegro and Il Penseroso were composed, as they do not appear in Milton's Trinity College manuscript of poetry. However, the settings found in the poem suggest that they were possibly composed ca. 1631 shortly after Milton left Cambridge in 1629.Kerrigan 2007 p. 40 ==Poem== As prelude to his invocation of Melancholy, the speaker dismisses joy from his imagination. Its rhythm of alternate lines of iambic trimeter and iambic pentameter is identical to that of the first 10 lines of L'Allegro: :Hence vain deluding Joys, :The brood of folly without father bred, :How little you bested, :Or fill the fixed mind with all your toyes; :Dwell in som idle brain :And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess, :As thick and numberless :As the gay motes that people the Sun Beams, :Or likest hovering dreams :The fickle Pensioners of Morpheus train. (lines 1‚Äì10) The speaker invokes a Melancholy goddess, veiled in black: :But hail thou Goddess, sage and holy, :Hail divinest Melancholy :Whose Saintly visage is too bright :To hit the Sense of human sight; :And therefore to our weaker view, :O'er laid with black, staid Wisdoms hue. (lines 11‚Äì16) ... and, following the form of classical hymn, claims her heritage with the Roman pantheon: :Thee bright-haired Vesta long of yore, :To solitary Saturn bore; :His daughter she (in Saturn's reign, :Such mixture was not held a stain); (lines 23‚Äì26) Having invoked the Melancholy goddess, the speaker imagines her ideal personification: :... pensive Nun, devout and pure, :Sober, stedfast, and demure, : All in a robe of darkest grain, : Flowing with majestick train, : And sable stole of Cipres Lawn, : Over thy decent shoulders drawn. : Com, but keep thy wonted state, : With eev'n step, and musing gate, : And looks commercing with the skies, : Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes: : There held in holy passion still, : Forget thy self to Marble, till : With a sad Leaden downward cast, : Thou fix them on the earth as fast. (lines 31‚Äì44) The central action of the poem proceeds as poetic visions of Melancholy, imagined by the speaker: : Thee Chauntress oft the Woods among :I woo to hear thy even-Song; :And missing thee, I walk unseen :On the dry smooth-shaven Green, :To behold the wandring Moon, :Riding neer her highest noon, :Like one that had bin led astray :Through the Heav'ns wide pathles way; (lines 63‚Äì70) :... let my Lamp at midnight hour, : Be seen in some high lonely Tow'r, : Where I may oft out- watch the Bear, : With thrice great Hermes, or unsphear : The spirit of Plato to unfold : What Worlds, or what vast Regions hold : The immortal mind hath forsook :Her mansion in this fleshly nook: :And of those Daemons that are found :In fire, air, flood, or under ground... (lines 85‚Äì95) :And if ought else, great Bards beside, :In sage and solemn tunes have sung, :Of Turneys and of Trophies hung; :Of Forests, and inchantments drear, :Where more is meant then meets the ear. : Thus night oft see me in thy pale career, :Till civil- suited Morn appeer... (lines 116-22) :And when the Sun begins to fling :His flaring beams, me Goddess bring :To arched walks of twilight groves, :And shadows brown that Sylvan loves :Of Pine, or monumental Oake, :Where the rude Ax with heaved stroke, :Was never heard the Nymphs to daunt, :Or fright them from their hallow'd haunt. (lines 131-8) At the end of his reverie on poetic Melancholy, the speaker invokes the Muse's song; he imagines that his Muse will reward his studious devotion to her by revealing a heavenly visions: :And as I wake, sweet musick breath :Above, about, or underneath, :Sent by som spirit to mortals good, :Or th'unseen Genius of the Wood. :But let my due feet never fail, :To walk the studious Cloysters pale, :And love the high embowed Roof :With antick Pillars massy proof, :And storied Windows richly dight, :Casting a dimm religious light. :There let the pealing Organ blow, :To the full voic'd Quire below, :In Service high, and Anthems cleer, :As may with sweetnes, through mine ear... :Dissolve me into extasies, :And bring all Heav'n before mine eyes. (lines 151-67) As the final ten lines reveal, the speaker aspires to a revelation of divine knowledge to inspire his great poetry: :And may at last my weary age :Find out the peaceful hermitage, :The Hairy Gown and Mossy Cell, :Where I may sit and rightly spell :Of every Star that Heav'n doth shew, :And every Herb that sips the dew; :Till old experience do attain :To somthing like prophetic strain. :These pleasures Melancholy give, :And I with thee will choose to live. (lines 168-76) The final couplet issues an ultimatum to the Melancholy mood; the speaker will devote himself to the existence of a solitary hermit, staking his life upon the contemplative ideal he has illustrated throughout the poem, which he imagines will be rewarded by a vision of the divine. ==Themes== According to Barbara Lewalski, Il Penseroso, along with L'Allegro, \\"explore and contrast in generic terms the ideal pleasures appropriate to contrasting lifestyles ... that a poet might choose, or might choose at different times, or in sequence\\".Lewalski 2003 p. 5 In particular, Il Penseroso celebrates Melancholy through the traditional Theocritan pastoral model. The setting focuses on a Gothic scene and emphasises a solitary scholarly life. The speaker of the poem invokes a melancholic mood main character wanders through an urban environment and the descriptions are reminiscent of medieval settings. The main character, in his pursuits, devotes his time to philosophy, to allegory, to tragedy, to Classical hymns, and, finally, to Christian hymns that cause him to be filled with a vision. Besides being set in a traditional form, there is no poetic antecedent for Milton's pairing.Lewalski pp. 5‚Äì6 Melancholy, in Il Penseroso, does not have the same parentage as Mirth does in L'Allegro; Melancholy comes from Saturn and Vesta, who are connected to science and a focus on the heavens.Revard 1997 pp. 110‚Äì111 Melancholy is connected in the poem with the \\"heavenly\\" muse Urania, the goddess of inspiring epics, through her focus and through her relationship with Saturn.Revard 1997 p. 97 Furthermore, she is related to prophecy, and the prophetic account within the final lines of Il Penseroso does not suggest that isolation is ideal, but they do emphasise the importance of experience and an understanding of nature. The higher life found within the poem, as opposed to the one within L'Allegro, allows an individual to experience such a vision.Lewalski 2003 p. 7 The poems have been classified in various traditions and genres by various scholars, including: as academic writing by E.

They were the first elections since the 12 April 1980 military coup that brought Samuel Doe to power. During 1984, a new draft constitutional was approved in a referendum, which provided for a 58-member civilian and military Interim National Assembly, headed by Doe as president. After a ban on political parties was lifted, four parties ‚Äì Doe's National Democratic Party (NDP), the Liberian Action Party, the Unity Party and the Liberia Unification Party ‚Äì contested the elections. Polling was marred by allegations of widespread fraud and rigging. Official results showed that Doe won the presidential election with 50.9% of the vote, just enough to avoid a runoff. His NDP won large majorities in both houses of the Legislature. Many independent observers believed that the Liberian Action Party's Jackson Doe, who officially finished second, was the actual winner. It was later revealed that Doe had the ballots counted in a secret location by his handpicked staff. The period after the elections saw increased human rights abuses, corruption, and ethnic tensions, ultimately leading to the start of the First Liberian Civil War in 1989 and Doe's overthrow and murder in 1990. ==Background== 250px The True Whig Party, founded in 1869, was one of the oldest political parties in the world and the oldest in Africa. In power from 1877, the party was mostly composed of Americo-Liberians, who constituted less than one per cent of the population in the census of 1962. President William Tubman ruled from 1947 until his death in 1971 and William Tolbert continued afterwards, winning the 1975 elections. However, in 1980 he was overthrown in a coup; Master Sergeant led a group of conspirators and removed Tolbert from office on 12 April 1980. According to his account, the group wanted to arrest Tolbert and when he resisted, he was shot dead. A counter-insurgency operation on 16 April was put down and Samuel Doe gained full control of the government. Doe's military People Redemption Council (PRC) invoked martial law and took control of all legislative and executive powers. This led to numerous executions, rampant corruption, increasing rate of employment and decreasing health conditions. At the UN General council, the new government announced that elections would be possibly held by 1983. Doe also built his image internationally by having border issues fixed with neighbouring countries and also promised a fair trial to the family of Tolbert. During 1984, a new draft constitutional was approved in a referendum, which provided for a 58-member civilian and military Interim National Assembly, headed by Doe as president. ==Electoral system== The bicameral Legislature consisted of a 26-member Senate and a 64-member House of Representatives. Each of the 13 counties elected two Senators and at least two Representatives. Senators served a nine year term and were elected by first- past-the-post voting. Representatives were elected from single-member districts, also by first-past-the-post voting. The voting age was 18. Persons of foreign origin, insane and convicted of crimes were not eligible. Candidates for the House of Representatives were required to have been resident in the country for one year before the elections, be a taxpayer and be at least 25 years old. Senate candidates had to be at least 30. ==Campaign== After the ban on political parties was lifted, four parties, namely, Doe's National Democratic Party of Liberia, the Liberian Action Party, the Unity Party and the Liberia Unification Party contested the elections. ==Conduct== Polling was largely peaceful, but marred by allegations of widespread fraud and rigging. Many independent observers believed that the Liberian Action Party's Jackson Doe, who officially finished second, was the actual winner. It was later revealed that Samuel Doe had the ballots counted in a secret location by his handpicked staff. Though there was no official mission from the United States to validate the fair conduct of the elections, the American Assistant Secretary of State Chester A. Crocker acknowledged that there were widespread irregularities, but pointed out that the narrow margin of victory showed good amount of fair polling and the extended hours of voting proved effective in increasing the voter turnaround. He also pointed out that radio stations and newspapers provided fair coverage to all the four parties that competed. ==Results== ===President=== { class= style=text- align:right !Candidate !Party !Votes !% - align=leftSamuel Doealign=leftNational Democratic Party of Liberia264,36450.9 - align=leftJackson Doealign=leftLiberian Action Party137,27026.5 - align=leftGabriel Kpollehalign=leftLiberia Unification Party59,96511.6 - align=leftEdward Kessellyalign=leftUnity Party57,44311.1 - align=left colspan=2Invalid/blank votes ‚Äì - align=left colspan=2Total518,872100 - align=left colspan=2Registered voters/turnout977,862 - align=left colspan=4Source: Nohlen et al. } ===Parliament=== { class= style=text-align:right !rowspan=2Party !rowspan=2Votes !rowspan=2% !colspan=2Seats - !House !Senate - align=leftNational Democratic Party of Liberia264,36450.95122 - align=leftLiberian Action Party137,27026.582 - align=leftUnity Party59,96511.621 - align=leftLiberia Unification Party57,27311.031 - align=left colspan=2Invalid/blank votes ‚Äì‚Äì - align=leftTotal518,8721006426 - align=leftRegistered voters/turnout977,862 ‚Äì‚Äì - colspan=5 align=leftSource: Nohlen et al. } ==Aftermath== Doe was sworn-in as the President on 6 January and a civilian cabinet on 15 January.

Pottery techniques include the potter's wheel, slipcasting, and many others. Methods for forming powders of ceramic raw materials into complex shapes are desirable in many areas of technology. For example, such methods are required for producing advanced, high-temperature structural parts such as heat engine components, recuperators and the like from powders of ceramic raw materials. Typical parts produced with this production operation include impellers made from stainless steel, bronze, complex cutting tools, plastic mould tooling, and others. Typical materials used are: wood, metal, water, plaster, epoxy and STLs, silica, and zirconia. This production operation is well known for providing tools with dimensional stability, surface quality, density and uniformity. For instance, on the slip casting process the cast part is of high concentration of raw materials with little additive, this improves uniformity. But also, the plaster mould draws water from the poured slip to compact and form the casting at the mould surface. This forms a dense cast. ==Slip casting== There are many forming techniques to make ceramics, but one example is slipcasting. This is where slip or, liquid clay, is poured into a plaster mould. The water in the slip is drawn out into the walls of the plaster mould, leaving an inside layer of solid clay, which hardens quickly. When dry, the solid clay can then also be removed. The slip used in slip casting is often liquified with a substance that reduces the need for additional water to soften the slip; this prevents excessive shrinkage which occurs when a piece containing a lot of water dries. Slip-casting methods provide superior surface quality, density and uniformity in casting high-purity ceramic raw materials over other ceramic casting techniques, such as hydraulic casting, since the cast part is a higher concentration of ceramic raw materials with little additives. A slip is a suspension of fine raw materials powder in a liquid such as water or alcohol with small amounts of secondary materials such as dispersants, surfactants and binders. Pottery slipcasting techniques employ a plaster block or flask mould. The plaster mould draws water from the poured slip to compact and form the casting at the mould surface. This forms a dense cast removing deleterious air gaps and minimizing shrinkage in the final sintering process. ==Additive manufacturing== For the production of complex shapes in small quantities, additive manufacturing (AM) represents an effective approach, and is the subject of significant research and development. Unlike the additive manufacturing of polymeric materials, the scope of AM of ceramics remains quite limited owing to materials processing challenges. Commercially available equipment for the AM of ceramics mostly relies on layer by layer sintering of powders and is rarely cost-effective. However, the difficulties in machining ceramic articles means that AM techniques can be attractive in situations where production volumes are too low to viably produce molds for slip casting methods. In particular the additive manufacturing of ceramics from preceramic polymers using techniques including stereolithography, with subsequent pyrolysis to yield polymer derived ceramics, represents an emerging approach to tackling the challenge of additively manufactured ceramics. Wang et al. Additive Manufacturing of Ceramics from Preceramic Polymers: A Versatile Stereolithographic Approach Assisted by Thiol-Ene Click Chemistry, Additive Manufacturing 2019 volume 27 pages 80 -90 ==Ceramic shell casting== Ceramic shell casting techniques using silica, zirconia and other refractory materials are currently used by the metal parts industry for 'net casting', forming precision shell moulds for molten metal casting. The technique involves a successive wet dipping and dry powder coating or stucco to build up the mould shell layer. The shell casting method in general is known for dimensional stability and is used in many net-casting processes for aerospace and other industries in molten metal casting. Automated facilities use multiple wax patterns on trees, large slurry mixers and fluidic powder beds for automated dipping. ==Technical ceramics== When forming technical ceramic materials from dry powders prepared for processing, the method of forming into the shape required depends upon the method of material preparation and size and shape of the part to be formed. Materials prepared for dry powder forming are most commonly formed by \\"dry\\" pressing in mechanical or hydraulic powder compacting presses selected for the necessary force and powder fill depth. Dry powder is automatically discharged into the non-flexible steel or tungsten carbide insert in the die and punches then compact the powder to the shape of the die. If the part is to be large and unable to have pressure transmit suitably for a uniform pressed density then isostatic pressing may be used. When isostatically pressed the powder takes the shape of a flexible membrane acting as the mould, forming the shape and size of the pressed powder. Isostatic presses can be either high speed, high output type of automatic presses for such parts as ceramic insulators for spark plugs or sand blast nozzles, or slower operating \\"wet bag\\" presses that are much more manual in operation but suitable particularly for large machinable blanks or blanks that will be cut or otherwise formed in secondary operations to the final shape. If technical ceramic parts are needed where the length to diameter ratio is very large, extrusion may be used. There are two types of ceramic extruders one being piston type with hydraulic force pushing a ram that in turn is pushing the ceramic through the loaded material cylinder to and through the die which forms the extrudate. The second type of extruder is a screw, or auger, type where a screw turns forcing the material to and through the die which again shapes the part. In both types of extrusion the raw material must be plasticized to allow and induce the flow of the material in the process. Complex technical ceramic parts are commonly formed using either the injection moulding process or \\"hot wax moulding.\\" Both rely on heat sensitive plasticizers to allow material flow into a die. The part is then quickly cooled for removal from the die. Ceramic injection moulding is much like plastic injection moulding using various polymers for plasticizing. Hot wax moulding largely uses paraffin wax. ==Other techniques== There are also several traditional techniques of handbuilding, such as pinching, soft slab, hard slab, and coil construction. Other techniques involve threading animal or artificial wool fiber through paperclay slip, to build up layers of material. The result can be wrapped over forms or cut, dried and later joined with liquid and soft paperclay. When forming very thin sheets of ceramic material, \\"tape casting\\" is commonly used. This involves pouring the slip (which contains a polymer \\"binder\\" to give it strength) onto a moving carrier belt, and then passing it under a stationary \\"doctor blade\\" to adjust the thickness. The moving slip is then air dried, and the \\"tape\\" thus formed is peeled off the carrier belt, cut into rectangular shapes, and processed further. As many as 100 tape layers, alternating with conductive metal powder layers, can be stacked up. These are then sintered (\\"fired\\") to remove the polymer and thus make \\"multilayer\\" capacitors, sensors, etc. According to D. W. Richerson of the American Ceramic Society, more than a billion of such capacitors are manufactured every day. (About 100 are in a typical cellular telephone, and about a thousand in a typical automobile.) Gel casting is another technique used to create engineering ceramics. ==See also== * Ceramic mold casting * Chalkware ==References== Category:Pottery Category:Ceramic materials Category:Artistic techniques ","title":"Ceramic forming techniques"},{"id":"2559880","text":"is one of the eleven wards in the city of Kyoto, in Kyoto Prefecture, Japan.

Phyletic gradualism is a model of evolution which theorizes that most speciation is slow, uniform and gradual.Eldredge, N. and S. J. Gould (1972). \\"Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism\\" In T.J.M. Schopf, ed., Models in Paleobiology. San Francisco: Freeman Cooper. p. 84. When evolution occurs in this mode, it is usually by the steady transformation of a whole species into a new one (through a process called anagenesis). In this view no clear line of demarcation exists between an ancestral species and a descendant species, unless splitting occurs. The theory is contrasted with punctuated equilibrium. ==History== The word phyletic derives from the Greek œÜœÖŒªŒµœÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ ph≈´letikos, which conveys the meaning of a line of descent.œÜœÖŒªŒµœÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ ph≈´letikos originates from œÜœÖŒªŒ≠œÑŒ∑œÇ ph≈´letƒìs \\"one of the same tribe,\\" from œÜœÖŒªŒÆ phulƒì, \\"clan, race, people\\", derived from œÜœçŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ phuesthai, \\"to descend, to originate.\\" Phyletic gradualism contrasts with the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which proposes that most evolution occurs isolated in rare episodes of rapid evolution, when a single species splits into two distinct species, followed by a long period of stasis or non-change. These models both contrast with variable-speed evolution (\\"variable speedism\\"), which maintains that different species evolve at different rates, and that there is no reason to stress one rate of change over another.Dawkins, Richard. 1996. The Blind Watchmaker. New York: W. W. Norton & Company. Futuyma, Douglas. 2005. Evolution. Sunderland MA: Sinauer Associates, pp. 86-89 Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins argues that constant-rate gradualism is not present in the professional literature, thereby the term serves only as a straw-man for punctuated-equilibrium advocates. In his book The Blind Watchmaker, Dawkins observes that Charles Darwin himself was not a constant-rate gradualist, as suggested by Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould. In the first edition of On the Origin of Species, Darwin stated that \\"Species of different genera and classes have not changed at the same rate, or in the same degree. In the oldest tertiary beds a few living shells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct forms... The Silurian Lingula differs but little from the living species of this genus\\".Charles Darwin, 1859. On the origin of species London: John Murray. 1st edition, p. 313. Lingula is among the few brachiopods surviving today but also known from fossils over 500 million years old. In the fifth edition of The Origin of Species, Darwin wrote that \\"the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form\\".

The band released nine full-length studio albums between 1982 and 1995. ==History== Toxic Reasons formed in Dayton, Ohio in 1979. The founding members were Bruce Stuckey (bass guitar and vocals), Joel Agne (guitar and vocals), Ed Pittman (lead vocals) and Mark Patterson (drums). In 1980, Agne left the band and was replaced by Greg Stout on bass, while Stuckey switched to lead guitar. In 1981, Patterson left the band and was replaced by James J. \\"J.J.\\" Pearson on drums. Rob \\"Snot\\" Lucjak also joined on rhythm guitar. They recorded their first studio album, Independence, at Keystone Recording in Indianapolis, Indiana, then went on tour and moved to San Francisco, where their label, Risky Records, was located. David \\"Tufty\\" Clough (formerly of Zero Boys) joined the band on bass guitar. Pittman left the group following the release of Independence. During this time, the band created a logo showing the U.S., Canadian, and British flags joined together. The symbol not only represented their tri-national roots (Pearson from Canada, Clough and Lucjak from England, and Stuckey from the U.S.), but also came to symbolize the diversity of their sound, which mixed fast hardcore punk with melodic guitar lines and elements of punk-reggae. The band's last album, No Peace in Our Time (1995), was the first-ever punk rock CD-ROM released for Mac and Windows. It included short videos, a history of the band's history as told by Stuckey and a karaoke competition with \\"White Noise\\". Several songs from No Peace in Our Time appeared in the 1997 feature film The Waiter, directed by G. Allen Johnson. ==Later projects== In 2007, Pearson released a solo album, Only One Reason. Clough later rejoined the reformed Zero Boys. Pittman currently plays with the band New Regrets. ==Band members== *Bruce Stuckey - guitar, vocals (1979‚Äì1995) *Ed Pittman - lead vocals (1979‚Äì1983) *Mark Patterson - drums (1979-1981) *Joel Agne - guitar, vocals (1979‚Äì1980) *Greg Stout - bass (1980-1982) *Jimmy Joe \\"J.J.\\" Pearson - drums, vocals (1981‚Äì1995) *Rob \\"Snot\\" Lucjak - bass, guitar, vocals (1981‚Äì1985) *David \\"Tufty\\" Clough - bass, vocals (1982‚Äì1995) *Terry Howe - guitar (1986; died 2000) *Federico \\"Fefo\\" Forconi - guitar (1988-1989) == Discography== ===Studio albums=== *Independence (1982, Risky Records) *Kill By Remote Control (1984, Sixth International Records) *Within These Walls (1985, Treason Records) *Bullets for You (1986, T-Reason Records) *Dedication 1979-1988 (1988, SFunhouse Records) *Anything for Money (1989, SPV/Hellhound) *Fashion for Fascism (1990, Lone Wolf Records) *In the House of God (1993, Bitzcore) *No Peace in Our Time (1995, Bitzcore, 1995) ===Singles and EPs=== *\\"War Hero\\" 7\\" single (1980, Banit Records) *\\"Ghost Town\\" 7\\" single (1981, Risky Records) *\\"God Bless America \\" 7\\" single (1984, T-Reason Records) *Nobody Tells Us 7\\" EP (1990, Selfless Records) *Toxic Reasons/ZB split 7\\" EP with Zero Boys (1992, Selfless Records) ===Live albums=== *Live Berkeley Square December 1981 (2014, Beer City Records) ==References== Category:Musical groups from Dayton, Ohio Category:Hardcore punk groups from Ohio Category:Alternative Tentacles artists Category:Musical groups from Ohio Category:Hellhound_Records_artists ","title":"Toxic Reasons"},{"id":"2559948","text":"The Mandara Mountains looking north-east from Jimeta/Yola. Kapsiki Peak near Rhumsiki is one of the most photographed parts of the Mandara. The Mandara Mountains are a volcanic range extending about 190 km (about 120 mi) along the northern part of the Cameroon‚ÄìNigeria border, from the Benue River in the south () to the north-west of Maroua in the north (). The highest elevation is the summit of Mount Oupay, at 1,494 m (4,900 ft) above sea level (). The region is densely populated, mainly by speakers of Chadic languages, including both the Mofu and the Kirdi ethnic groups. Extensive archaeological research has been undertaken in the Mandara Mountains, including work at Diy-Gid-Biy (DGB) sites. == Geology == The Mandara Mountains were formed millions of years ago when a continental plate of basement rock deep beneath the African continent rose up, fragmenting and splitting as it was pushed to the surface. The climate was significantly wetter in those times, so enormous amounts of precipitation formed numerous rivers that rushed through these fractures, carving them deeper and wider, resulting in the range's notably rugged terrain. Volcanic activity also played a role in the formation of the range. Eruptions of lava formed volcanic cones whose vents were eventually plugged with hardening magma. These hardened cores are called volcanic plugs. In the case of the Mandara Mountains, the plugs were much more erosion-resistant than the exterior of the cones, which wore away over time. Eventually, only the plugs remained, forming the stark, needle-like spires such as Kapsiki Peak that the range is known for.

Alfredson performed as Lindeman in the revues Gr√∂na hund (1962), Gula hund (1964), L√•dan (1966-1967) and Under dubbelg√∂ken (1979). Every evening when the revues were played, an interviewer played by Lasse O'M√•nsson or Tage Danielsson would mention a topic from that day's newspaper and introduce a character called Lindeman. Alfredson would then improvise over the given topic. Alfredson got the idea for the Lindeman sketches when he visited New York City together with Povel Ramel, and went to a so-called \\"instant theater\\" in Greenwich Village. The audience were allowed to request sketches on different topics, but Alfredson was unimpressed by the fact that when he and Ramel returned on the next evening, the actors performed the same \\"improvised\\" sketches. The different incarnations of Lindeman were thus all different, and had different occupations which in some way related to the topic of the day. In the first series of Lindeman sketches in Gr√∂na hund in 1962, all the characters had the first name Valfrid and were interviewed by O'M√•nsson. The recurring punchline for this first series was that they always ended up with that evening's Lindeman having his waistcoat stuck in his trouser zipper. In Gula hund, the Lindemen were introduced as Valfrid's son, Malte. The waistcoat-and-trousers running gag was abandoned, and it was Danielsson who acted as the interviwer from this point onwards. In L√•dan and Under dubbelg√∂ken, the Lindemen had different first names, and were occasionally female. Alfredson and Danielsson also released a number of LP records with Lindeman sketches, all in all 1,200 different records. In an interview in 1982, when the duo had sold 350,000 copies of their records, Alfredson declared that he would not perform the character again, saying \\"Lindeman is dead, and the final record was posthumous.\\" ==References== Category:Swedish humour ","title":"Lindeman (characters)"},{"id":"2559955","text":"Decommissioned and removed in late 2019.

He is best known for his work on Final Fantasy and SaGa franchise of role-playing video games. He was the majority shareholder for The Game Designers Studio, a shell corporation founded in June 1999 by Square and re-purposed in 2002 to exploit a loophole with the company's exclusivity deal to develop for Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation consoles. ==Biography== ===Joining Square=== Kawazu studied ceramics at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Kawazu was invited by a friend to work at the gaming magazine published by Softbank called \\"Beep\\". He stated that he had always been interested in board games, and after a time joined Square Co. in 1985. ===Early years=== His first game at Square Co. was Rad Racer, creating the ending sequence showing a player's accomplishments. ===Final Fantasy=== He and Hironobu Sakaguchi had wanted to make a role playing game for a long time, and were fans of Wizardry and Ultima, but were concerned it would not sell. After the success in Japan of Dragon Quest, and the popular desire for an RPG proven, development began. Kawazu took over the development of the battle sequence and system, and tried to model it as much after Dungeons and Dragons as he could. Part of the development was to add western fantasy gaming rules, such as a fire monster being vulnerable to ice, which at the time were not features of Japanese gaming. ===Later games=== Production on The Last Remnant began after the remake of Romancing SaGa for the PlayStation 2 was completed. Kawazu was also involved in the development of \\"It's New Frontier\\" (sic). During the development of Final Fantasy XII, Yasumi Matsuno, who was the lead on the game, left half way through, and Kawazu took over. ===Game style=== Board games such as Avalon Hill and Dungeons & Dragons influence a lot of Kawazu's development process. When creating a new game, he examines the elements like a board game and makes that the working foundation. ==Gameography== *Rad Racer ‚Äì Game design *Final Fantasy ‚Äì Game design *Final Fantasy II ‚Äì Game design *The Final Fantasy Legend ‚Äì Director and scenario *Final Fantasy Legend II ‚Äì Director and scenario *Romancing SaGa ‚Äì Director, scenario, system design, and battle design *Romancing SaGa 2 ‚Äì Director, scenario, and game design *Romancing SaGa 3 ‚Äì Director *Rudra no Hih≈ç ‚Äì Supervisor *SaGa Frontier ‚Äì Producer and director *SaGa Frontier 2 ‚Äì Producer *Racing Lagoon ‚Äì Producer *Legend of Mana ‚Äì Producer *Hataraku Chocobo ‚Äì Producer *Wild Card ‚Äì Game design *Unlimited Saga ‚Äì Producer and director *Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles ‚Äì Producer *Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song ‚Äì Producer and director *Code Age Commanders ‚Äì Executive producer *Final Fantasy XII ‚Äì Executive producer *Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates ‚Äì Executive producer *Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings ‚Äì Executive producer *Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King ‚Äì Executive producer *Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift ‚Äì Executive producer *Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a Darklord ‚Äì Executive producer *Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: The Crystal Bearers ‚Äì Executive producer, scenario writer *The Last Remnant ‚Äì Executive producer, scenario writer *It's New Frontier ‚Äì Design *Emperors SaGa ‚Äì Executive Producer *Imperial SaGa ‚Äì Executive Producer *SaGa: Scarlet Grace ‚Äì Game designer and scenario writer *Imperial SaGa: Eclipse ‚Äì Executive Producer ==References== Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:SaGa Category:People from Kumamoto Prefecture Category:Japanese video game designers Category:Final Fantasy designers Category:Tokyo Institute of Technology alumni Category:Square Enix people ","title":"Akitoshi Kawazu"},{"id":"2559987","text":"Penaeus monodon, commonly known as the giant tiger prawn,Asian tiger shrimp, black tiger shrimp, and other names, is a marine crustacean that is widely reared for food. Tiger prawns displayed in a supermarket ==Taxonomy== Penaeus monodon was first described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1798. That name was overlooked for a long time, until 1949 when Lipke Holthuis clarified to which species it referred. Holthuis also showed that P. monodon had to be the type species of the genus Penaeus. ==Description== Females can reach about long, but are typically long and weigh ; males are slightly smaller at long and weighing . The carapace and abdomen are transversely banded with alternative red and white. The antennae are grayish brown. Brown pereiopods and pleopods are present with fringing setae in red. ==Distribution== Its natural distribution is the Indo-Pacific, ranging from the eastern coast of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, as far as Southeast Asia, the Pacific Ocean, and northern Australia. It is an invasive species in the northern waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean off the southern US. === Invasive species === The first occurrence of P. monodon in the U.S. was in November 1988. Close to 300 shrimp were captured off the South Eastern shore after an accidental release from an aquaculture facility. This species can now be caught in waters from Texas to North Carolina. Although P. monodon has been an invasive species for many years, they have yet to grow large established populations.Knott, D.M., P.L. Fuller, A.J. Benson, and M.E. Neilson, 2019, Penaeus monodon: U.S. Geological Survey, Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database, Gainesville, FL However, escapes in other parts of the world have led to established P. monodon populations, such as West Africa, Brazil, and the Caribbean.Fuller, P., Knott, D., Kingsley-Smith, P., Morris, J., Buckel, C., Hunter, M., & Hartman, L.

In 2009, 770,000 tonnes were produced, with a total value of US$3,650,000,000. P. monodon makes up nearly fifty percent of cultured shrimp alone.Khedkar, Gulab Dattarao; Reddy, A Chandrashekar; Ron, Tetszuan Benny; Haymer, David.SpringerPlus; Heidelberg Vol. 2, Iss. 1, (Dec 2013): 1-8. DOI:10.1186/2193-1801-2-671 The prawn is popular to culture because of its tolerance to salinity and very quick growth rate. However, they are very vulnerable to fungal, viral, and bacterial infections.\\"Giant Tiger Prawn\\". Sea Grant Extension Project. Louisiana State University Diseases such as white spot disease and yellowhead disease have led to a great economic impact in shrimp industries around the globe.Flegel, T. World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology (1997) 13: 433. They can receive transmitted diseases from other crustaceans such as the Australian red claw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus), who is susceptible to yellowhead disease and has shown to transmit it to P. monodon in places like Thailand.Soowannayan, C., Nguyen, G. T., Pham, L. N., Phanthura, M., & Nakthong, N. (2015) Australian red claw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) is susceptible to yellow head virus (YHV) infection and can transmit it to the black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon). Aquaculture, 445, 63‚Äì69. P. monodon has been farmed throughout the world including areas such as West Africa, Hawaii, Tahiti and England. For optimal growth, P. monodon is raised in waters between 28¬∞C and 33¬∞C. Characteristically for the Penaeus genus, P. monodon has a natural ability to survive and grow in a wide range of salinity, though the optimal salinity for the prawn is around 15-25 ppt.Shekhar, M S; Kiruthika, J; Rajesh, S; Ponniah, A G.Molecular Biology Reports; Dordrecht Vol. 41, Iss. 9, (Sep 2014): 6275-89. While in a farm setting the shrimp are typically feed a compound diet which is produced in dried pellets. By mixing the diet to have compound feeds and fresh feed, P. monodon showed to have better reproductive performance. == Sustainable consumption == In 2010, Greenpeace added Penaeus monodon to its seafood red list ‚Äì \\"a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries\\". The reasons given by Greenpeace was \\"destruction of vast areas of mangroves in several countries, over-fishing of juvenile shrimp from the wild to supply farms, and significant human rights abuses\\". ==Basic research== In an effort to understand whether DNA repair processes can protect crustaceans against infection, basic research was conducted to elucidate the repair mechanisms used by P. monodon.Srivastava S, Dahal S, Naidu SJ, Anand D, Gopalakrishnan V, Kooloth Valappil R, Raghavan SC. DNA double-strand break repair in Penaeus monodon is predominantly dependent on homologous recombination. DNA Res. 2017 Apr 1;24(2):117-128. . It was found that repair of DNA double-strand breaks is predominantly carried out by accurate homologous recombinational repair. Another less accurate process, microhomology-mediated end joining is also used to repair such breaks. ==See also== *Macrobrachium rosenbergii, the giant freshwater prawn ==References== Category:Penaeidae Category:Edible crustaceans Category:Commercial crustaceans Category:Crustaceans described in 1798 Category:Taxa named by Johan Christian Fabricius ","title":"Penaeus monodon"},{"id":"2559994","text":"Richard Cory Kostelanetz (born May 14, 1940) is an American artist, author, and critic. ==Birth and Education== Kostelanetz was born to Boris Kostelanetz and Ethel Cory and is the nephew of the conductor Andre Kostelanetz.

Strategically located in the Mahim Bay, the fort overlooks Worli to the south, Bandra to the north, and Mahim to the east. The origins of the fort are unclear, but it occupies a strategic location that has been frequently contested. The fort is currently in disrepair, suffering from administrative neglect, encroachment of slums, and exposure to tidal erosion. ==History== In 1516, Portuguese commander Dom Joao de Monoy entered the Mahim Creek and defeated the commander of Mahim fort. The fort was the site of frequent skirmishes between the Portuguese and the Ali Shah, a Gujarati ruler, before the island of Mahim was appropriated from Bahadur Shah of Gujarat by the Portuguese in 1534. In 1661, the Portuguese ceded the island of Mahim as dowry to Charles II of England. After the English gained control of the fort, it was strengthened by Sir Thomas Grantham in 1684, and became a strategic watchtower against possible Portuguese attacks, and later from the Marathas. In 1772, the Portuguese attempted to attack this fort, but they were repelled by the British with cannonballs. The Mount Mary's Basilica was damaged during this encounter. According to historical accounts, the fort had 100 soldiers and 30 cannons at that time. The fort was captured by the British during the First Anglo-Maratha War. ==Encroachments== The fort lies off the Mahim Causeway which links the suburbs to the city. The fort is heavily encroached by slums, and parts of the fort have caved in due to tidal erosion and neglect. Though the site is classified as a Grade I heritage structure, nothing much has been done to maintain it. Large boulders are strewn on the sand and crevices as high as three metres (fifteen feet) are visible. Responsibility of the fort is shuffled between the state government and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, although the fort lies of state government land. In 2004, rupees five lakhs had to be returned as the encroachments were not removed by local authorities. Later, in 2008, Jairaj Phatak, the Municipal Commissioner had proposed a makeover to the fort. ==Gallery== File:Mahim Fort 1.jpg File:Mahim Fort 2.jpg File:Mahim Fort 3.jpg File:Mahim Fort 4.jpg File:Mahim Fort 5.jpg File:Mahim Fort 6.jpg File:Mahim Fort 7.jpg File:Mahim Fort 8.jpg File:Mahim Fort 9.jpg File:Mahim Fort 10.jpg File:Mahim Fort 11.jpg File:Mahim Fort 12.jpg File:Mahim Fort 13.jpg File:Mahim Fort 14.jpg File:Mahim Fort 15.jpg File:Castella de Aguada 1.jpg File:Castella de Aguada 2.jpg File:Castella de Aguada 3.jpg File:Castella de Aguada 4.jpg File:Castella de Aguada 14.jpg ==See also== *List of forts in Maharashtra ==References== ==External links== *Mahim Fort Category:Archaeological sites in Maharashtra Category:History of Mumbai Category:1516 in India Category:1772 in India Category:1534 establishments in the Portuguese Empire ","title":"Mahim Fort"},{"id":"2560007","text":"30 St. Mary Axe (left) and Tower 42.

Barden Ridge is located 29 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the Sutherland Shire. Barden Ridge is colloquially known to locals as 'The Ridge'. ==Location== Barden Ridge is located on the Woronora River, which flows north into the Georges River. 'The Needles', is a body of water (ria) on the Woronora River, on one of the original roads west from Helensburgh. On the northern side of the ria lies the fresh water source of the Woronora River, whilst on the other side is salt water. The water, between two steep hills, remains so cold that even during summer it has been known to have caused heart attacks. While car access has been generally blocked, pedestrian access is still available. This area is also popular for recreational activities such as hiking and mountain biking. Barden Ridge has shifted from a remote bushland area to an exclusive suburb that now contains all the necessary amenities that have established a strong community. ==History== Barden Ridge was named after Alfred Barden, whose pioneering family is associated with the Bangor area prior to the 1850s. In early times Barden Ridge had been used to identify the geographical location was later given to the suburb that developed here.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia The suburb was originally named Lucas Heights. The land was originally home to the Dharawal People. The area has faced several extreme bushfire incidents, with the most notable evacuation occurring in the early 2000s. ==Demographics== According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 4,329 residents in Barden Ridge. 83.0% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 2.8%. 85.0% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religious affiliation were Catholic 29.9%, Anglican 22.9%, No Religion 16.9% and Eastern Orthodox 5.0%.50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. ==Transport== The nearest train station is at Sutherland on the Sydney Trains Illawarra line and South Coast lines. There is also another close railway station at Padstow, New South Wales. Transdev NSW, formerly Veolia and Southtrans, operates the local bus service. In 2005, the Bangor Bypass was completed. It takes motorists directly from Sutherland to Barden Ridge, instead of passing through Menai and Bangor. A new section of the Bypass was constructed and passes by Barden Ridge improving the current access to the area and Heathcote Road (to the south). ==Sport and recreation== The Ridge Sports Complex is a major sporting facility on the western side of New Illawarra Road. It features playing fields and associated amenities buildings, netball courts, men's shed, dog park, BMX track, synthetic athletics track, a golf driving range, The Ridge Golf Course, and club facilities to service the needs of the sporting and golfing community. Also planned for this area are hockey fields.http://www.bardenridgebacks.com.au/ There is also another Baseball/AFL oval and a park directly adjacent to Lucas Heights Community School, which itself has two sporting fields and three basketball courts. Shire Christian School also has a sporting field and two multi-use tennis courts. There are other parks and nature reserves scattered throughout the suburb. Barden Ridge is home to the Barden Ridgebacks Football Club, the Barden Ridgebacks Netball Club, the Shire R/C Aircraft club, Illawong Marlins Baseball Club and The Barden Ridge Comets Cricket Team. ==Schools== Barden Ridge has two schools: Lucas Heights Community School [K-12] and Shire Christian School. ==Churches== St Paul's Anglican Church and the Sutherland Reformed Church. ==Politics== Barden Ridge has a long Liberal party history, which only changed in recent memory during the stalled construction of the Woronora Bridge. It comes under the Federal seat of Hughes, which is currently held by Liberal MP Craig Kelly. In State Government, it comes under the seat of Holsworthy, which is currently held by the Liberal Party MP Melanie Gibbons. In Local Government, Barden Ridge falls under Sutherland Shire E Ward, which has three representatives. ==Emergency Services== Barden Ridge has its own Bushfire Brigade station and is served by the very close-by Menai police station, Ambulance post and Fire Brigade. ==Aged Care== The suburb is home to the Barden Lodge Retirement Home. ==Notable residents== * Home and away and Blue Water High star Rebecca Breeds attended Shire Christian School ==References== Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:Sutherland Shire ","title":"Barden Ridge, New South Wales"},{"id":"2560026","text":"Here is a full taxonomy of the family Phyllanthaceae.

The film's plot revolves around a genetically engineered Suchomimus terrorizing the lake- side residents of a small town. The film stars Matthew Borlenghi, Jane Longenecker, Charles Napier, Costas Mandylor, Bruce Weitz, and Joanna Pacu≈Ça. The film was produced by b-movie director Roger Corman. The film received a limited theatrical release in early 2004. before premiering on the Syfy Channel in April of that year. It was followed by two sequels, Supergator and Dinocroc vs. Supergator, as well as a spin-off film, Dinoshark. Upon release, the film received negative reviews from critics and audiences. It later received a Golden Galaxy award. ==Plot== A North African dinosaur, related to the crocodile, is found which could grow up to 50 feet long. Dr. Campbell (Bruce Weitz) uses its DNA to create two hybrids of it with a modern-day crocodile at Paula Kennedy's Genetic Research Co. (Gereco) lab. One creature kills Dr. Campbell's assistant and the other creature before escaping. This information is kept from Sheriff Harper (Napier) by Kennedy, stating the dead creature killed Campbell's assistant. His daughter, county dog catcher Diane Harper, helps her ex-welding artist, Tom Banning, and his 12-year-old brother Michael Banning (Jake Thomas) find their three-legged dog, Lucky, who was lost a few days earlier. Meanwhile, Kennedy sends a trapper to feed the Dinocroc (the animal still being on Gereco Property). The trapper uses Lucky as bait, but Lucky runs away and the Dinocroc quickly kills the trapper soon after. Later in the morning Diane and Tom find Lucky running around in the woods and try to catch him, unaware that the Dinocroc is lurking nearby, but Dr. Campbell saves them by shooting at it. Kennedy then hires an Australian crocodile hunter, Dick Sydney (Costas Mandylor), to help kill the Dinocroc after it is discovered to have killed two hunters in the woods (leaving behind one of their guns). Later that night, Michael sneaks out to look for Lucky when he witnesses the creature. The Dinocroc chases Michael through the forest into a tool shed situated on a dock above the water. Dinocroc then gets under the shed (tearing the dock to pieces in the process) and kills Michael from below, leaving only his head. The next day, not having noticed that Michael has gone, Tom, Diane, Dick and Campbell find that the creature is headed toward the town's lakeside beach. It kills three people, the last one being Campbell. In a press conference after the incident, Kennedy lies that Campbell was not part of Gereco. Sheriff Harper then plans to kill the creature with his police force and Diane. While looking for it, they stumble upon Michael's damaged bike and Michael's remains in the ruined shed. Tom, who knows Michael is missing, appears on his motorbike and then speeds away after seeing what is left of his dead brother. After trying to get drunk, Tom cries loudly over his brother and is met by Dick Sydney who is also there to unwind. Sydney explains to Tom how a crocodile killed his son and that is the reason he hunts them. Diane also arrives to comfort Tom along with Lucky. Meanwhile, five of Sheriff Harper's officers are brutally killed by the Dinocroc while searching the swamp for the cause; their mutilated remains found shortly after. The next day, Tom, Diane and others devise a plan to trap the Dinocroc in a tunnel and gas him to death. Sheriff Harper uses some dogs for bait, which Diane and Tom immediately object to, so Harper has them handcuffed and put in the police car. The two manage to escape and use a blowtorch to release the chained dogs while the creature chases them. They trap the Dinocroc in the tunnel and gas him, seemingly killing it. While a local news crew is taping Kennedy (who arrived after the creature's death) inside the tunnel, telling the reporter false stories about the events, the Dinocroc awakens; it then kills Kennedy and comes after Tom and Diane, who are left after the news crew drives away quickly in terror. After hiding under a truck, they hear a train and lure the Dinocroc across the tracks. It is rammed by a passing train, followed by Tom stabbing it in the eye to the brain with a small pipe as revenge for Michael's death. As the sun rises the next day, Diane and Tom drive away, contemplating leaving for a vacation together just to get away for a while. Then the camera pans slowly back as their truck passes and a second Dinocroc is seen walking weakly across the road. == Cast == * Costas Mandylor as Dick Sydney * Charles Napier as Sheriff Harper * Bruce Weitz as Dr. Campbell * Matthew Borlenghi as Tom Banning (as Matt Borlenghi) * Jane Longenecker as Diane Harper * Max Perlich as Deputy Kerrigan * Jake Thomas as Michael Banning * Kerri Hemmington as Annie Dexter * Price Carson as Edwin Danders * Joanna Pacula as Paula Kennedy * Jamie Akhavi as Judith == Music == Composer Damon Ebner created background music for the creature, similar to that in Jaws. Every time the creature is near, attacks, or chases a victim, the background music, which was made up of orchestral and choir, accompanies it. ==Sequels== After Corman produced Dinocroc in 2004, he proposed a sequel to be named Dinocroc 2. However, Sci-Fi Channel turned down the project after claiming that sequels did not do well for them.

She earned her B.A. in 1952 and M.A. in 1954 at Florida State University. She began teaching at Miami Jackson High School in 1954 to help repay her college loan. When she began, the school's enrollment was 90% white middle-class students, but after the 1954 Supreme Court ruling on school desegregation, Florida began to admit black students to white schools beginning in 1963. By 1966 the student body at Miami Jackson High School was 85% black poor. Goleman helped develop new programs and demonstrated a caring attitude toward students to build academic success. She was awarded the 1969 National Teacher of the Year Award for her achievements. She was the first southerner to win the award in 18 years. She received the award on 28 April 1969 from President Richard M. Nixon in a White House ceremony. Barbara Goleman High School, opened in 1995, was named in her honor. ==Bibliography== * ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:20th-century births Category:Living people Category:Schoolteachers from Florida ","title":"Barbara Goleman"},{"id":"2560041","text":"Bankside Pier is a stop for river services in London.

It belongs to the eastern Finnish dialects and it is divided into more specific dialect groups. Savonian dialects are the most widely distributed dialects of Finnish. They are spoken in the Savonia region (Northern and Southern), but also in North Karelia, parts of P√§ij√§t-H√§me, Central Finland, Kainuu, Koillismaa district of Northern Ostrobothnia, the lake section between Southern and Central Ostrobothnia as far north as Evij√§rvi and in the municipalities of Pudasj√§rvi and the Southern part of Ranua in Lapland. Also the language spoken by forest settlers in V√§rmland and Norwegian Hedmark of Central Scandinavia belonged to the old Savonian dialects. The area of Savonian dialects makes up one third of the whole area of Finland. ==History== The Savonian dialects are of different origin than Western Finnish dialects. Savonian dialects form a dialect continuum with other Eastern dialects of Finnish and the Karelian language, with whom they have common ancestry in the Proto-Karelian language spoken in the coast of Lake Ladoga in the Iron Age. ==Features== Although the Savonian dialects are spread over a large geographical area with significant variations, they are rather different from the standard language and are recognized as local dialects. There are large variations between different Savonian dialects, but a few of the most stereotypical features are: *Re-development of palatalized consonants from consonant + i, which is denoted by digraphs with a 'j', e.g. , (standard Finnish , ). In conjunction, the word-final i is not generally added to stems ending in consonant + i. For example, standard √§√§ni is reflected as i√§n. *Some long vowels and diphthongs have shifted with respect to the standard language; thus, where the standard language has a diphthong, Savo may have a long vowel, and vice versa. **Stressed (initial-syllable) become opening diphthongs, first , and in most varieties further . E.g. mua for Standard Finnish maa \\"land, country, ground\\", or pi√§ for p√§√§ \\"head\\". ** as the 2nd element of a diphthong lowers to , e.g. laeta for laita \\"side\\", s√∂e for s√∂i \\"ate\\". ** lower similarly to or they may assimilate completely to produce a long vowel, e.g. kaoppa or kaappa for kauppa \\"store\\", t√§√∂nn√§ or t√§√§nn√§ for t√§ynn√§ \\"full\\". **When unstressed, the bisyllabic combination of o/√∂/e + a/√§ is smoothed to a monosyllabic long vowel. E.g. ruskee for ruskea \\"brown\\", kynt√∂√∂ for kynt√∂√§ \\"plowing (partitive case)\\". (This change is not specific to Savonian dialects and is found in most forms of spoken Finnish today.) *Word- medial simple consonants are geminated after a short initial syllable. A native Savonian doesn't say he speaks savoa, he says he speaks savvoo. *The combined effect of the three features above is referred to as speaking like one with a \\"crooked chin\\" (vi√§r√§leuka cf. standard v√§√§r√§leuka). Whereas standard Finnish has a \\"declarative\\" rhythm, Savo has an \\"expressive\\" rhythm. The different way of producing speech is noticeable even if the speaker speaks perfect standard Finnish. *The glottal stop replaces word-final , a trait common to many other Finnish varieties. For example, the genitive case is essentially marked by a glottal stop (e.g. is√§' i√§n vs. is√§n √§√§ni). *All syllable-initial consonants except the last one (which contacts the nucleic vowel) are systematically and completely removed in loans, e.g. traktori as raktorj. *An epenthetic vowel is inserted after a medial syllable coda of , /h/ or, in certain cases, , e.g. vanaha. This vowel is identical in quality to the preceding vowel. The resulting medial consonant is exempt from gemination. *Loi plural, e.g. risti ‚Äì ristil√∂it√§ (standard: ristej√§) Although standard and known elsewhere, the usage of verb compounds is particularly prevalent in Savo Finnish and a prolific source of creative expressions. The first verb is in the infinitive and indicates the action, and the second verb is declined and indicates the manner. For example, seist√§ toljotat \\"you stand there gawking\\" consists of words meaning \\"to-stand you-gawk\\". ===Northern Savonian dialects=== Northern Savonian dialects are spoken in the municipalities of Hankasalmi (Eastern part), Haukivuori, Hein√§vesi, Iisalmi, Joroinen, J√§ppil√§, Kaavi, Kangaslampi, Karttula, Keitele, Kiuruvesi, Konnevesi, (Eastern part), Kuopio, Lapinlahti, Lepp√§virta, Maaninka, Muuruvesi (part of Juankoski since 1971), Nilsi√§, Pieks√§m√§ki, Pielavesi, Pyh√§salmi, Rantasalmi, Rautalampi, Riistavesi (part of Kuopio since 1973), Siilinj√§rvi, Sonkaj√§rvi, Suonenjoki, S√§yneinen (part of Juankoski since 1971), Tervo, Tuusniemi, Varpaisj√§rvi, Varkaus, Vehmersalmi, Vesanto, Vierem√§ and Virtasalmi. ===Southern Savonian dialects=== Southern Savonian dialects are spoken in the municipalities of Anttola, Hirvensalmi, Juva, Kangasniemi, Mikkeli, M√§ntyharju, Pertunmaa, (Eastern part) Puumala, Ristiina, Sulkava and Suomenniemi. ===Middle dialects of Savonlinna area=== Middle dialects of Savonlinna area are spoken in the Eastern Savonia, the municipalities surrounding the city of Savonlinna between Southern Savonia and North Karelia: Enonkoski, Kerim√§ki, Punkaharju, Savonranta and S√§√§minki (part of Punkaharju and Savonlinna since 1973). The dialect spoken in Enonkoski has many similarities with the dialects of Northern Savo, while the dialect spoken in the Southern parts of Punkaharju resembles South-Eastern dialects in many ways. The difference between dialects in Savonlinna district has its roots in the colonization history. The area of greater Kerim√§ki (which consisted Enonkoski, Punkaharju and Savonranta) was settled by Karelian people till the 16th century, but from the 14th century the Savonian has started to settle to the Eastern side of Lake Pihlajavesi and the coasts of Puruvesi. The differences between natural and governmental borders goes together in many ways. In Enonkoski the dialect is more Savonian in the Northern side of Hanhivirta. The other reason to this is that the Northern villages of Enonkoski belonged to Hein√§vesi in the 19th century, while the Southern villages were part of Kerim√§ki. The Northern border of Puruvesi goes through Lake Puruvesi. So the old Karelian-based dialect features have kept in Punkaharju much better than in Kerim√§ki, which is located in the Northern side of Puruvesi. ===Eastern Savonian dialects or the dialects of North Karelia=== Eastern Savonian dialects or the dialects of North Karelia are spoken in North Karelia in the municipalities of Eno, Ilomantsi, Joensuu, Juuka, Kes√§lahti, Kiihtelysvaara (now part of Joensuu), Kitee, Kontiolahti, Korpiselk√§ (now part of Russia, little part of Tohmaj√§rvi since 1946), Outokumpu, Liperi, Nurmes, Pielisj√§rvi (part of Lieksa since 1973), Polvij√§rvi, Pyh√§selk√§, P√§lkj√§rvi (now part of Russia, little part of Tohmaj√§rvi since 1946), Rautavaara, Ruskeala (now part of Russia), Soanlahti, Tohmaj√§rvi, Tuupovaara (now part of Joensuu) and Valtimo. ===Dialects of Kainuu=== Kainuu dialects are spoken in Hyrynsalmi, Kajaani, Kuhmo, Kuusamo, Paltamo, Posio, Pudasj√§rvi, Puolanka, Ranua (Southern part), Ristij√§rvi, Sotkamo, Suomussalmi, Taivalkoski and Vaala. ===Dialects of Middle Finland=== Dialects of Middle Finland are spoken in Hankasalmi (Western part), Karstula, Kinnula, Kivij√§rvi, Konginkangas (part of √Ñ√§nekoski since 1993), Konnevesi (Western part), Kyyj√§rvi, Laukaa, Multia, Pihtipudas, Pylk√∂nm√§ki, Saarij√§rvi, Sumiainen, Uurainen, Viitasaari and √Ñ√§nekoski. ===Dialects of P√§ij√§t-H√§me=== P√§ij√§t-H√§me Savonian dialects are spoken in Joutsa, Jyv√§skyl√§, J√§ms√§, Korpilahti, Koskenp√§√§ (part of J√§ms√§nkoski since 1969), Kuhmoinen, Leivonm√§ki, Luhanka, Muurame, Pertunmaa (Western part), Pet√§j√§vesi, Sysm√§ and Toivakka. ===Middle dialects of Keuruu-Evij√§rvi=== Middle dialects of Keuruu-Evij√§rvi are spoken in Alaj√§rvi, Evij√§rvi, Keuruu, Lappaj√§rvi, Lehtim√§ki, Pihlajavesi, Soini, Vimpeli and √Ñht√§ri. This sub-dialect area is wedge shaped in the middle of Ostrobothnia, which has its own dialects and also Swedish-speaking population. This is the influence of Savonian slash-and-burn farmers who colonized the lake section in Southern Ostrobothnia in the 17th century. ===V√§rmland Savonian dialects=== The expansion of Savonian slash-and-burn agriculture, which started in the beginning of Modern era, expanded to Central Scandinavia. Mostly in the beginning of the 17th century Savonian settlers, mainly from the parish of Rautalampi, settled in V√§rmland, Sweden. In the beginning of the 19th century tens of thousands of people spoke the Savonian language as their mother tongue. These \\"Forest Finns\\" were an interesting group from a linguistic point of view because their language was kept safe from other influences. The practice of slash and burn agriculture was prohibited in Sweden in the middle of the 17th century and no new Finnish settlers moved to the area. The language of Forest Finns lacked the Schwa vowel and gemination, which are used now in the dialect spoken in Rautalampi. Nowadays the Savonian dialect of V√§rmland is extinct. The last Savonian speakers were Johannes Johansson-Oinonen (died in 1965) and Karl Persson (died 1969). ==Music== The band Verjnuarmu performs melodic death metal in the Savo dialect, while V√§rttin√§ perform folk music in the dialect. The folk song \\"Ievan polkka\\" is in the dialect, as well. ==Sources== * Suomen murrealueet ('Finnish dialects' - in Finnish) ===References=== Category:Finnish dialects Category:Savonia (historical province) ","title":"Savonian dialects"},{"id":"2560052","text":"Barbara Goleman Senior High School is a secondary school located at 14100 NW 89th Ave in Miami Lakes, Florida; its principal is Manuel Sanchez.

Ingulf (; died 16 November 1109) was a Benedictine abbot of Crowland, head of Crowland Abbey in Lincolnshire. ==Life== Ingulf was an Englishman who, having travelled to England on diplomatic business as secretary of William, Duke of Normandy, in 1051, was made Abbot of Crowland in 1087 (Chambers and DNB say 1086) at Duke William's instigation after he had become king of England and the abbacy had fallen vacant. 1087 was in the last year of William's reign. In the meantime, Ingulf had made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and entered Fontenelle Abbey at Caudebec-en-Caux in Normandy, where after a time, he was appointed prior. He was appointed abbot there in 1080. As his life as Abbot of Crowland progressed, Ingulf suffered the usual events: gout and the work of rebuilding after a destructive fire in the abbey. However, he was able to obtain an arm of Saint Wulfram; and in 1092 he received the body of Earl Waltheof of Northumbria, an Anglo-Saxon who had been executed per William's orders and who was considered a hero and martyr in popular thought. These relics brought in the pilgrims and eased his money problems. ==Works== For several centuries, he was credited with the original authorship of a history of Crowland Abbey, Historia Monasterii Croylandensis, the Croyland Chronicle, a manuscript which has since been shown to have been fabricated well after his time, probably in the 13th or 14th century. The chronicle, which for many years was referred to as 'Ingulf' and is now called the Pseudo-Ingulf, was probably written in order to support claims to property around Crowland, particularly in regard to incursions from Spalding. Crowland was on a small gravel ridge in wet fen. All of the Abbey's arable lands listed in Domesday Book were in other parishes, such as Spalding. ==References== *Thorne, J.O.

The river Danube and its tributaries overflowed in many places, flooding parts of Germany, Bavaria in particular. Several floodings and landslides were reported in Lower Austria and Styria. The floods also meant the temporary closure of many mountain passes, amongst them the Gotthard in Switzerland, and the Arlberg in Austria. On a section of the Arlberg, the road and rail were washed away. Austrian Federal Railways have issued a statement (in German) that the rail line reconstruction will take at least a month. The main phone and data line between Vorarlberg and the rest of Austria was destroyed and had to be replaced by a radio communication. With rain and flood waters subsiding on August 27, people started to return to their homes, rail and road routes reopened and the cleanup began. Town of Ja≈°a Tomiƒá in Serbia was devastated by floods. Poland, where seven bridges collapsed, and Slovenia were was also affected by flooding in August. ===Other countries=== Bulgaria and Moldova were also affected, though to a lesser extent. In Bulgaria, three months of rain and flooding killed 20 people and left 14,000 homeless. The country was hit by further floods in August (normally a very dry month), though these did not cause such widespread damage, but caused damage to the year's crops, causing an increase in the price of fruit and vegetables. Moldova was also hit by torrential rains in August. ==References== *24 August 2005. \\"Floods cause havoc across Europe\\" at BBC News.

It was designed by Michael Berlyn and Muffy McClung Berlyn and programmed by Rebecca Heineman of Interplay (credited as Bill Heineman) in cooperation with Brainwave Creations. Tass Times was released for the Atari ST, Amiga, Commodore 64, Apple II, Apple IIGS, Macintosh, and IBM PC compatibles. It was the first commercial game for the IIGS.WHAT IS THE APPLE IIGS?, Tass Times in Tonetown ==Plot== The plot of the game involves the player getting sucked into Tonetown, a surreal alternate world seemingly based on a distillation of 1980s culture, with overtones of punk and new wave culture (such as pink hair, etc.). The word \\"Tass\\" in the title refers to an adjective used within the parallel world of Tonetown. Its basic meaning is somewhat akin to \\"cool\\" or \\"hip\\". Game designer Michael Berlyn gives the following source for the word: The game's narrative begins with the player character inside a cabin belonging to \\"Gramps\\", a relative and inventor who has gone missing. While searching the cabin, the player activates one of Gramps' latest inventions: a device that resembles an electronically powered hoop. Gramps' pet dog, Spot, jumps through the active hoop and disappears. The player follows him and is transported to the mysterious Tonetown world alongside Spot, discovering that \\"Spot\\", in this world, is not only sentient and capable of speech but is actually a celebrity resident named \\"Ennio the Legend\\". Ennio travels along with the player, providing commentary and advice as well alerting the player to danger. The player learns that Gramps' mysterious disappearance extends even into the Tonetown world, and may have been arranged by the villainous Franklin Snarl. Snarl, a surreal combination of a pig, a raccoon and (most obviously) a crocodile, is a ruthless business magnate. He is also a murderously hostile Tonetown nativist, openly violent to most \\"tourists\\" (foreigners) he encounters. His negative effects on the local culture had begun to attract media attention against him, culminating in the disappearance of Gramps. To progress in the game, the player must assimilate into Tonetown's culture, using guitar picks as currency and partaking in its party scene, its \\"tass\\" music, including the popular band The Daglets, and such delicacies as \\"GloBurgers\\". The player encounters technology unique to Tonetown such as the \\"zagtone\\" (a device that plays variable notes depending on what object it is struck against), as well as bizarre creatures including the cute but destructive \\"blobpet\\" and dangerous monsters. The blobpet also makes an appearance in the animated intro exclusive to the Apple II, Commodore 64, and PC ports. Gramps is eventually revealed to be Snarl's prisoner, held captive in an island office tower. After rescuing him, the player brings the group to a final confrontation with Snarl at his mansion, with Snarl possessing the Tonetown world's iteration of the hoop device. While Ennio holds Snarl at bay, Gramps activates the hoop and the player throws Snarl through it. The player enters the hoop and is returned to the \\"normal\\" world just outside Gramps' cabin, discovering that Snarl's arrival into the normal world has transformed him into three separate creatures - which the game's narrator describes as \\"a cute little pig, a darling raccoon, and a little crocodile shedding a few tears\\". Talking to Snarl during the final sequence reveals that Gramps himself had created him, using the hoop device and the three original animal specimens, and that he had captured Gramps with the intention of continuing his work at any cost. It is also hinted that Tonetown itself may have been created entirely by Gramps' imagination, who then discovered a way to physically travel to it. ==Gameplay== The game is an example of the graphical text adventure genre. Somewhat like classical text adventures or the early Sierra games, players use text commands (e.g. \\"TAKE HOOPLET\\") to interact with the game, but like LucasArts adventure games (or the later Sierra games), they also use an intuitive GUI. The player viewed the world of the game through a small window at the top left of the screen in which their surroundings were displayed. Much like The Bard's Tale, this view was static (or mostly so); it was not animated, though it was context-sensitive (players could click on objects in this window rather than typing their names). Like many text adventures of this era, Tass Times had its share of possible unwinnable situations in which players can discover themselves trapped. The most infamous of these is Gramps' lab book, which is found in his cabin at the start of the game, and is used to complete the game at almost its very end. Hapless players can leave the book behind only to realize it is needed for game completion right when they are on the verge of completing it. Other scenarios include many possible instances of saving the game in situations in which death can never be avoided in time, such as in a location too far away from the shopping boutiques, so that Snarl will kill a player still deemed a \\"tourist\\" before Tonetown apparel and hairstyles can ever be purchased. ==Ports== Tass Times had different features and graphics depending on which system it was developed for. This was a common practice for games of its era due to the disparate abilities of the systems of that era. For example, the higher-end system (Amiga, Atari ST and Apple IIGS) versions had 16-32 color graphics and wavetable sound, while the lower-end (Apple II, PC) versions had more rudimentary graphics. Likewise, the higher-end systems supported sound, while some of the lower-end ports had no sound capability. The low-end versions, however, had a fully animated intro screen, depicting what may have been Ennio's first arrival into the mundane world. The Apple II version can run in 6-color HGR graphics on 64k models or 16-color DHGR graphics on 128k models. The Amiga and Atari ST versions, while very similar, have some differences. The Amiga version has a title song, where the Atari ST version does not. Though they both share the same title screen as seen at the top right of this page. Interestedly, the Atari ST version has some animated scenes within the game. The PC port was one of the earliest games for IBM compatibles to support mice, which were rare in 1985 and had little software that could use them. Since it was a booter game and no drivers were loaded, the programmers had to code their own routines to read a serial mouse. Andr√°s Szigethy converted the Commodore 64 version of Tass Times to Commodore Plus/4. ==Reception== Compute! stated that the Amiga version of Tass Times in Tonetown was a \\"fascinating new game\\" with \\"superb color graphics\\", calling the story \\"unusual\\". Hartley and Pattie Lesser similarly commented on the game in their \\"The Role of Computers\\" column in Dragon #116 (1986), stating \\"This one is truly bizarre\\". Computer Gaming Worlds Charles Ardai agreed, stating that the \\"strange story\\" did not interest him. Roy Wagner reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"This game is a relatively easy adventure with the added twist of the reality in which it is played. Get tass, stay tone-ly and find Gramps.\\" Macworld reviewed the Macintosh version of Tass Times in Tonetown, calling it a \\"Challenging, unique game with [a] sense of humor.\\" Macworld praises its gameplay, puzzles, and atmosphere, stating that \\"the game demands that you familiarize yourself with a vernacular and logic particular to Tonetown. ... Tass Times in Tonetown grows much tricker as you progress. What makes the game so challenging is also what makes it unique: the novelty of Tonetown, its mores, and its inhabitants. These same qualities make many clues difficult to decipher.\\" Macworld compares Tass Times in Tonetown's gameplay to other adventure games, including D√©j√† Vu, Uninvited, and Mindshadow. Macworld notes that Tonetown lacks an 'operate' command as D√©j√† Vu and Uninvited do, instead requiring context-sensitive verbs for actions, i.e typing \\"unlock\\" to unlock a door. Macworld criticizes Tonetown's difficulty, as well as its graphics, expressing that \\"The games's graphics, although imaginative and professionally constructed, sometimes lack detail and are relegated to a small part of the screen\\", and suggests that a zoom feature would remedy this. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1986 video games Category:Activision games Category:Adventure games Category:Atari ST games Category:Amiga games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Apple IIGS games Category:DOS games Category:Interplay Entertainment games Category:Mac OS games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Tass Times in Tonetown"},{"id":"2560068","text":"Kalimath (originally known, and still sometimes called Kaviltha) is a village in Rudraprayag District of the Indian state of Uttarakhand. It is regarded as a divine place and shakti peeth. == Geography == It lies at an altitude of around on the Saraswati river in the Himalayas, surrounded by the peaks of Kedarnath. Kalimath is situated close to Ukhimath and Guptakashi. It is one of the Siddha Peeths of the region and is held in high religious esteem. == Religion == The temple of Goddess Kali there is visited by devotees year round, especially during the Navratras. This holy shrine is one of 108 Shakti Peethas in India as per Srimad Devi Bhagwat.. The upper part of Kali is worshipped in Dhari Devi. The remaining part in Kalimath religious tradition is that Kalimath is where Kali killed the demon Raktavija and went under the earth. Kalimath is the only place where the goddess Kali is worshipped along with her sisters Laxmi and Saraswati. No idol is worshipped in the temple. Instead the Sri Yantra is the object of devotion. On one day each year the goddess is taken out and Puja is performed at midnight, with only the chief priest present. Near the temple are other ancient temples to Laxmi, Saraswati, Gauri Shankar and many antique Shivlings, idols of Nandi and Ganesh, etc. An eternal holy flame always burns in the temple of Laxmi. Bhairava Mandir is located nearby. Barti Baba is credited for preserving the sanctity of this holy shrine. All the people who met him and the locals say that he had a direct connection with Maa Kali. The guru and Member of Parliament, Satpal Maharaj, set up a small Dharamshala near the temple where pilgrims can stay. About 2 km east is Kunjethi village, hosting two temples of Mata Manana Devi and Mankameshwar Mahadev. 6 km from Kalimath at the top of a hill there is a huge Kalishila and another one Kali Temple. Barkha Giri Baba and Sarawati Mai lived there in a hut for many years. == Notables == The village is the birthplace of Kalidas, a Sanskrit poet. == References == Category:Villages in Rudraprayag district ","title":"Kalimath"},{"id":"2560072","text":"Environmental mitigation, compensatory mitigation, or mitigation banking, are terms used primarily by the United States government and the related environmental industry to describe projects or programs intended to offset known impacts to an existing historic or natural resource such as a stream, wetland, endangered species, archeological site, paleontological site or historic structure. To \\"mitigate\\" means to make less harsh or hostile. Environmental mitigation is typically a part of an environmental crediting system established by governing bodies which involves allocating debits and credits. Debits occur in situations where a natural resource has been destroyed or severely impaired and credits are given in situations where a natural resource has been deemed to be improved or preserved. Therefore, when an entity such as a business or individual has a \\"debit\\" they are required to purchase a \\"credit\\". In some cases credits are bought from \\"mitigation banks\\" which are large mitigation projects established to provide credit to multiple parties in advance of development when such compensation cannot be achieved at the development site or is not seen as beneficial to the environment. Crediting systems can allow credit to be generated in different ways. For example, in the United States, projects are valued based on what the intentions of the project are which may be to preserve, enhance, restore or create (PERC) a natural resource. == Advantages == Environmental mitigation and crediting systems are often praised for the following reasons: === Development-friendly === Mitigation is a more development-friendly alternative to strict environmental laws because it allows development to occur where environmental laws might prohibit it. === Mitigation industry === Mitigation inevitably creates a \\"mitigation industry\\". By requiring those who impact natural resources to purchase credits, a demand for mitigation credit is formed. Businesses related to environmental work typically benefit from such a system. === Targeting ecological value === Mitigation has the potential to save and restore the most valuable environmental resources at the least cost, assuming that regulation 1) protects health and welfare as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and 2) assures that a credit accurately represents measurable ecological value. Buyers are typically looking for mitigation credits that are both cheap and the most likely to meet regulatory requirements for compensatory mitigation. Regulators must therefore find a balance between protecting the long term public interest and ensuring that buyers have the proper incentives to participate in the environmental marketplace. === Cost burden === Mitigation systems place the environmental costs of development mostly on the individuals or entities that are impacting the environment. Without environmental mitigation, costs of alleviating environmental damage caused by development could be placed in the hands of the government which would in turn pass costs on to taxpayers not responsible for environmental impacts. === Benefit to landowners === Land previously unused or impractical for development is given greater monetary value under a mitigation system. For instance, land in floodplains may be impractical for commercial or residential development but conducive for mitigation activities. Land in rural areas with very little potential for growth are more valuable when given the opportunity to be used for mitigation credits. == Disadvantages == The following are criticisms of environmental mitigation and crediting systems: === Incorrect allocation and valuation of credits and debits === Mitigation regulations may not properly take into account the total ecological losses and gains associated with environmental impacts or mitigation when allocating debits and credits. Governing bodies are primarily responsible for prescribing the ecological criteria required to attain credits for mitigation. They are also responsible for valuation of credit. Therefore, it is evident that problems with the allocation and valuation of credits and debits might stem from the complexity of assessing the current comparative value of ecological resources (aka ecosystem services), ecosystem change over time, and/or a lack of understanding about what is beneficial or harmful to the environment overall. To address these uncertainties regulators often assign 'coverage ratios' to compensatory mitigation agreements. Coverage ratios of, for example, 3:1 require 3 compensatory mitigation credits for every 1 unit of ecological disturbance. === Effects on land cost and availability === Mitigation could be seen as contributing to the increasing cost of land because some mitigation work requires that large amounts of land be purchased or put into conservation easements. Mitigation can therefore compete with other rural land uses such as agriculture and residential development. This suggests that land owners must be alert to find the highest and best use for their properties given the potential market value that mitigation credits represent. === 'In perpetuity' commitments of land === Commitment of lands to compensatory mitigation must be done 'in perpetuity', meaning permanently into the future. Otherwise, the long-term public interest could not be served via compensatory mitigation programs. This means that properties must continue to be managed with ecosystem values in mind, sometimes preventing landowners from transforming the landscape to meet changing needs. For example, future large scale development projects would not likely be permitted on previously dedicated mitigation properties. == Notes and references == ==External links== * United States EPA Compensatory Mitigation website * National Mitigation Banking Association * Endangered Species and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Recovery Crediting Guidance Category:Economy and the environment Category:Environmental engineering ","title":"Environmental mitigation"},{"id":"2560077","text":"L√°ngos or lalanga () is a deep fried flatbread that can be found in Hungarian, Greek and Turkish cuisines.June Meyers Authentic Hungarian Heirloom Recipes Cookbook Historically it was present in both Byzantine and Ottoman cuisines. == Etymology and history == L√°ngos sold at a street vendor The name comes from l√°ng, the Hungarian word for flame. The early-15th-century Glossary of Beszterce, the most ancient currently known Hungarian \\"dictionary\\", reveals that the ultimate ancestor of flat breads was the panis focacius attributed to the Romans (of which derives also the Italian flat bread called focaccia). In ancient Rome, panis focacius was a flat bread baked in the ashes of the fireplace (cf. Latin focus meaning \\"fireplace\\"). The modern l√°ngos, despite its name, is not prepared near an open flame but rather by deep-fat frying, and among Hungarian foods it is instead the pog√°csa which preserves the connection, both etymological and culinary, to the ancient panis focacius. Lalanga was present both in the Byzantine and Ottoman cuisines; whilst in the former it was only eaten as a sweet, in Ottoman Turkey it was eaten both as a sweet dish with honey or as a savoury, with cheese. Lalanga continues to exist in the Turkish cuisine, as well as in the Greek Cuisine (mostly in Peloponnese) as Lalagia (In Greek ŒõŒ±ŒªŒ¨Œ≥Œ≥ŒπŒ±). ==Variations== L√°ngos topped with grated cheese, sour cream, bacon, onion and parsley The dough for l√°ngos is made of water or milk, flour, yeast, and salt. The ingredients are worked together either by hand or a kneading machine. As the yeast starts to metabolize the carbohydrates in the flour, carbon dioxide is released which causes the dough to rise, creating the air bubbles in the l√°ngos. The dough is basically the same as pizza dough, but it is not baked but fried in oil. Adding sour cream, yoghurt or mashed potatoes to the dough is optional but highly encouraged, in the latter case it is called potato l√°ngos (in Hungarian krumplis l√°ngos). It is eaten fresh and warm, topped with sour cream and grated cheese, or Liptauer, ham, or sausages, or most frequently, without toppings, just rubbed with garlic or garlic butter, or doused with garlic water. Other ingredients and accompaniments can be mushroom, quark cheese, eggplant, cabbage, kefir, omelet, and a confectioner's sugar or jam. L√°ngos being fried Traditionally l√°ngos was baked in the front of the brick oven close to the flames. This is the basis for its name; \\"l√°ng\\" which means \\"flame\\" in the Hungarian language. L√°ngos was made from bread dough and was served as breakfast on the days when new bread was baked. Now that people no longer have brick ovens nor bake bread at home, l√°ngos is virtually always fried in oil. L√°ngos is popular all year long. As it is a rather affordable and simple food, it is often sold around bus stations, fairs, local markets and all over Eastern European countries during local celebrations or sport events. It is sold at many fast-food restaurants not only in Hungary but also in Austria. In Austria, especially in Vienna, l√°ngos is very popular as a fast food at fairs and in amusement parks like the Prater. L√°ngos is known in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Croatia as lango≈°, in Serbia as langu≈° (although it is commonly called \\"Mekike\\"). In Slovenia is known as Langa≈°. In Bulgaria it is known as Mekitsi. It is also popular in Romania (especially in Transylvania) as lango»ôi. It is also extremely popular in Poland where it is known as \\"langosz\\" and in the UK where it's called \\"langos\\" or \\"Hungarian Fried Bread.\\" ==See also== * List of doughnut varieties * List of deep fried foods * Frybread * Shelpek * Bhatoora * Mekitsa * BeaverTails * National symbols of Hungary * ==References== ==External links== * Category:Hungarian cuisine Category:Flatbreads Category:Romanian breads Category:Ottoman cuisine Category:Street food Category:Doughnuts Category:Greek breads Category:Turkish breads ","title":"L√°ngos"},{"id":"2560082","text":"\\"A Matter of Honor\\" is the eighth episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek: The Next Generation, the 34th episode overall, first broadcast on February 6, 1989. The teleplay is written by Burton Armus, based on a story by Armus, Wanda M. Haight and Gregory W. Amos, and directed by Rob Bowman. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, Commander Riker is assigned to temporarily be first officer aboard a Klingon vessel as part of an officer exchange program. ==Plot== As part of an officer exchange program, Benzite Ensign Mendon is brought aboard the Federation starship Enterprise. Acting Ensign Wesley Crusher mistakes Mendon for Mordock, another Benzite who took the Starfleet entrance examination with him (in \\"Coming of Age\\"). Captain Picard suggests a similar officer exchange with the Klingons, and Commander Riker readily volunteers. Riker is assigned to the Klingon ship IKS Pagh, captained by Kargan. Before Riker departs for the Pagh, Lt. Worf briefs Riker on Klingon customs, and gives him a transponder to signal the Enterprise in the event of an emergency. Riker embraces his role as the Klingon First Officer, and when challenged by Second Officer Klag, subdues him by force, pleasing Captain Kargan and earning respect from the crew. Before the ships move away, Mendon scans the Klingon vessel and discovers a patch of strange organic material on its hull but does not bring it to Picard's attention. Worf soon discovers a similar patch on the Enterprise hull, identifying it as a lifeform. Mendon then reveals his previous discovery of the same matter on the Klingon ship, and when asked why he withheld the information, explains that on Benzite ships, it is considered improper to bring up a problem before you have a solution. Picard chastises him and orders the Enterprise to intercept the Pagh, as the Klingon ship is even more susceptible to damage from the organism. While en route, Mendon discovers a method to remove the organism. The Klingon crew also discovers the organism eating away at their hull. Kargan concludes that it must be a new Federation weapon, noting that the Enterprise had heavily scanned the area during their rendezvous, and orders the Pagh to cloak and prepare to attack the Enterprise. Riker is unable to convince Kargan to stand down even after the Enterprise sends a message with instructions for removing the organism. Suspicious of the radio silence, the Enterprise raises its shields. Seemingly accepting his fate, Riker convinces Kargan to close to a distance of 40,000 kilometers before attacking the Enterprise. He activates the transponder he got from Worf and tricks Kargan into taking it. The Enterprise locks onto the transponder signal and waits for the Pagh to get within 40,000 kilometers, the range of the Enterprises transporters. Kargan is beamed to the Enterprises bridge and draws his disruptor but Worf fires first and stuns him. Riker assumes command of the Pagh, decloaks, and demands that the Enterprise surrender, which Picard agrees to, disgracing Kargan further. The Enterprise cleans the organism from the Klingon ship, and Kargan is returned. Riker allows Kargan to hit him and order him off the ship to allow the Klingon to regain some of his dignity before the Pagh departs. ==Production== Brian Thompson was cast as the Klingon Lieutenant Klag. He had some difficulties during the audition process as the producers originally sought to have the actor portraying that part wear the same costume created for Christopher Lloyd in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. His audition was originally cancelled, as he later explained, \\"I phoned Herb Tobias, who was the head of the agency at the time, and told him what happened. I said, 'Herb, would you mind calling the Star Trek office and figuring out a tactful way of asking them, \\"Who casts this program? The directors and producers or the wardrobe department? Thompson praised the work of Jonathan Frakes, saying he is a \\"true professional and I loved working with him.\\" ==Reception== In 2011, Tor.com said that this episode \\"set the tone\\" for Klingon themed episodes, and praised both the performance and character arcs for both Riker and Mendon. Den of Geek says, in their 2013 review of this episode, \\"Competent, engaging, full of heart, humour and character interplay. The scene with Riker and Picard down at the shooting range is fantastic, ...\\". Zack Handlen, writing for the A.V. Club in 2010, gave the episode an A‚Äì.

Montgomery It is surrounded on three sides by the English county of Shropshire and forms a prominent landmark in the Wales- England border. Corndon's prominent western edge appears to form a separate hill and is known locally as Lan Fawr (Welsh: 'Big Hill'). It is frequented by walkers and ramblers from car parks nearby at Mitchell's Fold for example. There are spectacular panoramic views from the summit, and is itself an important landmark for the surrounding countryside and towns like Montgomery. It is close to villages such as Church Stoke and Hyssington. The hill is geologically part of the Shropshire Hills range of hills lying mainly to the north, east and south of the summit. The immediate area to the west is the Vale of Montgomery and the River Severn. The Cambrian Mountains are visible beyond to the far west. The Stiperstones and Shelve lie to the immediate north, with Caer Caradoc and the Long Mynd to the east. ==Archaeology== Bronze Age cairn on the summit of Corndon Hill Roundton Hill looking towards Corndon Hill There is a large Bronze Age cairn near the hill summit, and several more exist in the area around the summit. Such circular stone burial cairns are common on most summits in Wales and they commonly date from ca 2500 BC up until ca 700 BC, when iron slowly started to displace bronze for tools and other goods. Such cairns usually contain one or more cremation urns, and are often placed within a stone cyst or box within the mound. The Bronze Age stone circles of Mitchell's Fold and the now largely destroyed The Whetstones lie at the foot of the hill within Shropshire. There is another circle nearby, the Hoarstones. The hill lies about 2 miles east of Offa's Dyke, built during the 8th century to mark the border between Wales and England (or Mercia). ==Stone Axe Factory (Group XII)== In 1951 Professor F W Shotton of Birmingham University identified the source of the rock used for shafthole battle-axes, splitting mauls and axe hammers as picrite which had been quarried from Corndon Hill.Shotton F W, Chitty L F and Seaby W A, (1951), A new centre of stone axe dispersal on the Welsh Border, Proc. Prehist. Soc Vol 17, 159-67 Picrite is a hard volcanic or igneous rock. Production sites of stone axes and shafthole implements have been grouped by petrology and the Hyssington/Corndon Hill implements are known as Group XII. As the production of these implements in the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age did not employ the same flaking techniques as flint stone axes, which leave recognisable flaking debris, the site or sites of the Corndon Group XII implements production will be harder to identify. However the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust did excavate several small quarry depressions in 2008, but only found evidence of fairly recent disturbance. A stone slab with striations which was suggested was an example of Neolithic art, could equally well have been early plough marks or a hone for sharpening stone edgeshttp://www.cpat.org.uk/resource/reports/cpat907.pdf The main distribution of Group XII implements is in mid-Wales, the Midlands, the Cotswolds and stretching across to East Anglia. By 1988, 93 examples of these implements had been identified and all of these implements have shaftholes for hafting and there are no examples of picrite being used to produce axes.\\"Clough\\" and \\"Cummins\\", 1988, Table 2, pg.4 & distribution map 11, pg275 ==Quarrying== The Corndon flagstone quarries are on the South Western slopes of Corndon Hill and date from Medieval times. From the air the quarries are still a prominent feature in the landscape. In this area the altered Hope Shales of the Ordovician period on the margin of the dolerite produce finely laminated flagstones which were widely used on building on the Shropshire-Montgomeryshire border.

It occurs in all industrialised egg production whether free range, organic, or battery cage. Worldwide, around 7 billion male chicks are culled per year in the egg industry. Because male chickens do not lay eggs and only those on breeding programmes are required to fertilise eggs, they are considered redundant to the egg-laying industries and are usually killed shortly after being sexed, which occurs just days after they are conceived or after they hatch. Some methods of culling that do not involve anaesthetics include: cervical dislocation, asphyxiation by carbon dioxide and maceration using a high-speed grinder, while other methods include using a laser to cut a hole in the egg, removing a drop of fluid to be tested and providing the sex of the chicken. Asphyxiation is the only method in the United Kingdom, while maceration is the primary method in the United States. Due to modern selective breeding, laying hen strains differ from meat production strains (broilers). In the United States, males are culled in egg production, since males \\"don‚Äôt lay eggs or grow large enough to become broilers\\". Ducklings and goslings are also culled in the production of foie gras. However, because males put on more weight than females in this production system, the females are culled, sometimes in an industrial macerator. Up to 40 million female ducks per year may be killed in this way. The remains of female ducklings are later used in cat food and fertilisers. ==History== Chicks bred in the early 1900s Prior to the development of modern broiler meat breeds, most male chickens (cockerels) were slaughtered for meat, whereas females (pullets) would be kept for egg production. However, once the industry successfully bred separate meat and egg-producing hybrids‚Äîstarting in the 1920s and 1930s‚Äîthere was no reason to keep males of the egg-producing hybrid. As a consequence, the males of egg-laying chickens are killed as soon as possible after hatching and sexing to reduce financial losses incurred by the breeder. Special techniques have been developed to accurately determine the sex of chicks at as young an age as possible. In November 2018, the \\"world's first no-kill eggs\\" were sold to the public in Berlin, Germany. ==Methods== Chick grinding machine Several methods are used to cull chicks: * Maceration (also called 'grinding', 'shredding' or 'mincing'); the chicks are placed into a large high-speed grinder. * Asphyxiation (also called 'gassing' or 'controlled atmosphere killing'); carbon dioxide (CO2) is used to induce unconsciousness and then death. * Cervical dislocation; the neck is broken. * Electrocution; an electric current is passed through the chick's body until it is dead.Humane Killing of Male Chicks at the Laying Branch * Suffocation; the chicks are placed in plastic bags. === Permitted methods in the EU === The authorised procedures for killing chicks have been harmonised within the European Union. The regulations initiated in 1976 evolved in 1993, the first directive to specifically take chicks into account. A new directive was adopted in 2009, enacted on 1 January 2013 (replacing the 1993 directive) and last updated on 14 December 2019: * \\"Use of a mechanical apparatus causing rapid death\\" (essentially grinding) * \\"Exposure to carbon dioxide\\" (essentially gassing) === Recommended methods in the US === The American Veterinary Medical Association (AMVA) \\"Euthanasia\\" methods include: cervical dislocation, maceration, and asphyxiation by carbon dioxide. The 2005‚Äì2006 AMVA Executive Board proposed a policy change, recommended by the Animal Welfare Committee on the killing of unwanted chicks, poults, and pipped eggs. The policy states: * 'Unwanted chicks, poults, and pipped eggs should be killed by an acceptable humane method, such as use of a commercially designed macerator that results in instantaneous death. Smothering unwanted chicks or poults in bags or containers is not acceptable. Pips, unwanted chicks, or poults should be killed prior to disposal. A pipped egg, or pip, is one where the chick or poult has not been successful in escaping the egg shell during the hatching process.' US producers announced in 2016 a goal of being able by 2020 to determine the sex of the developing chick long before hatching, so male eggs can be destroyed. However in January 2020 they stated that killing day-old male chicks remains unavoidable due to the lack of a viable alternative. == Statistics == Male chicks prepared to be killed Shredded male chicks * Worldwide: approximately 7 billion male chicks are culled annually around the world (2015 Poultry Site estimate). Other estimates include 6 billion (June 2016 SMH claim), 4‚Äì6 billion chicks (December 2018 The Guardian claim). According to In Ovo cofouder Wouter Bruins in October 2013, the top 20 poultry production countries alone culled 3.2 billion male chicks a year. * Australia: more than 12 million male chicks are culled annually (June 2016 estimate). Maceration is the primary method used, but gassing is also used. * Belgium: more than 15 million male chicks are culled annually, 40,000 a day (February 2020 estimate). CO2 gassing is the only method used and happens in two stages: chicks are first stunned and then killed. * Canada: 22.5 million male chicks are culled annually, nearly 62,000 a day (December 2016 estimate). * France: 50 million male chicks are culled annually in the egg industry (February 2020 estimate) and around 40 million female ducklings and goslings are culled annually in the foie gras industry (October 2014 estimate). Maceration is the primary method in both industries. * Germany: up to 50 million chicks are culled annually (October 2019 estimate). Gassing is the primary method. * Netherlands: 45 million male chicks are culled annually (May 2016 estimate). Gassing is the primary method. * New Zealand: 2.5 million (April 2001 estimate) to 3 million (June 2016 estimate) male chicks are culled annually. Maceration is the primary method. * Spain: 35 million male chicks are culled annually (March 2020 estimate). * Switzerland: about 3 million male chicks are culled annually (September 2019 estimate). Gassing is the only method used; maceration was prohibited on 1 January 2020, but rarely used before that date. * United Kingdom: 30 to 40 million male chicks are culled annually (November 2010 Viva! claim). A November 2010 Telegraph article reported on two undercover operations carried out by animal rights organisation Viva! showing a gassing-method hatchery and a maceration-method hatchery, both located in Preston. Both methods were reportedly 'legal and approved by both the Humane Slaughter Association and the RSPCA', with a British Egg Information Service (BEIS) spokesman saying gassing was used more often than maceration in the UK. In March 2015, a BEIS spokesman insisted that gassing was the only method used in the UK. * United States: 300 million male chicks are culled annually (January 2020 The Humane Society claim). The Associated Press estimated this number at 200 million in 2009. Maceration is the primary method. == Controversy and phaseout == Animal welfare advocates maintain that many of the current practices surrounding chicken slaughtering are unethical. Animal rights advocates argue that it is wrong to unnecessarily exploit and kill other sentient beings for food production, including chicks. === Scientific research into alternatives (2010s) === A female chick hatching Several technologies may obviate chick culling by determining the sex of a chick before hatching. These technologies rely on measuring eggs (through spectroscopy, chemical assays, or imaging); they can determine a chick's sex within 4-9 days of laying. Some methods require genetic engineering to make male eggs fluorescent. Such methods are attractive not only for ethical reasons but to reduce the costs of employing human cullers and of incubating male eggs. Timothy Kurt, a director from the United States Department of Agriculture, said, \\"Everyone wants the same thing, and the right piece of technology could solve this right now.\\" A Unilever spokesperson has been quoted as saying \\"We have also committed to providing funding and expertise for research and introduction of alternative methods such as in-ovo gender identification (sexing) of eggs. This new technology offers the potential to eliminate the hatching and culling of male chicks.\\" In 2018, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, invested $844,000 to electronically \\"scan\\" fertilized eggs to determine if they are male or female. In September 2019, the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research, a company that was founded by the United States congress in 2014 will award six contestants from ten countries, $6 million for working entries. United Egg Producers intends to be cull-free by 2020. CRISPR technology uses a \\"pair of molecular scissors\\" to illuminate the male chicks after being conceived and before being placed in the incubator to be hatched, thus eliminating all male chicks from being hatched. === Legal challenge in Germany (2013‚Äì2019) === In 2013, the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia issued a decree banning hatcheries from killing chicks, against which two egg hatcheries in the state appealed. As paragraph one of Germany's Animal Welfare Act stipulates that \\"No-one shall inflict pain, suffering or harm on a pet without a reasonable cause,\\" a lower court ruled that killing for food production was a \\"reasonable\\" ground. This led to a challenge in the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig. On 13 June 2019, this court decided that the current way of culling chicks \\"violates the country's laws against killing animals without a justifiable reason.\\" However, the court allowed hatcheries to keep culling chicks on a temporary basis until alternatives, such as sex determination in eggs, are introduced. Such \\"no-kill eggs\\" had been introduced into the German market in 2018 and were available in more than 200 shops by June 2019, but there was no industrial-scale solution available yet. === Political efforts (2019‚Äìpresent) === thumb400pxCurrent legal status of chick culling around the world. In response to the June 2019 Leipzig court ruling, German Agriculture Minister Julia Kl√∂ckner stated chick culling was \\"ethically unacceptable\\" and argued it should be prohibited. The Grand Coalition agreement of March 2018 stated that chick culling should have been ended 'by the middle of the current legislative period', which would have been in October 2019, but this goal was not met. At that time, gassing was the most common method of chick culling in Germany, which killed up to 50 million chicks a year. Although the federal government had already invested millions of euros in stimulating scientific research into two alternative methods for sex determination in eggs by then, these were still not ready for the market yet. In September 2019, in Switzerland, the parliament voted to outlaw the shredding of chickens. This is despite this practice not being used in Switzerland. It was further commented that: ‚ÄúThis tendency to rear species only for the production of eggs or for meat turns animals into mere objects. It has led to absurd practices such as the shredding of living male chicks‚Äù. However, the practice of gassing chicks, which kills about three million male baby chicks in Switzerland per year, remained legal. In late October 2019, French Agriculture Minister Didier Guillaume told France Inter: 'We announced last week with my colleague, German Minister for Agriculture [Julia Kl√∂ckner], that we were going to stop the shredding of chicks, which is no longer bearable today. We said end of the year 2021.' He further argued that the practice needed to be phased out and not immediately discontinued: 'If we do it right away, what will happen? There won't be eggs anymore.' On 13 January 2020, during an official visit of Guillaume to Kl√∂ckner, the Ministers said in a joint statement that France and Germany wanted to end the mass shredding of male chicks at the EU level by the end of 2021. Guillaume stated that 'France and Germany should be the European motor to advance on this issue', with Kl√∂ckner adding that Germany's EU presidency in the second half of 2020 was a good opportunity to do so. The countries planned to bring together various groups to share scientific knowledge and implement alternative methods. On 28 January 2020, Guillaume repeated at a press conference that the culling of unwanted male chicks (by shredding) would be outlawed in France by the end of 2021. While some animal rights activists welcomed the move, others said that the decision did not go far enough. The minister's entourage told Agence France-Presse that it was unclear whether his announced ban also included asphyxiation by CO2 (which was excluded from the Swiss ban), pressing him to explicitly prohibit that chick culling method as well. In early February 2020, four Dutch animal rights organisations sent letters to Prime Minister Mark Rutte and the Parliamentary Commission on Agriculture urging them to follow the examples given by Switzerland and France, and phase out all chick culling including gassing in the Netherlands by the end of 2021. The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture cautiously responded that 'a political solution is being explored' and that the Agriculture Minister would soon provide more information. In March 2020, the Directorate of Production and Agrarian Markets of the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture stated that it is working with egg producers to end the annual culling of 35 million male chicks in Spain in 2021. The Ministry said producers were testing two different techniques of in-ovo sex detection. === Business efforts (2018‚Äìpresent) === Currently, the following businesses (producers, distributors and retailers) are in the process of introducing no- kill eggs (also called 'brotherless eggs') and phasing out kill eggs: Jumbo shelf talker for Respeggt six-packs, Netherlands, 2020 * German supermarket chain REWE is one of the main stakeholders of the Dutch‚ÄìGerman Seleggt company that developed the first no-kill eggs. Under the label of Respeggt, these no- kill eggs were first introduced in 350 supermarkets and shops of REWE and Penny in the Berlin region in November 2018. By September 2019, Respeggt eggs were sold in 1,350 REWE shops. * German supermarket chains Edeka, Marktkauf and Famila introduced brotherless eggs in 2019. * French retail multinational Carrefour, Fermiers de Lou√© and German group Agri Advanced Technologies (AAT) introduced no-kill eggs in France in December 2019. On 10 February 2020, Carrefour announced it planned to mark the package of no-kill eggs with special logos, to have 20% of all its eggs sold without chick culling by 1 May 2020, and to completely produce and sell all eggs with the AAT method before the end of 2021. The number of Carrefour locations that sold AAT-style eggs grew gradually in the first half of 2020. * In early February 2020, French egg distribution business Cocorette announced it would collaborate with poultry company Novoponto to produce no-kill eggs using Seleggt's technology. * The German supermarket chains Aldi Nord and Aldi S√ºd announced in March 2020 they wanted to phase out chick culling in their entire chain before 2022. Aldi Netherlands was still considering its course as of May 2020. * Dutch supermarket chain Jumbo was the first company in the Netherlands to start selling Respeggt eggs. Since mid-March 2020, all Jumbo supermarkets (more than 600 locations in the Netherlands and a few in Belgium) had them in store, and organic Respeggt eggs are planned to be introduced later in 2020. * Dutch supermarket chain Coop (over 300 locations) will start selling free range Respeggt eggs in September 2020. The following businesses are considering or have committed to introducing no-kill eggs and phasing out kill eggs: * In 2016, United Egg Producers, representing hatcheries that produce 95% of all eggs in the United States, reached an agreement with The Humane League that it would voluntarily phase out chick culling by 2020, or as soon as it was 'economically feasible' and an alternative was 'commercially available.' In January 2020, UEP president Chad Gregory said 'a workable, scalable, solution is not yet available', but remained 'a priority and the right thing to do' and that the UEP are 'hopeful a breakthrough is on the horizon'. The Humane League president David Coman-Hidy was similarly optimistic about the technological progress made and remains confident that alternatives will be soon be put in place 'in order to spare the lives of the estimated 300 million male chicks that are killed every year in the U.S. alone'. * Albert Heijn, the largest Dutch supermarket chain, with 1000 locations in the Netherlands and Belgium, stated in May 2020 that they are 'meticulously monitoring the technological developments, and when it's operationally feasible, we will enable it.' ==See also== *Culling *Chick sexing ==References== ==External links== *Hatchery Horrors: The Egg Industry's tiniest victims.

He was known as a man of great piety and devotion, and his business was reputed to be a flourishing one, but when, in 1773, he gave up his shop, his finances, owing to personal extravagance, were in a deplorable condition. Nevertheless, Desrues entered into negotiations with a Madame de la Motte for the purchase from her of a country estate, and, when the time came for the payment of the purchase money, invited her to stay with him in Paris pending the transfer. While she was still his guest, he poisoned first her and then her son, a youth of sixteen. Then, having forged a receipt for the purchase money and taken on the aristocratic name \\"Desrues de Bury,\\" he endeavoured to obtain possession of the property. But by this time the disappearance of Madame de la Motte and her son had aroused suspicion. Desrues was arrested, the bodies of his victims were discovered, and the crime was brought home to him. He was originally sentenced to life in prison, but was retried and condemned to be torn asunder alive and burned. He was condemned to death and executed in Paris in 1777, Desrues repeating protestations of his innocence to the last. An extended debate ensued after his death, which was seen as a touchstone for understanding both the last years of the Ancien R√©gime and the early revolutionary period, with Balzac, Hugo, and Dumas among the participants.

Cross Houses is also the name of a hamlet SW of Bridgnorth. == Atcham Union Workhouse/Cross Houses Hospital == Cross Houses has long been renowned for the hospital site, which has recently been redeveloped for housing. The hospital was originally built as the Atcham Union Workhouse in 1793 following Atcham's incorporation under a local Act in 1792. The Incorporation was allowed under the Act to build and operate workhouses. The original building was designed by local architect John Hiram Haycock (1759‚Äì1830), and was later extended in 1851, 1871 and 1903 to increase capacity.http://www.workhouses.org.uk/ The part of the building that was the original Workhouse, now residential accommodation, is called Haycock House after the original architect. In 1916, during World War I, the building became Berrington War Hospital before becoming successively a general hospital, maternity hospital and geriatric hospital after that war. The building was eventually used as NHS Trust admin offices and storage. The offices were closed in 2000 and redeveloped into modern housing. The development, commencing in 2001, aimed to preserve the heritage of the original buildings in the workhouse complex. The original workhouse building, the kitchen/laundry block and the chapel remained where other extensions were taken down. The chapel now houses a community centre and the former laundry and kitchen block houses offices. Architecturally, the appeal of the building is with the original Workhouse and the original laundry/kitchen block which has some of the earliest cast-iron windows in the world. It is also note-worthy that \\"great\\" bricks were used in the construction of the Workhouse, reflecting the response of brick manufacturers to the brick tax.http://www.shrewsbury.gov.uk/Public/YourCouncilAtWork/Planning/PlanningPolicy/devbrief/archiveddevbrief/formercrosshouse/xhouses+intro.htm To the north of Cross Houses lies Work House Wood ‚Äì a wood strategically positioned to protect the residents of Attingham Park Mansion from views of the Workhouse. == Art in Cross Houses == The history of the buildings inspired a group of artists during its redevelopment and Benchart in Cross Houses was formed. The artists developed contemporary public artworks in rural areas, recycling reclaimed materials from the site. Some of the art works include sculpted benches around the Workhouse and chapel and bus shelters built using reclaimed materials and reflecting the 'local vernacular'. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Berrington, Shropshire ==Notes and references== ==External links== Website for Cross Houses Category:Villages in Shropshire ","title":"Cross Houses"},{"id":"2560162","text":"thumb Robert Dick (January 1811 ‚Äì 24 December 1866), Scottish geologist and botanist was born at Tullibody, in Clackmannanshire. His father was an officer of excise. At the age of thirteen, after receiving a good elementary education at the parish school, Dick was apprenticed to a baker, and served for three years. In these early days he became interested in wildflowers‚Äîhe made a collection of plants and gradually acquired some knowledge of their names from an old encyclopedia. When his time was up he left Tullibody and gained employment as a journeyman baker at Leith, Glasgow and Greenock. Meanwhile his father, who in 1826 had been removed to Thurso, as supervisor of excise, advised his son to set up a baker's shop in that town. Dick went there in 1830, started a business as a baker, and worked laboriously until his death. Throughout this period he zealously devoted himself to studying and collecting the plants, mollusca and insects of a wide area of Caithness. Soon after he settled in Thurso his attention was directed to the rocks and fossils. In 1835 he first found remains of fossil fishes; but it was not until some years later that his interests became greatly stirred. Then he obtained a copy of Hugh Miller's Old Red Sandstone (published in 1841), and he began systematically collecting with hammer and chisel the fossils from the Caithness flags. In 1845 he found remains of Holoptychius and forwarded specimens to Miller, and he continued to send the best of his fossil fish to that geologist, and to other geologists after the death of Miller. In this way he largely contributed to the progress of geological knowledge, although he himself published nothing and was never averse from publicity. His herbarium, which consisted of about 200 folios of mosses, ferns and flowering plants \\"almost unique in its completeness,\\" is now stored, with many of his fossils, in the museum at Thurso. Dick had a hard struggle for existence, especially through competition during his late years, when he was reduced almost to beggary: but of this few, if any, of his friends were aware until it was too late. A monument erected in the new cemetery at Thurso testifies to the respect which his life-work created, when the merits of this enthusiastic naturalist came to be appreciated. One of his discoveries, the 385 million-year-old placoderm Microbrachius dicki was confirmed as the earliest known example of copulation between two sexes. ==References== * * Category:1811 births Category:1866 deaths Category:People from Clackmannanshire Category:Scottish geologists Category:Scottish botanists Category:British bakers Category:19th-century Scottish people ","title":"Robert Dick"},{"id":"2560167","text":"A group of burrowing owls.

He was often known as \\"Dublin Bay Loftus\\". He was a member of Dublin City Council for 25 years, an alderman for much of that time, and a member of the Council's Planning and Development Committee. He was a member and honorary legal advisor of the Dublin Bay Preservation Association (later Dublin Bay Watch). ==Background== Born Se√°n D. Loftus in Dublin in 1927, he was the eldest of seven siblings. He attended Col√°iste Mhuire primary school on Parnell Square and received his secondary education at Catholic University School. His father was a doctor and Loftus attended medical school at University College Dublin but did not enjoy it, leaving before graduating. He moved to England in the late 1940s, where he worked as a builder. After six years, he returned to Ireland to attend King's Inns, qualifying as a barrister. He returned to England for several years before moving to the United States, where he worked and lectured. He moved back to Ireland in 1961. Loftus specialised in town planning law, lecturing in law at Bolton Street College of Technology (later the Dublin Institute of Technology). A resident of Clontarf, he campaigned for the sustainable development of Dublin Bay. Loftus was a devout Catholic. While he lived in the United States, he was an active member of the Montclair, New Jersey branch of an Irish-American Catholic fraternal organisation, the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH). He was guest of honor at the 1960 AOH National Convention by invitation of the National President, Jeremiah J. O‚ÄôCallaghan. Loftus moved back to Ireland in 1961. ==Political career== In 1961, Loftus founded the Christian Democrat Movement of Ireland and stood for election to D√°il √âireann at the 1961 general election in the Dublin North-East constituency, the first of sixteen attempts. In 1972 the Dublin Port and Docks Board proposed the building of an oil refinery in Dublin Bay. The plan was vigorously opposed by environmentalists, including Loftus, on the grounds that it posed a serious risk of pollution. At the 1973 general election, Loftus stood for election to the D√°il in the Dublin North-Central constituency as a Christian Democrat on the issue of Dublin Bay. Because the party was too small to be registered under the 1963 Electoral Act, meaning Loftus would be listed as 'Independent', he changed his name by deed poll to Se√°n D. Christian Democrat Dublin Bay Loftus in order that his political affiliation and campaign issue would appear on the ballot paper. Although not elected, he succeeded in highlighting the issue and the proposal was eventually turned down by the Minister for Local Government, James Tully. He was elected to Dublin Corporation in 1974. In the following years Loftus changed his name by deed poll several times more, to \\"Se√°n Dublin Bay Loftus\\", \\"Se√°n Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus\\" (as part of a campaign to press the Irish Government to make a territorial claim to the Rockall islet off the coast of County Donegal) and \\"Se√°n Alderman Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus\\",Nealon's Guide to the 22nd D√°il and Seanad, Ted Nealon and S√©amus Brennan, 1981. among others. It was under this last name that he was finally elected to the 22nd D√°il for the Dublin North-East constituency at the 1981 general election. This D√°il was short-lived, however, and he himself contributed to the end of his D√°il career when he voted against John Bruton's 1982 budget. At the February 1982 general election he stood in two constituencies, Dublin North-East and Dublin North-Central, but failed to win a seat in either. He continued to contest D√°il and European Parliament elections until 1997. He remained on Dublin City Council, and served as Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1995 to 1996. Loftus remained active as a member and honorary legal advisor of Dublin Bay Watch, and led opposition to the 2002 application by the Dublin Port Company to fill in of Dublin Bay. The application was rejected in June 2010 by the planning board, An Bord Plean√°la, while Loftus was in hospital, having undergone brain surgery. Local councillor Gerry Breen said its rejection was a \\"fitting tribute\\" to Loftus. ==Personal life== In 1962, Loftus married √öna U√≠ Lachtn√°in, a home economics teacher from Cootehill, County Cavan. They had 3 children. A committed Gaeilgeoir, she became heavily involved in Oireachtas na Gaeilge, and was elected President of Oireachtas na Gaeilge in 2011. U√≠ Lachtn√°in also served several years as Chairperson of the Dublin City Community Forum and was a founding member of the Bull Island Action Group. ==Death== Loftus died on 10 July 2010 at the Mater Private Hospital. His funeral mass took place at St. Gabriel's Roman Catholic Church in Dollymount and he was interred at St. Fintan's Cemetery, Sutton on 12 July 2010.

He married Catharina van Hasselt in 1800, and had three children. ==Career== Gogel was born in Vught, the son of Johan Martin Gogel, a German officer in the service of the army of the Dutch Republic, and of Alexandrina Crul. He had only a limited formal education and went to Amsterdam to apprentice for a career as a merchant at age 16, at the merchant house of Godart Kappel en Zoon. He started his own firm (Gogel, Pluvinot en Gildemeester) in 1791.Parlement & Politiek, op. cit Gogel was a typical \\"self-made man\\", a product of the petty-broking and merchandising world of Amsterdam. Though later one of the most prominent pioneering Dutch economists, he did not receive a formal education in this field. As a typical self-taught man he tended to borrow his ideas from all the great texts from the day, from Adam Smith to the Physiocrats. He became an adherent of the Patriot party in these years, because of the corruption he saw in the government of Stadtholder William V, and the steep decline of the country, especially in economic terms, that he held that government responsible for. This caused a lifelong enmity toward the rivals of the Patriot party, the Orangists.Schama, pp.215, 499-500, 653 Even before the Batavian revolution of 1795 and the proclamation of the Batavian Republic he became involved in revolutionary politics, on a local and later national, level.He wrote a fiery memorandum to the French representatives in Comines, Belgium, in February, 1794, inviting them to bring their revolution to the Dutch Republic. Later that year he was one of the delegates a Committee of Insurrection sent to general Charles Pichegru to ask for a speedy invasion by the French to help the revolution in the Netherlands;Schama, pp. 164-165, 173-174 After the January 22, 1798, coup d'√©tat by general Herman Willem Daendels, he was appointed agent for finance and foreign affairs (pro tem)Parlement & Politiek, op. cit. under the new Uitvoerend Bewind. However, the contraventions of the new, democratic, constitution of 1798 by the Vreede regime disaffected him, and he conspired with the other agents and again general Daendels to overthrow that regime in June, 1798. He then became a member of the Uitvoerend Bewind himself for a short while, till elections had been held for a new Representative Assembly.Schama, pp. 331, 348, 355 He was again appointed Agent, this time for Finance, by the new Uitvoerend Bewind. He now started on the reform of the Dutch system of public finance that was long overdue. He attempted to reorganize the tax system, but because this entailed abolition of the old, federal arrangements, he met strong resistance. He tried to attain three main objectives with his imposing General Tax Plan: construction of a system of regularly levied taxes, instead of the hodge-podge of ad hoc taxes and forced loans that the Republic had to rely on to make ends meet; a shift away from regressive, indirect taxes toward direct income taxes; and an equalization of the tax burden between different parts of the country.Schama, pp. 501-512 Besides, he proposed to form a new, national organisation to collect the taxes. His General-Taxation-Plan legislation was first proposed in 1799, but only enacted on March 25, 1801. ==Nationale Konst- Gallery== The Threatened Swan, the first of many works that Roos purchased and resold to Gogel Gogel was working on adopting many parts of the new revolutionary infrastructure that had recently been put into place in Paris, and one of these was the Louvre. Modelled on that concept, he envisioned a National art gallery for art-lovers and artists alike, that would promote the country's art heritage. His motivation was partially developed out of the worries shared by many art lovers in the Netherlands at that time that the French saviors of freedom would take more than just one collection with them to Paris, as in 1795 the entire contents of Willem V's gallery had been installed in the Louvre. He decided on a place and two major types of art, and these were the Huis ten Bosch location with its magnificent Oranjezaal and the concepts \\"historieele\\" and \\"moderne\\" art. Oddly the Rijksmuseum which was later founded with this collection at its core, still contains a split between \\"historical\\" and \\"modern\\" art. In fact most Catholic or Orangist art galleries had either hidden their collections or taken them away, such as the art collection of Villa Welgelegen in Haarlem. Gogel saw that under the new government, he was able to appropriate pieces from distributed Royal collections (such as the Oranjezaal itself) and felt that if he did this in a systematic way with the intention to found a national collection, he would thus \\"save\\" the art from the French \\"saviors\\". For his national inventory in 1799 he appointed an inspector for this job: Cornelis Sebille Roos. As a patriot, Gogel was mostly interested in what he saw as \\"patriotic\\" art that promoted the country and taught a moral lesson, which indicates that probably it was Roos who put the moralistic text on The Threatened Swan\\" in order to sell the painting to Gogel. Gogel was a member of the Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen in Haarlem, which was closely allied with the Teylers Museum, a similar museum initiative.Gogel in Van der Aa The museum was a bit far from the center of town however, and though it received enough visitors that Roos had to hire the assistant Jan Gerard Waldorp, the museum was moved in 1808 when Lodewijk Napoleon opened the Koninklijk Museum in the former city hall of Amsterdam. ==New Regime== By 1801 the political winds had changed again. The unitarian Constitution of 1798, on whose tenets the plan was based, was being undermined by the Uitvoerend Bewind itself. The new Constitution of 1801, that came into force after another coup in the Fall of that year, entailed a re-federalization of the state. Gogel courageously fulminated against the financial chapters of that Constitution before the referendum that was set up to approve it. Soon afterward he lost his job, because the central Agencies were abolished, together with the Uitvoerend Bewind. In May, 1802, another of his reform plans, the founding of a National Bank, was discarded by the new regime (to be revived only in 1814).Schama, pp. 385-388, 417 Gogel now became a private citizen again, forming a new commercial firm Gogel en d'Arripe. During his years in the wilderness he remained in touch with politics, however. In the Spring of 1804 he approached the then commander-in- chief of the French army of occupation Marmont, a confidant of Napoleon's, with information critical of the Staatsbewind of the Batavian Republic, and a project for a new constitution. At the same time, Marmont happened to be fishing around for information of other discontented Dutch politicians, on the orders of Napoleon. Soon a coalition was formed around the Batavian envoy to Paris, Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck that openly worked to drive out the Staatsbewind-regime. Gogel played an important role in this coalition, even though he (as a convinced unitarist) and Schimmelpenninck (as the leader of the federalists) did not see eye to eye on many things. However, Napoleon made clear that he preferred the unitarist vision of Gogel, and his opinion of course prevailed, when the Staatsbewind was replaced by the regime of Grand Pensionary Schimmelpenninck in May, 1805.Schama, pp. 455-464 Gogel now was appointed Secretary of State for Finance. Now he was able to push through his old General Taxation Plan, in slightly modified form. This was made easier by the fact that under the new constitution of 1805 the often-obstructionist Wetgevend Lichaam (Legislative Corps) had been made toothless. Though Gogel was a lifelong democrat, never making concessions on his belief that the franchise should be universal (unlike other Patriot politicians, who in the course of events changed their views in a more authoritarian direction), as a technocrat he saw the advantage of being able to make his views prevail. His tax reforms were enacted in June, 1805, and put into operation on January 1, 1806.Schama, pp. 476-477 However, the final days of the Batavian Republic were passing rapidly. Gogel was a member of the Groot Besogne (Grand Commission) that helped to negotiate the transition to the Kingdom of Holland under king Louis Napoleon, however reluctantly.Schama, p. 483 In 1806 this title was changed to Minister under the new kingdom. As such he had to deal with attempts of the old elites to water down his new system of taxation that had been implemented only a few months before over much opposition. However, at first he gained the support of the new king, who had been impressed by his warnings about the dire state of the Dutch economy at the time. Revenues under the new system were falling short of expectations, and the kingdom therefore had to rely even more than before on deficit financing. The credit of the Dutch state had now suffered so much, that it was no longer possible to float bond loans without the assistance of the Amsterdam merchant bankers that had previously only served foreign governments, like that of the United States, as intermediaries. Fortunately, the Dutch system for financing sovereign debt, foreign or domestic, was still unparalleled at the time. (1997), The First Modern Economy. Success, Failure, and Perseverance of the Dutch Economy, 1500-1815, Cambridge University Press, , pp. 139-147 A few years later, however, the first benefits of the new system (enhanced revenues, reduced administrative costs, formation of a national fiscal bureaucracy) had finally been realized.Schama, pp. 514‚Äì517 Some of those reforms were of lasting importance. As the verponding (land tax) was an important new element of the system a kadaster had to be implemented. This had important beneficial effects in the sphere of Dutch civil law, also.Schama, p. 519 Other persisting reforms: in 1807 he was able to enact a law to reform the Dutch coinage. He also was instrumental in the abolition of the guilds and other economic reforms, like the abolition of internal tariffs and other obstructions to trade. He was the first director of the predecessor of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences under the Kingdom of Holland. Like king Louis, Gogel had a difficult character. This led increasingly to personal conflicts. He resigned in 1809 because of a conflict with the king over a commission for further tax reform.Schama, pp. 522‚Äì523 After the annexation of the Netherlands in 1810, Gogel took up the duties of finance minister again, but now as intendant des finances in the part of the imperial government that was devoted to the Dutch departments of the French Empire. He did this in the illusion that he might be able to shield his compatriots from the worst excesses of the imperial administration. Legion were his attempts to persuade the government in Paris that certain allowances had to be made for special Dutch circumstances. But, these proved mostly in vain.Schama, pp. 617, 619‚Äì620 When the French lost their grip on the Netherlands in 1813, after the accession of William I of the Netherlands, Gogel fled to France. He was allowed to return to the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1814, but he refused to take office under the new regime, which he viewed as a restoration of the pre-1795 Orangist clique that he despised (though he relented shortly before his death to become a member of the new Raad van State). He returned to private life, and started a small factory. He died soon after in 1821 in Overveen.Schama, pp. 643‚Äì645 ===Political functions=== * April 7 ‚Äì October 2, 1798: Agent for Foreign Affairs, pro tem * June 12 ‚Äì August 14, 1798: Member Uitvoerend Bewind, pro tem * January 22, 1798 ‚Äì October 2, 1801: Agent for Finance * June 19 ‚Äì July 4, 1801: Agent for the Interior, pro tem * May 1, 1805 ‚Äì June 5, 1806: Secretary of State for Finance; * June 5, 1806 ‚Äì May 27, 1809: Minister of Finance * July 22 ‚Äì October 29, 1810: Member, Council for Dutch Affairs in Paris * October 30, 1810 ‚Äì November 16, 1813: Intendant des Finances et du Tr√©sor Public (administration des Finances des d√©partements des Pays-Bas) ===Titles and decorations=== * Grootkruis Orde van de Unie, Februari 17, 1807 * Grootkruis Orde van de Re√ºnie, Februari 22, 1812 * Commandeur in de Orde van de Nederlandse Leeuw * Commandeur de la L√©gion d'honneur, June 30, 1811 * Ch√©valier de l'Empire, 1811 ==Publications== *\\"Over de nadeelen der buitenlandsche geldlichtingen\\", in: De Democraten, Aug. 17, 1796. *\\"Memori√´n en correspondenti√´n betrekkelijk den staat van 's rijk's geldmiddelen in den jaren 1820\\" (posthumously; edited by his son, J.M.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 156. The village, and the large rural area that surrounds it, was years ago famous for flooding from the nearby rivers but since the extensive defences being installed in Shrewsbury and improvements to the flood defences in and around the Melverley area flooding causes no problems for the majority of residents. It is a controlled flood area, meaning that water is allowed to flow across the open fields and held for a few hours until the river levels fall. Melverley Green is a small village to the north of Melverley. == St Peter's Church== St. Peter's Church The notable building in Melverley is the black and white timber-framed St Peter's Church which stands on the banks of the River Vyrnwy; it is one of only three such churches to be found in Shropshire and one of 27 in England and the oldest of its kind. The church was rebuilt in 1406 after Owain Glynd≈µr burnt it to the ground. The church has a Jacobean pulpit and a chained bible (also known as a \\"Great Bible\\"). The stained glass in the chancel window, installed 1925‚Äì28, is all by the C & Kempe workshops. One of its lights is a memorial to parish men who died in World War I. It is thought that the design of St Peter's may have inspired the architecture of St Andrew's Episcopalian church in Newcastle, Maine. == Melverley and the \\"Potts Line\\"== Melverley was situated on the Potts Railway Line designed to link Shrewsbury with the small village of Llanymynech, near Oswestry. Unlike many stops on the line, the station at Melverley had a brick shed for waiting passengers (many stations had wooden facilities and timber platforms). A viaduct was built at Melverley in order for the line to cross the Severn but this crashed into the river in 1902. The viaduct was rebuilt to enable the re- opening of the line on April 13, 1911. It was subsequently declared unsafe on several occasions and was a contributory factor to the demise of the Potts Line. Today, little evidence of the railway remains at Melverley save for some bricks marking the platform edge. However, a road has been built along the course of part of this branch line to Criggion utilizing the old railway bridge over the Severn and making a convenient connection to the main road at Crew Green. This is a single-track road with passing places but is unusually direct and level compared to other country lanes in the area. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Melverley ==References== == Further reading == *BBC: Panoramic view of Melverley ==External links== Category:Civil parishes in Shropshire Category:Villages in Shropshire ","title":"Melverley"},{"id":"2560196","text":"Riitta Uosukainen Riitta Maria Uosukainen (n√©e Vainikka; 18 June 1942, J√§√§ski, Viipuri Province, Finland (now Svetogorsk, Leningrad Oblast, Russia)) is a Finnish politician and former Member of Parliament.

The parish is very small (both in area covered and population ‚Äì 220 people) and is located on the Shropshire Council/Telford and Wrekin Council boundary. ==St. John the Baptist Church== St John the Baptist Church, Withington The church in the village today was completely rebuilt in 1874 by G. E. Street, on the site of a much older building. It is built of sandstone with a tiled roof and low stone tower with spire to the west. This tower houses two bells from the 13th and 14th centuries in a frame circa 1800. Remnants of the furnishings of the earlier church have also survived ‚Äì the stone reredos depicting the crucifixion, the stone font, stone pulpit, chancel wall and the eagle lectern. Withington Church is renowned for its 16th century brasses, the oldest has effigies to John Onley, his wife and seven children (1515) The other brass is of Adam Grafton (1530). He was a former vicar of Withington (among many parishes!) and one time chaplain to Edward V and Prince Arthur.Text extracted from the \\"Saint John the Baptist Church Visitor Guide\\", written by L. J. Stone and available from the church entrance. The church contains a wooden war memorial plaque to the two men of the parish who died in the First World War and a framed Roll of Honour to those \\"Belonging to Withington or connected with the parish by ties of family or friendship and who served in His Majesty's Forces\\" in the same war. ==Hare and Hounds public house== The Hare and Hounds is Withington's public house. Located in the centre of the village, the pub serves cooked food on Friday and Saturday evenings as well as a roast at Sunday lunchtimes. ==History of the village== The following history of Withington, by Mary Macpherson, was first published in the 2003 Withington Parish Plan and updated for the 2008 Parish Plan. Withington has sat on the sidelines of national history as important events happened nearby, these included the Battle of Shrewsbury at Battlefield and an important civil war siege at High Ercall. It must have seen changes as the Saxon settlement of Wietone, the village in the willows, became part of the lands of the Norman Roger de Montgomery, William 1's cousin: later changes brought in land ownership by Haughmond Abbey, the Haughtons, the Corbet and the Tayleur estates. The earliest reference to a church here is 1160. Little is known about these early times. In the church are brasses, transferred from the previous church, to the memory of John and Johanna Onley and their children. It is believed he was lord of the manor at the old manor at Hunkington. By the choir is a brass to Adam Grafton who was priest of Upton Magna and of the Battlefield College as well as being vicar of Withington. He died in 1530. In the 1480s he was the tutor to the young king Edward V and his brother in Ludlow Castle. The population of the village was 91 conforming Anglicans over 16 in 1676. That does not allow for any children or members of other denominations but there would have been few of them. Little remains of these times but scattered around the village are eight half- timbered houses, most now beautifully restored and extended, which would have been in existence then. That they have survived and others have been demolished which were in better condition is one of the accidents of history. The blacksmith's shop opposite the pub, featured on postcards in the early years of the 20th century, was demolished in the 1960s. In 1710 a new manor house was built for Illedge and Mary Maddox; following this all future buildings were built in brick. One of the most attractive is the Old Hall, once the vicarage, and before that a gentleman's residence, built in the days of Queen Anne. Arrival of the canal Perhaps the biggest change was the coming of the canal, opened in 1797 and used mainly to carry coal from Ketley to Shrewsbury. Coal for Withington was unloaded at a wharf at the Old Post Office as well as farm foodstuffs, oil etc. It traveled alongside the churchyard wall where there was a big pool in front of Church Farm where the boats could turn. There were swing bridges there and by Canal Cottage and humpback bridges over the lanes to Walcot and Rodington where the lanes crossed the canal. Fishermen, skaters and walkers all used the canal and its towpaths. In 1944 the canal was closed and in the 1960s it was offered for sale to the landowners whose land adjoined it but if they did not want it, to the landowner on the other side, by the towpath. The population of Withington in 1861 was 232; the village boasted a blacksmith, two wheelwrights, a shopkeeper and the landlord of the Hare and Hounds. The vicar's salary was ¬£107 per annum; fortunately the Rev. Halke was a man of means. The majority worked in farming but a few worked on the railway. After the Great War A big change came after the First World War when Shropshire County Council bought of the Manor, bringing its smallholdings scheme to Withington. The original manor was then split into two smallholdings and five new white houses were built for small- holders. There were also three cottage holdings owned by the council. This made the County Council the largest landowner in the village. In 1911 the sale of the Tayleur estate led to changes in the Walcot Lees to Rodington area of Withington. Three farmers operating on a larger scale emerged at this time. The population in 1926 was 235. Again there were craftsmen among the farmers -a blacksmith, a carpenter and a boot and shoe repairer. Village children travelled to Upton Magna or Rodington for state schools but from the 1920s to 1940s there was a small private school in the Shrubbery. After 1945 for all secondary schools children travelled into Shrewsbury and Wellington but with a limited choice of schools. Children going to private or grammar schools took the train from Walcot or Upton Magna stations whilst pupils at the secondary modern at Harlescott were bused into Shrewsbury. This state of affairs changed with the closing of the stations. As a result of a petition the daily bus service from Shrewsbury to Upton Magna was extended to Withington. The 1960s and modernisation Withington remained an agricultural community on this scale until the late 1960s when changes began to occur. The population had become rather elderly, children moved away out of agriculture and, as houses came up for sale, they were bought by people who wanted to live in the country and had the means to modernise them. At the same time agricultural changes meant it was more viable to create bigger holdings. The council began consolidating its holdings into bigger units as tenants retired and later began the process of selling them to the tenants if they wished or to the public. Only two holdings remained in 2003 as council holdings but three former council holdings, which were sold, were still farming. Services came to Withington slowly. Electricity was pre-Second World War, water in the late 1950s, sewerage in the early 1970s and gas in the early 1990s. These services were a necessary precursor to development. In the 1970s new building took place in gardens along Caernarvon Lane and Sunnyfields was sold to a builder. This eventually resulted in development along Caernarvon Lane. The Woodlands land was sold in the early 1960s and building commenced in Woodlands Close in 1985. The style of houses built reflected the different lifestyles of the new residents and the advances in our expectations. Three Withington house owners had built swimming pools by 1990. Withington today Although Withington is a more affluent community than in the 1960s it still retains its village pattern developed around a green central field; this is clearly seen on aerial photos. From the 1960s onwards there were gains and losses in terms of rural life. On the retirement of the last vicar of Withington the parish was joined to the parish of Upton Magna, then to Uffington and is now part of a team ministry. Although these changes work well, it has meant several adjustments for longer stay residents. In 1982 the shop and post office closed and there have been problems maintaining a bus service to both Shrewsbury and Telford. However, newer residents continue to give new life to the church and take leading roles in it and the wider community through the Parish Council and local societies. They have helped to keep the school open at Upton Magna. The pub, the church and Parish Room still survive and there are local shopping and post office facilities in neighbouring villages. A major achievement in 2007 was the Parish Council's acquisition of the land in the center of the village to develop into a village green. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Withington, Shropshire Field of poppies near Withington. ==References== ==External links== *Withington Community Website *On-line photographic Archive Includes historic photographs and maps Category:Villages in Shropshire Category:Civil parishes in Shropshire ","title":"Withington, Shropshire"},{"id":"2560205","text":"Bischofia javanica, or bishop wood, is a plant species of the family Phyllanthaceae.

He was the second son of Thomas Edward Dicey, of an old Leicestershire family, who was senior wrangler in 1811, was a pioneer of the Midland Railway, and owned the Northampton Mercury. His mother Anne Mary, was sister of Sir James Stephen; aunt of Sir James Fitzjames Stephen and Sir Leslie Stephen. His younger brother was Professor Albert Venn Dicey. He was educated at home and, for about two years, at King's College, London. Edward went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1850, was president of the Cambridge Union, and graduated B.A. in 1854 with a third class in the classical tripos, and as a senior optime in mathematics. After leaving Cambridge he went for a short time into business without success, and then took to writing, for which he had inherited from his mother and her family a singular facility. He travelled abroad and interested himself in foreign politics. In 1861, he published both Rome in 1860 and Cavour a Memoir,. In 1862, Dicey visited America, and wrote on the American civil war in Macmillan's Magazine and the Spectator. In 1863 Six Months in the Federal States, 'met with a somewhat lukewarm reception,' on account of the northern sympathies of the author. In 1861, Dicey became connected with the Daily Telegraph, and his style and knowledge of foreign questions led to his being made a permanent member of the staff in 1862. Among his colleagues were Sir Edwin Arnold, an old school friend, Francis Lawley, and George Augustus Sala. He was a leader-writer for the paper, and also acted as special correspondent in the Second Schleswig War, and the Austro-Prussian War. While in the East in 1869, he accepted an offer of the editorship of the Daily News, and held this post for three months in 1870. On leaving it he at once became editor of the Observer, and filled that office for nineteen years (1870‚Äì89), continuing to write for the paper for some time after he ceased to edit it. Subsequently, he was a constant contributor to the Nineteenth Century, the Empire Review, and other periodicals. His interest in foreign politics remained keen, especially in the affairs of Eastern Europe. He was a frequent visitor to Egypt, and formed at first hand well-defined views of England's position there, at one time advocating the annexation of the country by Great Britain. He was a strong supporter of friendly relations between England and Germany, and closely studied South African matters in later years. Dicey had entered at Gray's Inn as a student in 1865, and was called to the Bar in 1875, but did not practise. During his later life he made his home in chambers in the Inn, of which he became a bencher in 1896, and treasurer in 1903 and 1904. In 1886, he was made a C.B. He was a familiar figure at the Athen√¶um and Garrick Clubs. He died at his chambers in Gray's Inn on 7 July 1911, and was buried in Brompton Cemetery, the first part of the funeral service taking place in Gray's Inn Chapel. ==Family== He married in 1867 Anne Greene Chapman of Weymouth, Massachusetts; she died in 1878; they had one son. ==Works== *Rome in 1860 (1861) *Cavour: A Memoir (1861) *Six Months in the Federal States (1863) *The Schleswig-Holstein War (1864) *The Battle-Fields of 1866 (1866) *A Month in Russia during the Marriage of the Czarevitch (1867) *The Morning Land, being Sketches of Turkey, the Holy Land, and Egypt (1870) *England and Egypt (1881) *Victor Emmanuel (1882) * *The Story of the Khedivate (1902) *The Egypt of the Future (1907). ==Notes== Attribution * ==References== * * == External links == * * * Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:English male journalists Category:English non-fiction writers Category:1832 births Category:1911 deaths Category:Burials at Brompton Cemetery Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:Presidents of the Cambridge Union Category:English newspaper editors Category:19th-century English people Category:20th-century British people Category:The Observer people Category:Members of Gray's Inn Category:Alumni of King's College London Category:English male non-fiction writers ","title":"Edward Dicey"},{"id":"2560249","text":"Eucharistic Miracle of Lanciano ‚Äì rear-lighted panel. On the left the heart tissue, on the right the pellets of blood. It is the first Eucharistic miracle in history. In Christianity, a Eucharistic miracle is any miracle involving the Eucharist. In the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Eastern Orthodox, Methodist, Anglican and Oriental Orthodox Churches, the fact that Christ is really made manifest in the Eucharist is deemed a Eucharistic miracle; however, this is to be distinguished from other manifestations of God. The Catholic Church distinguishes between divine revelation, such as the Eucharist, and private revelation, such as Eucharistic miracles. In general, reported Eucharistic miracles usually consist of unexplainable phenomena such as consecrated Hosts visibly transforming into myocardium tissue, being preserved for extremely long stretches of time, surviving being thrown into fire, bleeding, or even sustaining people for decades. Verification of Eucharistic miracles often depends on the religious branch reporting the supposed miracle, but in the case of the Catholic Church, a special task-force or commission investigates supposed Eucharistic miracles before deciding whether they are \\"worthy of belief.\\" As with other private revelations, such as Marian apparitions, belief in approved miracles is not mandated by the Catholic Church, but often serves to reassure believers of God's presence or as the means to \\"send a message\\" to the population at large. Anglican Churches have also reported extraordinary Eucharistic miracles. It is also not uncommon for religious authorities to allow secular sources to investigate, and verify, at least specifics (such as muscle type) of the supposed miracle. ==Real Presence== Sacrarium of the Eucharistic miracle of Lanciano Roman Catholic Eucharistic Doctrine draws upon a quasi-Aristotelian understanding of reality,See Edward J. Kilmartin, The Eucharist in the West: History and Theology, ed. Robert J. Daly (Collegeville: Liturgical Press/Pueblo, 1998), 147-153. in which the core substance or essential reality of a given thing is bound to, but not equivalent with, its sensible realities or accidents. In the celebration of the Eucharist, by means of the consecratory Eucharistic Prayer, the actual substance of the bread and wine are changed into the body and blood of Christ. This change in substance is not, however, the outward appearances of the bread and wine‚Äîtheir accidents‚Äîwhich remain as before. This substantial change is called transubstantiation, a term reserved to describe the change itself. Scholastic philosophical terminology was used but is not a part of the dogma that defined Christ's presence for the Roman Catholic Church at the Council of Trent. In the 13th session of 11 October 1551, it promulgated the following conciliar decree: \\"if anyone says that the substance of bread and wine remains in the Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist together with the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ and denies that wonderful and extraordinary change of the whole substance of the wine into His blood, while only the species of bread and wine remain, a change which the Catholic Church has most fittingly called transubstantiation, let him be anathema.\\" (Session 13, can.2)\\". Protestant views on the fact of Christ's presence in the Eucharist vary significantly from one denomination to another: while many, such as Lutherans, Anglicans, Methodists and the Reformed agree with Roman Catholics that Christ is really present in the Eucharist, they do not accept the definition of transubstantiation to describe it.See, e.g., Thomas J. Davis, This is My Body: The Presence of Christ in Reformation Thought (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2008). According to Thomas Aquinas, in the case of extraordinary Eucharistic Miracles in which the appearance of the accidents are altered, this further alteration is not considered to be transubstantiation, but is a subsequent miracle that takes place for the building up of faith. Nor does the extraordinary manifestation alter or heighten the presence of Christ in the Eucharist, as the miracle does not manifest the physical presence of Christ: \\"in apparitions of this sort ... the proper species [actual flesh and blood] of Christ is not seen, but a species formed miraculously either in the eyes of the viewers, or in the sacramental dimensions themselves.\\"Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae III, 76.8 ad 2: \\"...In huiusmodi apparitionibus. . . non videtur propria species Christi, sed species miraculose formata vel in oculis intuentium, vel etiam in ipsis sacramentalibus dimensionibus....\\" Translated for Wikipedia. Some denominations, especially Lutherans, have similar beliefs regarding the Eucharist and the Real Presence, though they reject the Roman Catholic concept of transubstantiation, preferring instead, the doctrine of the sacramental union, in which \\"the body and blood of Christ are so truly united to the bread and wine of the Holy Communion that the two may be identified. They are at the same time body and blood, bread and wine. ...In this sacrament the Lutheran Christian receives the very body and blood of Christ precisely for the strengthening of the union of faith.\\" Lutherans hold that the miracle of the Eucharist is effected during the Words of Institution. Both the Eastern Orthodox Churches and the Oriental Orthodox Churches, such as the Coptic Church, insist \\"on the reality of the change from bread and wine into the body and the blood of Christ at the consecration of the elements,\\" although they have \\"never attempted to explain the manner of the change,\\" thus rejecting philosophical terms to describe it. The Methodist Church similarly holds that Christ is truly present in the Eucharist \\"through the elements of bread and wine,\\" but maintains that how He is present is a Holy Mystery. All Anglicans affirm the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, though Evangelical Anglicans believe that this is a pneumatic presence, while those of an Anglo-Catholic churchmanship believe this is a corporeal presence, but at the same time still rejecting the philosophical explanation of transubstantiation. ==Extraordinary Eucharistic miracles== The Mass at Bolsena, fresco of Raphael (1512, in Raphael Rooms of Apostolic Palace, Vatican City) Eucharistic miracle of Bolsena in a reliquary made by Ugolino di Vieri ===Roman Catholic=== ====Mystical Fasting==== Some Catholic saints reportedly survived for years on nothing but the Eucharist. Marthe Robin fasted from all food and drink except the Eucharist from 1930 to her death in 1981. Teresa Neumann, the famed Catholic Stigmatic from Bavaria subsisted on no solid food but the Holy Eucharist from 1926 until her death in 1962 some 36 years later. In a biography written about her she stated that numerous times she attempted to eat other things only to have them regurgitate immediately upon attempting to swallow them. ====Supernatural Communion==== Some saints reportedly received Holy Communion from angels. One example is the visionaries of Our Lady of Fatima receiving the Eucharist from an angel. The angel, \\"whiter than snow, ... quite transparent, and as brilliant as crystal in the rays of the sun,\\" proffered the Eucharist host and chalice to the Trinity in reparation for the sins committed against it, then administered the Eucharist to the visionaries and instructed them to make acts of reparation. Another example is Saint Faustina receiving the Eucharist from a seraph. At one time, she saw a dazzling seraph dressed in a gold robe, with a transparent surplice and stole, holding a crystal chalice covered in a transparent veil, which he gave Faustina to drink.Divine Mercy In My Soul 1676 At another time, when she was doubting, Jesus and a seraph appeared before her. She asked Jesus, but when he did not reply, she asked the seraph if he could hear her confession. The seraph replied, \\"no spirit in heaven has that power\\" and administered the Eucharist to her.Divine Mercy In My Soul 1677 ==== Flesh, blood and levitation ==== The rarest reported type of Eucharistic miracle is where the Eucharist becomes human flesh as in the miracle of Lanciano which some believe occurred at Lanciano, Italy in the 8th century. In fact, Lanciano is only one of the reported cases of Eucharistic miracles where the host has been transformed into human flesh.Linoli O. \\"Histological, immunological and biochemical studies on the flesh and blood of the eucharistic miracle of Lanciano (8th century).\\" Quad Sclavo Diagn. 1971 Sep; 7(3):661-74 However, a Eucharistic miracle more commonly reported is that of the Bleeding Host, where blood starts to trickle from a consecrated host, the bread consecrated during Mass. Other types of purported miracles include consecrated hosts being preserved for hundreds of years, such as the event of the Miraculous Hosts of Siena. Other miracles include a consecrated host passing through a fire unscathed, stolen consecrated hosts vanishing and turning up in churches, and levitating consecrated hosts. The Mass at Bolsena, depicted in a famous fresco by Raphael at the Vatican in Rome, was an incident said to have taken place in 1263. A Bohemian priest who doubted the doctrine of transubstantiation, celebrated Mass at Bolsena, a town north of Rome. During the Mass the bread of the eucharist began to bleed. The blood from the host fell onto the altar linen in the shape of the face of Jesus as traditionally represented, and the priest came to believe.Vatican The following year, in 1264, Pope Urban IV instituted the Feast of Corpus Christi to celebrate this miraculous event. A gold-plated, silver and enamel reliquary was made in 1337-1338 by Sienese goldsmith Ugolino di Vieri to house the relic. The blood-stained Corporal of Bolsena is still venerated as a major relic in Orvieto Cathedral in central Italy. There have been numerous other alleged miracles involving consecrated Hosts. Several of these are described below. A story from Amsterdam, 1345, claims that a priest was called to administer Viaticum to a dying man. He told the family that if the man threw up, they were to take the contents and throw it in the fire. The man threw up, and the family did what the priest had advised them to do. The next morning, one of the women went to rake the fire and noticed the Host sitting on the grate, unscathed and surrounded by a light. It has apparently passed into both the man's digestive system and the fire unscathed. The story is commemorated with an annual silent procession through central Amsterdam.Dutch-language description: \\"In Amsterdam, gelegen binnen het bisdom Utrecht, was een man zwaar ziek en vreesde te sterven. Om hem de laatste sacramenten toe te dienen werd een priester geroepen. Deze gaf hem na de biecht het heilig sacrament van de eucharistie. Echter, na het eten van de geconsacreerde hostie kon de zieke een braakneiging niet onderdrukken. Hij ging naar de brandende haard van zijn kamer en braakte het sacrament daarin uit. Daarop bleek dat de zieke niet alleen de hostie onbeschadigd had uitgebraakt, maar dat bovendien het brood niet door het hoogopvlammende vuur werd aangetast.\\" According to another story, a farmer in Bavaria took a consecrated Host from Mass to his house, believing that it would give him and his family good fortune. However he was plagued by the feeling that what he had done was very wrong and turned to go back to the church to confess his sin. As he turned, the Host flew from his hand, floated in the air and landed on the ground. He searched for it, but he could not see it. He went back accompanied by many villagers and the priest who bent to pick up the Host, having seen it from some distance off. It again flew up into the air, floated, and fell to the ground and disappeared. The bishop was informed and he came to the site and bent to pick up the Host. Again it flew into the air, remained suspended for an extended time, fell to the ground and disappeared. An alleged 1370 Brussels miracle involves an allegation of host desecration; a Jew attempted to stab a Host, but it miraculously bled and was otherwise unharmed. The Hosts were venerated in later centuries. Another claim is that a church in the village of Exilles, Italy, was plundered by a soldier and the monstrance (with the host still inside) was taken. The sack with the monstrance fell off the soldier's donkey and the monstrance fell out. It immediately rose up into the air and was suspended ten feet above the ground. The Bishop was notified and immediately came to view the miracle. When he arrived, the monstrance opened and fell to the ground, leaving the Host still suspended in the air and surrounded by a radiant light. Caesarius of Heisterbach recounts various tales of Eucharistic miracles in his book Dialogue on Miracles; most of the stories he tells are from word of mouth. They include Gotteschalk of Volmarstein who saw an infant in the Eucharist, a priest from Wickindisburg who saw the Host turn into raw flesh, and a man from Hemmenrode who saw an image of a crucified Jesus and blood dripping from the Host. All of these images, however, eventually reverted into the Host. Caesarius also recounts more extraordinary tales, such as bees creating a shrine to Jesus after a piece of the Eucharist was placed in a beehive, a church that was burnt to ashes while the pyx containing the Eucharist was still intact, and a woman who found the Host transformed into congealed blood after she stored it in a box.Dialogue on Miracles, by Caesarius of Heisterbach, London : G. Routledge & sons, ltd., 1929 Corpus Christi Anglican Church ===Anglican=== At the 2017 Synodal Mass held at Corpus Christi Anglican Church in Rogers, Arkansas, Rev. Fr. Jason Rice of the Holy Catholic Church Anglican Rite, a Continuing Anglican denomination, affirmed a Eucharistic miracle in which \\"an image of a heavenly host appeared directly over the chalice immediately after the words of consecration.\\" == See also == *Serratia marcescens ‚Äì bacteria that can colonize flour/bread/wafer and give it red color, sometimes even resembling blood stains. ==References== == Bibliography == * Eucharistic Miracles, by Joan Carroll Cruz, OCDS, TAN Books and Publishers, Inc., 1987. * Sammaciccia, Bruno (1977): \\"Il miracolo eucaristico di Lanciano\\".

He demonstrated how the text of the Ulster Cycle of tales, written circa AD 1100, preserves an oral tradition originating some six centuries earlier and reflects Celtic Irish society of the third and fourth century AD. His Celtic Miscellany is a popular standard. In retirement, Jackson continued his work on place-names and Goidelic languages. However he suffered a stroke in 1984 that restricted his work. An obituary was published in The Times on 8 March 1991 and in the journal Nomina. ==Early life== Born at Beddington, Surrey, England, he was the son of Alan Stuart Jackson and his wife, Lucy Hurlstone. His early education was at Hillcrest School, Wallington (1916‚Äì19), and then at Whitgift School in Croydon, from 1920 to 1928. He won an open scholarship to St John's College, Cambridge in 1928. He studied under Hector and Nora Chadwick, becoming fluent in six Celtic languages. At Cambridge he read Classics and then studied the early cultures of Ireland and Britain. He was then awarded a travelling scholarship during which he undertook study and fieldwork in Wales and Ireland. In the 1950s he spent his vacations recording dialects for the Linguistic Survey of Scotland. ==Academic appointments== Jackson returned to Cambridge in 1934 as a lecturer in Celtic. In 1939 he went to Harvard University and was appointed an associate professor in 1940, being the first chair of the Department of Celtic Language and Literature. He undertook war service with the Uncommon Languages section of British censorship (where he said he learned Japanese in three weeks). Afterwards he went back to Harvard, and became a full professor in 1948. He accepted the chair of Celtic Languages, History and Antiquities at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland (1950‚Äì1979). == Publications == While at Edinburgh Jackson published articles and books on the ancient Celts, and the Dark Ages and Middle Ages, on all six modern Celtic languages, on folklore, placenames and dialects. A bibliography of his publications appears in Studia Celtica 14/14, pp 5‚Äì11 (1979‚Äì80). His writings are always insightful and stimulating, often the only sources in English for their subject, and even where the reader may wish to disagree with his conclusions, the weight of his erudition and mastery of the early Celtic material must be taken into account. It is scarcely possible to come across a publication or longer article on Celtic studies that does not refer to Professor Jackson's work. There is also the advantage for those not familiar with the Celtic languages that much of his work is in an English-language medium, although this can make an appreciation of Celtica rather unbalanced, as an understanding of sources in at least Welsh can help develop a larger picture, where different opinions are represented. ===List of publications=== * 1935.

A long-time veteran of the video game industry, Heineman was a founding member of video game companies Interplay Productions, Logicware, Contraband Entertainment, and Olde Sk√º√ºl. She has been chief executive officer for Olde Sk√º√ºl since 2013. == Early life == Rebecca Ann Heineman (born William Salvador Heineman) was born and raised in Whittier, California. When she was young, she could not afford to purchase games for her Atari 2600, so she taught herself how to copy cartridges and built herself a sizable pirated video game collection. Eventually, she became discontented with just copying games and reverse-engineered the console's code to understand how the games were made. In 1980, Heineman and a friend traveled to Los Angeles to compete in a regional branch of a national Space Invaders championship. Although she did not expect to fall under the top 100 contestants, she won the competition. Later that year, she also won the championship in New York. Heineman is hence considered to be the first national video game tournament champion. == Career == After she won the tournament, Heineman was offered a writing job for monthly magazine Electronic Games and a consultancy job for a book called How to Master Video Games. During this time, she mentioned to one magazine publisher that she had reverse-engineered Atari 2600 code, and the publisher arranged a meeting between Heineman and the owners of video game developer Avalon Hill. As she met with them, she was hired as a programmer instantaneously. Heineman, aged 16 at the time, moved across the U.S. for her new job, canceling her plans to acquire a high school diploma. At Avalon Hill, Heineman created a manual for the company's programming team, the studio's game engine, and the base code for several software projects, including her first own game, London Blitz, before leaving the company. Heineman returned to California to work for another developer, Boone Corporation. For Boone, she programmed the games Chuck Norris Superkicks and Robin Hood, acquiring knowledge of programming for Commodore 64, Apple II, VIC-20 and IBM PCs, of video game hardware, as well as video game design. Boone ceased operations in 1983, so Heineman got together with Brian Fargo, Jay Patel and Troy Worrell, and the four founded Interplay Productions (later known as Interplay Entertainment). Heineman acted as lead programmer for the company, working on Wasteland, The Bard's Tale, Out of This World, and the Mac OS and 3DO ports of Wolfenstein 3D. Heineman went on to design The Bard's Tale III: Thief of Fate, Dragon Wars, Tass Times in Tonetown, Borrowed Time, Mindshadow and The Tracer Sanction, among others, for Interplay. As the company grew to more than 500 employees, Heineman, wishing to return to her small-team roots, left the company in 1995 and co-founded Logicware, where she acted as chief technology officer and lead programmer. Aside from original games, Heineman oversaw the company's porting activities, which included Out of This World, Shattered Steel, Jazz Jackrabbit 2 and a canceled Mac OS port of Half-Life. In 1999, Heineman founded Contraband Entertainment, operating as its chief executive officer. The company developed several original games alongside ports to various platforms for other developers. Projects led by Heineman include Myth III: The Wolf Age and Activision Anthology, and Mac OS ports for Aliens vs. predator, Baldur's Gate II and Heroes of Might and Magic IV. During this time, she also provided consultancy work directly for other companies: She acted as \\"Senior Engineer III\\" for Electronic Arts, upgraded engine code for Barking Lizards Technologies and Ubisoft, optimized code for Sensory Sweep Studios, acted as senior software architect for Bloomberg L.P. and Amazon, provided training on Xbox 360 development for Microsoft's development studios, and worked on the kernel code for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 4 at Sony. During her tenure at Amazon, Heineman was, in addition to her technological role, also the \\"Transgender Chair\\" of Amazon's LGBTQ+ group, known as Glamazon. Contraband was wound down in 2013, and Heineman founded a new company, Olde Sk√º√ºl, together with Jennell Jaquays, Maurine Starkey, and Susan Manley. At Olde Sk√º√ºl, Heineman acts as CEO. == Personal life == Around 2003, Heineman was diagnosed with gender dysphoria and began transitioning to a woman. She formally changed her given name to Rebecca Ann. Since the transition, Heineman has been living as a lesbian. She has five children and is married to Jennell Jaquays. Heineman resides in El Cerrito, California, where her company Olde Sk√º√ºl is located. == Board service == Heineman has been part of the advisory board of the Video Game History Museum since 2011, and is part of the board of directors of LGBTQ+ organization GLAAD. == Accolades == Heineman is recognized as the first national video game tournament champion for winning the 1980 National Space Invaders Championship. Sailor Ranko, a Sailor Moon-based fanfiction created by Heineman, has won multiple awards. In 2017, she became an inductee for the International Video Game Hall of Fame. == Games == * The Bard's Tale (1985) * Borrowed Time (1985) * Tass Times in Tonetown (1986) * The Bard's Tale III: Thief of Fate (1988) * Neuromancer (1988) * Crystal Quest (1989, Apple IIgs port) * Dragon Wars (1989) * Track Meet (1991) * RPM Racing (1991) * Another World (1992, SNES port) * Rescue Rover (1993, Apple IIgs port) * Interplay's 10 Year Anthology: Classic Collection (1993) * Ultima I: The First Age of Darkness (1994, Apple IIgs port) * Wolfenstein 3D (1995, Mac/3DO ports) * Kingdom: The Far Reaches (1995) * Killing Time (1996) * Doom (1996, 3DO port) * Defiance (1997) * Tempest 2000 (1998, Mac port) * Remington Top Shot: Interactive Target Shooting (1998) * Redneck Rampage (1999, Mac port) * Jazz Jackrabbit 2 (1999, Mac port) * Galactic Patrol (1999, Mac port) * Bugdom (1999) * Myth III: The Wolf Age (2001) * Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn (2001, Mac port) * Nanosaur Extreme (2002) * Icewind Dale (2002, Mac port) * Hexen II (2002, Mac port) * Activision Anthology (2002) * Medal of Honor: Rising Sun (2003) * Pitfall: The Lost Expedition (2004) * Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault (2004) * GoldenEye: Rogue Agent (2004) * Medal of Honor: European Assault (2005) * Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars (2007) * Alvin and the Chipmunks (2007) * Chip's Challenge (2015, Windows re-release) == See also == * Dona Bailey * Danielle Bunten Berry * Jamie Fenton * Lucy Gilbert * Patricia Goodson * Amy Hennig * Brenda Laurel * Suki Lee * Chris Maddox * Cathryn Mataga * Carla Meninsky * Laura Nikolich * Carol Shaw * Carol Ryan Thomas * Joyce Weisbecker * Anne Westfall *List of programmers *List of women in the video game industry *Women and video games *Women in computing == References == == External links == * * Category:Interplay Entertainment people Category:LGBT people from California Category:Living people Category:Microsoft people Category:People from Whittier, California Category:Transgender and transsexual computer programmers Category:Transgender and transsexual women Category:Women video game programmers Category:1963 births Category: Computer programmers Category: Video game programmers ","title":"Rebecca Heineman"},{"id":"2560286","text":"Wielandieae is a tribe of the family Phyllanthaceae.

As the son of itinerant Lutheran preacher Lajos D√∂brentey, his early schooling was in P√°pa; he remained in grammar school in Sopron on the Austrian border until 1805. He completed his studies at the universities of Wittenberg and Leipzig, and was afterwards engaged as a tutor in Transylvania. In 1814 he originated and edited the Erd√©lyi Muzeum, which, notwithstanding its important influence on the development of Hungarian language and literature, soon failed for want of support. In 1820, D√∂brentei settled at Pest, and there he spent the rest of his life. He held various official posts, but continued zealously to pursue the studies for which he had early shown a strong preference. His great work is the Ancient Monuments of the Magyar Language (R√©gi Magyar Nyelveml√©kek), the editing of which was entrusted to him by the Hungarian Academy. The first volume was published in 1838, and the fifth was in preparation at the time of his death. D√∂brentei was one of the twenty-two scholars appointed in 1825 to plan and organize, under the presidency of Count Teleki, the Hungarian Academy. In addition to his great work he wrote many valuable papers on historical and philological subjects, and many biographical notices of eminent Hungarians. These appeared in the Hungarian translation of Brockhaus's Conversations-Lexikon. He translated into Hungarian Macbeth and other plays of Shakespeare, Sterne's Letters from Yorick to Eliza (1828), several of Schiller's tragedies, and Moli√®re's A vare, and wrote several original poems.

This would place them in or around modern Slovakia, Moravia and Lower Austria. Commentators generally compare the term to another one found in the same text (but located further north), the \\"Bainochaimai\\".

Strabo describes Boihaemum, as the domain of Marabodus, in the Hercynian forest, where he had moved some of his Suebian people and based his kingdom. Tacitus describes Boiemum in the same region, and specifically as a name derived from the more ancient Celtic tribe, the Boii, who had lived there in the past.

The final edit was achieved by the autumn of 1974 although distribution proper began in April 1975 Russian art film directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. It is loosely autobiographical, unconventionally structured, and incorporates poems composed and read by the director's father, Arseny Tarkovsky. The film features Margarita Terekhova, Ignat Daniltsev, Alla Demidova, Anatoly Solonitsyn, Tarkovsky's wife Larisa Tarkovskaya and his mother Maria Vishnyakova. Innokenty Smoktunovsky provides voiceover and Eduard Artemyev the incidental music and sound effects. Mirror is structured in the form of a nonlinear narrative, with its main concept dating back to 1964 and undergoing multiple scripted versions by Tarkovsky and Aleksandr Misharin. It unfolds around memories recalled by a dying poet of key moments in his life and in Soviet culture. The film combines contemporary scenes with childhood memories, dreams, and newsreel footage. Its cinematography slips between color, black- and-white, and sepia. The film's loose flow of visually oneiric images has been compared with the stream of consciousness technique in modernist literature. Mirror initially polarized critics and audiences, with many considering its narrative to be incomprehensible. The work has grown in reputation since its release, and ranked nineteenth in Sight & Sound's 2012 critics' poll of the best films ever made, and ninth in the directors' poll. It has also found favor with many Russians for whom it remains their most beloved of Tarkovsky's works.\\"...remains today most Russians' favourite Tarkovsky film.\\" Synessios (2001). Tarkovsky himself recounts in Sculpting In Time that Mirror provoked an overwhelming audience response that dwarfed his other movies. He received hundreds of letters expressing in the most movingly intimate terms how the film had made a profound impact on them. ==Plot== ===Structure and content=== Mirror depicts the thoughts, emotions and memories of Alexei, or Alyosha (Ignat Daniltsev), and the world around him as a child, adolescent, and forty-year-old. The adult Alexei is only briefly glimpsed, but is present as a voice-over in some scenes including substantial dialogue. The structure of the film is discontinuous and nonchronological, without a conventional plot, and combines incidents, dreams and memories along with some news-reel footage.Timo Hoyer: Filmarbeit ‚Äì Traumarbeit. Andrej Tarkowskij und sein Film \\"Der Spiegel\\" (\\"Serkalo\\"). In: R. Zwiebel / A. Mahler-Bungers (Hrsg.): Projektion und Wirklichkeit. Die unbewusste Botshaft des Films. Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, G√∂ttingen 2007, S. 85‚Äì110. . The film switches among three different time-frames: prewar (1935), war-time (1940s), and postwar (1960s or '70s). Mirror draws heavily on Tarkovsky's own childhood. Memories such as the evacuation from Moscow to the countryside during the war, a withdrawn father and his own mother, who actually worked as a proof-reader at a printing press, featured prominently. ===Synopsis=== The film opens with Alexei's adolescent son Ignat (also played by Ignat Daniltsev) switching on a television and watching the examination of a stammerer by a physician who finally manages to make her patient say without disruptions: \\"I can talk\\". After the opening titles roll, a scene is set in the countryside during prewar times in which Alexei's mother Maria (Margarita Terekhova) ‚Äî also called Masha and Marusya ‚Äî talks with a doctor (Anatoly Solonitsyn) who chances to be passing by. The exterior and interior of Alexei's grandfather's country house are seen. The young Alexei, his mother and sister watch as the family barn burns down. In a dream sequence Maria is washing her hair. Now in the postwar time-frame, Alexei is heard talking with his mother Maria on the phone while rooms of an apartment are seen. Switching back to the prewar time-frame, Maria is seen rushing frantically to her work-place as a proof-reader at a printing press. She is worrying about a mistake she may have overlooked, but is comforted by her colleague Liza (Alla Demidova), who then abruptly reduces her to tears with withering criticism. Back in postwar time, Alexei quarrels with his ex-wife, Natalia (also played by Margarita Terekhova), who has divorced him and is living with their son Ignat. This is followed by news-reel scenes from the Spanish Civil War and of a balloon ascent in the U.S.S.R. In the next scene, set in Alexei's apartment, Ignat meets with a strange woman (Tamara Ogorodnikova) sitting at a table. At her request, Ignat reads a passage from a letter by Pushkin and receives a telephone call from his father Alexei. The strange woman vanishes mysteriously. Switching to war-time, the adolescent Alexei is seen undergoing rifle training with a dour instructor, intercut with news-reel footage of World War II and the Sino-Soviet border conflict. The reunion of Alexei and his sister with their father (Oleg Yankovsky) at war's end is shown. The film then returns to the quarrel between Alexei and his wife Natalia in the postwar sequence. Switching again to prewar time, vistas of the country house and surrounding countryside are followed by a dreamlike sequence showing a levitating Maria. The film then moves to the postwar time, showing Alexei apparently on his death-bed with a mysterious malady. The final scene plays in the prewar time-frame, showing a pregnant mother, Maria, intercut with scenes showing Maria young and old. (Old Maria is played by Tarkovsky's own mother, Maria Vishnyakova.) ==Cast== Several of the characters are played by the same actors. * Filipp Yankovsky as the child Alexei * Ignat Daniltsev as the adolescent Alexei and Ignat, Alexei's son * Innokenty Smoktunovsky as the adult Alexei (voice only) * Margarita Terekhova as the young Maria/Masha/Maroussia, Alexei's mother, and Natalia, Alexei's wife * Maria Vishnyakova as the elderly Maria * Oleg Yankovsky, Alexei's father * Alla Demidova as Liza, Maria's friend at printing house * Anatoly Solonitsyn as Forensic doctor & pedestrian * Tamara Ogorodnikova as Nanny and Strange woman at the tea table * Larisa Tarkovskaya as Nadezhda, Alexei's neighbor * Arseny Tarkovsky as Narrator/Poet (voice only) * Olga Kizilova as the redhead girl ==Production== ===Writing=== The concept of Mirror dates as far back as 1964, when Tarkovsky wrote down his idea for a film about the dreams and memories of a man, though without the man appearing on screen as he would in a conventional film. The first episodes of Mirror were written while Tarkovsky was working on Andrei Rublev. These episodes were published as a short story under the title A White Day in 1970. The title was taken from a 1942 poem by his father, Arseny Tarkovsky. In 1968, after having finished Andrei Rublev, Tarkovsky went to the cinematographer's resort in Repino intending to write the script for The Mirror together with Aleksandr Misharin. This script was titled Confession and was proposed to the film committee at Goskino. Although it contained popular themes ‚Äì for example, a heroic mother, the war, and patriotism ‚Äì the proposal was turned down. The main reason was most likely the complex and unconventional nature of the script. Moreover, Tarkovsky and Misharin clearly stated that they did not know what the final form of the film would be ‚Äì this was to be determined in the process of filming. With the script being turned down by the film committee, Tarkovsky went on to make the film Solaris. But his diary entries show that he was still eager to make the film. Finally, the script was approved by the new head of Goskino, Filipp Ermash in the summer of 1973. Tarkovsky was given a budget of 622,000 Soviet ruble and 7500 metres (24,606 feet) of Kodak film, corresponding to 110 minutes, or roughly three takes assuming a film length of 3000 metres (10,000 feet). Several versions of the script for Mirror exist, as Tarkovsky constantly rewrote parts of the script, with the latest variant of the script written in 1974 while he was in Italy. One scene that was in the script but that was removed during shooting was an interview with his mother. Tarkovsky wanted to use a hidden camera to interview her on the pretext that it was research for the film. This scene was one of the main reasons why Vadim Yusov, who was the camera-man for all of Tarkovsky's previous films refused to work with him on this film. At various times, the script and the film was known under the titles Confession, Redemption, Martyrology, Why are you standing so far away?, The Raging Stream and A White, White Day (sometimes also translated as A Bright, Bright Day.). Only while filming Tarkovsky decided to finally title the film Mirror. (The final film does indeed feature several mirrors with some scenes shot in reflection.) A poster of Tarkovsky's 1969 film Andrei Rublev is seen on a wall. Mirror thus forms the third part, together with Tarkovsky's previous film Solaris which was made in 1972 and which references Andrei Rublev by having an icon made by him being placed in the main character's room, in a series of three films by Tarkovsky referencing Andrei Rublev. ===Casting=== Initially, Tarkovsky considered Alla Demidova and Swedish actress Bibi Andersson for the role of the mother. In the end Margarita Terekhova was chosen. ===Filming=== Principal photography began in late July 1973Synessios 2001, p. 27 and ended in March 1974. Outdoor scenes were shot in Tutshkovo near Moscow and the indoor scenes were shot at the Mosfilm studio. The naturalist style of the film required Margarita Terekhova to forego makeup completely. The completed film was initially rejected by Filipp Ermash, the head of Goskino in July 1974. One reason given was that the film is incomprehensible. Tarkovsky was infuriated about this rejection and even toyed with the idea of going abroad and making a film outside the Soviet Union. Mirror was ultimately approved by Goskino without any changes in fall 1974. ==Release== Mirror never had an official premiere and had only a limited, second category release with only 73 copies. Although it was officially announced for September 1975, it was shown as early as March 1975. ==Reception and Legacy== When Mosfilm critics were asked in November 1974 to evaluate Mirror, responses were divided. Some viewed it as a major work that would be better understood upon the analysis of future generations; others dismissed it as an unfocused failure and believed that even more cultured viewers would find its story opaque. This resulted in a very limited distribution. Many audience members walked out of theatrical screenings, but those who approved of the work were ardent in their praise. In a 1975 article for The New York Times, James F. Clarity reported that \\"in the first round of published reviews, in which some of Mr. Tarkovsky's fellow film makers evaluated his new work, there is much praise, tempered with criticism of some parts of the film.\\" Goskino did not allow it to be shown at the Cannes Film Festival. The managing director of the festival, Maurice Bessy, was sympathetic to Tarkovsky. Upon hearing that Mirror would not be allowed to be shown in Cannes, he unsuccessfully threatened not to take any other Soviet film. Mirror has an approval rating of 100% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 17 reviews, and an average rating of 9.21/10.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_mirror_1975 Mirror is now frequently listed among the greatest films of all time. In a 2012 Sight & Sound directors' poll, Mirror ranked as the 9th greatest film of all time. In a parallel poll by film critics, the film ranks at No. 19. In 2012, Will Self argued that it remains 'the most beautiful film ever made'. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called it \\"a startling piece of film-making\\" and described many of its images as \\"transcendentally brilliant\\". In the British Film Institute, the film is billed as \\"a work of cumulative, rhythmic effect\\" and its unconventional narrative is credited with having \\"pioneered a poetic and richly allusive form.\\" Director Michael Haneke voted for Mirror in the 2002 Sight & Sound directors' poll, and later said that he has seen the picture at least 25 times. ==Interpretation== While highly acclaimed, Mirror continues to be viewed as enigmatic. Natasha Synessios wrote that it is closer in structure to a musical piece than a narrative film, noting that Tarkovsky himself \\"always maintained that he used the laws of music as the film's organisational principle...emphasis placed not on the logic, but the form, of the flow of events.\\" Critic Antti Alanen billed the film as a \\"space odyssey into the interior of the psyche\\" and Tarkovsky's In Search of Lost Time. Howard Hampton argued that the work's central subject is \\"the inescapable persistence of the past.\\" ==Trivia== * A recitative from Johann Sebastian Bach's Johannes-Passion (\\"Und siehe da, der Vorhang im Tempel...\\") features in the score, as does the opening chorus of Johannes-Passion (\\"Herr, unser Herrscher, dessen Ruhm in allen Landen herrlich ist!\\") accompanying the film's memorable closing scene. * Another of Bach‚Äôs works, Das alte Jahr vergangen ist, BWV 614, played by Leonid Roizman, is heard during the opening credits. * The soundtrack also features an aria from Henry Purcell's The Indian Queen (\\"They tell us that your mighty powers\\"), played by Bath Festival Orchestra and conducted by Yehudi Menuhin. * A poster of Tarkovsky's 1969 film Andrei Rublev is seen on a wall. *Dante Alighieri‚Äôs Divine Comedy is quoted by the skipping collaborator at the Printing Press: \\"Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita, ...\\" ==References== Bibliography * * ==External links== * * * The Mirror at official Mosfilm site with English subtitles * Poems of Arseny Tarkovsky recited in the film * Voted #16 on The Arts and Faith Top 100 Films (2010) Category:1975 films Category:Soviet films Category:Russian-language films Category:Spanish-language films Category:1975 in the Soviet Union Category:1970s avant-garde and experimental films Category:1975 drama films Category:Soviet avant-garde and experimental films Category:Soviet drama films Category:Russian drama films Category:Russian films Category:Films directed by Andrei Tarkovsky Category:Films scored by Eduard Artemyev Category:Films set in Russia Category:Films set in 1935 Category:Films set in the 1940s Category:Films set in 1969 Category:Films shot in Moscow Oblast Category:Existentialist works Category:Non-narrative films Category:Mosfilm films ","title":"Mirror (1975 film)"},{"id":"2560320","text":"B21 comprises brothers Bally and Bhota Jagpal.

He is a former member of the boy band East 17, who were originally active from 1991 to 1997 and sold over 20 million records worldwide. Mortimer wrote the band's only number-one single, \\"Stay Another Day\\". ==Career== Mortimer was a member of the 1990s boy band East 17, with whom he had seven UK Top 10 singles and four hit albums between 1992 and 1997. He turned to songwriting when the group disbanded in 1997, due to negative media coverage after fellow member Brian Harvey said that he had taken 12 ecstasy tablets in one night. In 1998, Mortimer's East 17 bandmates briefly reformed the group without him, and released two singles as E17. They disbanded again the following year. During his time in East 17, Tony wrote the Childliners The Gift of Christmas which was a charity single featuring other popular chart acts at the time such as MN8, Backstreet Boys, Peter Andre, Boyzone and Dannii Minogue among others. In 2010, East 17 reformed as a three piece (minus former lead singer, Brian Harvey) and were seeking a new lead singer, a position filled in 2011 by Blair Dreelan. They released the single \\"Secret of My Life\\" from the projected album Recharged but Dreelan left the band due to a contractual obligation not to contribute to East 17, while he was still connected with his previous musical group. The band scrapped the album and in 2012 released the newly recorded, Dark Light, with Mortimer in place as the lead vocalist. The group toured Europe throughout 2011 and in early 2012. In June 2012 they returned to Australia for the first time in over 15 years. Two singles were released from Dark Light; \\"I Can't Get You Off my Mind\\" and \\"Friday Night\\", whilst a third single, \\"Counting Clouds\\", was due for release in July 2012. Mortimer has continued as a record producer since 1997, from his studio in Essex, as well as recording his own songs including the single \\"N Toxyc 8\\". Mortimer has also managed bands, including girl group Urban Angel, whose members included Roxanne Pallett, who wrote some of the group's songs. The band broke up after Pallett won a role in ITV soap opera Emmerdale. Mortimer appeared on Never Mind the Buzzcocks in Season 19 on Episode 3. He competed in the BBC's Winter Wipeout series in March 2012 and finished second, ahead of former Coronation Street star Steven Arnold, but behind the winner Eddie \\"The Eagle\\" Edwards. In December 2012, Mortimer appeared as a panellist on Channel 5 show The Wright Stuff and again in June 2013. on 17 June 2013 he released his debut solo album Songs from the Suitcase. In early 2014, Mortimer departed from East 17 to focus more on his solo career. ==Personal life== Mortimer has two daughters with his partner Tracey.

All the ships have their home port in Pansio. All four vessels underwent a 70 million EUR modernization program at the Western Shipyard in Teijo. The program includes the installation of a new version of the 9LV225 control and command system made by SAAB (the Mk.3 has been replaced by a Mk.4), the replacement of the Mistral SAM missiles with a MASS decoy system. The MASS system also replaces the Philax chaff and IR flares, the Thales Matilda radar warning system, and the six 103 mm rails for rocket illuminants, that were previously fitted. The sonar and ASW systems are being completely renewed (the previous Simrad ST 240 has been replaced by a ST2400).

It was founded in 1997 by Faisal Alam, a Pakistani American, and was registered as a nonprofit organization in the United States until 2011. ==History== Members of Al Fatiha at the LGBT Pride parade in San Francisco 2008. Alam founded Al-Fatiha in November of 1997. The organization grew out of an internet listserve for questioning Muslims from 25 countries, and by October 1998 had developed numerous in-person chapters. At its height, Al- Fatiha had 14 chapters in the United States, as well as offices in England, Canada, Spain, Turkey, and South Africa and was the largest gay rights organization in the world. The name \\"Al-Fatiha\\" means \\"the Opening.\\" It is also the name of the first chapter of the Qur'an. In the beginning of that chapter ('surah'), God is described as compassionate and merciful; the organization's founders believe that these attributes characterize Islam, rather than hatred and homophobia. Each year, Al-Fatiha hosted an international membership retreat and conference. Early conferences took place in Boston, New York, and London in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and focused on issues such as the reconciliation of religion and sexual orientation. The last Al-Fatiha conference was held in 2005 in Atlanta, Georgia. ===Fatwa=== In 2001, Al-Muhajiroun, an international organization seeking the establishment of a global Islamic caliphate, issued a fatwa declaring that all members of Al-Fatiha were murtadd, or apostates, and condemning them to death. Because of the threat and coming from conservative societies, many members of the foundation's site still prefer to be anonymous so as to protect their identity while continuing a tradition of secrecy.Tim Herbert, \\"Queer chronicles\\", Weekend Australian, October 7, 2006, Qld Review Edition. ===Challenges=== While Al-Fatiha worked to combat homophobia within Muslim communities, it also felt it faced the challenge of seeking to avoid provoking an Islamophobic reaction among non-Muslims. After the organization's founder, Faisal Alam, stepped down, subsequent leaders failed to sustain the organization. It began a process of legal dissolution in 2011. One of the challenges that Al-Fahita faced is that the basic and common value regarding genders of Islam religion. The value of fundamental Islamist toward genders is relatively, in fact, very strict compare to other religions. For example, the extreme Muslim group \\"Taliban\\" actively harass women and LGBT people inside Afghanistan Taliban controlled territories. They kill women for going to school and kill LGBTs for being sexual minorities. Sometimes, Muslim communities not only discriminating, but also violent. ==See also== * Liberal movements in Islam * Lut, source of Qur'anic injunctions against homosexuality * Homosexuality and Islam * Board member Daayiee Abdullah ==References== ==External links== * Al- Fatiha homepage (website discontinued since 2009) * Muslim Alliance for Sexual and Gender Diversity (Founded 2013, USA) * Imaan, UK Muslim LGBT support organisation Category:LGBT Muslim organizations Category:International LGBT political advocacy groups Category:LGBT political advocacy groups in the United States Category:Islamic charities based in the United States Category:Liberal and progressive movements within Islam Category:1997 establishments in the United States Category:2011 disestablishments in the United States Category:Islamic organizations established in 1997 Category:Organizations disestablished in 2011 Category:1997 in LGBT history Category:2000s in LGBT history Category:1990s in Islam Category:LGBT religious organizations in the United States ","title":"Al-Fatiha Foundation"},{"id":"2560346","text":"The original castMama was a weekly CBS Television comedy-drama series that ran from July 1, 1949 until March 17, 1957. The series was based on Mama's Bank Account by Kathryn Forbes, which was also adapted for the John Van Druten play (1944) and the subsequent film I Remember Mama (1948), and told the ongoing story of a loving Norwegian family living in San Francisco in the 1910s through the eyes of the elder daughter, Katrin Hansen (Rosemary Rice). Katrin would be seen looking through the pages of the family album at the start of each episode with the opening narration: > This old album makes me remember so many things in the past. San Francisco > and the house on Steiner Street where I was born. It brings back memories of > my cousins, aunts and uncles; all the boys and girls I grew up with. And I > remember my family as we were then. My big brother Nels, my little sister > Dagmar, and of course, Papa. But most of all, when I look back to those days > so long ago, most of all, I remember ... Mama. The show was originally broadcast live from CBS Studio 41 above the 42nd Street waiting room in Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal and was sponsored by Maxwell House and Post Cereal. ==Characters and story== In addition to veteran stage actress Peggy Wood in the title role of Marta Hansen and Rosemary Rice as Katrin, the cast included Judson Laire as Papa and Dick Van Patten as brother Nels. The youngest child, Dagmar, was portrayed by Robin Morgan (who later became a radical feminist activist and poet) and then by Toni Campbell after Morgan left the show. Also featured were Ruth Gates (as Aunt Jenny), Carl Frank, Alice Frost, Malcolm Keen, Roland Winters, Kevin Coughlin and Patty McCormack. Gates was the only member of the cast to have played her role in the original Broadway production in 1944. The series was different from the play and film in that there were only three children instead of four, with the character of daughter Christine being eliminated. Also, Mama had two sisters instead of three, consisting of Jenny and, occasionally, Trina ‚Äì Sigrid was never seen or referred to. The character of Mama's Uncle Chris (played by Roland Winters) made a few appearances on the program, but the character of Mr. Hyde was deleted from the series. However, in a 1957 episode, \\"The Seventh Age\\", a character was featured with a different name - Mr. Carlysle (played by actor Bramwell Fletcher) - who was very similar to Mr. Hyde, in that he was a kind man, although a down and out, penniless, aging actor whom the Hansens took in as a boarder. Although earlier incarnations of I Remember Mama had focused primarily on the relationship between Marta and Katrin, the television series typically dealt with a specific family member's problem and eventually drew the whole family into helping with its resolution. The program aired live, and kinescope recordings were prepared for West Coast broadcasts. The popularity and high ratings of Mama prompted a national re-release of the I Remember Mama film in 1956. In some theaters, this reissue included a stage presentation of \\"Dish Night\\", a recreation of the dinnerware giveaways theaters held during the 1930s to attract ticket-buyers. From its premiere in 1949 to 1955, Mama proved to be not only a ratings winner for CBS, but it also became a Friday night tradition when millions of families across America (including children already dressed for bed) gathered around the television set at 8:00PM to tune into another episode of the Hansen family. ==From live to film== By the end of the 1955‚Äì56 season, even though the ratings for Mama were still respectable, viewership had decreased; Maxwell House, who co-sponsored the show, complained that not enough viewers were buying their coffee. This complaint led to CBS's cancellation of the show in July 1956. Carol Irwin, the show's producer, urged viewers to write the network demanding a return of the show. As a result, 175,000 letters poured into CBS, and the network immediately renewed the show. Unfortunately, with the prime-time schedule already filled, CBS scheduled Mama at 5:00pm on Sunday afternoons beginning December 16, 1956. This time, 26 episodes were filmed. The entire cast was reunited with the exception of actress Robin Morgan, who had portrayed the youngest daughter Dagmar beginning in 1950. Morgan opted not to continue with the role, wanting to pursue writing rather than acting. So, when Mama returned to CBS in December, 1956, the role of Dagmar was played by actress Toni Campbell. However, because of its less- than-desirable new time slot, Mama's ratings plummeted to the point of ultimately terminating its run three months later in March 1957, with several episodes left unaired. Nevertheless, after eight years of playing Marta Hansen, Peggy Wood was honored with her second Emmy nomination as best actress in a drama series. Her first nomination was for her work on Mama during the 1952‚Äì1953 television season. It was during this season that the orchestral accordionist John Serry Sr. collaborated with Peggy Wood on the show. Even though she did not win on the night of the 1956‚Äì57 Emmy Awards, in admiration for the long-running success of Mama and the great affection the public felt for Wood, the Television Academy asked her to present the last award of the evening: Best Single Program of the Year, which went to Playhouse 90's Requiem for a Heavyweight. In the fall of 1957, the complete 1956‚Äì57 filmed season of Mama aired on New York's WPIX-TV Channel 11. However, as the live (kinescoped) episodes are largely lost, Mama is unfamiliar to later generations of viewers. The aforementioned 26 filmed episodes from the last season of the show have occasionally been screened on public access stations. In 1985, the Museum of Broadcasting in Manhattan presented a retrospective of Mama by arranging screenings of several of the live television broadcasts (1949‚Äì56), which had been donated by various sources, as well as a seminar featuring the three actors who played the Hansen children - Rosemary Rice (Katrin), Dick Van Patten (Nels), Robin Morgan (Dagmar) - and longtime director, Ralph Nelson. The Museum also discovered all 26 episodes of the filmed season of Mama (1956‚Äì57) in a CBS storage facility in New Jersey; not only did these episodes become part of the screening exhibition, but they were also added to the Museum's collection. Rice donated several kinescopes she kept from the show for the exhibition. The opening and closing musical pieces were the \\"Holberg Suite\\" and \\"The Last Spring\\" by the Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg. Director- producer Ralph Nelson, himself of Norwegian descent, went on to direct the film Lilies of the Field. ==Awards== The series received two Emmy nominations: one in 1951 and another (for Peggy Wood's performance) in 1957. ==Ratings== Mama was one of the first TV sitcoms to consistently finish in the Nielsen ratings' top 30 after they were instituted in the 1950‚Äì1951 season: # 1950‚Äì1951: #10 # 1951‚Äì1952: #11 # 1952‚Äì1953: #18 # 1953‚Äì1954: #26 In the 1954‚Äì1955 seasons and afterward, Mama was not in the top 30 and its ratings data are not available. ==References== ==Further reading== *Holden, Stephen.

Old Brompton Road is a major street in the South Kensington district of The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, London. It starts from South Kensington Underground station and runs south-west, through a mainly residential area, until it reaches West Brompton and the area around Earl's Court tube station. It runs through the SW5 and SW7 postcodes. There are several 5-star hotels and upmarket shops along the road. One of the most famous auction houses in the world, Christie's, was located near the eastern end of the road at number 85. The Coleherne pub (now The Pembroke), located at number 261, has become infamous for being the stalking ground for three serial killers, Dennis Nilsen, Michael Lupo and Colin Ireland. It is also mentioned in the song 'Hanging Around' by The Stranglers, as well as in Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City book Babycakes. Another landmark of the road is the Troubadour which has been a cultural hub for over fifty years. The coffee-house above, now a restaurant, has hosted the founding of Private Eye and the writing of many books, while the club below has been a venue for Bob Dylan and Adele. The Drayton Arms is a Grade II listed pub and theatre at number 153. The most famous resident was Diana, Princess of Wales before her 1981 engagement and subsequent marriage to Charles, Prince of Wales. She shared a flat with three others before subsequently moving on to Clarence House. The road is sometimes confused with Brompton Road which lies further to the east, in Knightsbridge. ==See also== * Brompton, London ==References== Category:Streets in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Old Brompton Road Category:South Kensington ","title":"Old Brompton Road"},{"id":"2560370","text":"Enrico Arrigoni (pseudonym: Frank Brand) (February 20, 1894 Pozzuolo Martesana, Province of Milan ‚Äì December 7, 1986 New York City) was an Italian American individualist anarchist, a lathe operator, house painter, bricklayer, dramatist and political activist influenced by the work of Max Stirner.Enrico Arrigoni at the Daily Bleed's Anarchist Encyclopedia Paul Avrich. Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America == Life and activism == He took the pseudonym \\"Brand\\" from a fictional character in one of Henrik Ibsen¬¥s plays. In the 1910s, he became involved in anarchist and anti-war activism around Milan. From the 1910s until the 1920s, he participated in anarchist activities and popular uprisings in various countries including Switzerland, Germany, Hungary, Argentina and Cuba. He lived from the 1920s onwards in New York City, and there he edited the individualist anarchist eclectic journal Eresia in 1928. He also wrote for other American anarchist publications such as L' Adunata dei refrattari, Cultura Obrera, Controcorrente and Intessa Libertaria. During the Spanish Civil War, he went to fight with the anarchists but was imprisoned and was helped in his release by Emma Goldman. Afterwards, Arrigoni became a longtime member of the Libertarian Book Club in New York City. He lived in the US as an illegal immigrant. During the 1960s, he helped Cuban anarchists who were suffering the repression of the recently established Fidel Castro¬¥s Marxist-Leninist regime.\\"In the company of his old Italian friend Enrico Arrigoni, and urged on by him, Ferro commenced ‚Äúto write several articles about the Cuban reality‚Äù which, with the help of Arrigoni‚Äôs translations, were published in the anarchist press of France, Italy, Mexico, and Argentina.

Umanita Nova refused to publish Ferro's articles (translated by Arrigoni), saying that they didn't want to create a polemic. At that point, Arrigoni accused them of being in the pay of the Communists, and they eventually published Ferro's responses to Borghi. A few months later, Borghi ‚Äî ignoring the points raised by Ferro ‚Äî published a new defense of Castroism in L‚ÄôAdunata, but Umanita Nova refused to publish Ferro's response to it.\\"Frank Fern√°ndez.

The original Big Trak was a six-wheeled (two-wheel drive) tank with a front-mounted blue \\"photon beam\\" headlamp, and a keypad on top. The toy could remember up to 16 commands, which it then executed in sequence. There also was an optional cargo trailer accessory, with the U.K. version being white to match its colour scheme; once hooked to the Bigtrak, this trailer could be programmed to dump its payload. In 2010, BIG TRAK was relaunched in the form of a slightly modified replica (cosmetically very similar to the original U.K. bigtrak), produced under licence by Zeon Ltd. There is also a small dedicated Internet community who have reverse engineered the BIG TRAK and the Texas Instruments TMS1000 microcontroller inside it. == Versions == === The original Milton Bradley U.S. and U.K. versions === U.K. version of the keypad The U.S. and U.K./European versions were noticeably different. The U.S. version was moulded in gray plastic and labelled \\"BIG TRAK\\", while the U.K. version was white and labelled \\"bigtrak\\" with a different keypad. The U.S. version had Revision C, D, and E motherboards. While the U.K./European had Revision L and so on motherboards.Big Trak Versions, Serial Numbers, and Research === The unofficial Elektronika Soviet clones, Lunokhod and Planetokhod === Elektronika IM-11 In the Soviet Union, a clone was made under \\"Elektronika IM-11\\" designation. The early production version was named Lunokhod after the Lunokhod programme. It featured an obstruction sensor disguised as a plastic front bumper, which would stop the program when the toy got stuck. However, there was no provision for an accessory, and its motion sensor was based on a cheaper reed switch instead of an opto-isolator. A later version, named \\"Planetokhod,\\" additionally featured a shootable rotor blade as an accessory, LED head and rear lamps, and the on/off switch was relocated to the rear side. A Soviet popular science journal Nauka i Zhizn published a detailed article on the IM-11.\\"Lunokhod for informatics study.\\" ‚Äì Nauka i Zhizn,1988,‚Ññ4 (Russian magazine) === The Zeon Ltd replica === Zeon 2010 Bigtrak ‚Äì no stickers affixed. In 2010, Zeon Ltd released a replica of the original toy.New bigtrak by Zeon Ltd Stuff.tv - Big Trak returns from pre-programmed trip to the '80s The colour and graphic scheme are based on the U.K. version and all stickers have been redrawn as a direct copy of the original artwork. However, the replica differs in several ways from the original. 1) The circular hatch on the original was removable, to allow access to the 9v battery powering the electronics. On the replica, this hatch is fixed shut as the 9v battery is no longer used. 2) The main electronics circuit board is completely different, with surface-mount components and a different processor chip and software. 3) Motor rotation is detected by rotating magnets fitted to the motors, and hall- effect detectors on the circuit board - the original used optical detectors. 4) The original used an incandescent light bulb; the replica uses an LED. 5) The original used 4 x 'D' cell batteries and a 9v PP3 battery; the replica just uses 3 x 'D' cells. Since the initial release of the replica, a second version has been introduced, the differences being in the test program and the power switch. Version 1 has a single-position power switch, either on or off, whereas version 2 has a 3-position power switch, centre off, forward for use on carpets, back for use on smooth floors. This affects the stall-detection in the electronics, as the original version seems to have been designed to run on smooth floors, and easily stalls when attempting to turn on carpet. The test program for version 1 runs the unit forwards, pauses, then runs backwards; in version 2, the model runs forward, then turns 180 degrees, runs forward again, then backs up a little. === The Bigtrak Rover === A new model, the Bigtrak Rover, is scheduled for release by Zeon Ltd in late 2014. This model is based on the Junior chassis. \\"Robotics go back to the future with the retro looks of smash-hit 80s toy Bigtrak working together with high-tech smartphone technology. Now you can have your very own mini Bigtrak robot controlled by your smart device. Rover's on-board camera streams live video from his field of view, directly to your computer, tablet or phone. Bigtrak Rover uses contactless technology to go exploring. He will go forwards, backwards and spin both clockwise and anti-clockwise. Cones are included for orienteering fun. Bigtrak Rover can be controlled by simply downloading a free App from the App Store or Android Marketplace and then follows commands from your iPhone, Android device, PC, Mac or tablet. Bigtrak Rover does not draw any power from your smartphone, and does not require Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity.\\" === The Bigtrak XTR === The Bigtrak XTR was intended for release in 2012The new Bigtrak XTR coming soon but has not yet launched . It is an updated version of Bigtrak, its form based on the Bigtrak Jr with the 'cockpit' modified to be much smaller and streamlined. It can be controlled remotely using a computer, iOS, or Android device. The controls for the iOS / Android version allow for either tilting control or touch control. A foldable tray hides and protects the keypad from accidental input. The tray also functions as a cargo area that can detect an object placed on it. The Bigtrak XTR has two ports for optional accessories, one on the top and one on the front. The accessories are: Camera (XTRcam), computer communication module (XTRCom) that also allows another accessory to be plugged to it, light (LightBar), Infrared emitter (IRGun), and projectiles (XTRMissile). The camera can track an object.A demonstration video of Bigtrak XTR === The Dubreq desktop version, Bigtrak Jr === Dubreq Ltd under license from Zeon Ltd has released a 190mm long desktop version of the Bigtrak toy called \\"Bigtrak Jr\\". Like the original Bigtrak from the 1970s, it has an active accessory port for accessories including a rocket launcher (as an active accessory) and a drinks can carrier (as a passive accessory).http://www.frequencycast.co.uk/bigtrak.html == The bigtrak sound emulator for the Apple iOS == A simple iPhone app, bigtrak iCalc bigtrak iCalc iPhone app emulates the original bigtrack sounds. == Power == BigTrak main board. Made in Spain, with a microcontroller chip made in the Philippines. The original Big Trak uses a 9 volt battery to power its microcontroller, while the 4 D cell batteries are used to power its electric motors. This electrical isolation helps prevent any electrical noise from the motor, speaker, and lamp from resetting or interfering with the microcontroller.\\"This electrical isolation helps prevent electrical noise from the motor, speaker, and lamp from resetting or interfering with the microcontroller.\\" - Robot Room The re- release Zeon version uses only 3 D cell batteries to power both its microcontroller and electric motors, while the Bigtrak Jr version only needs 3 AA batteries to power both its microcontroller and electric motors. The original optional cargo trailer uses a single D cell battery to power its electrical motor, both for driving and dumping operations. While the optional rocket launcher accessory for the Bigtrak Jr uses 3 AA batteries. == Programming the Big Trak == Various commands can be given, such as: \\"go forward 5 lengths\\", \\"pause\\", \\"turn 15 minutes right (90 Degrees)\\", \\"fire phaser\\", and so on. There is also a \\"repeat\\" instruction allowing simple loop to be performed, but the language is not Turing complete, lacking branching instructions; its programming also resembles the principles of turtle graphics from Logo programming language. The Big Trak also lacks any sort of sensor input other than the wheel sensors, though recent re-released versions do have the ability to accept optional external input. == Programmable keypad == BigTrak Keypad (U.S.) There were no LED displays or ways to display program instructions, beyond actually running the program, which was done by pressing \\"GO\\". Each command inputted will be added next to the previous command inputted, allowing the operator to build a list of commands up to 16 commands. All programming to BigTrak was done through the keypad shown here: * Forward/Backwards: Move forward or backwards in units of body length * Left/Right: Turn left or right in units of roughly 1/60th of a full rotation * HOLD: Pause in 1/10 of second time units (U.K. version; P: Pause) * FIRE: Fire the light bulb \\"laser\\" (U.K.; Photon Symbol) * CLR: Clear the program (U.K.; CM: Clear Memory) * CLS: Clear Last Step (U.K.; CE: Clear Entry) * RPT: Repeat a number of steps (primitive loop) (U.K.; x2: Repeat key) * TEST: Run short test program * CK: Check last instruction (U.K.; Tick symbol) * Out: Dump optional trailer accessory * In: Reserved for future expansion (U.K.; missing. Disabled or not implemented on most if not all BigTraks) === In and Out commands === The Bigtrak is capable of communicating with an optional accessory. It uses an electrical 3.5 mm jack for its communication. Older bigger Bigtrak can also use a Bigtrak Jr optional accessory with an adaptor. However the newer Bigtrak XTR uses a different type of communication port, therefore it is not compatible with any previous Bigtrak accessory. The Out command is used in the 1970s/1980s Bigtrack to dump the cargo on its optional cargo trailer accessory. While in the modern 2010s Bigtrack, it is used to do things such as shooting missiles. However, the hardware on the late 1970s and early 1980s Bigtraks does not seem to be capable of processing any In command.Big Trak IN and OUT Commands - Robot Room == Computer control == In 1981 Steve Ciarcia published in his BYTE column \\"Ciarcia's Circuit Cellar\\" an article on controlling Big Trak with a personal computer and radio interface, turning it into a home robot. Meanwhile, in the 2000s and 2010s, many people have hacked the Bigtrak by allowing it to be controlled with modern microcontrollers such as the Arduino, or even a single board Personal Computer such as the Raspberry Pi. The Bigtrak XTR is capable of being fitted with a communication module to wirelessly communicate with a computer. == Big Trak in psychological research == In the early 1980s, the psychology of science community led by the laboratory of David Klahr at Carnegie Mellon University adopted the Big Trak as a research vehicle for the study of Instructionless learning, Scientific discovery, View application, Cognitive development, and Dual Space Search.D Klahr, 2000, Exploring Science: The Cognition and Development of Discovery Processes, Cambridge , MA:MIT Press == See also == * Lego Mindstorms NXT * Omnibot * RoboSapien ‚Äì a remote-programmable humanoid robot * Roomba == References == == External == * Zeon Ltd's new Bigtrack * a BIGTRAK hobbyist Page * Original instruction manual (PDF) * Original operators manual (full colour navigable pdf) * Transport instruction manual (PDF) * Robot Room ‚Äì Inside the Bigtrak * Big Trak decals Category:1970s toys Category:1980s toys Category:1979 robots Category:Toy robots Category:Hobbyist robots Category:Six-wheeled robots Category:Robots of the United States ","title":"Big Trak"},{"id":"2560375","text":"Captain Pushpendra Kumar Garg (born 22 November 1963) is an Indian sportsperson in yachting.

The school was opened as a part of the British Government's attempts to train more doctors, which also saw Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Peninsula Medical School and University of East Anglia Medical School open their doors. ==History== The early history of medical education in Hull and York goes back to the three following institutions: Hull Medical School (1831), York Medical Society (1832) and the York Medical School (1834). Notable doctors associated with the York school included John Hughlings Jackson (in whose honour the modern medical school building at the University of York is named), Daniel Hack Tuke, Thomas Laycock (physiologist), James Atkinson (surgeon), and Sir Jonathan Hutchinson. It is thought that the York school closed in the 1860s. The founding of a medical school as part of the University of Hull was considered in the Report of the Royal Commission on Medical Education 1965‚Äì68 (Todd Report) (published 1968), but the idea was thought not to be viable until the Humber Bridge was completed, as this would enable students to travel to placements in South Lincolnshire. ==Teaching== Allam Medical Building, Hull York Medical School, University of Hull campus The medical school has 156 places for 2018 and receives around 1,200 applications each year.

For 2019 these rankings fell to 30th and 26th respectively. applicants are required to sit the UCAT admissions test. Students spend the two years in phase one at their academic bases (either Hull or York). Phase two consists of rotation around York, Hull, Scunthorpe, Grimsby and Scarborough. In the final year of the course (phase three), students essentially take on the role of a 'junior' pre- registration house officer and are also able to carry out an 'elective' period overseas. This is a common feature in most UK medical curricula. The school's first international students began their studies in September 2006.

It is based on the 1971 novel The Abominable Man by Maj Sj√∂wall and Per Wahl√∂√∂. The film stars Carl-Gustaf Lindstedt, Sven Wollter, Thomas Hellberg and H√•kan Serner. The plot follows a police officer Martin Beck and his colleagues trying to solve the murder of a senior policeman, known for his brutality against others. While the investigation is ongoing, a well-armed man climbs up on a roof in Stockholm. Widerberg was inspired by the 1971 American film The French Connection, and Widerberg would make one more crime film in 1984: The Man from Majorca. The film won two Guldbagge Awards in 1977, for Best Film and Best Actor (H√•kan Serner). ==Plot== A policeman (Nyman) who is a patient at a hospital in Stockholm is brutally murdered, stabbed repeatedly with a bayonet. The investigation that follows is led by Martin Beck and Einar R√∂nn. It turns out that the murdered man had sadistic tendencies and was known among his colleagues for abusing his police privileges and brutalizing civilians. Although his colleagues had been aware of his behaviour, the police force's esprit de corps had suppressed complaints about him and prevented any reprisals. The investigation proceeds, and finally Beck and his team find a trail that leads to the murderer, who turns out to be an ex-policeman named Eriksson. Eriksson's wife Marja had diabetes, and one day, in need of insulin, she had fallen into a coma. She was mistaken by the police as a drunk and put in a jail cell, under the orders of Nyman, where she died. Eriksson blamed the police force for the death of his wife. Now, some years later, he has become a social misfit and the authorities are in the process of removing his daughter Malin from his custody. As Beck and his team close in on Eriksson he climbs up on the roof of the apartment building where he lives in central Stockholm, bringing with him both an automatic rifle and a sharpshooter's rifle. He starts to fire at any policeman and police vehicle he can spot, picking off several policemen. When the police commissioner decides to bring in the anti-terrorist units, including two police helicopters, Eriksson shoots up one of the helicopters such that it crashes on a crowded plaza near the building where he resides. Beck tries an individual initiative, climbing to the roof on a flimsy external ladder, but is shot in the chest, although he survives. Finally, two other members of Beck's team, along with another policeman and a civilian resident in the building, use explosives to gain access to the roof, and Eriksson is shot in the shoulder and arrested. ==Cast== *Carl-Gustaf Lindstedt as Martin Beck: Detective Inspector (Kriminalkommissarie) *Sven Wollter as Lennart Kollberg: Criminal police (Kriminalpolis) *Thomas Hellberg as Gunvald Larsson: Criminal police *H√•kan Serner as Einar R√∂nn: Criminal police *Ingvar Hirdwall as √Öke \\"The Man on the Roof\\" Eriksson *Bellan Roos as Mrs. Eriksson: Eriksson's mother *Gus Dahlstr√∂m as Mr. Eriksson: Eriksson's father *Harald Hamrell as Stefan Nyman: Stig Nyman's son *Birgitta Valberg as Mrs. Nyman *Carl-Axel Heiknert as Palmon Harald Hult: First police constable (F√∂rste polisassistent) *Torgny Anderberg as Stig √Öke Malm: Chief Superintendent (Polisintendent) *Folke Hjort as Fredrik Melander: Criminal police *Eva Remaeus as Mrs. Kollberg *Gunnel Wadner as Mrs. Beck ==Production== The actor Carl-Gustaf Lindstedt was picked for the part as the policeman Beck after Wideberg had seen him with a serious face in a talk show not knowing he was on air.

In 1878, he campaigned on behalf of Cartwright.

He is best known as the lead singer of The Mission, and the guitarist with The Sisters of Mercy. == Biography == Hussey grew up in Bristol. He was influenced at a young age by Marc Bolan and his band T. Rex, and was thus inspired to become a guitarist. Brought up in the LDS Church, he rebelled against his parents' wishes that he serve as a missionary and moved to Liverpool in the late 1970s to join the scene around Eric's Club, a noted nightclub of the time. Hussey started to perform, most notably with Pauline Murray and The Invisible Girls, with whom he started songwriting. The first success for Hussey came when he joined Dead or Alive at the request of frontman Pete Burns. After Burns retreated to become more studio-based, Hussey decided to leave and was offered a position with The Sisters of Mercy, concentrating on 12-string and 6-string guitars, contributing to arrangements and using his higher ranged voice for backing vocals which contrasted with Andrew Eldritch's melancholic baritone. When the Sisters of Mercy disbanded, Hussey and bassist Craig Adams set up The Mission, recruiting Mick Brown on drums and Simon Hinkler on guitars. He lived in Leeds for a while before moving to London towards the end of the 1980s. Hussey has produced and played on records by The Mission's Mercury Records labelmates All About Eve and in the late 1990s provided some remixes for Cleopatra Records. He also produced, remixed and appeared on some tracks for the US band Gossamer including the track \\"Run\\" for the first Unquiet Grave compilation by Cleopatra Records. He also produced and played on Brilliant Mistakes by the Greek band Flowers of Romance. Hussey has played live with both Gary Numan and The Cure. He is a Liverpool F.C. supporter and after his team's victory in the Champions League Final of 2005, he composed the song entitled \\"Draped in Red\\" featured on the album God is a Bullet.Draped in Red (downloadable link) In 2019 Hussey released his autobiography \\"Salad Daze\\". Hussey currently lives in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, married to a Brazilian actress, Cinthya, and has two children from previous relationships. ==Solo career== Since 2002, Hussey has regularly played solo shows that features Mission material, new songs and covers. After he wound up The Mission for the second time in early 2009, he released his first solo album called Bare in October of that year on the Sony Music label. (In Germany, there are four bonus tracks.) In May 2009, Hussey announced on The Mission's website and in an interview on BBC 6 Music that he and Julianne Regan were working together on an album of cover songs, reinterpretations of old material and new songs, and invited fans to suggest songs for the duo to cover. This album was eventually released in the autumn of 2011 as Curios under the name Hussey-Regan on Cherry Red Records. In 2014, he released his second solo album, Songs of Candlelight & Razorblades, of largely acoustic songs. In August 2020 Hussey re-recorded \\"Tower of Strength\\" as ReMission International TOS 2020, in support of key workers dealing with Covid-19 globally. All proceeds went to charities personally chosen by each contributor to TOS2020. On this project Wayne collaborated with friends and musicians including : Michael Ciravolo, Andy Rourke, Billy Duffy, Budgie, Evi Vine, Gary Numan, James Alexander Graham (from The Twilight Sad), Jay Aston, Julianne Regan, Kevin Haskins, Kirk Brandon, Lol Tolhurst, Martin Gore, Michael Aston, Midge Ure, Miles Hunt, Rachel Goswell, Richard Fortus, Robin Finck, Tim Palmer, Trentem√∏ller. == Equipment == When playing live solo, Hussey uses a Martin D42. When playing live with the band, Hussey currently uses a Schecter Corsair 12-string made especially for him for The Mission's 25th anniversary shows in late 2011; he has previously used a Gretsch White Falcon. In the studio, he uses both a Fender Telecaster and Fender Starcaster. His signature 12-string setup currently has a Fender Electric, a Vox Teardrop, an Ovation Acoustic, and a Taylor acoustic. During his time with the Sisters, he used an Aria Pro II. ==Discography== ===Dead or Alive=== *It's Been Hours Now EP (1982) *The stranger/Some of that (1982) *Sophisticated Boom Boom (1984) ===The Sisters of Mercy=== *Body and Soul (1984) *Walk Away (1984) *No Time To Cry (1985) *First and Last and Always (1985) ===The Mission=== *God's Own Medicine (1986) *The First Chapter (1987) *Children (1988) *Carved in Sand (February 1990) *Grains of Sand (November 1990) *Masque (1992) *Neverland (1995) *Blue (1996) *Aura (2001) *God is a Bullet (2007) *Dum Dum Bullet (2011) * The Brightest Light (2013) * Another Fall from Grace (2016) ===Solo=== *Bare (2009) *Songs of Candlelight and Razorblades (2014) ===Stisch featuring Wayne Hussey=== * Hit Repeat (single) (2008) ===Wayne Hussey and Julianne Regan=== * Curios (2011) ===Wayne Hussey and James Bacon=== *As Irm√£s Siamesas () (2018) ===Wayne Hussey and The Divine=== * Live At The Yellow Arch (2020) ==References== == External links == *Wayne Hussey on Myspace Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:People from Bristol Category:Former Latter Day Saints Category:English male guitarists Category:English rock guitarists Category:English male singers Category:English songwriters Category:Gothic rock musicians Category:Dead or Alive (band) members Category:The Sisters of Mercy members Category:The Mission (band) members Category:English new wave musicians Category:20th- century English musicians ","title":"Wayne Hussey"},{"id":"2560422","text":"In Ptolemy's Geography (book 2, chapter 10), the Luna forest (Latin Luna silva, Greek Louna hule) is a geographical feature whose location is not known now with any certainty.

Examples in English include the sentences \\"There is a God\\" and \\"There are boys in the yard\\". The use of such clauses can be considered analogous to existential quantification in predicate logic (often expressed with the phrase \\"There exist(s)...\\"). Different languages have different ways of forming and using existential clauses. For details about English, see English grammar: There as pronoun. ==Formation== Frequency of habere in Serbo- Croatian Many languages form existential clauses without any particular marker, simply using forms of the normal copula verb (the equivalent of English be), the subject being the noun (phrase) referring to the thing whose existence is asserted. For example, in Finnish, the sentence , meaning \\"There are boys in the yard\\", is literally \\"On the yard is boys\\". Some languages have a different verb for this purpose, e.g. Swedish , as in , which is literally \\"It is found boys on the yard\\". On the other hand, some languages do not require a copula at all, and sentences analogous to \\"In the yard boys\\" are used. Some languages use the verb have, e.g. Serbo-Croatian, as in , which is literally \\"In the yard has boys\\". Summary. [see Chapter 7: \\"Die Verben imati 'haben' und biti 'sein' in Lokal-Existentials√§tzen\\", pp. 187‚Äì229] Some languages form the negative of existential clauses in an irregular way; for example, in Russian, yest (\\"there is/are\\") is used in affirmative existential clauses (in the present tense), whereas the negative equivalent is nyet (\\"there is/are not\\"), used with the logical subject in the genitive case. In English, existential clauses usually use the dummy subject construction (also known as expletive) with there, as in \\"There are boys in the yard\\", although there is sometimes omitted when the sentence begins with another adverbial (usually designating a place), as in \\"In my room (there) is a large box.\\" Other languages with constructions similar to the English dummy subject include French (see ) and German (which uses , or , literally \\"it is\\", \\"it are\\", \\"it gives\\"). ==Uses== ===Indicating existence or presence=== The principal meaning of existential clauses is to refer to the existence of something, or the presence of something in a particular place or time. For example, \\"There is a God\\" asserts the existence of a God, while \\"There is a pen on the desk\\" asserts the presence or existence of a pen in a particular place. Existential clauses can be modified like other clauses in terms of tense, negation, question formation, modality (grammar), finiteness, etc. For example, one can say \\"There was a God\\", \\"There is not a God\\" (\\"There is no God\\"), \\"Is there a God?\\", \\"There might be a God\\", \\"He was anxious for there to be a God\\", etc. === In Pingelapese Language === Existential sentence structure is one of four structures associated within the Pingelapese language of Micronesia. This form heavily uses a post-verbal subject order. These sentences explain that something either does or does not exist. Only a few verbs are attached to existential sentence structure in Pingelapese. These verbs are minae- to exist, soh- to not exist, dir- to exist in large numbers, and daeri- to be finished. These four verbs all have a post verbal subject in common. Most of the time these verbs are used when introducing new characters to a story. If a character is already known the verb would be used in the preverbal position. ===Indicating possession=== In some languages, linguistic possession (in a broad sense) is indicated by existential clauses, rather than by a verb such as have. For example, in Russian, \\"I have a friend\\" can be expressed by the sentence —É –º–µ–Ω—è –µ—Å—Ç—å –¥—Ä—É–≥ u menya yest' drug, literally \\"at me there is a friend\\". Russian has a verb –∏–º–µ—Ç—å imet' meaning \\"have\\", but it is less commonly used than the preceding method for expressing possession. Other examples include Irish \\"There is hunger on me\\" (for \\"I have hunger\\", i.e. \\"I am hungry\\"), Hungarian \\"(There) is a fish-my\\" (for \\"I have a fish\\") and Turkish \\"two notebook-my (there) is\\" (for \\"I have two notebooks\\"). As an example, consider the following sentence in Hebrew: * y√©sh l-i ha-s√©fer ha-z√® * (EXISTENTIAL.COPULA) (DATIVE-1st.person.singular) (DEFINITE-book) (DEFINITE- masculine.singular.PROXIMAL.DEMONSTRATIVE) * There is for me the book the this * \\"I have this book\\" According to linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann, the Hebrew existential construction employed to mark possession was reinterpreted in \\"Israeli\\" (his term for \\"Modern Hebrew\\") to fit in with the \\"habere\\" (to have) construction, requiring the direct object, which is predominant in Yiddish and other European languages such as English (in \\"I have this book\\", \\"this book\\" is the direct object of \\"have\\"). Consider the following Israeli sentence: * y√©sh l-i et ha-s√©fer ha-z√® * (EXISTENTIAL.COPULA) (DATIVE-1st.person.singular) (ACCUSATIVE.MARKER) (DEFINITE-book) (DEFINITE- masculine.singular.PROXIMAL.DEMONSTRATIVE) *There is for me ACCUSATIVE the book the this *\\"I have this book\\" Zuckermann argues that Israeli is a \\"habere language\\" (cf. Latin \\"to have\\", taking the direct object), in stark contrast to Hebrew. As demonstrated by the accusative marker et, the noun phrase ha- s√©fer ha-z√® is the direct object in this sentence. Yiddish has two options to indicate possession. The most common form is ikh hob, literally \\"I have\\", which requires a direct object (accusative). However, there is also a form which is more similar to old Hebrew: bay mir iz do, literally \\"By me is there\\", followed by the subject (nominative). According to Zuckermann, the latter form, available in the feature pool together with the erstwhile non- habere Hebrew structure y√©sh l-i + Subject (there is for me, followed by the nominative), did not prevail because ikh hob is more productive in Yiddish and other European habere languages that contributed to the emergence of \\"Israeli\\".See pp. 51‚Äì52 in Zuckermann, Ghil'ad, Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns. In Journal of Language Contact, Varia 2 (2009), pp. 40‚Äì67. A similar process occurred in Maltese: \\"in the possessive construction, subject properties have been transferred diachronically from the possessed noun phrase to the possessor, while the possessor has all the subject properties except the form of the verb agreement that it triggers.\\"See pp. 212‚Äì218 in Bernard, Comrie, Language Universals and Linguistic Typology.

It is situated on the East Lancashire Line and is managed by Northern. ==Description== Its railway station, in common with Lostock Hall, was once much larger and used by many more trains than today. Opened in 1846 by the Blackburn & Preston Railway, it became a junction four years later when the B&PR;'s successor the East Lancashire Railway opened a direct route to Preston that avoided the need to use the North Union Railway between Farington and Preston (and thus pay hefty tolls to the NUR company). The Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway had in the meantime arrived at Lostock Hall in 1849, putting the village on the main line from Blackburn to Liverpool. The station in 1963 These newer lines all fell victim to BR economies in the aftermath of the Beeching Axe - the direct line to Preston closing to all traffic in April 1972 (services henceforth reverted to using the original 1846 line through Lostock Hall then the 1908-built Farington Curve to reach the WCML) and the Blackburn to Liverpool trains ending on 6 October 1969. The line was resignalled in 1973 and is now controlled by the power box at Preston, although the distinctive signal box still remains to supervise three level crossings (one here locally and two further east by CCTV). On the westbound platform, the station building built in 1846 survives but is no longer used as part of the station. The building has been disused recently but is now being converted into a drop-in centre for pensioners. The waiting room on the eastbound platform and the old pedestrian subway linking the two platforms have both been removed. Bamber Bridge may not strictly be a \\"one-street village\\", but each train to pass through stops traffic; the level crossing cuts across the main road. Only Northern trains en route to and from Preston use Bamber Bridge. It has two platforms, but is unstaffed (so tickets must be purchased from the ticket machine or on the train when travelling from here). Passenger information screens are in operation at the station, along with a long-line P.A system to provide train running information. As of January 2018, along with other Stations on this line, a new touch screen Ticket Machine was added to the Station. ==Services== Monday to Saturdays, there is an hourly service from Bamber Bridge towards Preston westbound and Blackburn, Burnley and Colne, eastbound. There is also an hourly service in each direction on Sundays, with westbound trains running to . In addition to the basic service, two additional calls are provided by services on the York & Leeds to Blackpool North line during the morning peak period to give additional journey opportunities to Preston for commuters & shoppers. There is also one evening peak additional train from Preston to Blackburn that stops here. ==References== * ==External links== Category:Railway stations in South Ribble Category:Former Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1846 Category:Northern franchise railway stations Category:1846 establishments in England ","title":"Bamber Bridge railway station"},{"id":"2560450","text":"Kathleen Hutchison is a British television producer, whose credits include Playing the Field, Holby City (of which she was the Series Producer, then Executive Producer for many years) and Casualty @ Holby City. ==EastEnders== On 21 September 2004, Hutchison was appointed Executive Producer of the BBC television soap opera EastEnders, after Executive Producer, Louise Berridge, resigned following prolonged critical and public criticism of the show.

He served on the town council for Elora and was reeve from 1859 to 1864 and from 1867 to 1868. He commanded a local militia unit during the Fenian raids, becoming lieutenant-colonel. In 1874, he helped introduce legislation that established the secret ballot for elections in the province. He became clerk of the legislature in January 1892 and served until 1907.

Best known as a centre half forward, he played in most outfield positions during his career. In 2009 he was named in the Sunday Tribunes list of the \\"125 Most Influential People In GAA History\\". Born in Tuam, County Galway, Purcell was educated at Tuam Christian Brothers School and St. Jarlath's College. He played in the St Jarlath's College side that won the Hogan Cup in 1947, beating St Patrick's Grammar School, Armagh in the final at Croke Park in Dublin. His nickname \\"The Master\\" originated when he taught at Strawberry Hill National School in Dunmore. His footballing career spanned three decades, from the 1940s to the 1960s. Purcell formed a successful on- field partnership with Frank Stockwell at Galway, culminating in the team winning their fourth All-Ireland championship in 1956 and leading to their nickname as the \\"Terrible Twins\\". Further successes in which Purcell was involved include winning the League title in 1957, three Railway Cups, one of which he captained, the 1950 Sigerson Cup, appearances with the Combined Universities side and ten county titles with the Tuam Stars, including seven in a row from 1954 to 1960. His involvement in the GAA continued long after his playing days as he served in a number of positions as team mentor and administrator in Galway. In 1984, the GAA's centenary year, he was named on the GAA's Football Team of the Century and the organisation's Gaelic football Team of the Millennium in 1999. In 1984 the Sunday Independent invited readers to vote for their Team of the Century. Purcell won more votes than any other player. In 1991 he was inducted into the All-Stars All-Time Hall of Fame. In 2003, he was named on the St. Jarlath's All Stars team.

The town of Barra de Navidad (Christmas Sandbar) with a population of 7000+ is a small farming and fishing community located on the east end of the Bah√≠a de Navidad, 60 km north of Manzanillo. In recent years, the Jalisco state government has promoted Barra as a tourist attraction of the Costalegre. The beachfront fronting the sandbar arks toward San Patricio, Jalisco 4.5 kilometers to the west. The history of \\"modern\\" Barra de Navidad dates back to the mid-16th century when the Spanish used it for ship building, repairs and a jumping off point to the Philippines. A monument has been erected as a memory to these journeys at the end of the jetty. Ruy L√≥pez de Villalobos (1500‚Äì1544) fleet of six galleon ships, the Santiago, Jorge, San Antonio, San Cristobal, San Martin, and San Juan, left Barra de Navidad, Jalisco, Mexico with 370 to 400 men on November 1, 1542. On the early morning of November 21, 1564, armed with five ships and 500 soldiers, Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi and his sail-captain Andr√©s de Urdaneta sailed from the port of Barra de Navidad, New Spain, in what is now Jalisco state, Mexico. The large lagoon behind Barra de Navidad is criss-crossed by small fishing boats gathering scallops and transporting visitors and locals from Barra to Isla Navidad and the Grand Bay Hotel, recently voted the Number One hotel/resort in Mexico by the Travel Channel. These boats (panga taxies) also carry passengers to and from the small Colima community of Colimilla where restaurants line the shore. In 2012 many of Barra de Navidad's seaside businesses were left in ruins after Hurricane Jova. The businesses recovered despite the damage and high tide.

He also played one Test match for England in 1948. Cricket writer, Colin Bateman stated, \\"Coxon's Test career was abrupt ‚Äì much like the man himself. An ever-willing seam bowler, he was one of several tried in the search for a partner for Alec Bedser, but he did himself no favours with a brusqueness which could upset\\". ==Life and career== Coxon was born in Huddersfield, Yorkshire. World War II delayed Coxon's first-class debut for Yorkshire to 1945, when he was 29. Coxon was an aggressive fast- medium bowler who played for England once ‚Äì against Australia in 1948 at Lord's. There were rumours of an argument with Denis Compton, and his prickly nature was later attested to by Brian Close. Coxon retired after the 1950 season, allegedly in umbrage at his non-selection for the forthcoming Ashes tour, and moved to play Minor counties cricket with Durham. He played 29 times for that county between 1951 and 1954, taking 127 wickets and scoring 1,047 runs with two centuries. His highest score was 102 not out against Yorkshire Second XI at Scarborough in 1952. Also in 1952, he achieved his best bowling figures for Durham; nine for 28 and six for 58 against Staffordshire. He also played professionally with Sunderland, where he took 753 wickets at 8.73 runs apiece, and scored 3,764 runs at an average of 34.21. In 1959, he moved to South Shields where he took 443 wickets for 10.28 and scored 2,663 runs at 23.63. He had shorter spells with both Wearmouth and Bolden, before finally retiring from the sport some distance past his 50th birthday, although still coaching at Whitburn Cricket Club in 1979. He also played soccer for Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C. in wartime matches. He kept up a keen interest in club cricket until the end. Clement Seymour \\"Sir Coxsone\\" Dodd CD (26 January 1932 ‚Äì 4 May 2004) was named after the cricketer : Coxsone Dodd was a Jamaican record producer who was influential in the development of ska, dub and reggae in the 1950s, 1960s and beyond.

It includes the capital city of Charleston and the rapidly growing residential communities of West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle and Potomac Highlands regions connected by a narrow strip of nearly unpopulated counties. It is wide and long. The district is currently represented by Alex Mooney, a Republican. West Virginia had four Congressional seats from 1973 to 1993. Previously, much of the western portion of the current 2nd District had been in the 3rd District, based in Charleston. The eastern portion of the district had been in the 2nd District, which had been anchored in Martinsburg and Morgantown for all but a few years since statehood. For all but two years from 1949 to 1993, it was held by the Democratic Staggers family--Harley O. Staggers from 1949 to 1981 and Harley \\"Buckey\\" Staggers, Jr. from 1983 to 1993. When West Virginia lost a seat following the 1990 Census, the state legislature divided Staggers's district among the remaining three districts. Much of Staggers's old territory was merged with the 3rd District, represented by five-term Democrat Bob Wise and renumbered the 2nd. However, Staggers's home in Mineral County wound up in the 1st District, where he was routed in the Democratic primary by Alan Mollohan. Wise represented the new district until 2000, when he ran for and won West Virginia's governorship. Following the 2010 Census, Mason County was transferred to the 3rd District, which changed the character of the district only slightly. This change took effect for the 2012 election.http://www.legis.state.wv.us/legisdocs/2011/1x/maps/senate/Enr%20SB1008%20Map.pdf The district is very expensive to campaign in, because six counties on the district's eastern fringe are in the very expensive Washington, D.C. television market. The two main parts, Charleston and the Eastern Panhandle, have very little in common and very little interaction. The district is slightly more conservative and prosperous than the rest of West Virginia, though like the state's other districts, it tends to give congressmen long tenures in Washington. The 2000 election that resulted in Capito's victory marked the first open-seat race in the district since 1945. The old 2nd District had only five congressmen from 1933 until its elimination in 1993. George W. Bush carried the district twice in 2000 with 54% of the vote and in 2004 with 57% of the vote. John McCain also won the district in 2008 with 54.63% of the vote while Barack Obama received 43.77%. The district contains much of the territory that was represented by longtime Senator Robert Byrd when he served in the House from 1953 to 1959. ==History== The Second District as originally formed in 1863 included Taylor, Marion, Monongalia, Preston, Tucker, Barbour, Upshur, Webster, Pocahontas, Randolph, Pendleton, Hardy, Hampshire, Berkeley, and Morgan counties (Jefferson county's status in the state was still in dispute, and Grant and Mineral counties were still part of other counties, but the modern territory of all was also included). It was essentially the successor of Virginia's 10th congressional district. The district was unchanged for 1882. In 1902, the district was changed to Monongalia, Preston, Tucker, Taylor, Barbour, Tucker, Randolph, Pendleton, Grant, Hardy, Mineral, Hampshire, Morgan, Berkeley, and Jefferson counties. The district was unchanged for 1916. Taylor was removed for 1934. The district was again unchanged for 1954. In 1962 Upshur, Webster, Pocahontas, and Greenbrier counties were added. In 1972, Lewis, Monroe, Summers, and Fayette were added. In 1982, Barbour was added. 1992 first saw the district as currently constituted, consisting of Berkeley, Braxton, Calhoun, Clay, Glimer, Hampshire, Hardy, Jackson, Jefferson, Kanawha, Lewis, Mason, Morgan, Nicholas, Pendleton, Putnam, Randolph, Roane, Upshur, and Wirt counties. In 2002, Gilmer and Nicholas were removed and for the election cycle beginning in 2012, Mason was removed.West Virginia Blue Book (pp 535, 2012 edition) == Recent presidential elections == { class= - ! colspan=\\"3\\"  Election results from presidential races - eee; text-align:center;\\" Year Office Results - 2000  President  align=\\"right\\" Bush 54 - 44% - 2004  President  align=\\"right\\" Bush 57 - 42% - 2008  President  align=\\"right\\" McCain 55 - 44% - 2012  President  align=\\"right\\" Romney 60 - 38% - 2016  President  align=\\"right\\" Trump 66 - 29% } == List of members representing the district == { class= style=\\"text- align:center\\" !

It may be awarded to civilians as well as military personnel, sometimes posthumously. It is third in order of precedence of peacetime gallantry awards and comes after the Ashoka Chakra and the Kirti Chakra. It precedes the Sena Medal. ==History== Established as the \\"Ashoka Chakra, Class III\\" by the President of India, 4 January 1952 (with effect from 15 August 1947). The statutes were revised and the decoration renamed on 27 January 1967. Before 1967, the award was known as the Ashoka Chakra, Class III. Subsequent awards of the Shaurya Chakra are recognized by a bar to the medal ribbon (to date five have been awarded). It is possible for a recipient to be awarded the Ashoka Chakra or Kirti Chakra in addition for separate acts of gallantry. Since July 1999, it also being given to Civilians of either gender in all walks of life, other than members of Police Forces and of recognized Fire Services. Indian Army From 1 February 1999, the central government set a monthly stipend of Rs. 750 for recipients of the award. Jammu and Kashmir awards a cash award of Rs. 700 (ca. 1960) for recipients of the Shaurya Chakra. ==Design== Medal: Circular bronze, 1-3/8 inches in diameter. In the centre, the Ashoka Chakra, surrounded by a lotus wreath and with an ornate edge. Suspended by a straight bar suspender. The medal is named on the edge. Reverse: For pre-1967 awards, the medal is blank in the centre, with \\"Ashoka Chakra\\" in Hindi along the upper edge on the medal and the same name in English along the lower rim, \\"ASHOKA CHAKRA\\". On either side is a lotus design. The centre is blank, perhaps with the intent that details of the award be engraved there. There is no indication of the class on the pre-1967 awards. For the post-1967 awards, the, names are changed to \\"Shauryua Chakra\\" in Hindi above and \\"SHAURYA CHAKRA\\" below. Ribbon: Green colour ribbon divided into four equal parts by three orange vertical lines. Bar: If a recipient of the Chakra shall again perform such an act of gallantry as would have made him or her eligible to receive the Chakra, such further act of gallantry shall be recognised by a Bar to be attached to the riband by which the Chakra is suspended and, for every subsequent act of gallantry, an additional Bar shall be added and such Bar or Bars may also be awarded posthumously. For every such Bar, a replica of the Chakra in miniature shall be added to the riband when worn alone. ==Eligibility== It is the peacetime equivalent of the Vir Chakra. It is generally awarded for Counter-Insurgency operations and actions against the enemy during peace-time. Following categories of persons are eligible for the Shaurya Chakra: * Officers and men and women of all ranks of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, of any of the Reserve Forces, of the Territorial Army, Militia and of any other lawfully constituted forces. * Nursing officers of military nursing service . * Civilian citizens of either sex in all walks of life and members of Police Forces including Central Para-Military Forces and Railway Protection Force. ==References== ==External links== * Shaurya Chakra at Indian Army website * List of Shaurya Chakra Awardees * Shaurya Chakra Recipients Category:Military awards and decorations of India Category:Awards established in 1952 Category:1952 establishments in India ","title":"Shaurya Chakra"},{"id":"2560497","text":"Micheal Douglas Williams (born July 23, 1966) is a retired American professional basketball player at the point guard position in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He holds the NBA record for most consecutive free throws made, with 97. Out of Baylor University, Williams was selected with the 48th overall pick in the 1988 NBA draft by the Detroit Pistons with whom he played 49 games in his rookie season, averaging 2.4 points and 1.4 assists per game. The Pistons won the NBA championship in his rookie year. Williams was traded by Detroit to the Phoenix Suns on draft day of 1989, along with the Pistons' first-round draft pick (27th overall) of the 1989 NBA draft, Kenny Battle, in exchange for the Suns' first-round draft choice (24th overall pick), Anthony Cook. That season was spent split between the Phoenix Suns and the Charlotte Hornets averaging 5.6 points and 2.9 assists per game, before being acquired by the Indiana Pacers in 1990. He thrived during his two seasons in Indiana, averaging 13.2 points, 6.5 assists and shooting 87.5% from the free-throw line. Prior to the 1992‚Äì93 season, he was traded along with Chuck Person to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Sam Mitchell and Pooh Richardson. He continued his solid play in Minnesota for the following two seasons but, due to various injuries, in his final four years with the Wolves he participated in just 35 games (including missing the entire 1996‚Äì97 season). On January 21, 1999 Minnesota traded him, along with ≈Ωeljko Rebraƒça, to the Toronto Raptors in a three-team deal. By then his career was on the decline, and he only played two games for the Raptors before retiring that year.

Retrieved 19 February 2014 In the process, Blood and Fire influenced the overall aesthetic of other labels issuing archival Jamaican recordings in the 1990s and beyond. Initial releases drew on mid-1970s Bunny Lee produced material but the label subsequently reissued material produced by Yabby You and Glen Brown along with the Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry produced Congos set Heart of the Congos and a three-CD Big Youth set, Natty Universal Dread. Despite the reissue objective, the label released two one-riddim albums. The first was Tree of Satta (2003) which utilised the original \\"Satta Massagana\\" riddim featuring a mixture of new and vintage voicings over the riddim along with the original version of the song by The Abyssinians. The second, Fisherman Style (2006), utilised The Congos' \\"Fisherman\\" riddim and featured new material from a variety of singers including Horace Andy, U Roy, Big Youth, Luciano, Tony Tuff and Dillinger. The label also had a sound system which has featured original Jamaican artists such as Dilinger, Trinity, Ranking Joe, U Brown, Horace Andy, Dennis Alcapone, U Roy, Spikey Tee, Country Culture, Raggamonica along with Steve Barrow and Dom Sotgiu. In July 2006 the sound went to Japan with U Roy on a three date sell out tour. In 2007, news leaked out via the company's popular message board that Blood and Fire had stopped trading as an active company. The loss of their American and French distributors due to bankruptcy as well as some unfortunate management decisions, combined with an industry-wide decline in sales, were to blame. Although the company declined to make any official announcement, it was effectively out of business.

His first five years as a producer were largely focused on developing the Swedish indie band The Cardigans, for whom Johansson has produced five of their six albums to date, beginning with the 1994 debut Emmerdale, excluding their fifth studio album Long Gone Before Daylight due to artistic differences. As someone as new to the studio as the band these sessions were an equally valuable learning experience for both parties.

It is composed of a benzene ring fused with a cyclopentene ring. This aromatic liquid is colorless although samples often are pale yellow. The principal industrial use of indene is in the production of indene/coumarone thermoplastic resins. Substituted indenes and their closely related indane derivatives are important structural motifs found in many natural products and biologically active molecules, such as sulindac. ==Isolation== Indene occurs naturally in coal-tar fractions boiling around 175‚Äì185 ¬∞C.

The other is the slightly larger southern ground hornbill; the two are the largest species of hornbills found in Africa. ==Taxonomy== The Abyssinian ground hornbill was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Buceros abyssinicus in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The type locality is Ethiopia. The Abyssinian ground hornbill is now placed in the genus Bucorvus that was introduced, originally as a subgenus, by the French naturalist Ren√© Lesson in 1830. The species is monotypic. The generic name is derived from the name of the genus Buceros introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for the Asian hornbills where corvus is the Latin word for a \\"raven\\". ==Description== Abyssinian ground hornbill is a large, terrestrial hornbill with black body feathers and white primary feathers which are visible in flight. The adult male has a patch of bare blue skin around the eye and an inflatable patch of bare skin on the neck and throat which is red, apart from the upper throat which is blue. The bill is long and black except for a reddish patch at the base of the mandible. On top of the bill there is a short open-ended black casque. The female is similar but smaller with any bare skin being wholly dark blue. Juvenile birds are dark sooty-brown with a smaller bill, with an incipient casque. As the juvenile matures, which usually takes 3 years, it gradually develops the plumage, bare skin colour and casque of the adults. The total length is . The Abyssinian ground hornbill has long feathers that look like eyelashes that surround its eyes. These protect the eyes from injury. It reportedly averages around tall, around and weighs approximately . Per Stevenson and Fanshawe, the Abyssinian is a larger species on average than the southern ground hornbill, at , but published weights and standard measurements contrarily indicate the southern species is indeed slightly larger.Field Guide to the Birds of East Africa: Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi by Stevenson & Fanshawe. Elsevier Science (2001), ===Voice=== A deep booming uh-uh, uh-uh-uh which is far carrying and is normally made at dawn from either a perch or from the ground. The male and female sing in duets. ==Distribution and habitat== left The Abyssinian ground hornbill is found in Northern sub-Saharan Africa from southern Mauritania, Senegal and Guinea east to Eritrea, Ethiopia, north western Somalia, north western Kenya and Uganda. It is found in open habitats such as savanna, sub-desert scrub, and rocky areas, preferring short vegetation which enables its visual foraging technique. The areas inhabited by this species are usually drier areas than the preferred habitat of the Southern ground hornbill. It will tolerate disturbed areas but does require large trees to be used as nest sites. The Abyssinian ground hornbill has escaped or been deliberately released in to Florida, USA, but there is no evidence that the population is breeding and may only persist due to continuing releases or escapes. ==Behaviour== The Abyssinian ground hornbill lives in open grassland, in pairs or small family parties. They patrol their territory by walking and are reluctant fliers, usually only taking to the air when alarmed. In captivity, they can live 35‚Äì40 years. Diet in the wild consists of a wide variety of small vertebrates and invertebrates, including tortoises, lizards, snakes, birds, spiders, beetles, and caterpillars; they also take carrion, some fruits, seeds, and groundnuts. Groups of ground hornbills have territories of . They are diurnal. ===Breeding=== The breeding season of the Abyssinian ground hornbill varies across its range: the West African populations breed in June through to August, Nigerian and Ugandan populations breed in January, and Kenyan birds breed as late as November. They prefer to nest in large trees, with baobabs and palm stumps being preferred; the nest is constructed in a cavity. They have also been recorded nesting in other types of cavities including holes in rocks and man-made cavities such as bee-hive logs or baskets. In the ground hornbills the females are partially sealed in using a mixture of mud and vegetation. In other hornbills the nesting female moult their all flight feathers at once but this is not the case in the ground hornbills. The male prepares the nest by lining the cavity with dry leaves before the female enters and lays a clutch of one or two eggs over around five days. She starts to incubate as soon as the first egg is laid so that the chick which hatches first has a head start in development over its sibling. Incubation of each egg takes between 37 and 41 days, during which time there is no effort to keep the cavity clean and the male is responsible for providing food to the incubating female. The weight of the newly hatched chick is around and the first-hatched grows rapidly at the expense of the second, which will normally die of starvation before it is four days old by which time its sibling can weigh as much as . When the surviving chick is 21 to 33 days old the mother leaves the nest and starts to help in food provision, then after 80 to 90 days the chick leaves the nest. Abyssinian ground hornbills invest a lot in their offspring and the fledged juveniles will remain with their parents for up to three years. They have a slow breeding rate and an average of one chick is raised to adulthood every 9 years so the adults' investment in each young bird raised is exceptionally high. ===Feeding=== Abyssinian ground hornbills are opportunist feeders, following ungulate herds and forest fires so that they can prey on small animals disturbed by the larger animals or flames. An individual hornbill can walk up to in a day, pouncing on and eating animals they come across. They have also been recorded digging for arthropods in the soil and attacking bee hives for honeycomb; they very rarely consume any plant matter. The strong bill is used to capture and overcome the prey before it is eaten. ==Predators, parasites and diseases== Abyssinian ground hornbills are preyed on by large carnivores, such as leopards. Human predation for food occurs in some countries, including northern Cameroon and Burkina Faso. The nests may be preyed upon by smaller terrestrial predators. The Abyssinian ground hornbill is a known host for the bird lice Bucorvellus docophorus, Bucerophagus productus and Bucerophagus africanus; it is also a host for the nematode Histiocephalus bucorvi and the tapeworms Chapmania unilateralis, Idiogenes bucorvi, Ophryocotyloides pinguis, and Paruterina daouensis. An individual held in captivity but which had been caught in the wild died from an infection of the bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila, a common pathogen in fish but not previously recorded in wild Abyssinian ground hornbills. In North America captive Abyssinian ground hornbills have also been known to die because of West Nile virus. ==Cultural importance== Abyssinian ground hornbills are not a normal quarry for commercial hunters, although they are not uncommon in captivity in zoos. In some areas the species has cultural significance and hunters may tie the severed head and neck of these birds around their necks in the belief that it helps them stalk their wild ungulate quarry. In some villages the call is often imitated and there are even entire songs based on the male and female duets of Abyssinian ground hornbills. ==Status and conservation== The Abyssinian ground hornbill is subject to the loss and degradation of its habitat and it is a quarry of hunters, in a smiliar way to its congener, the Southern ground hornbill, and, as a result, it is thought that the population may have started a rapid decline. As a result of this perceived decline the IUCN give its status as Vulnerable.

Although many phones play music as ringtones, true \\"music phones\\" generally allow users to stream music or download music files over the internet via a WiFi connection or 3G cell phone connection. Music phones are also able to import audio files from their PCs. The case of mobile music being stored within the memory of the mobile phone is the case similar to traditional business models in the music industry. It supports two variants: the user can either purchase the music for outright ownership or access entire libraries of music via a subscription model. In this case the music files are available as long as the subscription is active. ==Truetones== While ringtones do not include artists voices, truetones, chaku-uta and chaku- uta full are recordings of artists' interpretation of music. Distributing them usually requires the agreement of record labels and other owners of artists' rights. ==History== The integration of music in a cellphone was not easy. On one hand, technology for portable music had been developed since the 1980s with Sony driving the area with its portable walkman. On the other, cellphone technology had focused on the area of imaging, leveraging the user interest in taking pictures and the operator's need to drive data revenues through the use of its network. The success of ringtones in driving data revenues had placed operators on guard for interactive applications that could drive revenues. Nevertheless, slow data speeds in the GSM and CDMA areas which had 1 and 2G technology, prevented the economic download of music data through networks in comparison with media sites to a computer. So operators, which tended to subsidize phones with data capabilities focused more on ringtone, SMS, and picture phones than on music ready phones, and this prevented many manufacturers to develop those phones because their primary customer is the operator and not the user. Work on compression algorithms for music was extensive with AMR trying to push the envelope, but the revolution of Napster proliferated the world with the MP3 format and manufacturers began to take notice. Another issue was the development of DRM capabilities which helped prevent music piracy and gave mobile music more of a legal status. At that time, Apple was revolutionizing the world with the introduction of the new iPods and its iTunes Store. The first report on a business plan and need for the successful integration of Music Phones was written in 2004 by Strategy Analytics - \\"Music phones are key for 3G\\", a cellular consulting firm in Massachusetts. The report boosted the need for phone manufacturers like Nokia and Motorola to join the bandwagon and explore several music options including the development of a music store strategy by Nokia and the integration of iTunes into a phone by Motorola with its Rocker. Sony, Samsung, and LG were too busy focusing on increasing pixelation and stability within CDDMA camera modules. Sony tried to leverage the Cybershot technology in a multimedia strategy, but it was too slow of a change. While Samsung was driving the high tier segment improving display capability. Nokia worked hard to drive DRM technology to be included into its OVI music store and introduced a new music phone line called Xpress music banking on end user needs rather than on operator's wants because the line was expected to receive lower subsidies from operators than others. In this way, Nokia was banking on the Idea of the report that music could be used to drive customer acquisition at that time rather than data revenues for the time, as mentioned in the report from Strategy Analytics. The Rocker was a success driving new adherents into a highly competitive US market even though it still remained tied to a computer for music downloads. It could be said that it was the adoption of the Rocker by ATT as an acquisition strategy for the US market that prompted operators to purchase music capable phones and manufacturers to develop them. This success of ATT to drive acquisitions was copied by other operators such as Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile, which also drove the introduction of music into the cellphones. Two years after the Rocker, Apple introduced its iPhone and things went on its way. Today, most cell phones incorporate music capabilities which have also been transferred to the smartphones. The built-in app that you use to play music on the iPhone or iPod touch is called Music (on iOS 5 or higher) or iPod (on iOS 4 or lower). While many apps offer music, this is the most common and the one that, for many people, will be the only music app they need. ==See also== *Ringtone ==References== The Best Smartphones for Music Category:Mobile content Category:Mobile telecommunications ","title":"Mobile music"},{"id":"2560571","text":"The South African Bureau for State Security (given the acronym BOSS by journalists, ) was established in 1969 and ultimately replaced by the National Intelligence Service (NIS) in 1980. The Bureau's job was to monitor national security. It was headed by Hendrik van den Bergh. A scandal was the main reason for its replacement by NIS in 1980. The Bureau was involved in the Information Scandal or Muldergate Scandal, in which South African Government funds were used to establish a pro-National Party English language newspaper, The Citizen. ==Background== In the 1930s, the Union of South Africa had formed an intelligence organization modeled after MI5 and MI6 as a special branch of the South African Police. After the country's 1960 republic referendum and its expulsion from the Commonwealth of Nations, the organization was renamed Republican Intelligence. During the middle of 1968, the South African cabinet approved the implementation of a centralised security service and on 28 August of the same year, General Hendrik van den Bergh was instructed to start planning the new organisation. On the 1 October 1968, Lieutenant-General Hendrik van den Bergh, Deputy Police Commissioner and Head of the Security Branch, was promoted to General and then appointed as Security Advisor to Prime Minister John Vorster. Attached to the Prime Minister office, he would be in command of all security and intelligence chiefs in the country including the military, and reported only to Vorster. By March 1969, the skeleton of a new security service began to emerge with the release of the expenditures for 1969-70 when R5,320,500 was allocated to the secret services, a 188 percent increase over the previous year with R4,063,000 allocated to the Prime Minister's office and Van den Bergh. Military Intelligence's (MI) budget was reduced from R830,000 the previous year to a R39,000 a which would lead to continuous struggle for power between MI and BOSS throughout the seventies. On 13 May 1969, Minister of the Interior S.L. Muller introduced the framework of the new service in the Public Service Amendment Bill which he said was responsible for co-ordination and would draw personnel from other security and intelligence organisations. It outlined the control of the Bureau for State Security would rest with Prime Minister and that the civil service Public Service Commission would have no control over it powers, functions and duties. A Government Notice No. 808 on 16 May 1969 announced the Bureau for State Security's formation and came into being retrospectively on the 1 May as a department under the Prime Minister. BOSS' function was stated as investigating matters of state security, collect and evaluate any information received and distribute the analysis when necessary throughout the government and secondly but more ambiguously, perform other functions and responsibilities when required. The 19 May 1969 saw the introduction of the Security Services Special Account Bill and that would pass into law on 16 June 1969, and saw the use of money allocated to BOSS as confidential and not subjected to an audit by the Auditor-General as with other government departments. The General Law Amendment Bill was introduced on 4 June 1969 and passed into law on 30 June, with two clauses of interest to BOSS. One, the amendment of Officials Secrets Act to include BOSS and secondly, preventing the Prime Minister, Van den Bergh or cabinet ministers from giving evidence or producing documents in court that might prejudice State Security. This caused outrage throughout the South African legal community as it could no longer protect citizens rights from the Executive. On 5 September 1969, Prime Minister John Vorster formed a commission led by Justice H.J. Potgieter to establish the guidelines and mission for intelligence gathering by the Military Intelligence (later DMI) and the Bureau for State Security. The Commission to Inquire into Certain Intelligence Aspects of State Security, known better as the Potgieter Commission would investigate the clashes between the two organisations over who had primary responsibility for intelligence gathering in South Africa. As the BOSS head Hendrik van den Bergh was a close ally of the Prime Minister, it was seen by Military Intelligence as a foregone conclusion that BOSS would achieve favour. The Potgieter Commission reported back on the 2 February 1972 and the results were subsequently used to enact the Security Intelligence and State Security Council Act 64 of 1972 on 24 May 1972. The Act formalised the functions and the brief of BOSS while another part of this act would also established the formation of the State Security Council under the control of the cabinet and established it as the government's national centre for operational security. BOSS was actively involved in South Africa's foreign policy. It worked closely with intelligence services of other white-minority governments including PIDE of Estado Novo Portugal and its colonial empire as well as the British South Africa Police of Rhodesia to coordinate counterinsurgency operations between the three countries. It and the South African Defense Force managed Operation Plathond, an operation to train insurgents in an attempt to destabilize Zambia, before President Kenneth Kaunda accused South Africa of destabilization operations. The organization also arranged for political assassinations. Former agents testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission have confirmed the existence of a secret death squad called the Z-Squad managed by Dirk Coetzee. The agents have claimed that the Z-Squad killed dissidents through letter bombs and snipers. BOSS also attempted to kill Bafana Duna, the African National Congress representative to Swaziland, but he survived with a lost arm. ==Directors-General of BOSS/DONS== * Hendrik van den Bergh (1969‚Äì1978) * Alec van Wyk (1978‚Äì1979) ==Organisational structure== The organisational structure of BOSS is said to have been composed of the following departments: * Subversion * Counter-Espionage * Political and Economic Espionage * Military Intelligence * Administration * National Evaluation, Research and Special Studies ==End of the Bureau== In the wake of the Information scandal (known as Muldergate) in which the Bureau of State Security (BOSS) had become mired, the head of the BOSS, Hendrik van den Berg, resigned in June 1978 and was replaced by Alec van Wyk. Beginning with the covert Operation Savannah in 1975, it helped organize operations against the MPLA during the Angolan Civil War with the assistance of the U.S. State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency. This action, which escalated into a full-scale undeclared war and had received neither approval nor discussion from the Cabinet, prompted further outrage at the organization. The Bureau for State Security was then renamed the Department of National Security (DONS) on 1 September 1978. By 2 October 1978, Prime Minister John Vorster had resigned and on 9 October, the Defence Minister P.W. Botha was appointed as the new Prime Minister of South Africa. On 20 November 1978, the Bureau of State Security was brought under tighter control as a cabinet portfolio called National Security managed by Prime Minister who also held the Minister of Defence portfolio. With the rise of P.W. Botha to prime minister, the SADF's power increased in cabinet, along with that the Directorate Military Intelligence (DMI), who would strive to dominate security issues in the new government and decide its policy and implementation. In October 1978, Deputy Defence and Intelligence Minister Kobie Coetsee was appointed by Prime Minister P.W. Botha to lead a commission of inquiry into intelligence gathering in South Africa and in particular who would be the lead agency. It was believed that it was predetermined that the DMI would be the lead intelligence agency. P.W. Botha had decided to split the intelligence gathering ability of South Africa amongst four agencies, the DMI, BOSS/DONS, Security Branch and Foreign Affairs, hoping to reduce the political dominance by one over the others, but the rivalry would continue. At the same time, the Erasmus Commission of Inquiry was investigating the Information scandal. Believing that the outcome of both inquiries were already predetermined, BOSS officials began to shred any document that could be used against them. P.W. Botha was looking for an alternative to the policing function of BOSS as well as an alternative to a military view of intelligence, one which would provide long-term strategic intelligence to the government about the southern African region and world. He viewed Foreign Affairs as too overt and tainted by the Information Scandal and therefore saw a need to organise BOSS into a new agency based around research and analysis and removed its old covert operational function and transferred that to the Security Branch of the police. The new Prime Minister P.W. Botha appointed Niel Barnard in November 1979 to form a new intelligence service. Barnard would take over the South African Department of National Security (DONS) after the retirement of the existing head Alec van Wyk. The now newly named National Intelligence Service was announced on the 6 February 1980. Barnard had to restructure the NIS to a role based on analysis and evaluation, which meant that the old organisations offensive operational and policing role had to change resulting in many of the old BOSS/DONS personnel leaving. ==See also== *Apartheid *B.

The district covers the state's second largest city, Huntington, includes Bluefield, Princeton and Beckley, and has a long history of coal mining (especially in the southwestern counties), forestry and farming. The district is currently represented by Republican Carol Miller. == Character == The modern district has grown in geographic size over the years, as it contains the area of the state that has lost the most population. Most of the congressmen listed below prior to the 1992 election cycle actually represented other parts of the state, as most of the modern 3rd District's history is found in the obsolete 4th, 5th, and 6th Districts. The modern 3rd District began to take shape in the 1960s. For much of its history, the 4th district had been focused on Huntington and the mill towns and farm communities north of that city along the Ohio River, while the 5th and 6th Districts were focused on the then safely Democratic coal fields. In the 1970 redistricting, the 5th (which had absorbed most of the 6th due to population loss 10 years earlier) was eliminated, and most of its territory was merged into the 4th to form what is now the western half of the modern 3rd. In the 1990 redistricting the old 4th was renumbered as the 3rd and took in what is now the eastern half of its current shape from a previous version of the 2nd District. The current major areas of the district include the industrial and university city of Huntington, the coal producing southwestern part of the state, and the more conservative farm and timber region of the southeastern part of the state. 2010 Census figures again showed a major population loss, and Mason County was transferred from the 2nd to the 3rd District. This will not change the character of the district in a significant way. Despite the strength of Democrats at the local and state level, in presidential elections the district has followed the increasing Republican trend in West Virginia. While Bill Clinton twice carried the district handily in three-way races, Al Gore just narrowly won the district in 2000 with 51% of the vote. George W. Bush won the district in 2004 with 53% of the vote, and John McCain carried the district in 2008 with 55.76% of the vote, continuing the district, and the state's rightward shift despite a large shift towards the Democrats nationally in 2008. In 2012, the district shifted significantly towards the Republicans yet again, with Republican Mitt Romney defeating President Barack Obama 65.0% to 32.8% in the district. In 2016, the district shifted even further towards the Republican Party, with Republican Donald Trump defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton (wife of Bill Clinton, who carried the district by significant margins in the 1992 and 1996 presidential elections), by a massive margin of 72.5% to 23.3%. ==Statewide election results== Election results from presidential races: { class= - !

It was essentially the successor of Virginia's 12th congressional district. In 1882, the district was reformed of Logan, Wyoming, McDowell, Mercer, Raleigh, Boone, Kanawha, Fayette, Clay, Nicholas, Greenbrier, Monroe, Summers, Webster, Pocahontas, and Upshur counties. In 1902, Logan, Wyoming, McDowell, Raleigh, Boone and Mercer were removed. In 1916 the district was, more or less, renumbered as the new 6th District, and the 3rd was totally reconstituted as Ritchie, Doddridge, Harrison, Calhoun, Gilmer, Lewis, Upshur, Braxton, Clay, Nicholas, and Webster counties. In 1934, Fayette was added. In 1952, Wirt was added. In 1962, the district was again totally broken up and reconstituted as Boone, Clay, Kanawha, Nicholas and Raleigh. In 1972, Raleigh was removed and Ritchie, Wirt, Gilmer, Calhoun, Mason, Jackson, Roane, Braxton, Putnam, Lincoln, and Boone were added. In 1982, Lewis was added. The district's current configuration dates from the 1990 round of redistricting. From 1992 to 2002, it consisted of Boone, Cabell, Fayette, Greenbrier, Lincoln, Logan, McDowell, Mercer, Mingo, Monroe, Pocahontas, Raleigh, Summers, Wayne, Webster, and Wyoming. In 2002, Nicholas was added. For the 2012 cycle, Mason was added.West Virginia Blue Book (pp 538, 2012 edition) == List of members representing the district == { class=  ! Member ! Party ! Years !

Kynnersley lies in the borough of Telford and Wrekin, in a remote, rural location north of Telford. The village has a population of approximately 180 based on the 2001 census and taking into account new housing, increasing to 284 at the 2011 census. The population is expected to grow slightly as further new developments take place especially as former farm buildings are converted to residential use. Kynnersley has a small Church of England church, parts of which date from the 13th Century, surmounted by an unusual central bell tower. There is a small village hall of wooden construction which was probably once part of a military barracks (on another site). The village also contains a set of water pumps, still in situ but now out of service, that provided water from an underground pipe system fed from a wind pump. The oldest house in the village is the (grade 2 listed) Whim Cottage, a beamed house with walls of wattle and daub, part of which dates from the 16th century. Kynnersley is situated on the North Shropshire Weald Moors, an area of wetlands which have been drained for agricultural use using a series of drains or \\"strines\\". Most of the farming land was originally part of the estate of the Duke of Sutherland and several houses in the village are 'Duke of Sutherland Cottages' which have a distinctive architectural style. The \\"Dukes Drive\\" is a lane that leads directly from Kynnersley to the Duke of Sutherland memorial at Lilleshall In the centre of the village is a small triangle of raised land known as the Whim. The oak tree in the middle of the Whim is said to have been the hanging tree for the local court house. The old court house itself is now part of the farm buildings of Manor Farm and is in a poor state of repair. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Kynnersley ==References== *Raven, Michael, 'A Guide to Shropshire', Michael Raven, 2005, 0906114349. ==External links== Category:Villages in Shropshire Category:Telford and Wrekin ","title":"Kynnersley"},{"id":"2560604","text":"Kinnerley (Welsh: Chen-ar-dinlle) is a small village in Shropshire, England. It lies between the neighbouring villages of Dovaston and Pentre and the nearest town is Oswestry. To the north is the village of Knockin. ==History== Belan Bank Motte A mile to the south is the motte and bailey castle known as Belan Bank. The medieval castle was destroyed by Llewelyn, Prince of Wales, during the reign of Henry III. John Bridgeman, Bishop of Chester, who died in 1652, is buried in St Mary's parish church. To the north of the village is the site of Lady Ida's Well close to the Weir Brook. It takes its name from Lady Ida Lumley, wife of the 4th Earl of Bradford, who discovered a natural water spring in 1895 and championed its health benefits. ===Wartime role=== In the Second World War the area around the village became a top-secret bomb storage depot. Kinnerley was chosen because of its central location within the UK and because it had a railway link. The line was operated by the military (until it was closed in 1960). The huge site, which had extensive sidings and covered buildings, was created by the Royal Engineers: > More than 200 huge storage sheds, camouflaged and decked out with turfed > roofs, were built around the village of Kinnerley.

Kinnerley is currently served by the 576 Shrewsbury to Oswestry bus route. ==Amenities== The village today has a primary school, a church, a cemetery, and a shop. Its pub (the Cross Keys) closed in 2014 following a fire. On 1 October 2015 the pub was purchased as a community asset to be refurbished and re-opened in the future.

Mary Shelley spelled the novella's title \\"Matilda\\" and the heroine's name \\"Mathilda\\". The book has been published under each title. is the second long work of fiction of Mary Shelley, written between August 1819 and February 1820 and first published posthumously in 1959. It deals with common Romantic themes of incest and suicide.Todd, Introduction to Matilda, xxii; Bennett, An Introduction, 47. During this period, Percy Shelley dramatised an incestuous tale of his own, The Cenci. The narrative deals with a father's incestuous love for his daughter. ==Background== The act of writing this novella distracted Mary Shelley from her grief after the deaths of her one-year-old daughter Clara at Venice in September 1818 and her three-year-old son William in June 1819 in Rome.\\"When I wrote Matilda, miserable as I was, the inspiration was sufficient to quell my wretchedness temporarily.\\" Journal entry, 27 October 1822, quoted in Bennett, An Introduction, 53; see also, The Journals of Mary Shelley, 442. These losses plunged Mary Shelley into a depression that distanced her emotionally and sexually from Percy Shelley and left her, as he put it, \\"on the hearth of pale despair\\".\\"Thou art fled, gone down the dreary road,\\" he wrote, \\"that leads to Sorrow's most obscure abode\\". From \\"To Mary Shelley\\", published in Mary Shelley's edition of Percy Shelley's poetical works, 1839. Quoted in Todd, Introduction to Matilda, xvi; see also Mellor, Mary Shelley, 142. ==Plot== Narrating from her deathbed, Mathilda, a young woman barely in her twenties, writes her story as a way of explaining her actions to her friend, Woodville. Her narration follows her lonely upbringing and climaxes at a point when her unnamed father confesses his incestuous love for her. This is then followed by his suicide by drowning and her ultimate demise; her relationship with the gifted young poet, Woodville, fails to reverse Matilda's emotional withdrawal or prevent her lonely death. The novella begins with readers becoming aware that this story is being narrated in the first person, by Mathilda, and that this narration is meant for a specific audience in answer to a question asked prior to the novella's beginning: \\"You have often asked me the cause of my solitary life; my tears; and above all of my impenetrable and unkind silence.\\" Readers quickly learn that Mathilda is on her deathbed and this is the only reason she is exposing what seems to be a dark secret. Mathilda's narrative first explores the relationship between her mother and father, and how they knew each other growing up. Mathilda's mother, Diana, and her father were childhood friends; Mathilda's father found solace in Diana after the death of his own mother and the two married not long after. Mathilda, as narrator, notes that Diana changed Mathilda's father making him more tender and less fickle. However, Mathilda was born a little more than a year after their marriage and Diana died a few days after her birth, causing her father to sink into a deep depression. His sister, Mathilda's aunt, came to England to stay with them and help care for Mathilda, but Mathilda's father, unable to even look at his daughter, left about a month after his wife's death and Mathilda was raised by her aunt. Mathilda tells Woodville that her upbringing, while cold on the part of her aunt, was never neglectful; she learned to occupy her time with books and jaunts around her aunt's estate in Loch Lomond, Scotland. On Mathilda's sixteenth birthday her aunt received a letter from Mathilda's father expressing his desire to see his daughter. Mathilda describes their first three months in each other's company as being blissful, but this ended first when Mathilda's aunt dies and then, after the two return to London, upon Mathilda's father's expression of his love for her. Leading up to the moment of revelation, Mathilda was courted by suitors which, she noticed, drew dark moods from her father. This darkness ensued causing Mathilda to plot a way of bringing back the father she once knew. She asked him to accompany her on a walk through the woods that surrounded them and, on this walk, she expressed her concerns and her wishes to restore their relationship. Her father accused her of being \\"presumptuous and very rash.\\" However, this did not stop her and he eventually confessed his incestuous desire regarding her. Mathilda's father fainted and she retreated back to their home. Her father left her a note the next morning explaining that he would leave her and she understood that his actual intent was to commit suicide. Mathilda followed him, but was too late to stop him from drowning himself. For some time after his death, Mathilda returned to society as she became sick in her attempts to stop her father. She realized, though, that she could not remain in this society and she faked her own death to ensure that no one would come looking for her. Mathilda re- established herself in a solitary house in the heath. She has a maid who came to care for the house every few days, but other than that she had no human interaction until Woodville also established residence in the heath about two years after she chose to reside there. Woodville was mourning the loss of his betrothed, Elinor, and a poet. He and Mathilda struck a friendship; Woodville often asked Mathilda why she never smiled but she would not go into much detail regarding this. One day, Mathilda suggested to Woodville that they end their mutual sorrows together and commit suicide. Woodville talked Mathilda out of this decision, but soon after had to leave the heath to care for his ailing mother. Mathilda contemplates her future after his departure, and while walking through the heath, gets lost and ends up sleeping outside for a night. It rains while she sleeps outside and, after she makes her way back to her home, she becomes extremely sick. It is in this state that Mathilda decides to write out her story to Woodville as a way of explaining to him her darker countenance, even though she recognizes that she does not have much longer to live. ==Criticism== Commentators have often read the text as autobiographical, with the three central characters standing for Mary Shelley, William Godwin (her father), and Percy Shelley (her husband).The novella's 1959 editor, Elizabeth Nitchie, for example, states: \\"The three main characters are clearly Mary herself, Godwin, and Shelley, and their relations can easily be reassorted to correspond with reality\\". Introduction to Mathilda; see also, Mellor, Mary Shelley, 143. There is no firm evidence, however, that the storyline itself is autobiographical.Nitchie, Introduction to Mathilda. Analysis of Mathilda's first draft, titled \\"The Fields of Fancy\\", reveals that Mary Shelley took as her starting point Mary Wollstonecraft's unfinished \\"The Cave of Fancy\\", in which a small girl's mother dies in a shipwreck.Todd, Introduction to Matilda, xviii. Like Mary Shelley herself, Mathilda idealises her lost mother.Todd, Introduction to Mathilda, xix. According to editor Janet Todd, the absence of the mother from the last pages of the novella suggests that Mathilda's death renders her one with her mother, enabling a union with the dead father.Todd, Introduction to Mathilda, xx‚Äìxxi. Critic Pamela Clemit resists a purely autobiographical reading and argues that Mathilda is an artfully crafted novella, deploying confessional and unreliable narrations in the style of her father, as well as the device of the pursuit used by Godwin in his Caleb Williams and by Mary Shelley in Frankenstein.Clemit, \\"From The Fields of Fancy to Matilda \\", 64‚Äì75. The novella's 1959 editor, Elizabeth Nitchie, noted its faults of \\"verbosity, loose plotting, somewhat stereotyped and extravagant characterization\\" but praised a \\"feeling for character and situation and phrasing that is often vigorous and precise\\".Nitchie, Introduction to Mathilda. The story may be seen as a metaphor for what happens when a woman, ignorant of all consequences, follows her own heart while dependent on her male benefactor. Mathilda has also been seen as an example of redefining female Gothic narratives. An important characteristic of this redefined genre often includes female narrators having more control over the story than was common at the time. According to Kathleen A. Miller, \\"Although Shelley's novella appears to relate a conventional female gothic narrative of a young woman victimized by her father's incestuous desire, it leaves open the possibility that, in fact, it is Mathilda, rather than her father, who wields control over the novel's gothic script.\\" This potentially allows for Mathilda to be viewed as a positive role model in nineteenth-century literature as she overcomes paternal authority and refuses to conform to commonly accepted practices regarding female characters in literature of the time. This redefinition occurs in various ways: Mathilda's refusal to name her father, her voice being the primary source of information provided to readers, and a lack of the novella ending in marriage which was the typical motif for female gothic literature. ==Publication== Mary Shelley sent the finished Mathilda to her father in England, to submit for publication. However, though Godwin admired aspects of the novella, he found the incest theme \\"disgusting and detestable\\" and failed to return the manuscript despite his daughter's repeated requests.Todd, Introduction to Mathilda, xvii. In the light of Percy Shelley's later death by drowning, Mary Shelley came to regard the novella as ominous; she wrote of herself and Jane Williams \\"driving (like Mathilda) towards the sea to learn if we were to be for ever doomed to misery\\".Letter to Maria Gisborne, 15 August 1822. Todd, Introduction to Mathilda, xvii. The novella was published for the first time in 1959, edited by Elizabeth Nitchie from dispersed papers.Nitchie, Introduction to Mathilda. It has become possibly Mary Shelley's best-known work after Frankenstein.Clemit, \\"From The Fields of Fancy to Matilda \\", 64. ==Footnotes== ==Bibliography== *Allen, Graham. \\"Beyond Biographism: Mary Shelley's Matilda, Intertextuality, and the Wandering Subject\\".

It runs for , from Wallsend on the east coast of England to Bowness-on-Solway on the west coast. For most of its length it is close to the remains of Hadrian's Wall, the defensive wall built by the Romans on the northern border of their empire. This is now recognised as part of the \\"Frontiers of the Roman Empire\\" World Heritage Site. == Path description == Though muddy in places, the walking is relatively easy, as the highest point on the path is only 345 m (1130 ft) high and for much of its length the path is more or less flat. Most of the Wall runs through remote countryside but there are sections that pass through the cities and suburbs of Newcastle and Carlisle. The path is well signposted. For most of the walk there are many signs of human activity, and many other walkers in summer. Though there are villages and farms near to the path, there are not many places to buy food and drink, especially in the middle sections. The section between Chollerford and Walton is the highest and wildest part of the path; it is also where the Wall is most visible, and includes several important Roman forts. This itinerary breaks the 84-mile (135 km) walk into six reasonable stages, and is presented from east to west (against the prevailing wind). *Wallsend to Heddon-on-the-Wall ‚Äì long. The path starts at the Roman fort and Museum of Segedunum which sets the historical context for the Wall. Segedunum is also the first / last of the National Trail's Walkers' Passport stamping stations. Most of this section runs through urban areas, including through the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne, and along the banks of the Tyne. Only the last part, leading to Heddon-on-the-Wall, is in open countryside. There are occasional glimpses of the Wall. *Heddon-on-the-Wall to Chollerford ‚Äì long. This section is almost entirely through open countryside. The Wall is occasionally visible and the Vallum (earthwork) is frequently visible on the south side. *Chollerford to Steel Rigg - long. The remains of Milecastle 39 (Castle Nick), a short distance east of Steel Rigg and Peel Crags The Roman fort of Chesters is close to the start of this section. The path starts to rise now and the countryside becomes moorland, rather than farmland. Much more of the Wall is visible and parts of it run along the edge of crags, giving superb views over the open countryside to the north. The path passes the Roman fort at Vercovicium (Housesteads), which has been extensively consolidated and contains much of interest. For very good conservation reasons, nowhere along the route does the Trail follow the crest of Hadrian's Wall but in the small wood on the Whin Sill escarpment at Housesteads there is a short section of Public Right of Way, approximately 150 metres, which is actually on the Wall. The Trail follows a parallel path in the wood but visitors are allowed, if they choose, to walk on the Wall. The Pennine Way National Trail branches off northwards a little to the west of Milecastle 37. *Steel Rigg to Walton - long. This is another section across open countryside with the Wall occasionally visible. The Roman fort at Birdoswald has a museum. The Pennine Way long distance path joins the Hadrian's Wall Path near the village of Greenhead. As the path approaches Walton, Lanercost Priory is a short walk to the south. Much of the Priory was built with stones taken from the Wall. *Walton to Carlisle ‚Äì long. In this section the path returns to farmland and crosses the M6 motorway. Part of the path is alongside the River Eden, passing through a pleasant park and over a large footbridge. *Carlisle to Bowness-on- Solway ‚Äì long. The first part of this section is rather bare but the walking improves once the path gets beyond the outskirts of Carlisle. Most of the path runs alongside either the River Eden or the Solway Firth. There is nothing of the Wall to be seen but the walking is open and pleasant. The path ends in the village of Bowness-on-Solway. === Access === Both Newcastle and Carlisle are on the UK national railway network. The start of the walk at Wallsend can be easily reached by taking a local train from Newcastle to Wallsend Metro Station, which is the only station in the world with bilingual notices in English and Latin. From the station walk in the opposite direction to the shops along Station Road towards the tall observation tower of Segedunum Roman Fort and Museum. The Tyne Valley railway line runs between Newcastle and Carlisle, with stops at Wylam, Prudhoe, Corbridge, Hexham, Haydon Bridge, Bardon Mill, Haltwhistle, Brampton (1 mile from the town of Brampton) and Wetheral. For most of its length, the line is not within easy walking distance of the Wall. Northumberland National Park operates paying car parks at Brocolitia, Housesteads, Steel Rigg, the Sill National Landscape Discovery Centre, Cawfields quarry and Walltown quarry. Bowness-on-Solway does not have a car park and anyone thinking of leaving their car in Wallsend while they walk the Trail are advised to consider leaving their car in the long-stay car park at Newcastle airport. There is a Hadrian's Wall bus (service AD122) (note 'Roman' numbering) which runs close to the central section of the Wall during the summer. The bus runs between Hexham, Chesters, Housesteads, Once Brewed, Vindolanda, Walton and Haltwhistle approximately once an hour 0900 1700. The service runs daily from Easter until September. ==== Bowness on Solway transport options ==== * There is no off street parking in Bowness on Solway and the streets are very narrow. * There is one public transport option, the 93 Stagecoach Bus from Carlisle which stops in Bowness 2-3 times a weekday * Other options include paid Taxis from Carlisle or free shuttles which are available from some local establishments. ==See also== *Hadrian's Wall *Coast to Coast Walk ‚Äì a similar alternative, somewhat to the south, from St Bees to Robin Hood's Bay *Antonine Wall *National Trails *Long-distance footpaths in the United Kingdom ==References== * Hadrian's Wall Path by Anthony Burton.

The film includes a lot of live music and interviews with the band's members. It starts in R√•gsved, a working class suburb of Stockholm, and follows Ebba Gr√∂n on tour around Sweden until the band returns to R√•gsved. The Swedish reggaeband Dag Vag also participates in a part of the movie when Ebba is on tour. There are two versions of the film. When released in 1982, the movie was originally 78 minutes long. Johan Donner later cut down the film to a 52 minutes version which he called the Hardcore version. Both versions are included in the DVD-release. The title of the film is a reference to the 1977 documentary film ABBA: The Movie, featuring fellow Swedes ABBA. The reference is intended to be ironic, since Ebba Gr√∂n's style is very different from that of ABBA. == External links == * Category:1982 films Category:Swedish documentary films Category:Swedish films Category:Documentary films about punk music and musicians Category:1982 documentary films ","title":"Ebba the Movie"},{"id":"2560646","text":"West Virginia's 1st congressional district is located in the northern part of the state. It is the most regularly drawn of the state's three districts. It includes the industrial Rust Belt area of the state's northern panhandle which includes the district's third largest city, Wheeling, as well as Fairmont, Clarksburg, and the college town of Morgantown, the home of the main campus of West Virginia University. The largest city in the district is Parkersburg; the second largest is Morgantown. It also includes many rural farm and timber producing areas. The district has almost no population change reported in the 2010 Census change relative to the other 2 districts, as growth around Morgantown and Parkersburg offset population loss elsewhere, and the district was carried over unchanged for the next ten-year cycle. The district is currently represented by David McKinley, a Republican who has represented the district since 2011. West Virginia has tended to give its congressmen very long tenures in Washington, and the 1st District is no exception. Only four men have represented the district since 1953: Bob Mollohan (D) (1953‚Äì1957), former Governor Arch Moore, Jr. (R) (1957‚Äì1969), Bob Mollohan again (1969‚Äì1983), Alan Mollohan (1983‚Äì2011) and McKinley. Despite the lack of turnover in the congressional seat, historically the 1st was not safe for either party. The cities are ancestrally Democratic strongholds, while the rural areas are much more conservative and have a tendency to swing Republican more often. As late as 2014, state legislators were roughly split between both parties. Historically, the district has been very Democratic, mirroring the state as a whole. However, West Virginia Democrats tend to be somewhat more socially conservative than their counterparts in the rest of the nation, and the district has been swept up in the growing Republican trend in the state at the national level. No Democrat since Bill Clinton (who did so by a plurality in a three-way race) has carried the 1st District in presidential elections. George W. Bush carried the district both times in 2000 with 54% of the vote and 2004 with 58% of the vote. John McCain carried the district in 2008 with 56.77% of the vote while Barack Obama received 41.51%. ==History== The First District has always been anchored in Wheeling, and as such has always included Hancock, Brooke, Ohio, Marshall, and Wetzel countiesWest Virginia Blue Book, pp. 534 (2012 edition)‚Äìthe five counties usually reckoned as the Northern Panhandle. The original 1863 districting included also Tyler, Pleasants, Doddridge, Harrison, Ritchie, Wood, Wirt, Gilmer, Calhoun and Lewis counties. It was essentially the successor of Virginia's 11th congressional district. In 1882, the counties of Tyler, Doddridge, Harrison, Gilmer, Lewis and Braxton were added to the core counties. In 1902, the core counties were joined by Marion, Harrison, and Lewis counties. In the 1916 redistricting it included only the five core counties and Marion and Taylor. The district was unchanged in the 1934 and 1954 redistrictings. In 1962, Braxton, Calhoun, Doddridge, Gilmer, Harrison, Lewis, Marion and Taylor joined the five core counties. The 1972 redistricting added Tyler, Pleasants, and Woods and deleted Taylor. The 1982 redistricting added Taylor back to the district. 1992 began the district as currently constituted, consisting of Barbour, Brooke, Doddridge, Grant, Hancock, Harrison, Marion, Marshall, Mineral, Monongalia, Ohio, Pleasants, Preston, Ritchie, Taylor, Tucker, Tyler, Wetzel and Wood counties. In 2002 Gilmer was added. For the election cycle that begins in 2012 the district was unchanged. == Recent presidential elections == { class= - ! colspan=\\"3\\"  Election results from presidential races - eee; text-align:center;\\" Year Office Results - 2000  President  align=\\"right\\" Bush 54 - 43% - 2004  President  align=\\"right\\" Bush 58 - 42% - 2008  President  align=\\"right\\" McCain 57 - 42% - 2012  President  align=\\"right\\" Romney 62 - 36% - 2016  President  align=\\"right\\" Trump 68 - 26% } == List of members representing the district == { class=  !

Cricket writer, Colin Bateman, noted that Crapp was a \\"sound rather than spectacular batsman who scored 1,000 runs in all but one of his fifteen seasons ‚Äì that was 1954, when he struggled with the Gloucestershire captaincy\\". Crapp went on to become an umpire for twenty two seasons, including standing in four Test matches. ==Life and career== Crapp was born in St Columb Major, Cornwall, and began his career with Stapleton Cricket Club in Bristol, scoring a 'duck' for the third team on his debut. However, he soon moved up to the first XI following some spectacular performances, and was spotted by Wally Hammond who invited him for trials with Gloucestershire. In 1936, he made his debut for Gloucestershire and was a fixture in their team for the next twenty seasons, eventually becoming their captain. Crapp was a dependable left-hand batsman and a fine slip fielder, who early in his career was thought of as a potential Test batsman. However, World War II intervened and it was not until 1948 that he became the first-ever Cornishman to play for England. Unfortunately for him, he came up against the Australian cricket team known as \\"The Invincibles\\". He was chosen on the strength of the Gloucestershire match against Australia, when Crapp scored 100, one of the few players to register a century against the Australians in 1948. Like many of the England players that summer, his performances did not do his talent justice. He toured South Africa with the England team in 1948‚Äì49, but did not play spectacularly well in the Tests, although in the final Test he guided England home to victory with Allan Watkins, with only three balls to spare. Crapp was dropped from the Test side in 1949. He continued to perform well for Gloucestershire, becoming their first professional captain in 1953. In 1955 he handed over the role to George Emmett. In his later years, a debilitating skin condition affected his hands and this eventually led to his retirement. After retiring Crapp became a first-class umpire and stood in four Tests, notably the match in which Fred Trueman took his 300th Test wicket. For many years, Trueman would show people the ball he used to take the wicket. But shortly before his death, Crapp revealed to journalist, Frank Keating, that he had swapped balls preventing Trueman from keeping the historic one. Commemorative plaque at birthplace of Jack Crapp There is a story about a time he was sharing a room on tour with one of the Bedser twins. Returning to the hotel late one night, probably slightly worse for wear he approached reception to ask for his key. Now the touring England team were reported widely in the newspapers, and were recognisable to many people, and so he was not entirely surprised that before he could say anything the receptionist, asked \\"Bed, sir?\\" Jack replied, \\"No, Crapp\\", only for the receptionist to point him to the gents.B Johnston 2007 A delicious slice of Johnners. Virgin Books Ltd: page 40 His England blazer is in the possession of St Columb Old Cornwall Society. There is also a plaque in the garden of house at Bridge, St Columb Major where he was born.

One of the writers for the Batman comic strip and Super Friends, he also wrote The Inferior Five, among other comics. He has been called \\"DC's self-appointed continuity cop.\\" ==Career== Bridwell's early childhood interest in mythology and folklore stayed with him throughout his professional life and permeated much of his work. He credited his fame to his third grade teacher, Ryan Samuel, for interesting him in comics. Bridwell \\"was one of the first 'comics fans' hired in the industry after the long, bleak 1950's,\\".O'Connell, Margaret. \\"With One Magic Word...: A Talk With E. Nelson Bridwell!\\" in Richard Howell and Carol Kalish (ed.s) Comics Feature #10 (New Media Publishing, July 1981) Although his first published work consisted of a text page in Adventures into the Unknown #9 (Feb‚ÄìMarch 1950) published by the American Comics Group, he had since he \\"was still a kid\\" created various characters who would later evolve into those used in comics such as The Inferior Five. In 1962, while still residing in Oklahoma City, Bridwell submitted to the Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction his first idea for a Feghoot adventure, a specific type of shaggy dog story that ends in a humorous and unexpected play on words. His story was promptly accepted by the feature's pseudonymous author, Grendel Briarton (Reginald Bretnor) and shortly followed by yet another submission from Bridwell which was also accepted (\\"Dr. Jacqueline Missed Her Hide\\" and \\"Nude Rally Tea Pact\\", respectively.) Besides F&SF;, both stories would appear in the various Feghoot anthologies to follow. Caricature of E. Nelson Bridwell by Dave Manak (c. 1976). After writing a few stories for Mad and for Katy Keene, Bridwell began working for DC Comics in 1965 as an assistant to editor Mort Weisinger, \\"on the Superman titles, eventually becoming an editor himself (Lois Lane, and later The Superman Family).\\" Jim Shooter (who also worked with Weisinger) recalls that Weisinger did not always treat his assistant well, saying that his \\"assistant was Nelson Bridwell and boy, he tortured Nelson. He just was awful to Nelson.\\" Bridwell, however, recalled in 1980 an important lesson learned from Weisinger, that: :\\"You've got to keep in mind that while there are a lot of people who've read about the characters before, there are always new people coming along, and you've got to realize that you can't count on them to know the whole legend of the character.\\" This lesson set him in good stead both when he helped DC produce three 1970s anthologies ‚Äî Superman from the Thirties to the Seventies (1971),Superman from the Thirties to the Seventies at the Grand Comics Database Batman from the Thirties to the Seventies (1971),Batman from the Thirties to the Seventies at the Grand Comics Database and Shazam from the Forties to the Seventies (1977)Shazam from the Forties to the Seventies at the Grand Comics Database ‚Äî and when he wrote for the comic book series based on \\"one of the best rated TV shows on Saturday morning\\", Super Friends. Concurrent with his duties for DC, Bridwell \\"was submitting material as a freelancer to Mad\\", some of which was illustrated by Joe Orlando, who would later be suggested by Bridwell as artist for The Inferior Five. ===Continuity=== Recalling an early interest in comic book continuity, Bridwell \\"remembered getting a bit perturbed at times when I was a kid by having things that didn't fit\\", particularly over the wide range of Martian races in evidence in the adventures of DC's Atom, Wonder Woman, and Superman characters. Bridwell was also an early advocate of the theory that the Marvel and DC characters \\"exist in the same universe\\", citing early inter- company crossovers such as Superman vs. The Amazing Spider-Man and a cross- company interlocking storyline, with real-world crossover characters, between Justice League of America #103, Thor #207 and Amazing Adventures #16. Bridwell's love and knowledge of old comics led to his becoming editor on numerous reprint books, including digests, giant-size comics, and hardcover anthologies. He also worked as assistant editor to Julius Schwartz, keeping track of continuity between the numerous Superman titles published. Part of his job was to manage the letter columns for all the Superman titles, and in response to constant reader questions, Bridwell standardized the Kryptonian language and alphabet. Dubbed \\"Kryptonese\\", Bridwell established the 118-character alphabet, which was used by DC until John Byrne's 1986 \\"reboot\\" of the Superman universe. ===The Inferior Five=== Bridwell and Joe Orlando created the Inferior Five in Showcase #62 (June 1966). Talking about the humorous super-hero series, Bridwell recalls that: :\\"Jack Miller came up with the idea of a group of incompetent heroes, and at first he came up with the title The Inferior Four. When I created five heroes, he changed it to The Inferior Five. I completely created the heroes as a clown set, and Joe Orlando created the costumes.\\" ===Other comics=== Bridwell wrote for several other DC titles, including Action Comics, Adventure Comics, Shazam!, Superman, The Superman Family, World's Finest Comics and The Legion of Super-Heroes.

The name Kojonup is believed to refer to the \\"Kodja\\" or stone axe made by Indigenous Australians, from the local stone. ==History== The Noongar people are the traditional owners and inhabitants of Kojonup. Specifically, the Noongar people of Kojonup today are descendants of the Kaneang tribe. Historically the Noongar people drank from the local freshwater spring and hunted game with the traditional Noongar ‚Äòkodj‚Äô, or stone axe. Both Kojonup and The Kodja Place are named after the historically significant implement. Sovereignty has not been ceded. The first European in the area was surveyor Alfred Hillman who arrived in 1837 and had been guided to freshwater spring by the Noongar people. The site was an important staging place on the road to Albany, and in 1837 a military post was established there for the protection of travellers and the mail. By 1845 this outpost had grown to support a military barracks, built on the site of the freshwater spring. Today, the barracks still stands on its original site and houses the Kojonup Pioneer Museum. The barracks is one of the oldest buildings in Western Australia. The first farms in Kojonup were set up by soldiers with settlement grants. The appointment in 1865 of a mounted Police Constable marked the phasing out of the military presence at Kojonup. By the late 1860s the military had left and the Barracks became a focus for community gatherings, much as it is today. The town's first Police Station was built in 1869 and the first hotel licence was granted in 1868. In early 1898 the population of the town was 67, 32 men and 35 women. In 1926 the Kojonup Memorial Hall was built at a cost of ¬£5,000, it was officially opened by Major General Sir Talbot Hobbs. Kojonup has been the home to many important Australian Rules Football players, including several players of Indigenous Australian descent. ==Economy== Giant Dray in Kojonup The early economy of the town was initially dependent on cutting and transporting sandalwood and kangaroo hunting but by the mid-19th century the wool industry began to boom and by 1906 the shire had 10,500 sheep. By 1989 the shire had seen over 1 million sheep being shorn. To celebrate the importance of the wool industry the town built a one and a half scale model of a wool wagon; the project was officially opened on Australia Day in 2001. The surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops including organic, conventional and GMO.Paull, John (2015) The threat of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to organic agriculture: A case study update, Agriculture & Food, 3: 56-63.

The Marsh v Baxter case has put Kojonup at the epicentre of the battle in Australia of organic versus GMO agriculture. The town is a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling. ==Recreation== Sporting facilities include a golf club with 18 holes, a tennis club, a skate park, a 50-metre outdoor swimming pool, football oval, netball courts, and hockey ovals.

A police officer from Stockholm moves back to his hometown √Ñlvsbyn in Norrland, in northern Sweden. He starts to work on a long-running reindeer poaching case and soon discovers that his brother is involved. The film was one of the biggest Swedish box- office hits ever and received two Guldbagge Awards for Best Direction (Kjell Sundvall) and Best Supporting Actor (Lennart J√§hkel). It was also nominated for Best Actor (Rolf Lassg√•rd), Best Cinematography and Best Screenplay. Hollywood wanted to make a remake of this film, and the American producers wanted it to be about cowboys in the Nevada desert, shooting wild horses for fun. Kjell Sundvall agreed to this at first but later changed his mind. A sequel, The Hunters 2, premiered in September 2011. ==Plot== Erik (Rolf Lassg√•rd), a Stockholm police officer, reunites with his relatives upon the death of his abusive father in Norrbotten, where his brother Leif (Lennart J√§hkel) still lives. We learn that the control the father exerted over the family had resulted in Leif's giving up singing (despite being clearly talented), and instead remaining at home with his father. Suffering from post- traumatic stress after justifiably killing a man while on duty, Erik has been transferred to the local field office. Erik soon starts to suspect that his brother's friends, led by the half-Finnish Tomme (Jarmo M√§kinen), are involved in large-scale illegal hunting of reindeer and moose. Erik is frustrated by the local police's unwillingness to deal with the problem, but as events unfold he discovers illegal weapons in Tomme's car outside a pub and decides to intervene. Tomme is close to assaulting Erik when he is saved by his brother. It is later revealed that Leif in fact leads the illegal hunting, but has been keeping this a secret from his brother. The police come under increasing pressure as the local community grows more angry that the poaching case has not been solved. Erik continues to spy on Tomme, and after breaking into his house, discovers illegal guns and numerous animal carcasses. Before Erik can alert his colleagues, he is attacked and knocked unconscious. Leif decides to suspend operations until further notice because of the increased police interest in the case. Several members of the gang are unhappy about this, as they have taken on large financial commitments such as car loans. Pursuing a big raid to recover the lost income, Tomme accidentally shoots and kills a Russian bilberry worker. Another bilberry worker witnesses the dumping of the victim's body and car in a lake. Leif chases her and fatally slits her throat. Unaware that the murder of the woman has been seen by Ove, a kind but intellectually disabled childhood friend of Erik's, the five men decide to keep silent instead of going to the police. Erik suspects his brother is hiding something. Erik intervenes when the gang racially and sexually harasses a Filipina barmaid, Nena, at the local bar. Later, Erik and Nena spend the night together. Erik leaves Nena in the house while he attends a ceremony to receive an award for having returned to his hometown. While Erik is out, Leif and his gang arrive at the house and, after verbally abusing Nena, they rape her on the kitchen table. Nena then disappears, and it is later revealed that she returned to the Philippines. Erik, meanwhile, tries to have Tomme's wife betray her husband and tell him something, but she refuses. Upon the arrival of a female prosecutor from Stockholm (Helena Bergstr√∂m), the body of the Russian woman is found. With information from Ove, the police find the body of the male Russian, with a fragment of the bullet lodged within it. Erik tells Ove to stay inside and keep his door locked, but Leif and the others, having been tipped off by Erik's police partner that Ove is the witness, arrive at Ove's house and take him out in the woods for what they say is a hunting trip but is in fact an execution. Erik and prosecutor Anna arrive too late, as the gang has \\"accidentally\\" shot Ove. A short time before, Erik had found out that Ove was his and Leif's half-brother. Unable to prove that Ove was murdered, Erik is forced to find the rifle used to shoot the Russian to secure a conviction for this killing. In a final stand-off Erik is fired at and nearly killed by Tomme, but Erik manages to hit Tomme with an iron bar. Tomme is arrested. Leif gives Erik 200,000 Kronor (which is his share of their father's estate) and asks Erik to let him turn himself in. Erik agrees, giving him one hour to do so and then leaves. Rather than turn himself in, Leif then kills himself by blowing up their childhood house. Erik returns to Stockholm, trying to pursue another life than that which his father and his brother had attempted. ==Cast== * Rolf Lassg√•rd as Erik * Lennart J√§hkel as Leif * Jarmo M√§kinen as Tomme * Tomas Norstr√∂m as Ove * G√∂ran Forsmark as Hakan * Rolf Degerlund as Eilert *Editha Domingo as Nena * Helena Bergstr√∂m as Anna * Thomas Hedengran as Stig * Roland Hedlund as Bengtsson * Ove Tjernberg as Soderberg * √Öke Lindman as Chefen ==ReferencesCategory:1996 films Category:Films directed by Kjell Sundvall Category:Swedish films Category:Swedish-language films Category:Swedish thriller films Category:Films whose director won the Best Director Guldbagge Award ","title":"The Hunters (1996 film)"},{"id":"2560733","text":"The black swallower, Chiasmodon niger, is a species of deep sea fish in the family Chiasmodontidae. It is known for its ability to swallow fish larger than itself. It has a worldwide distribution in tropical and subtropical waters, in the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones at a depth of . It is a very common and widespread ocean fish; of its genus, it is the most common species in the North Atlantic. == Description == The black swallower is a small fish, with a maximum known length of . The body is elongated and compressed, without scales, and is a uniform brownish-black in color. Its head is long, with a blunt snout, moderately sized eyes, and a large mouth. The lower jaw protrudes past the upper; both jaws are lined with a single row of sharp, depressible teeth, which interlock when the mouth is closed. The first three teeth in each jaw are enlarged into canines. A small lower spine occurs on the preoperculum. The pectoral fins are long, with 12‚Äì15 (usually 13) rays; the pelvic fins are small and contain five rays. Of the two dorsal fins, the first is spiny with 10‚Äì12 spines, and the second is longer with one spine and 26‚Äì29 soft rays. The anal fin contains one spine and 26‚Äì29 soft rays. The caudal fin is forked with 9 rays. The lateral line is continuous with two pores per body segment. == Feeding == left The black swallower feeds on bony fishes, which are swallowed whole. With its greatly distensible stomach, it is capable of swallowing prey over twice its length and 10 times its mass. Its upper jaws are articulated with the skull at the front via the suspensorium, which allows the jaws to swing down and encompass objects larger than the swallower's head. Theodore Gill speculated that the swallower seizes prey fishes by the tail, and then \\"walks\\" its jaws over the prey until it is fully coiled inside the stomach. Black swallowers have been found to have swallowed fish so large that they could not be digested before decomposition set in, and the resulting release of gases forced the swallower to the ocean surface. This is, in fact, how most known specimens came to be collected. In 2007, a black swallower measuring long was found dead off Grand Cayman. Its stomach contained a snake mackerel (Gempylus serpens) long, or four and a half times its own length.Boxall, S. (October 9, 2007). . CaymanianCompass. Cayman Free Press, Ltd. == Reproduction == Reproduction is oviparous; the eggs are pelagic and measure in diameter and contain a clear oil globule and six dark pigment patches, which become distributed along the newly hatched larva from in front of the eyes to the tip of the notochord. These patches eventually disappear and the body darkens overall to black. The eggs are mostly found in winter off South Africa; juveniles have been found from April to August off Bermuda. The larvae and juveniles are covered in small, projecting spinules.Connell, A. Chiasmodontidae: L II AS . Marine fish eggs and larvae from the east coast of South Africa.

The novel is one of the earliest of Sheldon's works, but contains the typical Sheldon fast-paced narration and several narrative techniques, with the exception of a twist ending. The novel tells the life story of two fictitious Hollywood celebrities - Toby Temple and Jill Castle (roman √† clef on Sheldon's acquaintances Groucho Marx and Erin Fleming) and portrays the emotional extremes of success and failure and how people inevitably become victims of time. It was adapted into a television film in 1993 starring Perry King, Lori Loughlin, Christopher Plummer, and Juliet Mills. == Plot summary == A retired captain recalls the cruise where he decided to retire, which involves the famous celebrity, Jill Castle. The book then goes back to the beginning of the lives of the two main characters: Jill and Toby Temple. Toby's main influence growing up is his mother, who pushes him to always do better and leads him to believe he is destined for fame and greatness. After running away to Hollywood to avoid a shotgun marriage, his delusion of being naturally funny and charming is shattered when he struggles to start his career as a comedian. Eventually, after years of hardship, he becomes a successful star through the help of Clifton Lawrence, a celebrity producer, though he has become an egomaniac who destroys the careers of anyone with the slightest fault against him, and has to have everyone around him dependent on him, including Lawrence, whom he forces to drop all of his other celebrity clients. Jill, born Josephine Czinski, leaves her hometown of Odessa, Texas for Hollywood after she learns that her boyfriend, the wealthy David Kenyon, is engaged to another woman, Cissy, the morning after he nearly proposed to Jill himself. In reality, David's mother and Cissy trick David into thinking it would be a temporary marriage just to please his mother, but he fails to tell Jill about this. She discovers the difficulty of being an actress with no connections and, after being drugged into participating in a pornographic film, decides to start earning better roles in exchange for sexual favors. After a failed attempt at reuniting with David, who misses their rendezvous after Cissy attempts to kill herself, Jill returns to Hollywood and ends up working for the Toby Temple Show. Toby is attracted to Jill, unaware of her promiscuous reputation. They bond over their humble beginnings and Toby marries her, despite Lawrence's warnings. Jill manipulates Toby into destroying the careers of those who have used her in the past, and then ends Lawrence's career (since he refused her a meeting when she was an unknown) by becoming Toby's manager. Lawrence learns about Jill's porno film, but is unable to show it to Toby. Toby enjoys Jill's new role as his manager, seeing her resemblance to his mother, but he suffers a stroke that leaves him paralyzed with an estimated few years left to live. Jill's determination to help him and his miraculous improvement earns public approval, making her more famous than Toby. She reconnects with David, now a divorce, and while they agree to be friends, she secretly loves him still. Toby relapses into another stroke, this time marring his appearance and paralyzing him completely, though this time he is estimated to live for another 20 years. In frustration, she tells a paralyzed Toby that she does not love him anymore but, as a result, begins to have nightmares about his moving eyes. She decides to drown him and stage his death as an accident, and while she is not charged with murder, Lawrence does not believe her story. Lawrence hears of Jill's low-profile wedding to David Kenyon and suspects her of murdering Toby to be with him. He follows them to their honeymoon cruise and forces David to watch Jill's pornographic film. David's racist history is revealed, and he beats up Lawrence.

They released their debut album, Wine of Life, in 1994 which peaked in the top 50 on the ARIA Albums Chart. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1994, their debut extended play, Movin' On (April 1993), was nominated for an ARIA award for 'Best Independent Release'. ==History== Juice formed in 1991 in Sydney as a hard rock funk band by Amarnath and his brother Krishna Jones both on guitars and vocals; Lucius Borich on drums, and David Kyle on bass guitar. According to Australian rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, they \\"played a fiery fusion of hard funk, aggressive rock, psychedelia and soul (somewhere between Funkadelic, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix and the 'stoned soul picnic' stylings of Sly and the Family Stone). Juice was one of a number of young bands at that time exploring diverse musical avenues on the traditional Australian pub-rock scene: d.i.g.'s acid jazz, Swoop's soulful funk grooves, Def FX's techno-metal, Skunkhour's funk'n'rap and Caligula's techno-pop\\". Phil Jones (aka Shiva Shankar Jones), father of Amarnath and Krishna, is a musician, who worked with 1960s group The Unknown Blues. In 1969 he relocated to the United Kingdom to join progressive rock band, Quintessence. Borich is a son of New Zealand-born Australian guitarist Kevin Borich. During 1993 Juice supported Hoodoo Gurus and INXS; in April they released their first extended play, Movin' On. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1994 it was nominated for 'Best Independent Release'. In May 1994 the group's debut studio album, Wine of Life, was issued on the Dr J label for Polydor Records. It provided the singles \\"Skyhigh\\" in April and \\"Paper World\\" in November that same year. Kyle left before the album had appeared and was replaced on bass guitar by Ben Rosen. In early 1995 Borich left to form a heavy stoner rock band, The Hanging Tree. Borich was replaced by Chris Simms on drums. They supported tours by Radiohead and The Tea Party. In June 1995 Juice released a single, \\"Never Enough\\", followed by another EP, Fractured in September. Simon Cox replaced Simms on drums, but by early 1996 Juice had disbanded. ==Music Careers== After disbandment various former members of Juice continued their music careers. In 1998, Lucius Borich, along with Flynn Gower from The Hanging Tree formed a progressive rock group, Cog. In 1999, Amarnath and Krishna Jones created a new acoustic blues-rock band, Juggernaut, which issued three EPs, Million Miles from Home (1999), Better Than Everyone (2000) and Head in the Clouds (September 2004); and a studio album, Burn. Krishna co-wrote the screenplay of a 2001 short film, The Host, with its director and editor, Nick Tomnay. In 2002, Krishna produced recordings by nu-metal band Beacon, the group included Emelyn Walters from The Hanging Tree. Juggernaut's track, \\"Bubbleman\\", received an honourable mention in the Rock category at the 2004 International Songwriting Competition for its songwriters, Amarnath and Krishna. Krishna issued his debut solo album, Razor's Edge, in 2007. Ben Rosen remixed works by Marilyn Manson, Unwritten Law, Nikka Costa, Grinspoon, 8mm and also started his own audio company, The Gunnery, in Singapore. On 29 May 2010 the original four members of Juice (Krishna and Amarnath Jones, Lucius Borich and David Kyle) reunited for a gig at The Beach Road Hotel to perform together for the first time since Dave Kyle departed the band in 1994.

Chaplin played the leading man and Edna Purviance played Carmen. The film is a parody of Cecil B. DeMille's Carmen 1915, which was itself an interpretation of the popular novella Carmen by Prosper M√©rim√©e. Chaplin's original version was a tightly paced two-reeler, but in 1916 after he had moved to Mutual, Essanay reworked the film into a four-reel version called A Burlesque on Carmen, or Charlie Chaplin's Burlesque on Carmen, adding discarded footage and new scenes involving a subplot about a gypsy character played by Ben Turpin. This longer version was deeply flawed in pacing and continuity, and not representative of Chaplin's initial conception. Chaplin sued Essanay but failed to stop the distribution of the longer version; Essanay's tampering with this and other of his films contributed significantly to Chaplin's bitterness about his time there. The presence of Essanay's badly redone version is likely the reason that A Burlesque on Carmen is among the least known of Chaplin's early works. Historian Ted Okuda calls the two-reel original version the best film of Chaplin's Essanay period, but derides the longer version as the worst. Further reissues followed, for instance a synchronized sound version in 1928 by Quality Amusement Corporation. It was re-edited from the 1916 Essanay reissue, with a newly shot introduction written by newspaper columnist Duke Bakrak. This version, with rewritten title cards, poor sequencing, and \\"fuzzy\\" in appearance from generation loss, can be found today on some budget home video releases. Film preservationist David Shepard studied Chaplin's court transcripts and other evidence to more closely reproduce the original Chaplin cut. This version was released on DVD by Image Entertainment in 1999 and has since been restored a second time in HD. ==Background== The story of Carmen was very popular in the 1910s, and two films under this title were released earlier in 1915. One was directed by Raoul Walsh, in which stage actress Theda Bara played Carmen, and the other by Cecil B. DeMille, in which the part was played by opera star Geraldine Farrar. DeMille's film received positive reviews but Chaplin thought it was ripe for parody. ==Synopsis== 1916 advertisement Carmen, a gypsy seductress is sent to convince Darn Hosiery, the goofy officer in charge of guarding one of the entrances to the city of Sevilla, to allow a smuggling run. She first tries to bribe him but he takes the money and refused to let the smuggled goods in. She then invites him to Lillas Pastia's inn where she seduces him. After a fight at the tobacco factory where Carmen works, he has to arrest her but later lets her escape. At Lillas Pastia's inn, he kills an officer who is also in love with her and has to go into hiding and he joins the gang of smugglers. Carmen meets the famous toreador Escamillo and falls in love with him. She accompanies him to a bullfight but Darn Hosiery waits for her and when she tells him that she no longer loves him, he stabs her to death. But it is not for real, Chaplin shows that the knife was fake and both smile at the camera. ==Review== In reviewing the four-reel version of this film that Essanay released in April 1916, four months after Chaplin's contract had expired with the studio, Julian Johnson of Photoplay panned the lengthy re-release of this comedy. Johnson declared, \\"In two reels this would be a characteristic Chaplin uproar. Four reels is watering the cream.\\" ==Cast== Purviance and Chaplin * Charles Chaplin - Darn Hosiery * Edna Purviance - Carmen * Jack Henderson - Lillas Pastia * Leo White - Morales, Officer of the Guard * John Rand - Escamillo the Toreador * May White - Frasquita * Bud Jamison - Soldier of the Guard * Lawrence A. Bowes - Gypsy * Frank J. Coleman - Soldier ==Production== In his sequencing, Chaplin followed closely the structure of the DeMille production, using very similar sets and costumes, and he used Riesenfeld's music. At the end, Chaplin indulges in an early example of breaking the fourth wall, turning to the camera to show laughingly that his character had not really killed Carmen. The film was released as a two-reeler at the end of 1915, when Chaplin's contract with Essanay Studios was up. After he had left, the studio added two reels' worth of non-Chaplin material and re-released the film in 1916. ==Music== A Burlesque on Carmen, as produced in 1999 by David Shepard. David Shepard's 1999 restoration was released with a Robert Israel score, based on Bizet's music. A score was commissioned from Timothy Brock by Teatro de la Zarzuela de Madrid, and released in 2013 by the Cineteca di Bologna and Lobster Films for their Chaplin Essanay Project restoration. Brock also based his score on the opera by Bizet, but performed in a 1920s style. Both versions have been released numerous times on home video. ==References‚Äì reissue version with Ben Turpin *A Burlesque on Carmen at SilentEra *A Burlesque on Carmen at Brenton Film Category:1915 films Category:1915 short films Category:1915 comedy films Category:American comedy films Category:American films Category:American silent short films Category:Short films directed by Charlie Chaplin Category:American black-and-white films Category:American parody films Category:Films based on Carmen Category:Films set in Spain Category:Films set in the 19th century Category:Essanay Studios films Category:Articles containing video clips Category:American silent feature films Category:Romani films Category:Bullfighting films ","title":"A Burlesque on Carmen"},{"id":"2560811","text":"Targ is a 1980 shoot 'em up arcade game by Exidy depicting vehicular combat in a future world.

A port of Targ was developed for the Atari 2600 by CBS Games, but was never released. ==Gameplay== Screenshot The locale, described by the game cabinet as \\"The Crystal City\\", is a simple 10x10 grid of roads demarcated by rectangular buildings. The player, piloting the Wummel, which looks like a small green car, maneuvers through the maze trying to shoot enemies and avoid collisions. Most of the enemies consist of angry- looking red wedges, or \\"Targs\\". Occasionally, a small cyan-colored \\"Spectar Smuggler\\" appears; shooting it scores a significant bonus. When all enemies are destroyed, a bonus is awarded and a new round starts. If the player takes too long to clear the board, the Targs's speed increases until they are traveling faster than the Wummel. None of the enemies shoot back. Their sole means of killing the player is ramming in to him. Despite this, the game is quite challenging. ==Reception== Electronic Games in 1983 stated that Targ had \\"one of the most unique approaches to the maze-chase contest\\". ==Legacy== Attack Force for the TRS-80 is a clone of Targ released by Big Five Software in 1980.

Inspired by the fatal shooting on 17 April 1984 of WPC Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan embassy in London, Winner wrote a letter to the editor of The Times newspaper suggesting a memorial be erected in Fletcher's honour. After receiving donations from members of the public, Winner established the trust on 3 May 1984. ==Memorials== PC Brian Bishop The first Police Memorial Trust memorial was erected for Fletcher and was unveiled at St James's Square in London by the then prime minister Margaret Thatcher on 1 February 1985. The trust's third memorial, and the first to be erected outside London, was sited at the seafront at Frinton-on-Sea, Essex, where PC Brian Bishop was fatally shot by an armed robber on 22 August 1984. Bishop's memorial was unveiled by the then home secretary Douglas Hurd, on 19 February 1986. The most recent memorial was unveiled by the then prime minister Gordon Brown in Luton on 3 October 2008 to mark the site of the fatal stabbing of PC Jonathan Henry.

Both the Continental Navy, started in 1775, and the United States Navy created by the United States Congress, in 1796, had just two commissioned ranks, lieutenant and captain. Master commandant, who would command smaller vessels, was used, unofficially, as early as 1799. The rank was made official in 1806. The name of the rank was changed to commander\\" in 1837. The early U.S. Navy had three \\"grades\\" of officer who were typically placed in charge of warships: captain; master commandant; and lieutenant, commanding (which was not a distinct rank, but a title given to an ordinary lieutenant). That structure remains largely in place in the modern American Navy, with the distinct ranks of captain, commander, and lieutenant commander. Master commandant was roughly equivalent to the Royal Navy rank of master and commander, which itself was shortened to \\"commander\\" in 1794. When he was in command of a ship, such as a sloop or brig, a master commandant would be addressed as \\"captain\\" by the sailors on board. Contemporary paintings show a master commandant's uniform main difference from a captain's uniform was that while a Captain wore an epaulet on each shoulder a master commandant's uniform had a single epaulet on the right shoulder, and a lieutenant commandant wore a single epaulet on the left shoulder. American naval hero Stephen Decatur notably never held the rank of master commandant. After leading a daring raid to destroy the captured U.S. frigate in Tripoli Harbor in 1804, Decatur returned to the U.S. as a national hero and was given a direct promotion from lieutenant to captain. Also in 1804, Master Commandant Richard Somers led a dozen volunteer sailors on USS Intrepid‚Äîloaded with explosives‚Äîtoward the pirate fleet in the harbor of Tripoli, Libya. In 1825 a master commandant was paid $60 per month, while a captain of a ship with 20‚Äì32 cannons was paid $75 per month. A lieutenant commandant was paid $50 per month, while a lieutenant or a sailing master earned $40 per month. Midshipmen earned $19 per month.

It is a member of the American sole family Achiridae. They are usually brown to dark brown in color, and lighter on their \\"blind side\\" (side lacking an eye). The overall body color is often broken by a series of spots and thin stripes, which can be lighter or darker than the main body color. The fins and tail have fringed edges helping hide the fish from its prey. They mainly feed on small aquatic insects and invertebrates. They are regarded as \\"trash fish\\" by recreational fishermen and were fed to pigs but they have rather bony bodies which were sometimes difficult for the pigs to swallow, hence the vernacular name. Distinguished from other species by an interbrachial septum lacking a foramen, T. maculatus often has no (rarely one) ray(s) in its pectoral fin.Munroe, T.A., 2002 ==In the aquarium== Hogchokers are sometimes offered for sale in aquarium stores, often marketed as \\"freshwater flounder\\" or \\"freshwater fluke\\". This is not fully correct, however. While some species of full freshwater flatfish exist from Southeast Asia and South America, the hogchoker is thought to be a species of coastal estuaries and mud flats. While some aquarists have kept specimens for their whole lives in fresh water, it is not known whether or not they can thrive without salt. Large adult specimens have been found quite regularly up the Mississippi, Hudson, and East Rivers, so long as the bottom is soft sand and rich enough to cultivate small invertebrates on the substrate. They spend their time in aquariums attached to rocks, driftwood, and the glass, using their bellies as suction cups in much the same manner as hillstream loaches. They are known to spawn in various salinities but prefer moderate salinities of 10-16 parts per thousand and a tempertature of around 25¬∞C. After hatching the larvae move upstream into freshwater. In Spring they migrate back downstream to spawn. They are hard to feed, preferring live food such as brine shrimp, Daphnia, mosquito larvae, and Tubifex worms. In the wild, they feed mainly by sifting tiny organisms (white sandworms in salt and brackish water, insect larvae in fresh) out of sand and mud. When unhealthy, the spots on this fish's belly often change color or move. ==References== * Munroe, T.A., 2002. Achiridae. American soles. p. 1925-1933. In K.E. Carpenter (ed.)

Charlie rescues a hot dog vendor from a thug, but deftly takes a few of the sausages with his cane. Charlie sells the stolen handbag to the other male suitor. A suspicious policemen observes the goings-on and the men realize the bag is stolen and pass it among each other. Finally Charlie presents it as a gift to the other female and receives an affectionate embrace. The bag's original owner becomes angry with her suitor for permitting her bag to be stolen. The suitor is rejected and reacts hyper-dramatically. He intends to drown himself in the park's lake and asks Charlie to assist him. He presents his behind as a target and Charlie gladly kicks him into the pond. Shortly thereafter he also kicks the other girl's suitor into the pond along with the park policeman. ==Review== A reviewer from Bioscope wrote, \\"The one and only Charlie is seen to the best advantage in this riotous farce which is as wildly funny as it is absurd.

In his book A Visual Dictionary of Architecture, Francis D. K. Ching defines a knee wall as \\"a short wall supporting rafters at some intermediate position along their length.\\" The knee wall provides support to rafters which therefore need not be large enough to span from the ridge to the eaves. Typically the knee wall is covered with plaster or gypsum board, enclosing the useful part of the attic space (not necessarily high enough for a person to stand up), while the remaining small space under the eaves is only useful for storage. The term is derived from the association with the vertical location of the human knee. Knee walls are common in old houses in which the ceiling on the top floor is an attic, i.e. the ceiling is the underside of the roof and slopes down on one or more sides. ==See also== * Sleeper wall ‚Äì a short wall used to support floor joists of a ground floor ==References== Category:Types of wall Category:Building engineering ","title":"Knee wall"},{"id":"2560847","text":"Intrahepatic bile ducts compose the outflow system of exocrine bile product from the liver.

It was first serialized in the magazine Pilote, issues 469‚Äì491, in 1968, and translated into English in 1976. ==Plot summary== The story introduces Chief Whosemoralsarelastix, the chief of a neighboring Gaulish village: a miser who often does business with the Romans. When the Romans levy new taxes, Whosemoralsarelastix asks the people of Asterix's village to guard a cauldron full of sestertii, ostensibly to keep the money away from the imminent visit of the Roman tax collectors. Despite Asterix keeping watch, the cauldron is stolen during the night, whereupon the strict laws of the Gauls demand that Asterix be banished until he has atoned for his negligence. Obelix immediately \\"banishes\\" himself to accompany Asterix, until they find money to refill the cauldron and repay Whosemoralsarelastix. Asterix and Obelix engage in many futile attempts to earn back the money: questioning the Romans at Compendium (only to start a riot when the Romans know nothing about the theft), attacking the pirates in the belief that they stole the money (after the pirates have converted their ship into a restaurant), selling boars (at a ridiculously low price), prize fighting (only to win worthless statuettes), acting (foiled when Obelix insults the audience and ruins the company), gambling on a chariot race (only to lose their money on false information), and even trying to rob a bank (which is empty of money after the recent tax increases). With little else to gain or lose, they take the cauldron back to Whosemoralsarelastix's village, Asterix hoping to save the village's honour by clarifying that he alone is responsible for the loss. En route they rob a Roman tax collector of sufficient money to fill the cauldron; and Asterix catches an onion-like scent on the coins, recalling that the cauldron had previously been used for cooking onion soup, and thus proving that these are the very coins seized from Asterix's care. At Whosemoralsarelastix's village, on a high cliff at the coast, Asterix confronts Whosemoralsarelastix with the onion-smelling money, having correctly guessed that Whosemoralsarelastix stole back his own money in the hope that Asterix, to repay the supposed debt, would reimburse him. Here, Asterix and Whosemoralsarelastix duel with their swords (Asterix having exhausted the magic potion granting him superior strength), while Obelix repels Whosemoralsarelastix's followers. When Whosemoralsarelastix wins the duel and prepares to kill Asterix, a section of the cliff beneath his feet suddenly gives way, and the cauldron falls toward the ocean while Whosemoralsarelastix hangs above. Asterix then rescues Whosemoralsarelastix and re-unites with Obelix, with whom he returns home. The money itself falls into the ship and possession of the pirates. At Asterix's village, a celebration is held for the return of the two heroes and the recovery of their honour. ==Notes== *When Obelix suggests they get paid by telling people their adventures, Asterix rejects the idea as unlikely to raise any money. The joke is that, by this time, the series had made Goscinny and Uderzo very wealthy. *When Roman dignitaries assemble at the theatre, Uderzo (in Roman costume) is shown talking to the Prefect, while Goscinny, on the right, amuses his neighbours with jokes. *The tax collector in the book appears to be a caricature of Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, then the French minister of finance, who later became President. Two of the actors in the theatre are named Laurensolivius and Alecginus. *This is the first and only volume in which the pirates enjoy a happy ending, and the first of the few rare stories where their ship is not sunk (though they have already taken a beating earlier in this episode). *The fight at the end of the story is one of the rare times Asterix is seen using his sword, although he always carries it with him. *Asterix unraveling of the plot is a reference to the Roman proverb Pecunia non olet (\\"money does not stink\\"). *In earlier editions, the colour of breeches of the Roman legionaries changed from white to red. ==In other languages== *Arabic: ÿ£ÿ≥ÿ™ÿ±ŸäŸÉÿ≥ Ÿà ÿßŸÑŸÇÿØÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÖÿπÿØŸÜŸäÿ© *Catalan: Ast√®rix i el calder√≥ *Croatian: Asterix i kotliƒá *Czech: Asterix a kotl√≠k *Dutch: Asterix en de koperen ketel (\\"Asterix and the Copper Cauldron\\") *Finnish: Asterix ja rahapata (\\"Asterix and the Cauldron of Money\\") *German: Asterix und der Kupferkessel *Greek: Œü ŒëœÉœÑŒµœÅŒØŒæ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ∑ œáœçœÑœÅŒ± *Hebrew: ◊ê◊°◊ò◊®◊ô◊ß◊° ◊ï◊î◊ß◊ú◊ó◊™ *Icelandic: √Åstr√≠kur og grautarpotturinn *Indonesian: \\"Asterix dan Panci Sup Bawang\\" (\\"Asterix and the Cauldron of Onion Soup\\") *Italian: Asterix e il Paiolo *Norwegian: Asterix p√• skattejakt (\\"Asterix on a Treasure Hunt\\") *Persian: Asterix va deeg-che *Polish: Asteriks i kocio≈Çek *Portuguese: Ast√©rix e o Caldeir√£o *Serbian: –ö–æ—Ç–ª–∏—õ —Å –±–ª–∞–≥–æ–º *Slovenian: Asterix in kotliƒçek *Spanish: Ast√©rix y el caldero *Swedish: Asterix och skatten (\\"Asterix and the Treasure\\" or \\"Asterix and the Tax\\", skatt meaning both treasure and tax) *Turkish: Asteriks ve Kazan ==Reception == On Goodreads, it has a score of 4.1 out of 5. == References== == External links == *Official English website Category:1969 graphic novels Cauldron, Asterix and the Category:Works originally published in Pilote Category:Literature first published in serial form Category:Works by Ren√© Goscinny Category:Comics by Albert Uderzo ","title":"Asterix and the Cauldron"},{"id":"2560867","text":"The Federal University of Surrey was an English university body which existed from 2000 to 2004.

Gale's general equilibrium handbooks on monetary economics acknowledge Merhling's assistance.* * == Money View == Perry Mehrling's brainchild, the Money View, is a monetary-financial school of thought that links the (usually separate) intellectual realms of economics and finance. It offers an integrated approach for conceptualizing money, finance and (shadow) banking, which it sees as the fundamental infrastructure of capitalismPerry Mehrling, 2017. \\"Financialization and its discontents\\", Finance and Society 3(1), pp. 1‚Äì10.. Other than most economic theories, it denotes analytical importance to the notion of liquidity as well as to the centrality of profit-seeking dealers as market makers. The Money View has first been developed, formulated and put forward by Mehrling and is now - despite still being an academic minority view - popularized by scholarsSteffen Murau, 2017. \\"Shadow Money and the Public Money Supply: The Impact of the 2007-09 Financial Crisis on the Monetary System\\", Review of International Political Economy 24(5)., central bankers and market practitionersZoltan Pozsar, 2014. \\"Shadow Banking: The Money View\\", Office of Financial Research 14(4).Perry Mehrling, Zoltan Pozsar, James Sweeney, Daniel Neilson, 2013. \\"Bagehot was a shadow banker: shadow banking, central banking, and the future of global finance\\", Shadow Banking Within and Across BordersWorld Scientific Publishing Company. around the world. === Description === The speciality of the Money View it its ability to adequately synthesize current features of our integrated monetary and financial system, which Mehrling describes as 'money market funding of capital market lending', a.k.a. shadow banking, by paying attention to both the money market and the capital market. The Money View includes elements of theories and insights by H.P. Minsky, Charles Kindleberger, Marcia Stigum, to name just a few. === Central institutions === Money, as a means of payment, to facilitate (final) settlement. Credit, as a promise to pay (money). Finance, to facilitate valuation of promises to pay. Banking, as a means of allocation of credit.Perry Mehrling, 2017. \\"Financialization and its discontents\\", Finance and Society 3(1), pp. 1‚Äì10. === Hierarchy of Money === Inspired by Minsky's Hierarchy of Money, the Money View recognizes the de facto inequality of economic agents or entire countries in their capacity to issue something called money. A privileged few at the top of the hierarchy may issue money while the rest can only issue mere promises to pay money, i.e. credit (further down the hierarchy). The US dollar is at the top of the international hierarchy of money. === Politics === The Money View is inherently political. Its political dimensions are manifold and include the following: * a direct application of values the Enlightenment as a philosophical movement purports (by, inter alia, sustaining from vulgar assumptions on the nature of human beings that often prevails in economics, such as the homo economicus) *ideas centered on reason as the primary source of knowledge * a recognition of the \\"difficulty of money\\" * an open rejection of equilibrium accounts of the economy (and therefore of mainstream economic thought & teaching) * a refutation of the quantity theory of money * critical thinking about the monetary-financial system (as opposed to proficient manipulation of formal models) * an emphasis on liquidity as compared to solvency === Epistemology === The Money View relies on comparatively few assumptions and uses reason as the primary source of knowledge. Generally, its analytical framework is based on viewing every monetary entity in terms of their stylized balance sheet, which serves as basic tools for asset-liability management, i.e. to measure sources and uses of funding. The Money View has been categorized by Zoltan Pozsar as 'monetary reality' (in contrast to monetary theory) because of its reliance on balance sheets and T-accounts. == References == == External links == * Perry Mehrling at Barnard College / Columbia University Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American economists Category:Barnard College faculty Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Institute for New Economic Thinking ","title":"Perry Mehrling"},{"id":"2560900","text":" MS Viking Cinderella is a cruiseferry built in 1989 at W√§rtsil√§ Marine Perno Shipyard in Turku, Finland, as MS Cinderella for SF Line, one of the owners of the Viking Line consortium. She's currently used on cruise traffic from Stockholm to Mariehamn and occasionally Riga during the summer. ==History== The Cinderella was planned in the later half of the 1980s as the new flagship for SF Line. Her interior layout was based on that of MS Mariella but with more space and additional facilities. SF Line originally planned the Cinderella to take over the Mariellas place in Helsinki‚ÄìStockholm traffic (the Mariella would have been placed on a new route from Helsinki to Norrk√∂ping). The plan was never realised however, and when completed the Cinderella was placed as a third ship on the Helsinki‚ÄìStockholm route, with departures from Helsinki on Monday, Wednesday and Friday (at 19:30 instead of the normal 18:00), with a 25-hour (later 24-hour) cruise from Helsinki on Sundays. The one-day cruises proved very popular and after a few years they were made also on Fridays and Saturdays. During 1988-89 SF Line made plans to order a sister for Cinderella, to be built at Brodogradiliste Split. The plan was abandoned when Euroway came in between and made a big two ship order at the yard. MS Cinderella in earlier livery. Notice that there is no multi-deck panoramic window on the port side of the vessel. In 1993, after the other Viking Line partner Rederi AB Slite went bankrupt, the Cinderella took over MS Olympia's place on the Helsinki‚ÄìStockholm route, sailing in tandem with the Mariella. At this time her passenger capacity was upgraded to 2,700, but it was soon lowered back to 2500. In autumn 1994 she swapped routes with MS Isabella, returning to making 24 (later 20) hour cruises from Helsinki to Tallinn. In summers 1995 and 1996 Cinderella sailed on the Turku‚ÄìMariehamn‚ÄìStockholm route, freeing MS Rosella for the seasonal Naantali‚ÄìMariehamn‚ÄìKapellsk√§r route. In summers 2002 and 2003 Cinderella made cruises from Helsinki to Riga in addition to the normal 20 hour Tallinn cruises. Viking Line decided to withdraw Cinderella from the Helsinki‚ÄìTallinn route after the end of the 2003 summer seasons, due to increased competition from Tallink's newer MS Romantika and the fact tax-free sales on the route would end in 2004 when Estonia joined the EU. Cinderella was extensively rebuilt in Naantali, and emerged as the all-white Swedish-flagged Viking Cinderella for the Stockholm‚ÄìMariehamn 22-hour cruise market. The name change was dictated by necessity as a ship called Cinderella already existed in the Swedish ship registry. In 2003 the Viking Cinderella was declared the most environmentally friendly ship of her size in the world by the Swedish maritime authorities. From 2004 onwards Viking Cinderella made cruises to Riga (via Mariehamn in order to sell tax- free goods) during the summer season in addition to the 22-hour cruises. Viking Cinderella is currently the ship used in Sweden's Kanal 5 docusoap F√§rjan. MS Viking Cinderella is the only ship left in the Viking Line fleet to sail under Swedish flag after MS Rosella and MS Viking XPRS were reflagged to Finland and Estonia in January 2014. ==See also== *Largest ferries of Europe ==References== ==External links== * Viking Line official website for M/S Viking Cinderella Category:Ferries of Finland Category:Ferries of Sweden Category:Cruiseferries Category:Ships built in Turku Category:1989 ships ","title":"MS Viking Cinderella"},{"id":"2560902","text":"Boris Anrep () (born Boris Vasilyevich Anrep; 27 September 1883 ‚Äì 7 June 1969) was a Russian mosaicist active in Britain, who devoted himself to the art of mosaic. In Britain, he is known for his monumental mosaics at the National Gallery, London, Westminster Cathedral and the Bank of England. Being close to the Bloomsbury Group, he was a noticeable figure in London social and intellectual life from 1912 up to the mid-1960s. In Ireland, he is known for his mosaics at Christ the King Cathedral, Mullingar. In Russia, he is associated with the Silver Age of Russian Poetry as the addressee of many beautiful poems by Anna Akhmatova, including her Tale of the Black Ring. Anrep was also friendly with Nikolay Gumilyov, an outstanding poet and Akhmatova's husband, and Nikolay Nedobrovo, a talented critic, two prominent figures of the 1910s in Saint Petersburg.Oxford index Overview __TOC__ == Life and works == The Anrep family, originally from Westphalia, belonged to Swedish and Russian nobility and numbered a few renowned army officers in 16th‚Äì19th centuries. === Early years === Anrep was born in 1883 in Saint Petersburg. His father, Vassily von Anrep, professor of forensic medicine, occupied high positions in the ministries of education and of interior and was elected in 1907 to the Russian parliament, the Duma. From 1899 to 1901 Boris went to school in Kharkov, where he first met Nikolay Nedobrovo, and spent the summer of 1899 in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, learning English. From 1902 Anrep studied in Imperial School of Jurisprudence in St. Petersburg and graduated in 1905. The same year he met Yunia Khitrovo, whom he married three years later. After Nedobrovo introduced him to the painter Dmitri Stelletsky, Anrep began to be interested in art. In 1908 Boris abandoned his law studies in St. Petersburg University, left for Paris to study art and enrolled at the Acad√©mie Julian (classes of J.-P. Laurens).Tate.org.uk He attended also Acad√©mie de La Palette and Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re. This was followed by a year at the Edinburgh College of Art in 1910‚Äì1911 (classes of F. Morley Fletcher). While in France Anrep had become friends with the painters Henry Lamb and Augustus John, and soon he was acquainted with English artists and intellectuals, among them Lytton Strachey, Maynard Keynes, Roger Fry, and Virginia Woolf. He also fell in love with Helen Maitland, a close friend of A. John's wife Dorelia. They lived together from 1911, had two children, and married in 1918. However, the marriage was unhappy, and Helen left him to become the lifelong companion of the artist and critic Roger Fry. In 1912, Anrep worked with the art critic Clive Bell on Roger Fry's second Post- Impressionist exhibition. He was in charge of the Russian section and presented pictures by Natalia Goncharova, Mikhail Larionov, and Nicholas Roerich. === Anna Akhmatova and Boris Anrep === Anrep wrote poetry in Russian and in English, influenced by English romantics, Percy Bysshe Shelley and William Blake. His narrative poem Fiza was read in 1913 in author's absence in St. Petersburg and gave its name to the Society of Poets, which included Anna Akhmatova, her husband Nikolay Gumilyov, and Osip Mandelstam and became the centre of Acmeism, a new trend in Russian poetry. At the outbreak of World War I in 1914 Anrep went to serve as an officer in the Russian army and fought in Galicia till 1916. Before joining the ranks, he visited Nedobrovo in Tsarskoe Selo and was introduced to Akhmatova, who lived nearby. They met continually during Anrep's short vacations in St. Petersburg. He described their relationship as a warm friendship, but for Akhmatova it was intensely important and inspired over 30 poems, which trace the passage of their affair from her early hopes and dreams to her bitter disappointment at their parting. In April 1917 Anrep was called back to London as Military Secretary to the Russian Government Committee and never returned to Russia. The same year, Akhmatova used a line from Fiza as an epigraph to her book White Flock. For many years, they did not communicate. Their last meeting occurred in Paris in 1965, when Akhmatova returned home after receiving the honorary degree from Oxford University, shortly before her death.Russian encyclopedia of Fine Arts ===Early commissions in England=== Having travelled to Italy with Stelletsky in 1904 and been enthralled by the Byzantine mosaics in Ravenna, Anrep settled on the idea of making mosaics himself. His first success was the hall of the woman artist Ethel Sands' house in Chelsea, London: a dark turquoise blue floor with Byzantine characters (1917) and the walls, with portraits of Lytton Strachey, his companion Dora Carrington, and Virginia Woolf in male costume (1920).National Portrait Gallery Another commission was the vestibule in 35, Upper Brook St Mayfair for Sir William Jowitt, showing Various Moments in the Life of a Lady of Fashion (1922). Lesley Jowitt was shown telephoning in bed, in her bath, and at a nightclub. The mosaics Christus Militans and The Vision of St.John were made for the chapel at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst (1921). Eight panels, illustrating \\"The Proverbs of Hell\\" from The Marriage of Heaven and Hell by William Blake, decorated the octagonal room at the Tate Gallery (1923).Tate Identifier ===Saint Sophia Cathedral=== In 1926 the trustees of Saint Sophia, Bayswater commissioned Anrep to execute a major set of mosaics in the sanctuary of the Greek Orthodox Cathedral. He settled on a scheme depicting the incarnation of Christ and the mystery and celebration of the Eucharist. His design takes full use of its Byzantine domes. The prothesis apse vault contains a semi-circular Nativity on its ceiling, using an individual composition. The diaconal apse depicts the Hospitality of Abraham from the Old Testament. At the summit of the vault are trios of angels celebrating the chalice of the Eucharist. The figures are simplified with rigid folds in Byzantine style. Gold tesserae sparkle between blocks of colour. The mosaic is harmonious with the structure, designed by Barry in the 1880s. Anrep was invited back to decorate further sections of the cathedral between 1932 and 1956. This includes full length figures of the Major Prophets and busts of the Minor Prophets. In the west arch he depicted Saint Nicholas and Saint Christopher with the Christ Child, both protectors of the seafarers and travellers of the congregation, a community that was closely associated with shipping and trading. ===Commissions in Mullingar, Ireland=== Boris Anrep also realised two attractive mosaics of Saint Anne and Saint Patrick within the Cathedral of Christ the King Mullingar. The cathedral was realised from 1933 to 1939 by Byrne and sons, decorative work was subcontracted to Oppenheimer Ltd, Old Trafford, Manchester. Note carefully the unconventional spelling of Saint Anne in the mosaic; it is spelt Anna. Additionally, the saint's image bears an uncanny resemblance to that of the poet Anna Akhmatova in her mid-20s.In \\"Ana Achmatova and Mullingar Connection\\" ‚Äì broadcast on RT√â 4 May 2008, the poet Joseph Woods recounts the story of the mosaics. Relevant section begins at timestamp 40'43\\". === National Gallery mosaics (1928‚Äì52) === Anrep created four colourful mosaics, which decorate the imposing staircase built by Sir John Taylor in 1887 for the entrance hall of the National Gallery. The mosaics were paid for by private patrons, mainly the industrialist Samuel Courtauld and Anrep's friend Maud Russell, wife of the banker Gilbert Russell. Anrep described the subject as a philosophical cycle. The Labours of Life in the west vestibule (1928) illustrates Man's constructive and creative nature. It includes working with electric drill (Engineering), filming a zebra (Exploring), washing a pig (Farming) and studying the diplodocus in the Natural History Museum (Science). Other pictures are Sacred Love (a family), Art, Astronomy, Letters, Mining, Commerce (a Covent Garden porter), Music (a shell and a flute), and Theatre (a contortionist). The Pleasures of Life in the east vestibule (1929) shows Man's recreations. The subjects are Contemplation, Conversation, Football, Hunting, Cricket. Girls are depicted riding a motorcycle (Speed), wiggling in a hammock (Rest), jiving charleston (Dance), swimming (Sea-Horse). Christmas pudding and Mud Pie are childish, while Profane Love shows a man with two girls. The Awakening of the Muses on the half-way landing (1933) links the themes of the first two mosaics. At the crowing of the cock, Bacchus, patron of pleasures, and Apollo, who inspires the labours, awaken the muses. Here the figures are portraits of the artist's contemporaries. Apollo is Sir Osbert Sitwell, Bacchus is Clive Bell. Polyhymnia is represented as Diana Mitford, Clio as Virginia Woolf. Melpomene is Greta Garbo, and Terpsichore is prima ballerina Lydia Lopokova, Lady Keynes. Euterpe as Lady Christabel Aberconway. Urania as Maria Volkova. Calliope as Anna Akhmatova. Erato as Mary Hutchinson. Thalia as Lady Lesley Jowitt. Modern Virtues in the north vestibule (1952) is a record of the intellectual life of the 1930s and 1940s. Compromise is presented by the American actress Loretta Young, wearing a Phrygian cap as well as a crown; Curiosity is Lord Rutherford with a splitting atom; Sir Winston Churchill defies a beast in a shape of swastika (Defiance). The ballerina Margot Fonteyn listens to the writer and musician Hon. Edward Sackville-West playing the harpsichord (Delectation); Lady Diana Cooper as Britannia crowns Punch (Humour); the poet T. S. Eliot features in Leisure, Bertrand Russell illustrates Lucidity. The astronomer Fred Hoyle, Augustus John and the poet Edith Sitwell and are portrayed respectively in Pursuit, Wonder and Sixth Sense (named after the poem by Gumilyov). Compassion is a portrait of Akhmatova surrounded by the horrors of war.Olga Stein Akhmatova and Anrep Vestnik 4(341) 18 February 2004 She is looking towards another panel which depicts Anrep's gravestone, linking together his art and her poetry. == Mosaics == Maud Russell Angel mosaic at Mottisfont Abbey, 1946 *1912 Three Mosaic panels made at the Ebel Factory, Paris. *1914 Westminster Cathedral crypt.

In this relatively light skirmish, a very small garrison of Canadian militia, with the assistance of Kahnawake Mohawk warriors, defended the Lacolle Mills Blockhouse on the Montreal road bridge over the Lacolle River at the village of Lacolle, Quebec. Canadian regulars and militia were under the command of Charles de Salaberry who had positioned his outnumbered forces together with his native allies as best he could to attempt to block any advance toward Montreal. The American invasion force totalling about 2,000 regulars and 3,000 militia was assembled and led by Major General Henry Dearborn. Since about half of the American militia refused to advance into Lower Canada, Dearborn was hamstrung from the outset in undertaking a full advance. Nevertheless, his forces still far outnumbered the Crown allies on the other side of the border and American Colonel Zebulon Pike crossed the border into Lower Canada with an advance party of about 650 regulars and a party of Aboriginal warriors. These were to be followed by additional American forces. http://www.warof1812.ca/lacolle1812.htm The advance party were initially met by only a small force of 25 Canadian militiamen, from the 1st Battalion Select Embodied Militia, and 15 Aboriginal warriors. Clearly outnumbered, the Crown forces withdrew, allowing the Americans to advance on the guardhouse and several buildings. In the dark, Pike's forces became engaged with a second group of New York militia, both sides mistaking each other for the enemy. The result was a fierce firefight between two groups of American forces at the guardhouse. In the aftermath of this confusion, and amidst war cries from reinforcing Crown-allied Mohawk warriors, the shaken American forces retreated to Champlain and then from Lower Canada completely.https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/battle-of- lacolle-mill http://www.warof1812.ca/lacolle1812.htm The American effort directed at Montreal in 1812 suffered from poor preparation and coordination. However, the logistical challenges involved in advancing a large force toward Montreal at the start of the winter were significant. After the attack, de Salaberry evacuated the Lacolle area and destroyed farms and houses which the Americans had evidently planned to use, since they lacked tents for shelter against the winter elements. http://forces.gc.ca/en/news/article.page?doc=the- battles-along-the-lacolle-river-quebec/hgq87xju Faced with a significant logistical challenge and in the face of setbacks, Dearborn abandoned his perfunctory plans and the demoralized American forces would not attempt this assault again until 1814 in the second Battle of Lacolle Mills (1814). == References == The First American Invasion of Quebec: The Battle of Lacolle River Category:1812 in Lower Canada Lacolle River(1812) Lacolle River(1812) Category:History of Mont√©r√©gie Lacolle River(1812) Category:November 1812 events ","title":"Battle of Lacolle Mills (1812)"},{"id":"2560908","text":" MS Isabelle is a cruiseferry Isabella and her sisters.

She was built in 1989 by Brodosplit in Split, Croatia, back then Yugoslavia, for SF Line‚Äîone of the partners in the Viking Line consortium‚Äîas Isabella. The ship is currently serving the Riga‚ÄìStockholm route. Isabelle has two sister ships in the Viking Line fleet, Amorella and Gabriella, and a third one, Crown Seaways, operated by DFDS Seaways. ==Concept and construction== Isabella was the second of two sister ships ordered by SF Line from Brodosplit in Split, SFR Yugoslavia for Viking Line service (the first sister being Amorella). Order for Isabella was placed on 4 February 1986, her keel was laid on 15 September 1987, and she was launched on 13 August 1988. She has twelve decks. Delivery to SF Line took place on 15 June 1989, and on 20 June 1989 the ship left Yugoslavia for Finland. ==Service history== Isabella in the Archipelago Sea, 19 May 2008 Prior to entering service Isabella visited Pori, Finland where the ship was displayed to the public on 3 July 1989. She had originally been planned to replace Rosella on the Naantali‚ÄìMariehamn‚ÄìKapellsk√§r route, but the authorities of Kapellsk√§r failed to modernise the port of the town to accommodate a ship of such large size. As a result, when delivered the ship was placed on a new Naantali‚ÄìStockholm route for the northern hemisphere summer season, and 24-hour cruises from Helsinki for the rest of the year. In spring 1992 the ship was rebuilt at Naantali with a new skybar on deck 11, new cabins in place of the former second car deck on deck 5 and her livery was slightly altered by the addition of a red stripe running along the windows of deck 6. After the 1992 summer season SF Line decided to terminate the Naantali‚ÄìStockholm service and the Isabella was placed on the Helsinki cruise route all year round. In summer 1993 she made a handful of cruises from Helsinki to Visby. After the 1994 summer season Isabella swapped routes with Cinderella and served Helsinki‚ÄìStockholm for the next three years. During the summer of 1996, instead of spending the day in Helsinki she made short 'picnic' cruises to Tallinn. These proved to be unprofitable and were terminated after the single season. In 1997 Viking Line placed Isabellas newly purchased sister Gabriella on the Helsinki‚ÄìStockholm route and Isabella joined Amorella on the Turku‚ÄìMariehamn‚ÄìStockholm route. After this Isabella has occasionally sailed on the Helsinki route when the normal ships of that route have been docked. She was rebuilt with rear sponsons at Naantali in 2000. In September 2007 the ship was again docked at Naantali. Her tax-free shop, pub and disco were completely rebuilt, and two restaurants based on new concepts replaced two earlier restaurants. Viking Line had plans to refurbish all of the ship's cabins as a part of their large-scale fleet rebuilding programme. Viking Line press release: Viking Linella merkitt√§v√§ laadunkehitysohjelma , retrieved 23. 10. 2007 In January 2013, Isabella was replaced by the newbuilding Viking Grace. She then temporarily replaced the docked Amorella from 16 January to 11 February. After that she was laid up in Turku awaiting her entrance on the Helsinki‚ÄìTallinn route for the summer season starting in May 2013. This was in case no buyer for her was found. Since the summer of 2012, Isabella was on sale on the international market. On 5 April 2013, Viking Line announced that Isabella has been sold to the competitor Tallink. This meant that Isabella will not sail on the Helsinki‚ÄìTallinn route as originally planned. According to the CEO, \\"some 10 000 bookings\\" were affected by this but they were all be compensated. Isabella replaced Silja Festival on the Stockholm‚ÄìRiga route. In April 2013, Isabella was renamed Isabelle and her port of registry was changed to Riga, Latvia. From late April 2013 until 5 May 2013, she was in Tallinn for maintenance and repainting. On 6 May she made her first voyage on the Riga‚ÄìStockholm route. In April 2014, on board a passenger was found dead from unknown causes.D√∂d man hittad p√• f√§rja, retrieved 02. 04. 2014 ==References== ==External links== * Viking Line official website for Isabella Category:Ferries of Finland Category:Cruiseferries Category:Ships built in Croatia Category:1988 ships Category:Active ships of Latvia ","title":"MS Isabelle"},{"id":"2560912","text":"Leo White (November 10, 1882 ‚Äì September 20, 1948), Leo Weiss, was a German- born British-American film and stage actor who appeared as a character actor in many Charlie Chaplin films. ==Biography== Born in Germany, White grew up in England where he began his stage career.

She currently serves Viking Line's Kapellsk√§r‚ÄìMariehamn route. ==Background== ===New vessels for SF Line=== The market for transporting passengers, cars and cargo trucks across the Baltic Sea between Finland and Sweden grew steadily during the 1960s and the early 1970s. During these years, two major carriers on these services emerged: Viking Line and Silja Line. By the time of the mid 1970s, the √Ölandian based shipping company SF Line operated three ships as a part of Viking Line. Although not more than ten years old, these ships was already beginning to be too small and held too few passenger cabins to meet the growing demand from passengers. In response to this, as well as the newbuilings recently added to the Silja Line fleet, SF Line decided to order two new and bigger ships. These ships would later be known as the MS Turella and the Rosella. ===Ordering=== The lowest bid for building the two new vessels came from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. In order to save job opportunities in Finland, the Finnish state subsidised the construction of the new ships with 17 million Finnish markka. Fakta om Fartyg: MS Turella (1979), retrieved 26. 9. 2007 Fakta om Fartyg: MS Rosella (1980), retrieved 26 September 2007 Thus, the order for the ships eventually went to W√§rtsil√§ and both ships were to be built at their shipyard in Turku, Finland. ===Design=== SF Line's latest newbuilding was the Aurella, delivered to the company in 1973. The Aurella was of a new breed of ferries crossing the Baltic, she had two decks of public spaces along with two separate car decks. Inspired by the success of the Aurella, the newbuildings' design resembled her closely although more cabins and larger public spaces were added. ===Naming=== SF Line's earlier ships were all named with the suffix -ella with the prefix taken from names of the regions where the ships sailed. Thus the had her name taken from the port of Kapellsk√§r, the 's from Mariehamn and the 's from the Aura River in Turku. In this manner, the first of the newly built ships was named the Turella, the name deriving from the city of Turku. The second ship got her name, Rosella, from the region of Roslagen (the coastal areas north of Stockholm). ===Building and Delivery=== The Turella was put into Viking Line traffic between Turku and Stockholm on June 15, 1979. The Rosella was laid down on April 27, 1979 and was launched on August 14, 1979. Nine months later, on April 25, 1980, the Rosella was delivered to SF Line. Due to a seaman's strike in Finland, the Rosella wasn't put into service until May 23 when she started sailing on the Naantali-Kapellsk√§r route. ==Service history== During her entire career, the Rosella has been a part of the fleet of Viking Line. She has served on the longest time and on more routes than any other Viking Line ship. === Naantali‚ÄìMariehamn‚ÄìKapellsk√§r (1980‚Äì1981) === When delivered, the Rosella was put in service on Viking Line's route between Naantali and Kapellsk√§r together with her sister Turella and SF-Line's Aurella. === Turku‚ÄìMariehamn‚ÄìStockholm (1981‚Äì1988) === After one year of service, Rosella was transferred to the Turku‚ÄìStockholm route, switching routes with Slite's Diana II. The Rosella continued on this route until the delivery of the Amorella on October 14, 1988. === Naantali‚ÄìMariehamn‚ÄìKapellsk√§r (1988‚Äì1993) === In 1987 SF Line made an agreement with Stena Line to sell the Rosella to them once the Amorella was delivered in March 1988. However, the Amorellas delivery was delayed by seven months, meaning the Rosella could not be delivered to Stena in time for the summer season 1988, and SF Line had to pay them compensations. In the end Stena and SF Line reached an agreement where the Turella, which was in better condition and easier to convert for the traffic Stena planned her for, was sold instead of Rosella. FCBS Forum: Sliten konkurssin syyt ja seuraukset + muuta 1980-90-l. taitteen Vikingist√§, retrieved 26. 9. 2007 As a result the Rosella took over the Turellas role on the Naantali‚ÄìMariehamn‚ÄìKapellsk√§r route, replacing her sister for the second time. === Turku‚ÄìMariehamn‚ÄìStockholm (1994‚Äì1997) === After the collapse of Rederi AB Slite, the other Viking Line partner, in 1993, SF Line was forced to reorganise its operations.

In 1999 the summer route's eastern terminus was changed to Turku, allowing Viking to give up the terminal at Naantali completely. === Helsinki‚ÄìTallinn (2003‚Äì2008) === Fearing losses after the termination of tax- free sales between Finland and Estonia after Estonia joined the EU in 2004, Viking Line decided to swap the routes of Rosella and Cinderella in autumn 2003. Rosella began a ferry-service between Helsinki and Tallinn with two daily departures from both ports, while the Cinderella (now renamed Viking Cinderella) took over Rosellas Stockholm‚ÄìMariehamn cruise itinerary. Due to high prices the Rosellas new route was extremely unpopular during the first year and the company strongly considered selling the ship. However, after prices were lowered the ship's popularity increased, to the extent that in 2006 Viking Line decided to order a new fast ferry for the Helsinki-Tallinn route, the .Viking Line press release: Viking XPRS ‚Äì a new concept on the Helsinki‚ÄìTallinn route , retrieved 26. 9. 2007 The Viking XPRS replaced Rosella on the route on April 28, 2008. === Kapellsk√§r‚ÄìMariehamn (2008 onwards) === On 30 May 2008, the Rosella replaced the √Ölandsf√§rjan on the Kapellsk√§r‚ÄìMariehamn route.

However, when the building project was cancelled due to big delays at the shipyard Rosella became the permanent ship to sail on the route. In early 2011 MS Rosella underwent a major refurbishment where the public areas were extensively rebuilt and enlarged.

Noted for his defensive skills at the catcher spot, he also had a career-best year with the bat, hitting .276 with 21 home runs. Following the 2005 season, the Angels declined to pursue the return of their free agent starting catcher, Bengie Molina, ensuring Mathis would make the roster for the 2006 season.MLB.com ==Major League career== Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 2011 ===Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim=== After a solid 2006 spring training, Mathis was expected to see substantial playing time at catcher, sharing the position with Jos√© Molina. However, once the regular season began, he struggled greatly on both defense and offense. With Mathis batting only .108 and the team compiling just a 2‚Äì9 record in games that he started, the Angels demoted him back to the minor leagues one month into the season. Mathis was replaced on the Angels roster by catcher Mike Napoli, who later became a very offensive-minded catcher that transitioned to being a first baseman and designated hitter due to his defensive shortcomings. In 2008, Mathis batted just .194, below the Mendoza Line. Mathis hit an 11th- inning walk-off RBI double in game three of the 2009 American League Championship Series, that defeated the New York Yankees 5‚Äì4.http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/2009-mlb-championship-series/15/ His impressive 2009 playoff offensive statistics became important in his 2010 arbitration hearings. In spite of poor regular season stats (.211 average), he used his strong playoff offensive performance and excellent defensive skill to bolster his case for a raise to $1.3 million, beating the Angels management in arbitration. The arbitration hearing was also something of a watershed in the amount of consideration paid to Mathis' defensive statistics. The LA Times highlighted the stark comparisons with competing catcher Mike Napoli: \\"in 657 innings with the agile Mathis behind the plate, Angels pitchers had a 3.99 earned-run average; they had a 4.86 ERA in 758 innings with Napoli catching. Mathis also caught 17 of 69 attempted base-stealers for a 24.6% success rate; Napoli, who will make $3.6 million in 2010 but is coming off two 20-homer seasons, caught 13 of 87 attempted base-stealers for a 14.9% success rate\\". Mathis had been among the AL leaders in pitchers' earned run averages while behind the plate. In 2010, Mathis was ranked by Beyond the Box Score as one of the worst defensive catchers in baseball. He also matched his career-worst batting average of .194, while posting a sub-.500 OPS in over 200 at bats. ===Toronto Blue Jays=== Toronto Blue Jays in 2012 On December 3, 2011, following the acquisition of Chris Iannetta, he was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for pitcher Brad Mills. Nine days later, Mathis signed a contract with the Blue Jays to avoid arbitration. He signed a one-year deal and was guaranteed to earn $1.5 million. Mathis made his first career pitching appearance in a game against the Texas Rangers on May 25. Pitching in the 8th inning, Mathis gave up a hit and walked a batter, but ended the inning without surrendering a run. He became the sixth position player for the Blue Jays to pitch in a game, and the first since Mike McCoy on June 11, 2011. He made a second pitching appearance exactly two months later, mopping up in a 16-0 loss against Oakland. In that game, Mathis gave up 3 hits and 2 runs (both earned) in 1 inning of work. On August 14, 2012, Mathis was signed to a two-year contract extension worth $3 million. It included a 2015 club option worth $1.5 million. Mathis was hitting .215 with six home runs over 147 plate appearances at the time of extension. ===Miami Marlins=== Mathis with the Marlins in 2015 On November 19, 2012, Mathis was traded to the Miami Marlins along with Adeiny Hechavarria, Henderson √Ålvarez, Yunel Escobar, Jake Marisnick, Anthony DeSclafani, and Justin Nicolino, in exchange for Mark Buehrle, Josh Johnson, Jos√© Reyes, John Buck, and Emilio Bonifacio. Mathis was expected to serve as the back-up to Rob Brantly. In his first spring training game with the Marlins on February 23, 2013, Mathis broke his collarbone on a foul tip hit by Matt Holliday. He was the only catcher with major-league experience besides Brantly, and was expected to miss 6 weeks. Mathis made his season debut on May 16, going 0‚Äì4 with 2 strikeouts. On June 30, he hit a walk-off grand slam against Tyson Ross of the San Diego Padres to give Miami the win, 6‚Äì2. On November 1, 2014, the Marlins exercised their $1.5 million 2015 option on Mathis. On December 18, 2015, Mathis re-signed with the Marlins on a 1-year deal worth $1.5 million. He hit his third career grand slam (first since 2013) in a June 14, 2016 game against the San Diego Padres. ===Arizona Diamondbacks=== Mathis signed a two-year, $4 million deal, with the Arizona Diamondbacks on December 5, 2016.http://www.foxsports.com/arizona/story/diamondbacks-sign-veteran-catcher- jeff-mathis-120516 During the 2017 season, he appeared in 60 games with the Diamondbacks, batting .215 with two home runs and 11 RBIs. He hit .200 with 1 home run and 20 RBI in 2018.  On November 15, 2018, Mathis signed a two-year deal, with the Texas Rangers. In 2019, Mathis hit .158/.209/.224/.433 with 2 home runs and 12 RBI over 86 games, but still helped Lance Lynn and Mike Minor to finish top 10 in AL Cy Young Award votings. He is expected to be working in tandem with Robinson Chirinos, a more offensive-minded catcher. == Player profile == After leaving the Angels, Mathis became a heavily defensive catcher who excels in framing and catching base stealers, he was a preferred catcher to Jose Fernandez and Zack Greinke, despite being amongst the league worst in many batting statistics. ==References== ==External links== Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:People from Marianna, Florida Category:Baseball players from Florida Category:American expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Major League Baseball catchers Category:All-Star Futures Game players Category:Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim players Category:Toronto Blue Jays players Category:Miami Marlins players Category:Arizona Diamondbacks players Category:Texas Rangers players Category:Arizona League Angels players Category:Provo Angels players Category:Cedar Rapids Kernels players Category:Rancho Cucamonga Quakes players Category:Arkansas Travelers players Category:Scottsdale Scorpions players Category:Salt Lake Stingers players Category:Salt Lake Bees players Category:Jupiter Hammerheads players Category:Jacksonville Suns players Category:New Orleans Zephyrs players ","title":"Jeff Mathis"},{"id":"2560930","text":"Hagley railway station serves the English village of Hagley, Worcestershire.

The station retains one of its GWR-era station buildings and its canopied footbridge, both dating from 1884. Although typical of its era, very few examples of that kind of ornamental ironwork bridge now survive and it was listed grade 2 in 2000.British Listed Buildings When it was refurbished in late 2011, the colours reverted from its former navy blue and white to the original GWR cream and salmon livery.BBC News, \\"Hagley's' Hornby' railway footbridge restored\\", 10 April 2012 The footbridge was also used by Hornby as the basis for its 00 Gauge model.Hattons model railways ==History== The original village of Hagley was a mile away uphill; when its station first appeared in timetables in 1862 as part of the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton railway, it was a rough and ready structure with platforms built of old sleepers. With the line subsequently being taken over by GWR, and the expansion of Lower Hagley along the nearby road to Worcester, there was a demand for a proper building with a station approach up to it.Geoffrey Parkes, ‚ÄúHistory of Hagley‚Äù, Hagley Historical and Field Society Canopied brick buildings were constructed on either side of the line at this time. While the one on the Stourbridge side housed waiting rooms and toilets, on the Kidderminster and Station Drive side there was the stationmaster's office, the ticket office, and two more waiting rooms and toilets. Under him the stationmaster had a booking clerk and three porters as well as someone to deliver parcels and personal luggage. There were also three signalmen at the box beyond the Brake Lane bridge and maintenance workers responsible for the track and embankments. The signal box has now gone while the building on the Stourbridge platform has been demolished and replaced with a metal shelter. In the former goods yard north of the station on Brake Lane were coal merchants and the offices responsible for dealing with livestock brought by train for sale at the Monday cattle market, which was located uphill in the old village (at the junction of the A491 and the A456). Where the sidings for coal trucks and the cattle pens used to be, there is now a private housing development named The Sidings after the site.Tom Pagett, ‚ÄúAn Introduction to the History of Hagley‚Äù, Hagley Field and Historical Society 1997, pp.54-5 ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== *Rail Around Birmingham and the West Midlands: Hagley station Category:Railway stations in Worcestershire Category:Former Great Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1862 ","title":"Hagley railway station"},{"id":"2560931","text":"The Democratic Alliance (, AD) was a social-liberal political party in Italy. AD was founded in 1993 with the intent of becoming the container of an alliance of centre-left forces, the project did not succeed, thus AD acted as a minor social-liberal party, proposing economic liberalism, criticism of the Italian left's statism, and a shake-up of the political system. AD members were mainly former Republicans and former Socialists, while its founder and leader, Willer Bordon, was a former member of the Italian Communist Party and the Democratic Party of the Left. The party ran in the 1994 general election within the Alliance of Progressives and obtained a mere 1.2% of the vote, due to the uneasy alliance with the traditional left and the competition by Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia, which embraced most of AD's policies. In the 1995 regional elections AD was part of the Pact of Democrats electoral alliance with the Segni Pact and the Italian Socialists. Most AD members continued to be part of the centre-left coalition, with the notable exceptions of Ferdinando Adornato and Giulio Tremonti, who would eventually join Forza Italia. In the 1996 general election AD was a minor member of The Olive Tree, and evolved into the Democratic Union (UD) with the entry of other Republicans such as Antonio Maccanico, and some Socialists including Giorgio Benvenuto.

She was built as a car/passenger ferry in 1972 by Helsing√∏r Skibsv√¶rft og Maskinbyggeri A/S, Helsing√∏r, Denmark as Kattegat for Jydsk F√¶rgefart A/S. Subsequently, she sailed under the names nf Tiger for P&O; Normandy Ferries, Tiger for Townsend Thoresen and √Ölandsf√§rjan for Viking Line, prior to conversion into a cruise ship in 2008. The MS Expedition has the IMO number 7211074 and is ice- strengthened, having an ice class of 1B. There are two higher classes, being 1A Super and 1A. ==Service history== ===As a Car Ferry=== The Kattegat was delivered in 1972 and placed on the intra-Denmark Gren√•‚ÄîHundested service of Jydsk F√¶rgefart A/S. She stopped serving on that route in December 1977. In March 1978 she was sold to the London-based Midland Montague Leasing Ltd who leased the ship to P&O; Normandy Ferries Ltd, also based in London. After rebuilding at Caillard S.A., Le Havre, France, the ship was renamed nf Tiger and placed on the Dover‚ÄîBoulogne-sur-Mer service. In 1985 P&O; Normandy Ferries was bought by Townsend Thoresen. The ship's name was shortened to Tiger, but she remained on the same service. In July 1986 the ship was laid up, and in November of the same year she was sold to Finlandshamnen AB, a subsidiary to SF Line, one of the owners of the Viking Line consortium. After being rebuilt, the ship was renamed √Ölandsf√§rjan (in English \\"The √Öland Ferry\\") and was placed on the Mariehamn‚ÄîKapellsk√§r service in May 1987. In 1993, following bankruptcy of the other Viking Line partner, Rederi AB Slite, the √Ölandsf√§rjans route was extended into Naantali‚ÄîMariehamn‚ÄîKapellsk√§r (freight only on the Mariehamn‚ÄîNaantali part of the route), but this solution was found impractical and soon the ship reverted to the earlier route). √Ölandsf√§rjan on the √Öland Sea, October 2006. In 2002 the ship was rebuilt at Baltic Ship Repairers, Tallinn, Estonia, where sidesponsons were added for increased stability. In January 2007, Viking Line ordered a replacement for her to be delivered in summer 2009, codenamed Viking ADCC. On 23 October 2007, the √Ölandsf√§rjan touched the bottom near Mariehamn. Passengers were readied for evacuation, but an inspection of the ship revealed no major damage and she was able to continue to Mariehamn under her own power, arriving some 30 minutes behind schedule.

Aker Yards subsequently drew up plans for the conversion and refurbishment of the vessel, and on 10 September 2008 the conversion contract was signed between Aker Yards and Gap Adventures. The conversion cost thirteen million dollars.https://www.gadventures.co.uk/travel-styles/cruising/expedition- cruises/why/ The Expedition then re-entered service on 4 January 2009, re- launching GAP's polar cruise program which had been halted due to the sinking of their previous ship, Explorer. MS Expedition was formally christened at Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, Canary Islands 0n 11 October 2010. Between June and September 2009 the Expedition was chartered to Spitsbergen Travel, a daughter company of the Norway-based Hurtigruten, for week-long cruises around Spitsbergen. Following this, she underwent further repair work in Las Palmas, Gran Canaria after she developed engine problems in October 2009. A major overhaul was done on both main engines and at the same time there were repairs to a corroded deck, renovation of crew cabin areas and also the removal of some asbestos.http://www.src.ee/en/news/53-repairs-on-mv-expedition The work was due to be completed by December 2009, but ultimately resulted in the cancellation of much of the first Antarctic season.http://wateringhole.gadventures.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t;=11913 MS Expedition at Enterprise Island, Antarctic in 2012 In February 2010 she arrived in Ushuaia, Argentina for the remainder of her first season in the Antarctic with GAP Adventures, before returning to the Arctic in June 2010 for her first full season in the North. Since then she has been alternating between the two polar regions each year during their respective summer seasons and offering additional cruises during the transitional journeys from one pole to the other. These included a cruise along the West coast of Africa and a cruise along the West coast of South America, stopping at ports along the way. On 23 July 2012, the Expedition touched bottom at Isispynten, east of Nordaustlandet in the Arctic. Reports state that the ship was travelling at a low speed at the time and that nobody was ever in any danger. The ship freed itself under its own engine power and continued on its way.http://www.spitsbergen-svalbard.com/2012/08/08/grounding-of-ms- expedition.html One reason given for this was the buildup of rubbish in the bottom of the channel which had severely restricted the depth of water in an area that the ship had regularly travelled through. In November 2014, several trips had to be cancelled when her port engine failed unexpectedly whilst the ship was berthed in Ushuaia, Argentina. This was fully repaired and trips are now running again normally.http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g1-i12337-k3784364-o320-MS_EXPEDITION_Antarctica_cruise- Antarctic_Adventures.html However, at the end of the 2015 Arctic season, she is due to have both engines replaced. In November, 2015 two trips were cancelled because of delays in the shipyard in Italy.http://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g1-i12337-k8995429-o30-Dealing_with_last_minutes_trip_cancellation- Antarctic_Adventures.html ==MS Expedition Tours== ===Arctic tours=== The 2015 Arctic season typically includes three different types of tour. The first starts in Edinburgh, Scotland and visits the Orkneys, travels the Norwegian coast and then finishes at Longyearbyen, Spitsbergen. Following tours circumnavigate the islands of Svalbard, starting and finishing at Longyearbyen. The final tour of the season travels from Longyearbyen to Greenland and finishes in Reykjavik, Iceland. ===Antarctic tours=== The Antarctic season includes various tours starting at either Ushuaia, Argentina or Montevideo, Uruguay, crossing the Drake Passage and travelling along the Antarctic Peninsula, visiting the South Shetland Islands, the Weddell Sea, the Falkland Islands and South Georgia. ==Cruising Style== The ship carries a maximum of 134 passengers and travels the polar regions with a number of on- board guides and scientific experts/lecturers in relevant fields. Numerous trips ashore are arranged to see the landscapes, geology, flora and fauna, by using 12-man Zodiac inflatable boats. In the Arctic, the guides are armed and trained in the use of flare guns and rifles, due to the possibility of polar bear encounters and are in constant radio contact with the ship and each other. The ship contains a heated Mudroom in which boots and clothing can be stored after excursions, enabling anything wet to dry out quickly. On board, there are viewing platforms, a bar and restaurant, five different standards of cabin (all en-suite) and a lounge big enough to accommodate all passengers in which lectures and presentations can be given. Live evening entertainment is provided in the Polar Bear Bar. There is also a gym, sauna, library, computer room and a gift shop. Passengers can also keep in touch with the outside world via a satellite-linked internet/phone system. ==References== ==External links== * G Adventures official website Category:Ferries of Finland Category:Ships built in Helsing√∏r Category:1972 ships ","title":"MS Expedition"},{"id":"2560937","text":"HeR Interactive is a video game company based in Bellevue, Washington.

They follow the orders of villain Shredder, leader of the Foot Clan. Their names are both derived from genres of music: bebop is a style of jazz; while rocksteady is a Jamaican music style, a precursor to reggae. ==Character creation== The characters were designed by Peter Laird while negotiating the Turtles action figure deal with Playmates Toys, because they wanted more characters to release. They were added into the 1987 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated television series and given names, personalities and an origin story by writer David Wise, based on instructions by Fred Wolf to \\"put more mutants in the series\\". ==Transition to comic books and publication history== ===Archie Comics=== Rocksteady and Bebop were featured in the comic book series Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures, with similar origins and dimwittedness. As told in the cartoon, they were street gang members mutated by the Shredder to help him defeat the turtles. As the series progressed, the animal side of Bebop and Rocksteady surfaced as they dreamed and longed for the 'old days' when they were just animals in the wild (Rocksteady in particular had dreams where he was a real rhino in the wild). When the Shredder and his bunch were defeated by the TMNT in the 'Final Conflict' (issue #13), Rocksteady and Bebop were banished to an Eden World, a huge paradise planet in Dimension X full of wilderness and natural wildlife, without any humans or similar to disrupt their peace, and they enjoyed it. In issues #23-#25, Krang, who was banished to the toxic waste dump planet Morbus for exiled criminals, befriended two other criminals, Slash and Bellybomb. The group stole a spaceship and headed to Earth and happened to stop along the way at the same Eden World Bebop and Rocksteady inhabited. Being bored of Paradise, Rocksteady and Bebop joined them on the trip back to Earth. However, rather than battle the turtles, the pair left Krang and the villains to fight the turtles and wandered the streets of New York City on their own. They robbed a clothing store to get clothes similar to their original attire. They then robbed a gun store for some guns. They then went to the zoo and blasted all the cages, setting all the animals free. Just as the turtles managed to defeat Krang (who had taken over Shredder's body), Rocksteady and Bebop arrived with guns and all the zoo animals, intending to take them back to the same Eden World. The turtles surrendered and let Bebop and Rocksteady escape in the spaceship with the animals. Leonardo asked them to take the defeated Krang and Bellybomb with them back to Morbus in Dimension X (Slash had already left the scene and was wandering the city). Bebop and Rocksteady did as asked and bid the Ninja Turtles farewell. The final panel of #25 shows the two mutants removing their clothes and going back to their simple life in the wilds of the Eden World. Bebop and Rocksteady maintained the abilities they demonstrated in the cartoon including their superhuman strength. After the initial mini series, the duo seemed to become even less intelligent than their cartoon versions. In Archie Comics's Sonic Universe #29 (June 2011), Bebop and Rocksteady are seen in the Zone Jail, ready to bully Sonic the Hedgehog's evil counterpart Scourge, who was reading \\"How Not to Be Seen\\". ===IDW Comics=== Bebop and Rocksteady are shown in their human forms in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Micro Series #1 (December 2011). They work alongside an Arctic fox mutant named Alopex and appear mutated in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #25 (August 2013). Their back story is told in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Villains Micro-Series #7 (October 2013). In this version, they fully understood the implications of their mutation, having successfully fought and defeated all other candidates for the right after being defeated by the Turtles as humans. It is revealed in the micro-series that having been kicked out of gangs in the past owing to their incompetence, they are fanatically determined to remain in the Foot Clan. They were ordered by Shredder to kill Donatello, which they carried out. Rocksteady smashed Donatello's shell with a sledgehammer, leaving the Turtle in a pool of blood. However, Donatello clung to lifelong enough for his consciousness to be temporarily transferred into the robot Metalhead while his turtle body was being restored.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW) #43-44: \\"Attack on Technodrome\\" Parts 3 & 4 After Shredder's death in issue #50, Bebop and Rocksteady desert the Foot and, after inadvertently coming into contact with Savanti Romero and his stolen Time Scepter, wreak so much havoc across the multiverse that all reality is pushed to the brink of obliteration; the Turtles and their time mistress friend Renet just barely manage to avert that catastrophe.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW): Bebop and Rocksteady Destroy Everything #1-4 (June 2016) ==In other media== ===Television=== ====Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987‚Äì1996)==== Rocksteady and Bebop in the original 1987 animated series. Bebop (voiced by Barry Gordon in most appearances, Greg Berg in some 1989 episodes) and Rocksteady (voiced by Cam Clarke) were introduced in the series as part of a human street gang in New York City that was employed by Shredder. Rocksteady was a short and stocky blond Caucasian man (who sported army camouflage pants that would be replaced with simple beige cargo pants later while also occasionally sporting a strong army helmet on his head in his mutated form). Bebop was a taller African American man with a purple mohawk. With the other members of their gang, they were sent out to stop a Channel 6 reporter named April O'Neil from doing a report about crime in the city. April ran down into the sewers while being chased by the street gang and met the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, who then defeated the gang in a fight. After this humiliating setback, The Shredder developed a plan to defeat the Turtles by mutating members of the street gang that Rocksteady and Bebop are a part of so that they would have abilities greater than the Turtles'. Rocksteady and Bebop both volunteered to undergo the procedure first (though neither was particularly aware of what it would entail) with the promise that it would allow them to exact revenge on the Turtles. As the result of being brought into contact with a common warthog and a black rhinoceros that Shredder had abducted from the zoo, Bebop mutated into a humanoid mutant warthog while Rocksteady mutated into a humanoid mutant black rhinoceros. Although the transformation did make them larger and stronger, they remained bungling, incompetent simpletons and were completely inept at stopping the Turtles or carrying out Shredder's plans. Throughout most of the series, they tried to attack the Turtles with brute force, without applying knowledge and strategy. In the episode \\"The Missing Map,\\" when the two were accidentally caught in Krang's \\"brain extraction\\" machine, the results concluded there was \\"no data to extract,\\" implying that the two possessed little or no knowledge. Most of the time, the Turtles consider them to be formidable in combat (despite their stupidity) due to their great strength and endurance, and as such, often use their intelligence to outwit them rather than fighting them in a straightforward manner. But their attempts at the turtles seem to regularly fail due to their incompetence and goofing behavior, which all leads to them being abused both physically and verbally by Shredder and Krang, and the former even fired them in one episode. In one episode of the series, Bebop was shown to have kept a pet turtle, which got mutated into the evil turtle Slash. In Planet of the Turtleoids, Part 1, Bebop and Rocksteady were responsible for causing a red bull and a mole to be exposed to a mutagen-showering machine at the zoo, transforming them into Groundchuck and Dirtbag, by accidentally setting them free at the same time when Shredder and Krang wanted to mutate a lion and a gorilla (which were freed by the Turtleoid Kerma) to be their latest henchmen. In season eight, Bebop and Rocksteady seemed to have some form of intelligence, and talked and joked around less. Rocksteady and Bebop's last appearance is in the season 8 finale Turtle Trek. In that episode, the Turtles destroy the Technodrome's engines, trapping it and its inhabitants in Dimension X for good. While their bosses Krang and Shredder returned in the 10th and final season, Bebop and Rocksteady did not. Their ultimate fate was not explained, although it is assumed that they are still somewhere in Dimension X. ====Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003‚Äì2010)==== In the 2003 series episode \\"Fallen Angel\\", two characters are seen that are dressed like Bebop and Rocksteady, and resemble their pre-mutated appearances. In the episode \\"Samurai Tourist\\", the character Gen, also an anthropomorphic rhinoceros, puts on human clothing that makes him look almost identical to Rocksteady. Also in that episode, Gen is chased by Kojima, an assassin who happens to be a humanoid warthog. In the Fast Forward episode \\"Future Shellshock\\", Michelangelo falls out of a flying truck and onto another vehicle, the driver of which greatly resembles Bebop, only with smaller, more modern sunglasses. ====Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012‚Äì2017)==== Rocksteady and Bebop as they appear in the 2012 animated series. Bebop and Rocksteady appear in the 2012 incarnation, voiced by J. B. Smoove and Fred Tatasciore, respectively. Rocksteady was first introduced in the series as Ivan Steranko, a Russian arms dealer and artifact collector with a gold tooth, a diamond right eye, and armed with a pair of brass knuckles (which have a picture of the Soviet hammer and sickle on each), who is an old friend and business partner of the Shredder's. Steranko is known to have Excalibur, the Spear of Destiny, Alexander the Great's armor, tanks, a polar bear hunting trophy, and a taxidermy rhinoceros in his collection and the ability to tell the difference between a fake artifact and a real one. He first appeared in \\"Enemy of My Enemy,\\" where he met with Shredder for a weapons deal. Shredder didn't seem to trust him very well, and had the cargo searched just in case Steranko was pulling any tricks. During the Turtles' fight with Shredder, Steranko got knocked out by the weapon that was being sold to the Foot Clan. In \\"A Chinatown Ghost Story,\\" it was mentioned that Steranko would pay the Purple Dragons through the roof for the Mystic Dagger. Bebop was later on introduced as Anton Zeck, an African American professional thief in a high-tech Tron- based suit with an energy Mohawk, his dance is almost similar to Michael Jackson's moves, and armed with high-tech gadgets who gave Steranko his diamond right eye in an earlier encounter. He first appeared in \\"The Legend of the Kuro Kabuto,\\" where he was sent by Steranko to steal Shredder's helmet, the titular Kuro Kabuto. Following his theft, where he left his calling card on a glued-down Rahzar, Zeck ran into the Turtles, who stole the kabuto from him. The Turtles, Rahzar, Fishface, Tiger Claw, and Baxter Stockman fought Zeck over the helmet, but he managed to evade them. When Zeck met up with Steranko in his helicopter, they both discovered that Leonardo swapped the helmet out with dirty diapers at the last minute, to Steranko's rage. In \\"Serpent Hunt\\" and \\"The Pig and the Rhino\\", three months after the Kraang conquered New York, a desperate Steranko and Zeck resolve to capture the mutated Karai in exchange for Shredder securing their safe departure from the city. The duo succeeded, but Shredder was livid at the revelation that Steranko was behind the theft of the Kabuto helmet and that Katai escaped when the Turtles interfere. An enraged Shredder proceed to have the duo mutated in Stockman-Fly's lab, Zeck and Steranko respectively exposed to common warthog and white rhinoceros DNA introduced to their two mutagen exposure. After made Foot Clan members against their will, the two are sent after Karai before deciding to go after the Turtles instead out of misplaced revenge. They managed to capture Donatello, Raphael, April O'Neil and Casey Jones before cornering Leonardo and Michelangelo at Coney Island, the latter serving as a distraction while coming up with their mutant names from the van they arrived in. Streanko like \\"Rocksteady\\" while Zeck was not fond of initially \\"Bebop\\", the two ultimately escaping after briefly fighting the heroes over the retro- mutagen batch Donatello had concocted. They were able to recapture Karai and deliver her to their new master. Rocksteady became the Shredder's connection to the Russian mafia, as mentioned in \\"Casey Jones Vs. the Underworld\\". In \\"The Noxious Avenger\\", Bebop and Rocksteady were tasked by Stockman to retrieve a chemical known as \\"Reagent-X\\" (and some groceries, to their anger) in order for to create a mind control serum for Shredder to use on Karai, inadvertently finding some mutagen in the process. During their battle with the Turtles however, the mutagen they found wound up being thrown by Zeck all over humble sewer worker-turned-garbage man Garson Grunge, who mutated into Muckman. After witnessing him defeat the Turtles in a later encounter, Bebop and Rocksteady took advantage of the lost and confused Muckman, by convincing him that it was the Turtles' doing for his mutation. Muckman then temporarily helped the duo steal another chemical fighting the Turtles, but eventually came to his senses after noticing Bebop and Rocksteady's true nature when the Turtles rescued him, thus turning on them and destroying the chemical, which caused Bebop and Rocksteady to retreat. In \\"Meet Mondo Gecko\\", the two attended Xever's underground mutant race with the rest of the Foot and other mutants who were foes of the Turtles. In \\"The Deadly Venom,\\" a mind-controlled Karai was able to defeat Rocksteady in combat as part of a test to see if the mind-control serum worked on her. In \\"Attack of the Mega Shredder!\\" the duo are ordered to maintain constant surveillance of the Foot's base, as the Shredder believes the Turtles will soon infiltrate it. Shredder's premonition is proven correct and the two help Tiger Claw and a new trio of Shredder mutants fend off the Turtles. The two capture Leonardo and Michelangelo when they infiltrate the base once again, and prepare to dump them into Stockman's vat of mutagen. However, the two are tricked by Leonardo to create a massive mutant from the Turtles and the three Shredder mutants. Bebop also dumps some sardines into the vat with the Shredder mutants, inadvertently creating a massive Shredder mutant Kaiju that goes on a rampage. After the Turtles defeat the monster, the Shredder is livid at the two, and orders Tiger Claw to deal them a savage beating for their failures. The duo helped subdue the Turtles to be placed in Karai's traps during \\"The Fourfold Trap\\", also suffering a brutal defeat at the hands of Splinter when he came looking for his sons. In \\"Annihilation: Earth\\" Pt. 2, when the Triceratons came to Earth with the intention of destroying it, the two helped battle the aliens until Shredder doomed them all by killing Splinter. Terrified, the two embraced each other as they were sucked into the black hole generated by the Triceratons, making them among the first casualties of the destruction of the Earth. However, thanks to Professor Zayton Honeycutt reversing time back six months to before the events of \\"Annihilation: Earth\\", the duo were revived, and thanks to the Turtles of the future, the Black Hole Generator is stopped, before being destroyed, along with the Triceraton Mother Ship, by the Fugitoid in a kamikaze attack. Shredder is beaten by Splinter, and the duo are forced to flee Manhattan with the rest of Shredder's crew. They reappear at the end of \\"City at War\\", where taking refuge in a condominium deep in the woods, the duo act as bodyguards for Shredder as he is cared for by Stockman-Fly due to the injuries he sustained leaving him hooked up to medical equipment to keep him alive before Stockman-Fly injects him with mutagen. They soon are teamed up with Tiger Claw in \\"Broken Foot\\" to defend the Auman Chemicals factory from Karai as she begins to systematically take down Shredder's criminal empire one piece at a time. After Karai, Shinigami, and Leo are able to damage the factory, but are forced to flee due to being outnumbered by Foot-bots, the duo pursue the Party Wagon, and manage to crash it by removing one of its back tires with their own van's weapons, but the Turtles escape. They regroup with Tiger Claw to defend the factory producing the Foot-bots, but though they manage to capture Karai, Shinigami, and the Foot Ninja with them, the Turtles, minus Donatello, who was injured by the earlier attack's explosives, are able to rescue them and destroy the factory, forcing the duo and Tiger Claw to escape before the NYPD arrived to investigate the destruction. When their master was fully restored to full strength (and upon receiving a massive dose of special mutagen), they were ordered to seek out the Turtles down in the subway sewers. They eventually succeeded in breaking through the steel door, where the Turtles, April, and Karai were hiding. The pair clashed with the Turtles several more times before the death of the Shredder in the fourth season finale, \\"Owari\\". Despite the death of their master, Tiger Claw, the new leader of the Foot, pressed them into service once again. After the demodragon Kavaxas (voiced by Mark Hamill) resurrected the Shredder as a shambling corpse, Bebop and Rocksteady abandoned the Foot Clan for good in \\"End Times\\", out of an accurate fear that they were in over their heads. In the three-part episode saga Crossover Tales, Bebop and Rocksteady are employed by 1987 counterparts of Shredder and Krang to conquer Earth of both 1987 and 2012 realities along with eliminates both realities' Turtles. Despite the frequent mistreatment from Shredder and Krang due to their history with their 1987 counterparts, Bebop and Rocksteady earn their respect before turning upon realizing they intend to destroy the planet and consider becoming super heroes instead. When the 1987 Turtles return to their reality, they tell the 1987 versions of Bebop and Rocksteady that they're allowed to choose their own lives, causing the two to start re-considering their life choices. When Nickelodeon Rocksteady shows up his merits before he joined the Foot Clan, it shows he fought as a volunteer in Iraq, the Yugoslavian Civil War and the Congo Wars. ===Film=== * Bebop and Rocksteady were planned to be included in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles creators Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird objected, partially due to having to go through legal clearances for the characters, resulting in the characters being replaced by Tokka and Rahzar. * Bebop and Rocksteady are mentioned in the song \\"Shell Shock\\" by Gym Class Heroes, featuring during the end credits of TMNT. * Bebop and Rocksteady appear in Turtles Forever, voiced by Braford Cameron and Johnny Castro, respectively. Their human forms are also seen when the Turtles first travel back to the 1987 dimension. In a flashback describing how the Turtles crossed dimensions, they said to their Turtle counterparts that they were facing off against Shredder and the Technodrome, meaning that he got the machine out of Dimension X (as well as Rocksteady and Bebop). Their incompetence is still shown, although it ended up saving the 2003 Shredder when Rocksteady accidentally tripped over and unplugged a laser that was about to destroy him, although Bebop ended up obliterating the 2003 Shredder anyway when he replugged the same laser device all the while thinking he would be pleased that they \\"fixed\\" his machine. All this happened just as the Utrom Shredder was unleashing a plan that would wipe out Ninja Turtles of all planes of existence (even if it meant destroying himself since he was still linked to them), so ironically, Bebop saved all of Turtle existence. * Bebop and Rocksteady were planned to be included in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but did not make it into the final draft. * Bebop and Rocksteady appear in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, portrayed by Gary Anthony Williams and Sheamus, respectively.Gary Anthony Williams Cast as Bebop in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 comingsoon.net, Retrieved May 15, 2015 While Bebop's true name is Anton Zeck, the rap sheet in prison guard Casey Jones' hand lists Rocksteady as Owen Rocksteed (though it mentions Ivan Steranko as one of his aliases). Originally, they were two criminals being transported at the same time as the Shredder, after they provide assistance in Shredder's rescue and escape themselves, he selects them as test subjects for a new variation of the mutagen, which taps into dormant animal DNA in their system from a point before life on Earth began to evolve in different routes, causing them to mutate into their more familiar states. As the result of tapping common warthog and white rhinoceros DNA into their system, Bebop mutated into a humanoid mutant warthog while Rocksteady mutated into a humanoid mutant white rhinoceros. While portrayed as more competent than their cartoonish incarnations, Rocksteady and Bebop are powerful fighters but intellectually limited. They constantly goof around, are easily distracted, and at one point Rocksteady becomes completely carried away in the heat of battle and attempts to shoot at the turtles with a Mark 19 grenade launcher mounted on an M1 Abrams tank while they are in a transport plane, resulting in him destroying the cockpit and sending the plane into a crash-dive into a river. There are no scenes in the movie in which Bebop and Rocksteady are seen apart. Casey Jones later fights Bebop and Rocksteady in TCRI's parking garage and tricks them into going into an intermodal container where Casey sets off one of their miniature explosives. Around the end of the movie, it was mentioned in April's news broadcast that Bebop and Rocksteady have been arrested and are in police custody. ===Video games=== * Bebop and Rocksteady appear as bosses in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. * Bebop and Rocksteady appear as bosses in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. In the game, the Turtles defeat Rocksteady in the first level and Bebop in the second level, and then have a rematch with Rocksteady and Bebop together immediately before rescuing April. Occasionally, Rocksteady and Bebop bump into each other in their attempts to charge the Turtles, but it does not affect their energy. When the game was released on the NES, the rematch with Rocksteady and Bebop was replaced with a second battle with Baxter Stockman in his mutated insect form. * Bebop and Rocksteady appear as bosses in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project.

Rocksteady was packaged with a \\"Retromutagen Rifle\\" which was most likely modeled after a US Army M60 general purpose machine gun. Other accessories included a \\"Turtle Carver Knife\\" (a bowie knife), a \\"Manhole Cover Shield\\", and a removable belt with turtle shell trophies. Bebop was packaged with a \\"Turtle Shell Drill\\" (which resembled a power drill but with its own telescopic sight attached), a double-edged knife that resembled the Fairbairn-Sykes fighting knife, and a trashcan lid for a shield. Both retailed originally at $3.98 each. Bebop and Rocksteady saw continuous release as they were on store shelves for close to a decade from 1988-1995. Three years later both Bebop and Rocksteady were reissued as KB Toys exclusives commemorating 10 years of the first toy line. The reissues have the date stamps changed from 1988 to 1998. Both figures were reissued again in 2009 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise. Other figure incarnations of Bebop and Rocksteady were produced for the Wacky Action, Night Ninjas, Mutant Military 2, Mutation, Smash 'em/Bash 'em, Tournament Fighters, Sewer Heroes, and Warriors of the Forgotten Sewer sub lines and in 13 in. \\"Giant\\" scale. In late 2013, figures of Bebop and Rocksteady were released for the Classic Collection toy line. ==Weapons== In the 1987 series, Rocksteady and Bebop were armed with various types, makes, and models of firearms and laser weaponry from both Earth and Dimension X. In the early episodes of the 1987 cartoon series, Bebop and Rocksteady were armed with automatic rifles and machine guns, which they used against the Turtles. Later in the series, they were armed with laser rifles and pistols from Dimension X. In \\"The Cat Woman from Channel Six\\", Rocksteady carried a sword and Bebop carried a baseball bat. Besides the extensive array of firepower from both Earth and Dimension X at their disposal, Bebop and Rocksteady were also armed with combat knives; Bebop with a double-edged knife (which resembles the Fairbairn-Sykes Fighting Knife) and Rocksteady with a machete. In some episodes, they are seen fighting over a club. The use of firearms and laser weaponry by Bebop and Rocksteady help to differentiate them from both the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Splinter, the Shredder, and the Foot Soldiers/Ninjas who use traditional ninja weaponry. This is because Bebop and Rocksteady were never ninjas, but street punks that were skilled in the use of firearms and knives before they were mutated. In the game series they use a variety of different weapons. In TMNT: The Arcade Game, Rocksteady used a machine gun while Bebop used a ray gun. In The Manhattan Project, Rocksteady uses a harpoon gun, while Bebop uses a ball and chain mounted on his head. They were absent from the arcade version of Turtles in Time, but in the Super NES version, Rocksteady and Bebop were dressed as a pirate captain and first mate respectively. Rocksteady used a rapier while Bebop used a whip. In the 2012 series, Anton Zeck/Bebop is equipped with many gadgets, such as gauntlet- mounted lasers, z-ray glasses, a sliding backpack, a tub of glue, a cloaking device run by Double A batteries, a laser Mohawk, and belt-mounted laser- blasters. Ivan Steranko/Rocksteady is equipped with two brass knuckles, a war hammer, a sickle, a laser chaingun, a flamethrower, a dart-rifle, and grenades. ==References== ==External links== * Bebop's profile on the official TMNT website * Rocksteady's profile on the official TMNT website Category:Animated duos Category:Animated series villains Category:Black characters in films Category:Comics characters introduced in 1988 Category:Fictional African-American people Category:Television characters introduced in 1987 Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength Category:Fictional duos Category:Fictional gang members Category:Fictional gangsters Category:Fictional henchmen Category:Fictional kidnappers Category:Fictional mutants Category:Fictional rhinoceroses Category:Fictional warthogs Category:Fictional Yugoslav War veterans Category:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters Category:Video game bosses ","title":"Bebop and Rocksteady"},{"id":"2560948","text":"The Hanging Tree were an Australian progressive metal, stoner rock band formed in 1992 by Flynn Gower on guitar, Rohan Mellick on guitar, Daniel Parkinson on bass guitar and Emmy Walters on lead vocals. They were joined in 1995 by Lucius Borich on drums (ex-Juice). They issued a self-titled album in August 1996. Borich and Gower left the group later that year and, in 1998, formed Cog. Parkinson and Walters continued with new members until the Hanging Tree disbanded in 2002. ==History== The Hanging Tree were formed as a progressive metal group in 1992 in Sydney by Flynn Gower on guitar, Rohan Mellick on guitar, Daniel Parkinson (son of singer-songwriter, Doug Parkinson) on bass guitar and Emmy Walters on lead vocals. They had no permanent drummer during their early years. In early 1995 former Juice member Lucius Borich (son of guitarist, Kevin Borich) joined on drums. Gower later told Debbie Kruger of APRAP, \\"While writing music was a collaborative effort, lyric writing was always the domain of the lead singer, in that case Walters.\\" The band began to establish a healthy following and reputation, particularly in their home territory where they could consistently pull impressive crowds, even to 1000-capacity venues such as the Narrabeen Sands. Their debut self-titled album appeared on the Scratch M label in August 1996. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, they, \\"fused crunching, down-tuned, blues-derived guitar riffs with a rhythmic swing to arrive at a sound reminiscent of retro- metal masters Monster Magnet and Kyuss.\\" Despite an excellent self-titled album of dark and moody, stoner rock based heavy metal, a Fear Factory support, and a notable live broadcast on Triple J's Australian Music Show, the Hanging Tree found it difficult to make headway beyond their own turf and split up at the end of 1996 when Borich left to pursue a session career in the United States. Some time later the remaining members (minus Mellick and Borich) reformed the band with guitarist Paul Ermer and a new drummer and continued for some 18 months. Once again, however, despite being one of Sydney's more popular live bands The Hanging Tree split. After a break of almost three years, Parkinson and Walters reformed the band with a new line-up including Faceplant guitarist David Romeo, and quickly released an EP that hinted at a somewhat different musical direction, a combination of their old style and injections of nu metal and hardcore. This incarnation split in late 2002. Flynn Gower and Lucius Borich, in 1998, formed rock band Cog. Daniel Parkinson (son of Australian singing icon, Doug Parkinson) continues to work on graphic design and photography through his studio, notably designing the cover and booklet art to Cog's debut album The New Normal. Daniel took up bass and vocal duties with Sydney prog band Los Alamos, that released an E.P. named Burn Down. Build. Burn Again. He has also completed a solo E.P. in 2013 with Borich on drums named Ajax Prayed For Light. Flynn Gower formed a new project in 2013 named the Occupants, with brother Luke and achieved high rotation on Triple J with their first release. Emmy Walters formed nu metal band Beacon with Krishna Jones from Juice, Juggernaut and others in 2002. Lucius Borich has recently featured in bands Floating Me, and currently the Nerve. == Discography == *The Hanging Tree (1996) Scratch M *Pieces (EP) (2000) *Peace, Order, Unity (2002, unreleased) ==Band members== ===1995=== * Daniel Parkinson (bass) *Emmy Walters (vocals) *Lucius Borich (drums) *Rohan Mellick (guitar) *Flynn Gower (guitar) ===1996=== *Daniel Parkinson (bass) *Emmy Walters (vocals) *Lucius Borich (drums) *Flynn Gower (guitar) *Paul Ermer (guitar) *David Romeo (guitar) ===2000=== *Daniel Parkinson (bass) *David Romeo (guitar) *Emmy Walters (vocals) *Jason Bremmell (guitar) *Justin Leef (drums) == References == == External links == Category:Australian rock music groups Category:Stoner rock musical groups ","title":"The Hanging Tree (band)"},{"id":"2560960","text":"The Marquess of the Pazo de la Merced Jos√© de Elduayen y Gorriti, 1st Marquess of the Pazo de la Merced (Madrid, Spain; 22 June 1823 - 24 June 1898) was a Spanish statesman who served three times as Minister of State.

Within it are a number of small areas with botanical features and a local climate consistent with a temperate rainforest. == Location and description == The Scandinavian coastal conifer forest is a terrestrial ecoregion as defined by WWF and National Geographic. The broad definition is based on climatic parameters and includes a long area along the western Norwegian coast from Lindesnes and north to approximately Senja (further north summers are too cool for pine to grow in coastal areas); in essence areas along the Norwegian coast where precipitation is high and winters are fairly mild. It might include areas lacking naturally occurring conifer forests (as in Lofoten, where the pine forest was cleared by man many centuries ago) and even islands and rocky headlands with little or no woodland and forest. Some of Europe's largest sea bird colonies are located in this ecoregion, including R√∏st, Lovund and Runde. At somewhat higher elevations near the treeline in the Scandinavian Mountains is the Scandinavian montane birch forest and grasslands ecoregion. In some areas along valleys, this ecoregion meet the taiga of the inland belonging to the Scandinavian and Russian taiga ecoregion without mountain barriers. Examples of such valleys include the Rauma valley connecting √Öndalsnes to Lesja and Domb√•s and the Namdalen valley connecting the Nord-Tr√∏ndelag coast to the cold interior with connection into Sweden.Moen, A. 1998. Nasjonalatlas for Norge: Vegetasjon. Statens Kartverk, H√∏nefoss. . The ecoregion is naturally fragmented by fjords and mountains.

Winters are generally mild and rainy, sometimes with substantial snowfall, but the snow usually melts regularly throughout winter.√Öfjord climate statistics monthly 24-hr average and monthly average precipitation in mm yr.no √Öfjord weather statistics ==Subregions and species== The lack of spruce north of the Arctic circle (Saltfjell) and along the southwestern coast is mainly due to barriers such as fjords and mountain ranges, and planted spruce grows well north of the arctic circle as in Troms√∏. Common eider nest The southern limit of the Norway Spruce habitat in Norway is limited by mountains and fjords blocking the way, and also because of winters being too mild for Norway spruce near the outer seaboard along the southwestern coast. Along the southwestern coast and fjords (Vestlandet or Western Norway) is a temperate mixed forest with pine, some yew and deciduous trees (betula pendula, wych elm, linden, oak, aspen, hazel) in the lowlands and more typical boreal forest at higher altitudes. The botanically richest areas here (following the coast north to √Ölesund, often the northern, south-facing shores of fjords, and patches further north along Trondheimsfjord), even if less diverse than the Oslofjord area due to migration barriers, is considered hemiborealfao.org: Europe: ecological zones and might be considered as part of the Sarmatic mixed forests PA0436 or North Atlantic moist mixed forests PA0429 ecoregion. Some of the wettest areas in this region, where annual rainfall might exceed 1,500 mm and even 2,500 mm, are sometimes considered hemiboreal rainforest.University of Oslo/Blyttia 1998 - some similarities between the West Norwegian pine dominated forests and the Scottish pine forests ==Introduced species== The human footprint, although weaker than further south, has transformed much of the ecoregion. Lov√∏yg√•rden Old trading centre and Inn surrounded by introduced sitka spruce, D√∏nna. Introduced species include the Norway spruce, which has been planted for economic reasons in areas outside the natural range both on the southwestern coast and in the northernmost part of the ecoregion. Sitka spruce has also been planted extensively, especially near the outer seaboard, even north to Vester√•len and Harstad. Sycamore maple was introduced to private gardens and church yards more than 150 years ago, and has spread profusely along the southwestern coast, along the central coast (Tr√∏ndelag) and, to a considerably lesser degree, north to Vester√•len.Sycamore maple invasive species along Norwegian coast and fjords It is still most common near cities and villages, but seems certain to continue expansion along the coast and fjords. There are many smaller introduced plants spreading, such as rosa rugosa. However, due to the often steep terrain, forestry has been somewhat limited in the coastal area, and many areas with original vegetation remain, but are often fragmented, especially so in the southern part of the ecoregion. American mink, originally escaped from fur farms, has colonized the whole country, and threaten sea bird colonies in some areas, but have not reached the outermost islands such as R√∏st, which have the largest sea bird colonies. The native otter seem to be dominant in areas with competition.Mustela vison has spread throughout Norway ==Boreal rainforest== Within this long area is a smaller area classified as boreal rainforest based on botanical criteria. Much of the original forests have been destroyed, but a total of 250 forested areas, most of them not very large, have been classified as boreal rainforest. They are located from 63¬∞20'N in Snillfjord in S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag county and north along the coast to 66¬∞N in Rana in Nordland county, but restricted to areas with high humidity; often shielded from the sun most of the day. Some inland locations are included; these are located in moist locations, often near waterfalls. This is the main area in Europe for boreal rainforest and Norway thus has a special responsibility for preservation.WWF.no:Norways rainforest This coastal forest is mostly found at the lower elevations (below 200 m). === Botanical criteria for boreal rainforest === Due to the long history of human settlement (millennia) with agriculture and more recently forestry management, only fragments remain of the original forest. The boreal rainforests are made up mostly of Norway Spruce (Picea abies) but also included deciduous trees. Common Juniper (Juniperus communis) is also common. There is a rich understory of mosses and ferns. However, the most distinguishing feature is the diversity of lichens, some of which are endemic for this forest, or have their only location in Europe here (they are often found on the northwest coast of North America). Approximately 15 of the most rare or typical species of lichens have been named Tr√∏ndelagselementet (named after the Tr√∏ndelag region). Pseudocyphella crocata, Pannaria ahlneri and Erioderma padicellatum and Lobaria halli are examples of lichens.Panda.org:Norways forest heritageforest.org. The vanishing old growth forest of Norway More than 60 unique species of lichen and moss can be found in the area.Taigarescue.org pdf There are two subtypes of this rainforest; the Namdalen type and the Br√∏nn√∏y/Fosen type. There are also broadleaf trees scattered in this forest, especially in the Br√∏nn√∏y/Fosen type. Broadleaf trees include birch (Silver Birch Betula pendula and Downy Birch Betula pubescens), European Rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), Aspen (Populus tremula), Goat Willow (Salix caprea), and Grey Alder (Alnus incana). Rarer species are Wych Elm (Ulmus glabra), Common Hazel (Corylus avellana) and Black Alder (Alnus glutinosa) (the latter only in the southern part of the area). The climate is also warm, and ya. == Fauna == In the last decades, the red deer has migrated further north along the coast and also further inland. There are a large number of species of migrating birds in this ecoregion, as well as some that stay all year. Larger herbivore animals are moose and red deer (the latter only south of the Arctic circle), as well as the smaller roe deer. Reindeer might occasionally come down to the coast north of Trondheimsfjord, but they usually stay at the highlands outside this ecoregion. Predators are few, as they have been hunted by man for centuries, exterminating brown bear and grey wolf in the coastal area. In some areas, they roam further inland in the taiga ecoregion, and might on rare occasions get closer to the coast. Red fox and the sea eagle are common predators in the area, the latter now being very common after decades of protection. There are also some lynx, mostly in the northern part. Hares, otters are common and one can even see european beavers although more rarely. There are also some amphibians including the common frog and the smooth newt; the european viper can be seen south of the Arctic circle. == See also == Flakstad√∏ya, Lofoten, in late September *List of ecoregions in Europe *Scandinavian montane birch forest and grasslands *Scandinavian and Russian taiga *Sarmatic mixed forests *Vegetation of Norway *Temperate coniferous forests == External links == *Abstract descripting article about lichens in Norwegian coastal rainforest *Image *Image - lichens == References == Category:Temperate coniferous forests Category:Ecoregions of Europe Category:Ecoregions of Norway Category:Forests and woodlands of Norway Category:Forests of Norway Category:Geography of Scandinavia Category:Scandinavia Category:Palearctic ecoregions ","title":"Scandinavian coastal conifer forests"},{"id":"2560967","text":"William Shatner with Nick Cravat as the gremlin in The Twilight Zone episode \\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\\" (1963) Nicholas Cuccia (pronounced coo-cha; January 10, 1912 ‚Äì January 29, 1994), better known by his stage name Nick Cravat, was an American actor and stunt performer. ==Early life== Nicholas Cuccia was born in Manhattan, New York City. His real surname was Italian and too hard to pronounce, so he took a stage name, Cravat, from a character in a play he had seen and liked.http://www.tinacuccia.com/nickcravat.html ==Career== Cravat and Burt Lancaster met as youngsters at a summer camp in New York and became lifelong friends. They created an acrobatic act called Lang and Cravat in the early 1930s, and joined the Kay Brothers circus in Florida. The pair worked at various circuses and in vaudeville. In 1939, Lancaster suffered a hand injury that ended their act. They would later reunite. He co-starred with Lancaster in nine films, including The Flame and the Arrow (1950), The Crimson Pirate (1952), Run Silent, Run Deep (1958), The Scalphunters (1968) and The Island of Dr. Moreau (1977). He played a mute character in several films such as The Flame and the Arrow, The Crimson Pirate, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier (1955), and the TV series The Count of Monte Cristo, mostly because his thick Brooklyn accent would have been out of place. He also played the \\"gremlin\\" on the wing of an airplane in the 1963 Twilight Zone episode \\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\\". ==Personal life== Cravat's first wife, Arlene, died in the 1950s He had two daughters from his second and final marriage, Marcelina \\"Marcy\\" Cravat-Overway and Christina \\"Tina\\" Cravat, who also goes by the name Tina Cuccia.

It was developed by a small team of Internet Protocol and cryptographic experts from Cisco and Ericsson. It was first published by the IETF in March 2004 as . Since RTP is accompanied by the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) which is used to control an RTP session, SRTP has a sister protocol, called Secure RTCP (SRTCP); it securely provides the same functions to RTCP, like the ones provided by SRTP to RTP. Utilization of SRTP or SRTCP is optional in RTP or RTCP applications; but even if SRTP or SRTCP are used, all provided features (such as encryption and authentication) are optional and can be separately enabled or disabled. The only exception is the message authentication feature which is indispensable and required when using SRTCP. == Data flow encryption == SRTP and SRTCP use Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as the default cipher. There are two cipher modes defined which allow the AES block cipher to be used as a stream cipher: ; Segmented Integer Counter Mode: A typical counter mode, which allows random access to any blocks, which is essential for RTP traffic running over unreliable network with possible loss of packets. In the general case, almost any function can be used in the role of counter, assuming that this function does not repeat for a large number of iterations. But the standard for encryption of RTP data is just a usual integer incremental counter. AES running in this mode is the default encryption algorithm, with a default key size of 128 bits and a default session salt key length of 112 bits. ; f8-mode: A variation of output feedback mode, enhanced to be seekable and with an altered initialization function. The default values of the encryption key and salt key are the same as for AES in counter mode. (AES running in this mode has been chosen to be used in 3G mobile networks.) Besides the AES cipher, SRTP allows the ability to disable encryption outright, using the so-called NULL cipher, which can be assumed as an alternate supported cipher. In fact, the NULL cipher does not perform any encryption; The encryption algorithm functions as the identity function, and copies the input stream to the output stream without any changes. It is mandatory for this cipher mode to be implemented in any SRTP- compatible system. As such, it can be used when the confidentiality guarantees ensured by SRTP are not required, while other SRTP features, such as authentication and message integrity, may be used. Through SRTP can easily accommodate new encryption algorithms, the SRTP standard states that new encryption algorithms may only be introduced through publication of a new companion standard track RFC which must clearly define the new algorithm. == Authentication, integrity and replay protection == The above-listed encryption algorithms do not alone secure message integrity, an attacker will not be able to decrypt data but may be able to forge or replay previously transmitted data. Hence the SRTP standard also provides the means to secure the integrity of data and safety from replay. To authenticate the message and protect its integrity, the HMAC-SHA1 algorithm is used. This produces a 160-bit result, which is then truncated to 80 or 32 bits to become the authentication tag appended to each packet. The HMAC is calculated over the packet payload and material from the packet header, including the packet sequence number. To protect against replay attacks, the receiver maintains the sequence numbers of previously received messages, compares them with the sequence number in each new received message and admits the new message only if it has not been previously received. This approach relies on the integrity protection to make it impossible to modify the sequence number without detection. == Key derivation == A key derivation function is used to derive the different keys used in a crypto context (SRTP and SRTCP encryption keys and salts, SRTP and SRTCP authentication keys) from one single master key in a cryptographically secure way. Thus, the key management protocol needs to exchange only one master key, all the necessary session keys are generated by applying the key derivation function. Periodic application of the key derivation function prevents an attacker from collecting large amounts of ciphertext encrypted with one single session key. This provides protection against certain attacks which are easier to carry out when a large amount of ciphertext is available. Furthermore, multiple applications of the key derivation function provides backwards and forward security in the sense that a compromised session key does not compromise other session keys derived from the same master key. This means that even if an attacker managed to recover a session key, he is not able to decrypt messages secured with previous and later session keys derived from the same master key. (Note that, of course, a leaked master key reveals all the session keys derived from it.) SRTP relies on an external key management protocol to set up the initial master key. Two protocols specifically designed to be used with SRTP are ZRTP and MIKEY. There are also other methods to negotiate the SRTP keys. There are several vendors which offer products that use the SDES key exchange method. == Interoperability and applications == See for phones, servers and applications supporting SRTP. === Telephony (VoIP) === * Asterisk (PBX) === Web browser support === Usage share of web browsers according to StatCounter Known browsers with SRTP support of some kind * Blink (browser engine) family * Chromium (web browser) supporting (but not universally) SRTP experimentally since 2016 * Opera (web browser) * Vivaldi (web browser) Web browser families with some level of SRTP in the mainline updating branches from the core rendering system * Gecko (software) * Trident (software) (superseded, but minimal support existed at time of expiration) * WebKit So far no known SRTP support exists for text based web browsers.

It is a short walk from Hay, the distance between bus stops, and can be reached by walking or driving out of Hay towards Bredwardine, and turning right into Cusop Dingle. == Notable people == The writer L.T.C. Rolt lived here between 1914 and 1922, in a house then known as \\"Radnor View\\", in a development locally called \\"Thirty Acres\\". Spending his early boyhood here, he went on to co-found the Inland Waterways Association and the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society, and to write many books on transport, engineering biography and industrial archaeology. Penelope Chetwode, Lady Betjeman, author of Two Middle-Aged Ladies in Andalucia, mother of journalist and writer Candida Lycett Green, lived with her husband Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman at New House, a cottage on Cusop Hill. The village is recorded in Domesday Book as \\"Cheweshope\\". The Manor of Cusop formed part of the Ewyas Lacy Hundred and was once owned by the Clanowe family, Edward III, Henry ap Griffith, Vaughans of Moccas and the Cornewall Family, lastly George Cornewall. ==Castles== There are two castles associated with the village: Cusop Castle and Mouse Castle, or Llygad. Cusop Castle is 200 yards from the church, formerly a fortified residence. Mouse Castle is an unfinished motte-and-bailey earthwork, consisting of a rock boss with an artificially scarped vertical side. The castle was held by the de Clanowe family in the 14th century. ==St Mary's Church== The church of St Mary,http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-153729-church-of-st-mary- cusop- Cusop, although heavily restored over the centuries (and in particular in 1857; the North Vestry, South Porch and the W. wall of the nave are modern)http://www.british-history.ac.uk/rchme/heref/vol1/pp46-47 still retains a Norman chancel arch, a Norman window (the west-most in the south wall), and a Norman font. Its scissor beam roof structure dates back to the 14th century.

It is notable in entomological history as the place where the fly Platypeza hirticeps was discovered in 1899. In the Dingle is a single track road, locally known as 'Millionaire's Row', because of the large, Victorian houses which line the route up to Offa's Dyke Path, one of the popular walking tracks in the West of England. It runs alongside the Dulas Brook (forming the border between Wales and England) into the foothills of the Black Mountains. With a multitude of waterfalls, the Dulas Brook is home to trout, otter and kingfishers. Cusop Dingle was home to the poisoner Herbert Rowse Armstrong, the only English solicitor ever hanged for murder, and the grave of his wife Katharine is in the parish churchyard. His former home, originally Mayfield but now The Mantles, was owned by Martin Beales, a solicitor working in Armstrong's old office in Hay. Beales believed that Armstrong was innocent and published a book arguing his case.Beales, Martin (1997) The Hay Poisoner, London: Robert Hale Ltd, Beales' obituary in The Daily Telegraph ==Geology== The bedrock is Old Red Sandstone (often referred to as the 'ORS') consisting of Upper Silurian strata overlain by the Lower Devonian. In the upper reaches of Cusop is a notable geological horizon known as the Townsend Tuff Bed, which is a volcanic air-fall ash band. Today this is a marker used in the Anglo-Welsh ORS area to divide the Silurian from the Devonian. Previously the calcrete zone \\"often quarried for limestone\\" was considered as the boundary between the Silurian and Devonian. These inorganically formed calcrete limestones were formerly known as the Psammosteus Limestones but now known as the Bishops Frome Limestone. The rock sequences have been studied by many geologists in the 19th and 20th centuries. Perhaps one of the first was Roderick Murchison who travelled this way in the early 1830s in search of material for his book The Silurian System. He notes the quarrying and even an attempt to find coal in the side of Cusop Hill near 'The Criggy' circa 1800 by a tenant of Sir George Cornewalle. The rocks hereabouts do have blackish colourings in places of very early plant life and even primitive fishes have been found but mostly as disarticulated remains. Fish scales, boney plates and scales are usually found in pellety gritty beds. Errol White and Harry Toombs of the Natural History Museum in London looked over the area in the 1930/40s for fossil fishes; many now reside in that museum. Although Murchison was one of the first to make notes of fossils here, other geologists past and present have looked over the area. ==References== == External links == *Cusop community website Category:Villages in Herefordshire Category:Civil parishes in Herefordshire ","title":"Cusop"},{"id":"2560976","text":"Isoindene is a flammable polycyclic hydrocarbon with chemical formula C9H8.

The small garrison of a British outpost position, aided by reinforcements, fought off a large American attack. ==Background== After the St. Lawrence campaign had ended late the previous year with the British victory at the Battle of Crysler's Farm, the defeated American Army under Major General James Wilkinson went into winter quarters at French Mills, New York, only just inside the United States. The British commanders feared that the Americans could threaten the British line of communication along the St. Lawrence River from this position,J. Mackay Hitsman, The Incredible War of 1812, p.205 but Wilkinson made no attempt to do so. His army arrived at French Mills with few supplies, and because of poor roads, lack of transport and draught animals and inefficiency of the Quartermaster General's Department, it was almost impossible to supply the army in this advanced position.John R. Elting, Amateurs to Arms, p.152 Sickness rapidly increased until there were no less than 450 sick in squalid conditions in a hospital in Malone, New York and many more in French Mills. Schematics for Congreve rockets. The British defenders at Lacolle Mills included a Congreve rocket detachment from the Royal Marines. Finally, in late January, Secretary of War John Armstrong ordered Wilkinson to detach a division numbering 2,000 men under Brigadier General Jacob Brown to Sackett's Harbor, New York, and fall back with the main body (about 4,000 fit men) to Plattsburgh, New York on Lake Champlain, while the sick and wounded were removed to Burlington, Vermont.John R. Elting, Amateurs to Arms, p.175 British troops followed up almost to Plattsburgh, recovering large quantities of supplies from settlements in New York state such as Malone and Four CornersJ. Mackay Hitsman, The Incredible War of 1812, p.206 and paroling many sick American soldiers who fell into their hands, before withdrawing. Wilkinson was aware that he would almost certainly be removed from command following the defeat of the St. Lawrence campaign, and planned several offensives to restore his reputation. Most of these were too ambitious with the means available, but one objective seemed feasible. A few miles north of the border between Canada and the United States, the main road running north crossed the small Lacolle River. Here, the British maintained an outpost of 80 men of the 13th Regiment of Foot in the Lacolle Mills Blockhouse and the stout stone-built watermill. The defenders also included a Congreve rocket detachment of the Royal Marine Artillery, and there were other outpost positions and blockhouses nearby.John R. Elting, Amateurs to Arms, p.176 ==Battle== Wilkinson marched northwards from Plattsburgh to attack this outpost on 27 March 1814. His force consisted of 4,000 men organised into three brigades, with 11 pieces of artillery. The march was delayed by deep snow and mud, and he was not able to occupy Odelltown until 30 March, and begin the attack on Lacolle Mill until the early afternoon. Map of the Battle of Lacolle Mill The Americans opened fire with two 12-pounder cannon and a 5.5 inch mortar. They could not bring an 18-pounder gun into action because of soft ground around the area. The British garrison fired back with their Congreve rockets. Although the rockets were inaccurate, they caused several American casualties. The American troops had not encountered these weapons before in battle and were unnerved. The flank (i.e. the Light and Grenadier) companies of the 13th had been stationed nearby. They launched a bayonet charge against the American artillery emplacements, but they were far outnumbered and were repulsed. Hearing the firing from some away, a company of the Canadian Voltigeurs and the Grenadier company of the Canadian Regiment of Fencible Infantry also marched to reinforce the defenders. They waded through icy water to slip through the American lines and opened fire on American artillery, wounding the American artillery commander, his replacement and many of the gun crews. The Americans were also under fire from British gunboats under Commander Daniel Pring of the Royal Navy, who had brought his vessels up the Richelieu River from Ile aux Noix to the mouth of the Lacolle River.Report of the Commanding Officer of the 13th FootNICOLAS, Paul Harris: Historical Record of the Royal Marine Forces, Volume 2, p253 By evening, the Americans had made little impression on the British defences. Rather than launch an all- out assault, Wilkinson ordered a retreat. The Americans returned to Plattsburgh, considerably disheartened. Wilkinson had recklessly exposed himself to British fire throughout the action, though to little purpose. ==Aftermath== American Maj Gen James Wilkinson, was relieved of his command shortly after the battle. His conduct during the St. Lawrence campaign was later questioned in a U.S. Army Court of Enquiry. On 11 April, Wilkinson received orders from Armstrong relieving him of command. This was probably not a direct result of the debacle at Lacolle Mills, but followed a request made by Wilkinson himself on 24 March for a Court of Enquiry to rule on his conduct of the St. Lawrence campaign the previous year. This eventually resulted in a court martial, but Wilkinson was acquitted of various charges of negligence and misconduct. The failure nevertheless allowed Armstrong to promote a crop of comparatively junior officers to command divisions and brigades. Major General George Izard, who had been on leave when the Battle of Lacolle Mills was fought, eventually took command at Plattsburgh. Thirteen active regular infantry battalions of the United States Army (1-2 Inf, 2-2 Inf, 1-3 Inf, 2-3 Inf, 4-3 Inf, 1-4 Inf, 2-4 Inf, 3-4 Inf, 1-5 Inf, 2-5 Inf, 1-6 Inf, 2-6 Inf and 4-6 Inf) perpetuate the lineages of a number of American units (the old 5th, 6th, 11th, 13th, 14th and 20th Infantry Regiments) that were present at the battle. The 13th Regiment of Foot is perpetuated in the British Army by the Rifles Regiment. Within the Canadian Army, the Canadian Regiment of Fencible Infantry is commemorated by the Royal 22e Regiment. while the Canadian Voltigeurs are perpetuated by Les Voltigeurs de Quebec. While a specific battle honour was not awarded for the Battle of Lacolle Mills, both of the Canadian Regiments carry the theater honour \\"Defence of Canada, 1812-1815\\", awarded to Canadian Fencible and militia units for participation in successful engagements during the War of 1812, including this battle.

Released to theaters on July 10, 1916, it co-starred Edna Purviance, Eric Campbell, Leo White and Lloyd Bacon. This film echoed Chaplin's work on The Tramp, with more drama and pathos mixed in with the comedy. == Synopsis == The Vagabond (1916)The story begins with Charlie, the Tramp, arriving at a bar, playing on a violin to raise money and exciting a rivalry with competing musicians. This results in a barroom brawl and comic mayhem. Wandering off into the vicinity of a gypsy caravan in the country, he encounters the beautiful, though bedraggled, Edna. He entertains her with his violin. She has been abducted and abused by the gypsies, chief among them Eric Campbell, who whips her mercilessly. Charlie comes to her rescue and knocks her tormentors over the head with a stick before riding off with her in a commandeered cart. Love develops between them as Charlie washes Edna's face in a bowl and combs her hair. He makes breakfast while she goes to fetch water. On the way Edna meets an artist who lacks inspiration. Edna is his muse and he paints her, including her unique shamrock-shaped birthmark. Edna falls for him and brings him back to the cart where the two talk, while Charlie is ignored. The artist leaves and she is stuck with Charlie. The resulting painting is seen by the girl's mother who recognizes the unusual birthmark and rushes with the artist to rescue her daughter. They find her with Charlie, who refuses payment from the mother and sadly says goodbye. Edna is driven off in a limousine with her mother, others, and the artist--only to realize she loves Charlie. She orders the car to reverse and take him along with her.Simon Louvish (2009) Chaplin: The Tramp's Odyssey. London, Faber and Faber: 105-8; revised from Louvish based on the movie itself == Reception == Louis Reeves Harrison wrote in The Moving Picture World, \\"The latter part of this story shows Chaplin in a new role, and he handles it well in spite of the necessity of being as funny as possible. He would make an interesting lead in almost any story if it were possible for him to divest himself of the little tricks which have made him famous. Those little tricks still go, and they pay, but it would be a novelty to see Chaplin free to do without them in some opportunity of a reverse, or much different, character.\\" The film was briefly discussed in Motion Picture Magazine, where it was described as \\"Almost a comedy-drama, in which heart interest mixes well with broad farce.

He studied Greek at T√ºbingen and jurisprudence at Basel, and after acting for three years as chaplain and secretary to Raymond Peraudi, cardinal of Gurk, he began lecturing on classics in 1504 at Erfurt, where Luther may have been among his audience. In the same year he became secretary to Duke George of Albertine Saxony, who, unlike his cousin Frederick the Wise, the elector of Ernestine Saxony, remained the stanchest defender of Roman Catholicism among the princes of northern Germany. Duke George at this time was bent on securing the canonization of Bishop Benno of Meissen, and at his instance Emser travelled through Saxony and Bohemia in search of materials for a life of Benno, which he subsequently published in German and Latin. In pursuit of the same object he made an unsuccessful visit to Rome in 1510. Meanwhile, he had also been lecturing on classics at Leipzig, but gradually turned his attention to theology and canon law. A prebend at Dresden (1509) and another at Meissen, which he obtained through Duke George's influence, gave him means and leisure to pursue his studies. At first Emser was on the side of the reformers, but like his patron he desired a practical reformation of the clergy without any doctrinal breach with the past or the church; and his liberal sympathies were mainly humanistic, like those of Erasmus and others who parted company with Luther after 1519. As late as that year Luther referred to him as \\"Emser noster,\\" but the Leipzig Debate in that year completed the breach between them. Emser warned his Bohemian friends against Luther, and Luther retorted with an attack on Emser which outdid in scurrility all his polemical writings. Emser, who was further embittered by an attack of the Leipzig students, imitated Luther's violence, and asserted that Luther's whole crusade originated in nothing more than enmity to the Dominicans, Luther's reply was to burn Emser's books along with Leo X's bull of excommunication. Emser next, in 1521, published an attack on Luther's Appeal to the German Nobility, and eight works followed from his pen in the controversy, in which he defended the Roman doctrine of the Mass and the primacy of the pope. At Duke George's instance he prepared, in 1523, a German translation of Henry VIII's Assertio Septem Sacramentorum contra Lutherum, and criticized Luther's New Testament. He also entered into a controversy with Zwingli. He took an active part in organizing a reformed Roman Catholic Church in Germany, and in 1527 published a German version of the New Testament as a counterblast to Luther's. He died on the 8th of November in that year and was buried at Dresden. Emser was a vigorous controversialist, and next to Eck the most eminent of the German divines who stood by the old church. But he was hardly a great scholar; the errors he detected in Luther's New Testament were for the most part legitimate variations from the Vulgate, and his own version is merely Luther's adapted to Vulgate requirements. Emser's crest was a goat's head and Luther delighted in calling him \\"Bock-Emser\\" and \\"√Ügoceros\\" New International Encyclopedia ==Works== *De disputatione Lipsicensi, quantum ad Boemos obiter deflexa est, (1519) - Corpus Catholicorum, Vol. 4, Dr. Franz Xaver Thurnhofer, ed., Munster in Westfalen, 1921 - HathiTrust. *A Venatione Luteriana Aegocerotis Assertio, (1519) - Corpus Catholicorum, Vol. 4. ==Bibliography== *Bagchi, David V.

It is highly diverse ethnically, and has experienced a measure of animosity between blacks and Latinos, and a gang injunction has been enforced against Latino gangs. Harbor Gateway was originally known as the Shoestring Strip and was attached to Los Angeles in 1906 to serve as a link to the Pacific Ocean port cities of Wilmington and San Pedro. It was given its present name in 1985. With a relatively youthful population of over 42,000, it is the home of Gardena High School and seven other schools. The neighborhood is bisected by Artesia Boulevard and has two neighborhood councils, one north of the boulevard and the other south of it. A large transportation center serves the south Los Angeles County area. ==Geography== Harbor Gateway is a narrow north-south corridor situated approximately between Vermont Avenue and Figueroa Street north of Interstate 405, and Western and Normandie avenues south of I-405. The territory was acquired by the city of Los Angeles in a shoestring annexation, specifically to connect San Pedro, Wilmington, Harbor City and the Port of Los Angeles with the rest of the city. Harbor Gateway abuts Broadway-Manchester on the north and is flanked by Rosewood, Carson and West Carson to the east, West Carson and Harbor City to the south and Athens and Gardena to the west and Torrance to the south and west.\\"Harbor,\\" Mapping L.A., Los Angeles TimesThe Thomas Guide, Los Angeles County 2006, pages D, 704, 734, 764 and 794 The neighborhood's street boundaries are 120th Street on the north and Vermont Avenue and Figueroa Street on the west and east respectively, running south to 182nd Street, where the neighborhood takes a jog to the west and draws its western boundary at Western Avenue, its eastern line at Normandie Avenue and its southern border at West Sepulveda Boulevard. A southeastern section bounded by 192nd Street on the north, Hamilton Avenue on the east, Del Amo Boulevard on the south and railroad tracks on the west includes the Holiday Inn Harbor Gateway.The Thomas Guide, 2006, pages 734, 763, 764 and 793 \\"Harbor Gateway,\\" Mapping L.A., Los Angeles Times Another section between 177th and 182nd Streets includes Gardena High School. ==Population== A total of 39,688 people lived in Harbor Gateway's 5.14 square miles, according to the 2000 U.S. census‚Äîaveraging 7,720 people per square mile, about the same population density for the city as a whole. Population was estimated at 42,005 in 2008. The median age was 27, young for the city of Los Angeles. The percentage of married women (56.2%) was among the county's highest. Harbor Gateway is considered highly diverse ethnically, with a diversity index of 0.648 \\"Diversity,\\" Mapping L.A., Los Angeles Times In 2000 Latinos made up 53.4% of the population, blacks were at 16.3%, Asians at 16%, whites at 11.8% and others at 2.4%. Mexico and the Philippines were the most common places of birth for the 40.8% of the residents who were born abroad, considered an average percentage of foreign-born when compared with the city as a whole. The $47,849 median household income in 2008 dollars was average for the city. Renters occupied 59.7% of the housing units, and homeowners occupied the rest. In 1992, it was noted that the poorest part of the area was between Rosecrans Avenue and Artesia Boulevard. ==History== The city of Los Angeles annexed the area on December 26, 1906 \\"in anticipation of taking over, several years later, the independent cities of Wilmington and San Pedro\\" in order to create the Port of Los Angeles. Because of its slim shape, once likened to two shoelaces tied together with a granny knot,\\"Council District 15: Harbor Gateway, the City on a Shoestring,\\" Los Angeles Times, December 23, 2011 the neighborhood‚Äîonly a half mile wide at some points‚Äîwas known for years as the \\"city strip,\\" the \\"shoestring strip\\" or simply \\"the strip.\\" The strip was simply open fields before World War II, but \\"Then came factories, attracting workers who needed housing,\\" and builders \\"filled those fields with small houses and duplexes.\\" Cubans settled in the 1960s and Mexican immigrants in the 1970s. From 1985 to 1992, some seventy-five single-family homes were replaced by nearly five hundred apartment units, and the neighborhood gained some 1,500 residents, with \\"no plan, no thought,\\" as the area's leading developer put it.Sam Quinones, \\"How a Community Imploded,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 4, 2007 A Latino gang, the 204th Street Gang, came into existence, but as the African-American population rose from 313 in 1990 to 835 in 2000, a black gang also formed‚Äîthe 208th Street Crips. \\"The Crip gang's willingness to go to the police with complaints offended the Latino gang's sense of honor,\\" wrote reporter Sam Quinones for the Los Angeles Times. Yet the gang was never \\"rooted in the neighborhood,\\" and by 2001 it had faded away. In 1985, the Los Angeles City Council renamed the area as Harbor Gateway.Sheryl Stolberg, \\"In Search of an Identity: Area Lacks a Sense of Community,\\" Los Angeles Times, January 1, 1989 (three screens)See, for example, Leonard Pitt and Dale Pitt, \\"Shoestring Strip,\\" Los Angeles From A to Z, University of California Press (1997) . But a Los Angeles Times reporter noted four years later that > Harbor Gateway lacks much of what makes a community a community‚Äîno central > business district, no civic center or gathering place, no library branch, no > police station ... no post office. Its largest park is a cemetery. And, > despite the new name, mailing addresses of residents remain unchanged. They > still say Torrance or Gardena, not Los Angeles. In 1989, however, Harbor Gateway was tied with the Westwood neighborhood as Los Angeles's second-fastest-growing area, Sylmar being first. However, the contrast between the unkempt Los Angeles side of Gardena Boulevard and the tidy Gardena side was striking. In March 1988, the United Way of Los Angeles declared Harbor Gateway an \\"under-served geographic area,\\" noting \\"real gaps in law enforcement\\" and in social services. At the same time, there became a \\"major drawing card for commercial development\\" along the 190th Street corridor where \\"Gleaming high-rises with pleasant landscaping have replaced a Shell oil refinery and manufacturing plants.\\" In 1985, Harbor Gateway was referred to as a \\"crime-plagued area,\\" and residents blamed the widespread availability of alcohol for \\"dozens of robberies, burglaries and other crimes\\" in the blue-collar neighborhood. There were at that time 51 liquor outlets within a two-mile radius of the intersection of El Segundo Boulevard and Vermont Avenue.David Ferrell, \\"Harbor Gateway Residents Win Round in Alcohol Sales Battle,\\" Los Angeles Times, August 25, 1985 By 1992, the United Way had \\"funneled $100,000 to the few private charities serving the area, including a small free medical clinic, a job center and an ad hoc coalition helping the homeless.\\" It was written that \\"extended families crowd into single apartments, and the homeless sleep under freeway overpasses.\\"Ronald B. Taylor, \\"Stretched Thin: Public Services: Harbor Gateway, an Eight-Mile Ribbon of Los Angeles, Is Long on Need and Short on Government Support,\\" Los Angeles Times, April 30, 1992 In 2013, it was noted that one section of Harbor Gateway had \\"one of the city's highest concentrations of registered sex offenders,\\" with 86 living in a 13-block area, and so the city began a campaign to force some of them to move by building pocket parks in Harbor Gateway and in Wilmington. In California, such offenders are barred by law from living near schools and parks. The small park was built on city-owned land on the southeast corner of Torrance Boulevard and Denker Avenue.Angel Jennings, \\"L.A. Sees Parks as a Weapon Against Sex Offenders,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 28, 2013 Other than the notorious 204th street gang, Gardena 13 has also been taking over the Gardena strip of Harbor Gateway. Known for violent acts of crimes, Gardena Police Dept. formed an 18-month investigation which led to the arrest of 11 suspects, one individual being that of a triple murder incident. Harbor Gateway's Gardena Boulevard is heart of this gang. On the corner of Ainsworth and Gardena a mural of the Virgin Mary has expressed the Chicano culture. ===Racial violence=== In 1991, parts of the Gateway were known to be \\"the turf of warring black and Latino gangs, and Gardena High School students of those two ethnicities \\"clashed after a multicultural program in the school auditorium.\\" In December 2006 the Los Angeles Times reported that racial tensions \\"have held this working-class neighborhood in a state of fear for years\\" and that the Latino 204th Street Gang, \\"noted for preying on\\" blacks had warned all blacks to stay south of 206th Street. The neighborhood averaged \\"about one Latino-on-black homicide\\" each year since 1997, the Los Angeles Police Department reported.Sam Quinones, \\"Man Gets 238 Years in L.A.

In December 2006, a 14-year-old black girl, Cheryl Green, was shot and killed while talking with friends on Harvard Boulevard just south of the 206th Street dividing line.

Known as \\"Jimmy,\\" he began working at a racetrack as a stable boy then in 1930 became a professional jockey. Stout became most famous riding for Belair Stud and trainer Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons. He rode Seabiscuit in his first race in January 1935 before the colt was sold. In 1936 Stout rode in his first Kentucky Derby. His highly touted colt Granville was a victim of one of the roughest starts in Derby history, and he was thrown from the horse. However, Jimmy Stout and Granville came back to finish second to the Derby winner Bold Venture in the Preakness Stakes then won the Belmont Stakes and went on to earn the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year. Jimmy Stout won the Belmont two more times, aboard Pasteurized in 1938 and the following year he rode future Hall of Famer Johnstown to victory in both the 1939 Kentucky Derby and the 1939 Belmont Stakes. Among his other major racing successes, he won the Jockey Club Gold Cup on two occasions. Jimmy Stout became part of racing history when he rode Bousset to a share of the victory in racing's only triple dead heat in the June 10, 1944 Carter Handicap. In 1946 he returned to his native New Jersey to ride at Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport where he was the leading rider for four years. After a twenty-five-year career as a jockey, in which he won 2,056 races, Stout retired from riding in 1954 following which he worked as a race official. In 1968 Jimmy Stout was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

He was educated at Bodmin Grammar School and after leaving school entered his father's office. His natural tastes, however, were not for law but for engineering ; he was therefore articled to James Meadows Rendel of Plymouth, and on completion of his pupilage he worked for some years for that gentleman and on the Great Western Railway. In 1844, he set up in business for himself in Westminster as a consulting engineer, and remained there till 1847. In that year he was appointed resident engineer in charge of the great works at Portland harbour, which had been designed by Rendel. On the death of the latter in 1856, Coode was appointed engineer-in- chief, and retained that post until the completion of the work in 1872. This harbour provided the largest area of deep water of any artificial harbour in Great Britain, and was a work of the utmost national importance. The first stone of the great breakwater was laid by the prince consort on 25 July 1849, and the final stone was put in place by the prince of Wales in 1872, the work having therefore taken twenty-three years to complete and having cost about a million sterling. The honour of knighthood was conferred upon Coode in 1872 for his services in connection with this national undertaking. While this work was going on Coode served as a member of the royal commission on harbours of refuge, and also drew out the plans for the harbour which was to be constructed in Table Bay, Cape Town, and for numerous other similar harbour works. He designed the lighthouse at La Corbi√®re in Jersey which was the first lighthouse in the British Isles to be built of reinforced concrete. He was consulted by several of the most important colonial governments, notably by those of the South African and Australian colonies, in reference to proposed harbour works, and he made several journeys to South Africa, Australia, and India in connection with the schemes upon which his advice was sought. In 1876, he was in Cape Colony and in Natal, and again in 1877, and in 1878 and 1885 he paid visits to Australia and New Zealand. After the Portland Harbour his best-known work is the harbour of Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). He was also responsible for the straightening of the lower reaches of the Yarra River in Melbourne, Australia with the resulting district of Coode Island and the Coode Canal named for him, and the design of what became Victoria Dock. He was a member of the royal commission on metropolitan sewage discharge (1882-4), and of the international commission of the Suez Canal ; on the latter he served from 1884 till his death in 1892. After he returned from his second visit to the Australian colonies he was made a K.C.M.G. in 1886, in recognition of the distinguished services he had rendered to the empire. Coode was probably the most distinguished harbour engineer of the nineteenth century ; it would be difficult to estimate too highly the value to the trade and mutual intercourse of the different parts of the British empire, of the harbour and river improvement schemes in every part of the world for which he was responsible. He was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1849, served for many years on the council, and was president from May 1889 to May 1891. He was also an active member of the Royal Colonial Institute, and sat on its council from 1881 till his death. Coode died at Brighton on 2 March 1892. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. ==Family== He married in 1842 Jane, daughter of William Price of Weston-super-Mare. There is a portrait of him in oil at the Institution of Civil Engineers, and a bust, the property of Mrs. Lillingston, the Vicarage, Havering-atte-Bower, near Romford. ==Works== Coode contributed a very valuable paper to the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1852 on the 'Chesil Bank' (Proc. Inst. Civil Eng, xii. 520), and his presidential address to the civil engineers was delivered in 1889. He wrote many professional reports, chiefly on harbours, the most important of which are Table Bay (Weymouth, 1859); Whitehaven (London, 1866); on military harbours (London, 1875); Table Bay, Mossel Bay, &c.; (London, 1877) ; Port Natal (London, 1877) ; Melbourne (London, 1879) ; Report on Harbours and Rivers in Queensland, Mackay (London, 1887); Townsville (London, 1887) ; Report on River Tyne Improvements (London, 1877) ; Report on tidal difficulties on Dee at Chester (Chester, 1891). ==References== ;Attribution ==External links== * Coode, John, McMaster Libraries * Sir John Coode's Harbour, East London harbour development, 1872 - 1895 Category:1816 births Category:1892 deaths Category:Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:People from Bodmin Category:Cornish engineers Category:Presidents of the Institution of Civil Engineers Category:English canal engineers Category:Harbour engineers Category:Lighthouse builders Category:Burials at Kensal Green Cemetery ","title":"John Coode (engineer)"},{"id":"2561157","text":"The sooty orange tip (Zegris eupheme) is a Palearctic Pieridae butterfly that has a range that extends through southern Europe, southwest Europe, northern Africa, East Kazakhstan and Asia Minor.

The VF1000 is named after its V-4 double overhead cam 16-valve engine. There were three main models in the VF1000 range, the VF1000F (also known as Interceptor), the VF1000R and the VF1000F2. == VF1000F \\"Interceptor\\" == The first of Honda's 1,000 cc VF range, known as the 1000 Interceptor, was launched in the United States and Canada in March 1984.http://honda.vf1000.com/vf1000f-interceptor/ The Interceptor had a 113 BHP 16-valve V-4 engine with double over head chain driven cams. The bike featured adjustable Pro-Link rear suspension with adjustable braced front forks, black and silver cast aluminum magnesium rims (16 inch front, 17 inch rear), and an aerodynamic half fairing and lower cowl with single rectangular headlight. Three dual-piston disc brakes comprised the braking system with dual discs at the front and a single disc at the rear. In Europe the \\"Interceptor\\" was launched as the FE model, in 1984 and reported engine power output was increased to . Features such as Honda's dive control system (TRAC) and adjustable suspension were still present. The VF1000F was discontinued in April 1985. The evolution of the VF1000F(1) to the VF1000F2 began in April 1985 with the VF1000FF (and subsequent rare FG) model. The styling of the bike changed with new side panels and grab rail. The front wheel was replaced with an wheel The VF1000FF was sold in Europe, Australia, South Africa and Canada. The VF1000FF was discontinued in August 1987. == VF1000R == Honda VF1000RF, 1984 In March 1984, Honda introduced the VF1000R in Europe. Its styling was a celebration of the V4's racing heritage and the VF1000R was a showcase for the technology Honda had developed on the track with the FWS1000 race bike which was designed for competition in the Daytona 200 and AMA F1 class. The original concept Honda had in designing the VF1000R was that it would showcase and, more importantly, homologate all of the innovative and groundbreaking technology that had been used in the F1 class, for use in the production based classes of the time. This was not to be the case, though, as the finished bike weighed in at nearly 600 pounds with half a tank of fuel, roughly 85 pounds heavier than the VF1000F model, and for this reason was rarely used in competition, and struggled to be competitive when it was used. Many modifications were made to the VF1000F in its transformation into the \\"R\\" version including major engine reworking, major front suspension revision, bodywork revision, and rider ergonomics. The engine of the VF1000R was the same cast block as in the VF1000F, displacing the same 998cc as the standard model, but modifications were required to mount the gear train in each head, used for driving the cams. The crankshaft was also altered, in order to accept a straight-cut gear which would drive the gear train instead of the chain system, used in the \\"F\\" model. Each head had two gears held by a carrier, which was then bolted into the respective head, driving each of the two camshafts arranged in a dual overhead camshaft arrangement for each head. In total, there were nine gears required to transmit power from the crankshaft to all four camshafts. The camshafts were altered in relation to the ones found on the \\"F\\" model in order to provide more power. This arrangement added to the weight of the engine when compared to the chain driven arrangement present in the \\"F\\" model. Gear noise is one of the major drawbacks of using a geartrain to drive cams. In order to minimise this, Honda used a spring mounted scissor gear system (essentially two gears slightly offset) on the gear mounted on each camshaft, as well as the lowest mounted gear in each head (driven by the crankshaft), offsetting the teeth by roughly half of the pitch. This allowed the lash to be entirely taken up by the tension of the two teeth resting on the gear below, hence eliminating some of the noise and lash inherent in this type of system. The motor still makes a whirring noise which can be heard, as this is an intrinsic property of the straight cut type of gears which were used. The gear driven cams went on to be a key feature Honda used in their line of VFR750 motorcycles throughout the remainder of the 80's and throughout the 90's. The heads of the engine were also redesigned relative to the \\"F\\" model, with a redesigned squish zone in the combustion chamber, aiding in eliminating detonation within the cylinder. The redesigned head raised compression to 11:1 (up from 10.5:1 on the standard model) and power to 122 hp (125 for the US version), up from 113 hp on the \\"F\\" model. The coolant system was altered from that of the \\"F\\" model, via the utilization of different thermostat settings and through the use of two radiators. The lower of the two radiators had 2 fans which drew air through the radiator from the back side, while the upper relied on ram-air, drawn from vents around the headlight opening. The exhaust system was slightly altered, utilizing an exhaust collector box (directly downstream for each of the four header pipes) with slightly augmented output angles for each of the two exhaust pipes compared to the \\"F\\" model. This was done in an attempt to increase ground clearance while cornering. The rear suspension (air shock with adjustable damping control) and frame (square-section steel tube type) were direct carryovers from the \\"F\\" model, but the front suspension featured Honda's anti-dive system named \\"TRAC\\" which stood for \\"Torque Reactive Anti-dive Control\\". This system utilized the left brake hangar being pinned to the fork on the bottom mount and allowed to pivot in an anti-clockwise direction, thereby closing a valve in the left fork leg, forcing the damping fluid through a smaller passageway, and increasing the damping rate under hard braking. The left fork leg had a screw-type adjuster with four positions of adjustment which would change the amount of influence this system had under braking. The fork also featured a Schrader- type air valve which allowed air assistance from 0-6 psi to increase the spring rate in the fork. The right fork leg featured a 3 position hand adjustable dial which would increase damping rates. The fork also featured quick-release, swing-away axle clamps for faster tire changes in endurance racing. Many of these features were seen as very exotic for the time, and modern adjustable sportbike suspension can trace design roots to these features. The braking system was improved via the use of dual floating front discs and racing style piston calipers on the ventilated rear disc. This was the first used on the honda cbx 1000 in 1981...then used on the vf1000r (sc 16). Compared to the VF1000F, the VF1000R had completely different bodywork and rider positioning. The \\"R\\" model got fully faired, racer replica bodywork with rearset footpegs and adjustable clip-on handlebars. The handlebars were adjustable through a range of 4 degrees in 2 degree increments via a double serrated ring which meshed with the handle and the mounting ring parts of the clip on. Even with the adjustment available in the clip ons, period tests still criticized the bike for having too committed of a riding position, with a long stretch over the tank. The fuel tank had a 6.2 gallon capacity for the European models, and was redesigned, with a smaller 5.8 gallon capacity tank for the US models. This was used with an eye on endurance racing, utilizing the larger tank for homologation in racing where the larger capacity would result in longer time between pit stops. The front fairing of the VF1000R was split into two pieces. These both attached to a metal bracket which ran around the perimeter of the engine. The lower fairing was held on primarily by the use of 6 quarter-turn, race type fasteners (3 per side) with the aid of 4 traditional bolts (2 per side). The bolts which held the lower fairing on at the connection to the upper fairing also went through holes in the upper fairing in order to ensure proper panel gaps and alignment. On models from 1985 and later, the lower fairing also featured spring-loaded vent doors which could be opened and closed in order to cool the engine and rider during high temperature conditions. The upper fairing of the VF1000R featured a sealed air intake behind the headlight, which directed air towards the upper mounted engine coolant radiator. Because of this, most VF1000R's used in competition had the front number plates mounted on the front of the windscreen instead of in the traditional location, where the headlight would be on the road going version. This area was filled with a mesh screen in order to feed the radiator with the maximum amount of air possible. Wheels were changed from the \\"F\\" model to utilize 16 inch front and 17 inch rear NS type bolt together aluminum Comstar wheels. These wheels were constructed of a 5-pointed design which used bolts to connect the aluminum \\"spokes\\" to the hub and rim. The 16 inch front wheel was used to aid steering response, and the 17 inch rear saw the first use of radial construction tire for the European models. The American market models were sold with the traditional bias ply construction tire. In order to complete the endurance racer appearance of the bike, a removable solo seat cowl was included, as were dual round endurance racer headlights and taillights. The dual headlight was changed to a single square light with white and black plastic surround on the initial US release models in order to satisfy what most major manufacturers thought would be a requirement of US street legal vehicles in the near future. The legislation never passed, and Honda included the very desirable dual round headlight on the 1986 US models. The VF1000R had three major model revisions. The first model which ran from the beginning of production in 1984 to April 1985 was coded the RE model (internal Honda factory code) The second model, denoted with the RF suffix, was produced from 1985 to the end of the worldwide production in 1988. The RG model was the final model and was produced from 1986 through 1987 Differences between the models were mainly cosmetic, but a number of important mechanical changes were made to increase reliability when Honda transitioned from the RE to the RF model designations. The RF model saw improved cooling through fairing redesigns in relation to the RE, as well as the addition of a double oil sump system, complete with anti-slosh plate mounted in the oil pan (compared to the single pump system in use on the RE model. This was done in order to combat oil starvation during cornering, as well as ensure that the cams and heads of the motor were receiving adequate lubrication. The RE models initially had trouble with camshaft wear. The addition of the second oil pump as well as a redesign of the camshaft clamps was done in order to improve the situation. The RF model also got a redesigned oil pan with taps for an oil cooler and the respective lines, in order to help with the high temperatures seen in the oiling system. The final changes to the RF model from the RE, was the change in sidecover design, from a solid plastic version with cutout vent, to a mesh version. This allowed the inspection of battery fluid level, as well as coolant level without removing the covers. Changes from the RE to the RF in terms of color scheme included eliminating the Blue/Red/White (with blue seat) color scheme and continuing production with only the Red/White/Blue (with red seat) HRC replica paint scheme. The RF model was the first model to be sold outside Europe. The RG model carried very few modifications in relation to the RF model, with exceptions being the recoloring of the clip on handlebars from black to silver/gold anodized, as well as a slight color scheme tweaking that saw the upper white stripe on the upper fairing and gas tank move slightly lower on the body, incorporating more blue into the design. The RG model also included the very desirable Euro-style twin endurance headlight on the US model, whereas the RF model could only be had with the single, square headlight in the US release. Finally, the RG model made the blue/White Rothman's racing livery, popularized by Honda's racing efforts, an option. This color option was only offered from March 1986 to August 1987 and was never available in the US version. The VF1000R was able to claim the title of \\"fastest production motorcycle in the world\\" with a top speed of 150 mph for a short period before being dethroned by the Kawasaki GPz900. == VF1000F2 == Following the release of the VF1000FF in 1985, a fully faired version was introduced, and the VF1000F2(F) was launched in April 1985 as a sports tourer. The F2 included the same styling changes we had seen in the VF1000FF but Honda added a more aerodynamic full fairing which covered most of the engine, and changed the seat design to improve comfort for rider and passenger over long distances. The F2 has the name of the French 24 hour endurance race \\"Bol d'Or\\" across the top of the fairing behind the indicator, giving this VF it's Bol d'Or nickname. An extra radiator is included to assist cooling and is integrated into the \\"wind tunnel\\" designed fairing. The fairing, designed to increase rider comfort and reduce drag, has a built in ventilation system and twin storage \\"pockets\\". The cockpit was redesigned too with a centrally mounted fuel and coolant temperature gauge, new style speedometer and tachometer with yellow needles and numbers. The twin headlights first seen on the VF1000R are also included on some models. Suspension and braking specifications remain the same as the VF1000F/FE. Engine and frame modifications were carried over from the development of the R and FF models, but the F2 still had chain driven cams. The VF1000F2-(F/G) was discontinued in May 1986.http://honda.vf1000.com/vf1000f2/ ==References== Vf1000 Category:Sport bikes Category:Sport touring motorcycles Category:Motorcycles introduced in 1984 ","title":"Honda VF1000"},{"id":"2561172","text":"Naghsh-e-Jahan Stadium (, Image of the World Stadium), is a stadium in Isfahan, Iran Construction finished on October 31, 2016 and it became the new stadium of the football club Sepahan.

Poorly rationed and hampered by muddy conditions, the soldiers eventually had to butcher and eat their horses and mules as they became lame or injured. The Horsemeat March ended with the Battle of Slim Buttes and the capture and looting of American Horse the Elder's richly stocked village.Jerome A. Greene, \\"Slim Buttes, 1876: An Episode of the Great Sioux War\\", (1982), p. 90. \\"The soldiers last night, ragged, cold, weak, starved and well-nigh desperate, are feasting upon meat and fruits received from a savage enemy ...\\" ==Background== Disputes over the Black Hills of the Dakota Territory came to a high during the Great Sioux War of 1876 between the U.S. Army and the many Native American groups in the area (Lakota, Sioux, Arapaho and Northern Cheyenne). After the Battle of Powder River in March, organized by General Crook and led by Colonel Joseph J. Reynolds, a larger effort was made for a battle later in the spring in order to move the Indians to reservations. Multiple columns of soldiers were made to trap the enemy and prevent escaping. Crook's command, the 2nd and 3rd Cavalries and 4th and 9th Infantries, moved north from Fort Fetterman for the battle. However, they encountered the Sioux and Cheyenne, resulting in the Battle of the Rosebud, which delayed them to the columns in Dakota. The subsequent Battle of the Little Bighorn went on without them. The intention of the Army's senior commanders was to reunite their soldiers with Custer's in order to finally win the battle by overwhelming the native camps. On June 22, 1876, Custer declined the offer of reinforcements in either soldiers or equipment. On June 24, Custer's troops found shelter on an overlook called Crow's Nest, about fourteen miles east of the Little Bighorn River; from here they spotted a herd of ponies.Greene, Jerome A. \\"The Battle of Powder River.\\" Battles and Skirmishes of the Great Sioux War: 1876-1877 : The Military View. Norman U.a.: Univ. of Oklahoma, 1993. Print. This overlook afforded them a view of one of the largest gatherings of Native Americans on the Great Plains ever recorded at the time. The gathering had been called together by Hunkpapa Lakota religious leader Sitting Bull and consisted of approximately 1800 warriors, including such notable warriors as Crazy Horse and Gall. Custer moved forward under false information given by agents that suggested the region had just over 800 warriors, roughly the same size as the 7th Cavalry.Robinson, Charles M. \\"The Great Sioux War.\\" General Crook and the Western Frontier. Norman: University of Oklahoma, 2001. Print. Custer and the men under his command took up positions on a hill near the native encampment known as Battle Ridge. Under the leadership of Crazy Horse, the native warriors decimated Custer's soldiers, forcing a small remnant of his command to defend themselves at a spot now known as Last Stand Hill. Custer and his men were massacred by the combined Sioux and Cheyenne force in what has become known as one of the worst defeats in American military history. Following the battle, the United States increased the size of its army and began a campaign to hunt down the large force of native warriors that had carried out the massacre.UTLEY, Robert Marshall. \\"The Sioux War of 1876.\\" [Frontier Regulars: The United States Army and the Indian, 1866-1891.] Bluecoats and Redskins: The United States Army and the Indian, 1866-1891. London: Cassell, 1975. Print. ==The Horsemeat March== Following the Battle of the Little Bighorn, most of the native warriors fled the area and were not pursued for nearly two months. The U.S. Army spent much of those two months trying to recruit and train a force capable of fighting the tribes. General George Crook, who commanded over one thousand cavalry and infantry soldiers together with numerous Native American scouts, eventually took the helm of a punitive military campaign against the Sioux. Despite an extreme shortage of rations for his troops, Crook pushed forward to the Black Hills. The resulting march, variably known as the \\"Mud March\\" because of the conditions created by heavy rainfall at the time, and also the \\"Starvation March\\" because of the lack of food and supplies, is most commonly labeled the \\"Horsemeat March\\" because of the particular food on which the troops subsisted: their own horses. ===Dr. Clements' Diary=== Bennett A. Clements was a surgeon in the United States Army who, by the late 1860s, had achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel. In December 1876, Dr. Clements filed a report on General Crook's campaign against the Sioux, detailing the Horsemeat March and the Battle of Slim Buttes. His report, which takes the form of a daily diary of the campaign, describes a difficult time of near-starvation. One entry, on August 31, 1876, illustrates the intense difficulties encountered by Crook's troops: > Long marches in the most frequent of rain-storms, with cold nights and heavy > dews, and the prospect of achieving satisfactory results, always so > encouraging to the soldier, was not apparent. There were about five-and-a- > half days' rations of coffee, and less than two days of bread and salt left; > the distance to the Black Hills was definitely not known, and the Ree Indian > scouts, who alone knew anything of the intervening country, left us at this > point to carry dispatches to Fort Lincoln. Under these unfavorable > conditions the command moved from its camp directly south on the morning of > September 6, and marched 30 miles over a broken, rolling country, and camped > on alkaline water holes, without enough wood to even boil coffee with. On > the 7th we again made 30 miles over the same kind of country, and had an > equally bad camp. All the litters, nine in number, were in use this day; > many horses were abandoned, and men continued to struggle into camp until 10 > P.M. On this day the men began to kill abandoned horses for food.

Norman U.a.: Univ. of Oklahoma, 1993. Print. Dr. Clements' report describes an exhausting trek through the badlands of the Dakota Territory, which became lakes of mud in the stormy weather that accompanied the journey. Before the march ended, many of the soldiers were sick and wounded, while others were forced to dismount from their horses and to walk through the mud in order for the horses to be eaten. It was a dismal follow-up to the disastrous Battle of the Little Bighorn, with General Crook, who had been considered the most talented general in the U.S. Army, losing a large proportion of his force to starvation and disease. ==Battle of Slim Buttes== By September 8, the troops were living off the meat from the cavalry's horses. Crook sent ahead a request for a train to bring supplies into Deadwood, a mining town in the Black Hills, and a small group of troops to pick up the supplies and carry them back to his column. On the way there, the troops discovered the Lakota tribe, in particular, an encampment of Oglala men, women, and children near Slim Buttes, in present-day South Dakota. At dawn on September 9, roughly 150 men led by Captain Anson Mills attacked the Oglala encampment, though the natives fought back fiercely. The Battle of Slim Buttes quickly spiraled into one of the largest battles on the Northern Plains since the Battle of the Little Bighorn itself. Crook arrived with the rest of his forces the next day, but the Oglala camp was still much larger. Ultimately, Crook's forces captured an enormous supply of dried meat that the Oglala had stockpiled to last them through the winter, and captured or killed 37 Oglala warriors. On September 13, 1876, the Horsemeat March ended when Crook's troops came in contact with the train carrying their supplies. The U.S. Army did finally find the Lakota to fight and defeat, but the troops were too worn out to go in pursuit of them. ==References== UTLEY, Robert Marshall. \\"The Sioux War of 1876.\\" [Frontier Regulars: The United States Army and the Indian, 1866-1891.] Bluecoats and Redskins: The United States Army and the Indian, 1866-1891.

He makes his first appearance in the novel when he informs Liu Bei of his father's assassination just before the Battle of Yiling. Zhang Bao meets Guan Xing, Guan Yu's second son, and competes with him for the position of leading the vanguard force into battle. After nearly coming to blows, Zhang Bao and Guan Xing are stopped by Liu Bei, who forces them to become oath brothers in the same manner he did with their fathers many years ago. The two are regularly depicted together from that moment onwards. In the novel, Zhang Bao is involved in several military campaigns, including the disastrous Battle of Xiaoting and Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions against Shu's rival state Wei. In the third Northern Expedition, Zhang Bao falls into a gully while pursuing the Wei generals Guo Huai and Sun Li, and later dies from the resulting injuries. When Zhuge Liang learns of Zhang Bao's death, he becomes so upset that he coughs blood and faints. ==Modern references== Zhang Bao is first introduced as a playable character in the eighth instalment of Koei's Dynasty Warriors video game series. In the ninth instalment, his mother is Xiahou Ji (Xiahou Yuan's niece and Zhang Fei's only known wife), making him a brother of Xingcai. Zhang Bao's rivalry with Guan Xing and his involvement in the Northern Expeditions are depicted in the 2008 film Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon. ==See also== * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms ==References== * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

The original students came primarily from the Carson Road and Pineview neighbourhoods. During the 1980s and early 90s, students from Fallingbrook in Orleans were bussed to the school. Eventually, the entire school was home to students bussed from Orleans while a new campus was built at its current location on Tenth Line Road. After moving to the new location, students from Pineview/Carson Road attended Gloucester High School and the building was eventually purchased by the French Catholic school board as the new home for Coll√®ge Catholique Samuel-Genest. == School layout == Sir Wilfrid Laurier is a two-story school. It includes a full resource library, and number of computer labs which hosts classes and individual work. The gym can be split into three divisions, creating space to host multiple activities or host larger sports games. Close to the gymnasium is a fitness room which includes treadmills, bench press equipment, and a variety of exercise machines. There is also a track at the back of the school and an outdoor basketball court. With the connection to the Ray Friel Recreational Complex, gym classes are able to access the swimming pool, skating rink, and public library. The school also has a broadcasting lab which is used for its broadcasting program. == Extra-curricular activities == The school participates in a wide range of sports for both males and females. The fall sports include: golf, football, cross-country running, basketball (girls), soccer, volleyball (boys), tennis, ultimate frisbee, and rugby (7's).

Jack is a given name. Since the late 20th century, Jack has become one of the most common names for boys in many English-speaking countries. While Jack is now a proper name in its own right, in English, it was traditionally used as a diminutive form of John. It can also be used as a diminutive for: Jacob, Jason, Jonathan, Jan, Johann, Johannes, Joachim and sometimes for James, from its French form Jacques, from the Latin Jacobus. It is also used as a female given name (often a shortened version of Jacqueline or Jackie) and as a surname to a lesser extent. The word jack is also commonly used in other contexts in English for many occupations, objects and actions, linked to the use of the word as a metaphor for a common man. ==Origin== 'Jackie' has been used among men (Jackie Coogan, Jackie Cooper, and Jackie Gleason were all formally named John). This diminutive of Jack is thought by some to have hailed from the earlier Jackin (from the name Jankin). Alternatively, it may be derived from the name Jacques, the French form of the name James or Jacob. There is also a theory that it is Celtic in origin, meaning \\"healthy, strong, full of vital energy\\" (compare the Welsh word iach, \\"health\\"), from a putative Ancient British Yakkios. Whatever its origins, both the name and the word \\"jack\\" were long used as a term to refer to any man, especially of the common classes. ==Frequency== ===Given name=== Jack has become increasingly used as a formal, registered name, rather than a nickname, for boys in several English- speaking countries. It is now more popular in its own right than John, James and Jacob where it is originally derived from. In recent years, Jack has been the most common given name for baby boys in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia, and has grown in popularity in the United States. Jack was also the most popular baby boy's name in Scotland from 1999‚Äì2002, again in 2006, and from 2008 to the present; where it continues to be the most popular boy's name. From 2003‚Äì05 and again in 2007, Jack was reduced to second place after Lewis took the #1 spot. Although the use of Jack as a formal given name is a recent phenomenon, John ‚Äì from which Jack was often derived ‚Äì was, along with William, the most frequent male name throughout the nineteenth century and in the first half of the twentieth century. Jack was included on lists of the most frequently used male baby names in the UK for 2003‚Äì2007. In 1994, Jack was the most popular name in London but was not among the 10 most popular in the preceding 970 years. A survey in December 2008 showed that Jack was the most popular name in the UK for the fourteenth consecutive year, since it overtook Thomas in 1994. In 2014, Jack was again the most popular name for baby boys in Ireland. In 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2013, Jack was the most common name given to boys in Australia. According to the United States Census of 1990, \\"Jack\\" is an uncommon American name, the given name for 0.315% of the male population and 0.001% of the female population.The male, female, and total populations of the United States in the 1990 census were 121,239,418; 127,470,455; and 248,709,873, respectively. Information from However, the frequency of Jack as a baby name has steadily increased from the 160‚Äì170 rank prior to 1991 to a rank of 35 in 2006.Popular baby names Jock is a common diminutive of the name John in Scotland. ===Surname=== The occurrence of Jack as a surname is much less frequent than its use as a male forename. In 1990, in the United States, this surname is shared by about 0.007% of the population, though the geographical distribution of the surname has been broad since at least 1840, at which time there was a modest concentration of Jacks in Pennsylvania. Within the United Kingdom, the surname is considered almost exclusively Scottish.Retrieved 08‚Äì24‚Äì11 In the late-nineteenth century, the geographic distribution of Jacks in England was also broad, with concentration in North East England, Yorkshire and the Humber, and southern North West England. In 1891, the highest concentration of Jacks in the United Kingdom appeared in Scotland. ==Other uses in English== The name Jack is unusual in the English language for its frequent use as a noun or verb for many common objects and actions, and in many compound words and phrases. Examples include implements, such as a car jack, knucklebones (the game jacks), or the jack in bowls. The word is also used in other words and phrases such as: apple jack, hijack, jack of clubs (playing card), jack straw (scarecrow), jack tar (sailor), jack-in-the-box, jack-of-all-trades, jack o'lantern, jackdaw, jackhammer, jackknife, jackpot, lumberjack, union jack, etc. The history of the word is linked to the name being used as a by-name for a man. ==People with the given name== *Jack Abel (1927‚Äì1996), American comic book artist *Jack Abramoff (born 1959), American former lobbyist, businessman, movie producer, and writer, convicted of corruption *Jack Adams (disambiguation), multiple people *Jack Agazarian (1915‚Äì1945), British spy *Jack Aker, American former Major League Baseball pitcher *Jack Albertson (1907‚Äì1981), American actor *Jack Angel, American actor *Jack Arute, American former sportscaster *Jack Asher, English cinematographer *Jack Avery, American singer in boy band Why Don't We *Jack Barakat, lead guitarist for punk rock band All Time Low *Jack Benny, American comedian, vaudevillian, actor, and violinist *Jack Black, American actor *Jack Blott, All-American football center and place kicker *Jack Brabham, Australian racing driver *Jack Brickhouse, American sportscaster *Jack Brisco, American professional wrestler *Jack Bruce (1943‚Äì2014), Scottish musician, composer, and vocalist *Jack Buck, American sportscaster *Jack Cade, the leader of a popular revolt against the government of England in 1450 *Jack Bridger Chalker, British artist and teacher *Jack L.

From the ages of 9 to 18 Emmius studied in a Latin school, before having to leave on the death of his father, a Lutheran preacher. After studying at Rostock, at the age of 30, Emmius took classes in Geneva with Theodorus Beza, a Calvinist who influenced Emmius greatly.http://www.rug.nl/museum/geschiedenis/hoogleraren/ubbo?lang=en ==Life== Upon returning to East Friesland in 1579 he took the position of rector in the very school in which he was taught, the college at Norden. He was subsequently sacked by the local court in 1587 because, as a Calvinist, he would not subscribe to the confession of Augsburg. Following this, in 1588, the Calvinist count Johan offered him the position of rector in the Latin school of Leer (later renamed the Ubbo-Emmius-Gymnasium). Whilst remaining in Leer it is known that Emmius had corresponded with many other important people of the time who had fled from Groningen after the area fell into the hands of the Spanish. When Groningen surrendered to Prince Maurits in 1594 those who fled returned and offered Ubbo the position of rector in St Maarten school. When in 1614 the decision was made to form a university, under the guidance of Emmius. As a result, he was chosen as the principal and professor of history and Greek and ultimately became the first rector magnificus of the Academy in which he formed. ==Work== Ubbo Emmius made prominent contributions to historiography. His primary works were on the History of the Frisian Territories: his 6 part Rerum Frisicarum historiae decades from 1592 to 1616. In one of his other important works titled the Chronologicum he compared the histories of different nations that used different calendars.

Lieutenant Colonel John Henry Guy Nevill, 5th Marquess of Abergavenny, (8 November 1914 ‚Äì 23 February 2000) was a British peer. ==Biography== The eldest son of the 4th Marquess of Abergavenny, Lord Abergavenny was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1936, he became an officer in the service of the Life Guards and fought in the Second World War, was invested as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1945, and rose to the rank of Lieutenant- Colonel in 1946. On 4 January 1938, he married (Mary) Patricia Harrison, by whom he had five children: * Lady Anne Patricia Nevill (b. 25 October 1938), married Captain Martin Whiteley and had issue. * Lady Vivienne Margaret Nevill (15 February 1941 - 10 September 2018), married Alan Lillingston and had issue. * Lady Jane Elizabeth Nevill (1944‚Äì1946), died in infancy. * Henry John Montague Nevill, Earl of Lewes (1948‚Äì1965), educated at Eton, died without issue. * Lady Rose Nevill (b. 15 July 1950); a bridesmaid at the wedding of Princess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones. Lady Rose married George Clowes and had issue. Lord Abergavenny was an Honorary Colonel of the Kent Yeomanry 1949‚Äì1961, and of the Kent and County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters) 1961‚Äì1962. He was a member of East Sussex County Council between 1947 and 1954 and County Alderman for East Sussex between 1954 and 1962. He was also Deputy Lieutenant of Sussex in 1955, Vice-Lieutenant of Sussex between 1970 and 1974 and later the first Lord Lieutenant of East Sussex from 1974 to 1989. Aside from his army and political career, Lord Abergavenny was also a Director of Massey-Ferguson between 1955 and 1985; a Director of Lloyds Bank between 1962 and 1985; Chairman of Lloyds Bank South-East Regional Board between 1962 and 1985; and a Director of Whitbread Investment. Lord Abergavenny became a Knight of St John in 1976, a Knight of the Garter in 1974, and was Chancellor of that Order between 1977 and 1994. In 1986, he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Sussex. Abergavenny was also involved in horse racing. He rode in steeplechases between 1935 and 1939, and was elected to the National Hunt Committee in 1942, acting as a steward from 1948‚Äì50, 1952‚Äì54 and 1960-62. He became a member of the Jockey Club in 1950 and Vice-Chairman of the Turf Board in 1967. He was also a director of both Cheltenham and Fontwell Racecourses. He served as a Trustee to the Ascot Authority in 1952 and became the Queen's representative at Ascot. His racing colours were scarlet with white cross-belts. ==Death== Lord Abergavenny died in 2000, aged 85.

It is most often used to detect or infer the presence and position of economically useful geological deposits, such as ore minerals; fossil fuels and other hydrocarbons; geothermal reservoirs; and groundwater reservoirs. Exploration geophysics can be used to directly detect the target style of mineralization, via measuring its physical properties directly. For example, one may measure the density contrasts between the dense iron ore and the lighter silicate host rock, or one may measure the electrical conductivity contrast between conductive sulfide minerals and the resistive silicate host rock. == Geophysical methods == The main techniques used are: # Seismic tomography to locate earthquakes and assist in Seismology # Reflection seismology and seismic refraction to map the surface structure of a region. # Geodesy and gravity techniques, including gravity gradiometry. # Magnetic techniques, including aeromagnetic surveys to map magnetic anomalies. # Electrical techniques, including electrical resistivity tomography and induced polarization. # Electromagnetic methods, such as magnetotellurics, ground penetrating radar, transient/time-domain electromagnetics and SNMR. # Borehole geophysics, also called well logging. # Remote sensing techniques, including hyperspectral imaging. Many other techniques, or methods of integration of the above techniques, have been developed and are currently used. However these are not as common due to cost-effectiveness, wide applicability and/or uncertainty in the results produced. == Uses == Exploration geophysics is also used to map the subsurface structure of a region, to elucidate the underlying structures, spatial distribution of rock units, and to detect structures such as faults, folds and intrusive rocks. This is an indirect method for assessing the likelihood of ore deposits or hydrocarbon accumulations. Methods devised for finding mineral or hydrocarbon deposits can also be used in other areas such as monitoring environmental impact, imaging subsurface archaeological sites, ground water investigations, subsurface salinity mapping, civil engineering site investigations and interplanetary imaging. === Mineral exploration === Magnetometric surveys can be useful in defining magnetic anomalies which represent ore (direct detection), or in some cases gangue minerals associated with ore deposits (indirect or inferential detection). The most direct method of detection of ore via magnetism involves detecting iron ore mineralisation via mapping magnetic anomalies associated with banded iron formations which usually contain magnetite in some proportion. Skarn mineralisation, which often contains magnetite, can also be detected though the ore minerals themselves would be non-magnetic. Similarly, magnetite, hematite and often pyrrhotite are common minerals associated with hydrothermal alteration, and this alteration can be detected to provide an inference that some mineralising hydrothermal event has affected the rocks. Gravity surveying can be used to detect dense bodies of rocks within host formations of less dense wall rocks. This can be used to directly detect Mississippi Valley Type ore deposits, IOCG ore deposits, iron ore deposits, skarn deposits and salt diapirs which can form oil and gas traps. Electromagnetic (EM) surveys can be used to help detect a wide variety of mineral deposits, especially base metal sulphides via detection of conductivity anomalies which can be generated around sulphide bodies in the subsurface. EM surveys are also used in diamond exploration (where the kimberlite pipes tend to have lower resistance than enclosing rocks), graphite exploration, palaeochannel-hosted uranium deposits (which are associated with shallow aquifers, which often respond to EM surveys in conductive overburden). These are indirect inferential methods of detecting mineralisation, as the commodity being sought is not directly conductive, or not sufficiently conductive to be measurable. EM surveys are also used in unexploded ordnance, archaeological, and geotechnical investigations. Regional EM surveys are conducted via airborne methods, using either fixed-wing aircraft or helicopter-borne EM rigs. Surface EM methods are based mostly on Transient EM methods using surface loops with a surface receiver, or a downhole tool lowered into a borehole which transects a body of mineralisation. These methods can map out sulphide bodies within the earth in 3 dimensions, and provide information to geologists to direct further exploratory drilling on known mineralisation. Surface loop surveys are rarely used for regional exploration, however in some cases such surveys can be used with success (e.g.; SQUID surveys for nickel ore bodies). Electric-resistance methods such as induced polarization methods can be useful for directly detecting sulfide bodies, coal and resistive rocks such as salt and carbonates. Seismic methods can be also used for mineral exploration, since they can provide high-resolution images of geologic structures hosting mineral deposits. It is not just surface seismic surveys which are used, but also borehole seismic methods. All in all the usage of seismic methods for mineral exploration is steadily increasing. === Hydrocarbon exploration === Seismic reflection and refraction techniques are the most widely used geophysical technique in hydrocarbon exploration. They are used to map the subsurface distribution of stratigraphy and its structure which can be used to delineate potential hydrocarbon accumulations, both stratigraphic and structural deposits or \\"traps\\". Well logging is another widely used technique as it provides necessary high resolution information about rock and fluid properties in a vertical section, although they are limited in areal extent. This limitation in areal extent is the reason why seismic reflection techniques are so popular; they provide a method for interpolating and extrapolating well log information over a much larger area. Gravity and magnetics are also used, with considerable frequency, in oil and gas exploration. These can be used to determine the geometry and depth of covered geological structures including uplifts, subsiding basins, faults, folds, igneous intrusions and salt diapirs due to their unique density and magnetic susceptibility signatures compared to the surrounding rocks, the latter is particularly useful for metallic ores. Remote sensing techniques, specifically hyperspectral imaging, have been used to detect hydrocarbon microseepages using the spectral signature of geochemically altered soils and vegetation. Specifically at sea, two methods are used: marine seismic reflection and electromagnetic seabed logging (SBL). Marine Magnetotellurics (mMT) or marine Controlled Source Electro-Magnetics (mCSEM) can provide pseudo-direct detection of hydrocarbons by detecting resistivity changes over geological traps (signaled by seismic survey).St√©phane Sainson, Electromagnetic seabed logging, A new tool for geoscientists. Ed. Springer, 2017 === Civil engineering === ==== Ground penetrating radar ==== Ground penetrating radar is a non-invasive technique, and is used within civil construction and engineering for a variety of uses, including detection of utilities (buried water, gas, sewerage, electrical and telecommunication cables), mapping of soft soils and overburden for geotechnical characterization, and other similar uses. ==== Spectral-Analysis- of-Surface-Waves ==== The Spectral-Analysis-of-Surface-Waves (SASW) method is another non-invasive technique, which is widely used in practice to image the shear wave velocity profile of the soil. The SASW method relies on the dispersive nature of Raleigh waves in layered media, i.e., the wave-velocity depends on the load's frequency. A material profile, based on the SASW method, is thus obtained according to: a) constructing an experimental dispersion curve, by performing field experiments, each time using a different loading frequency, and measuring the surface wave-speed for each frequency; b) constructing a theoretical dispersion curve, by assuming a trial distribution for the material properties of a layered profile; c) varying the material properties of the layered profile, and repeating the previous step, until a match between the experimental dispersion curve, and the theoretical dispersion curve is attained. The SASW method renders a layered (one- dimensional) shear wave velocity profile for the soil.  Full waveform inversion  Full-waveform-inversion (FWI) methods are among the most recent techniques for geotechnical site characterization, and are still under continuous development. The method is fairly general, and is capable of imaging the arbitrarily heterogeneous compressional and shear wave velocity profiles of the soil. Elastic waves are used to probe the site under investigation, by placing seismic vibrators on the ground surface. These waves propagate through the soil, and due to the heterogeneous geological structure of the site under investigation, multiple reflections and refractions occur. The response of the site to the seismic vibrator is measured by sensors (geophones), also placed on the ground surface. Two key-components are required for the profiling based on full-waveform inversion. These components are: a) a computer model for the simulation of elastic waves in semi-infinite domains; and b) an optimization framework, through which the computed response is matched to the measured response, via iteratively updating an initially assumed material distribution for the soil.  Other techniques  Civil engineering can also use remote sensing information for topographical mapping, planning and environmental impact assessment. Airborne electromagnetic surveys are also used to characterize soft sediments in planning and engineering roads, dams and other structures. Magnetotellurics has proven useful for delineating groundwater reservoirs, mapping faults around areas where hazardous substances are stored (e.g. nuclear power stations and nuclear waste storage facilities), and earthquake precursor monitoring in areas with major structures such as hydro-electric dams subject to high levels of seismic activity. BS 5930 is the standard used in the UK as a code of practice for site investigations. === Archaeology === Ground penetrating radar can be used to map buried artifacts, such as graves, mortuaries, wreck sites, and other shallowly buried archaeological sites. Ground magnetometric surveys can be used for detecting buried ferrous metals, useful in surveying shipwrecks, modern battlefields strewn with metal debris, and even subtle disturbances such as large-scale ancient ruins. Sonar systems can be used to detect shipwrecks. === Forensics === Ground penetrating radar can be used to detect grave sites. === Unexploded ordnance detection === Magnetic and electromagnetic surveys can be used to locate unexploded ordnance. ==See also== *Archaeological geophysics *Hydrocarbon exploration *Kola Superdeep Borehole *List of free geophysics software *Mineral exploration *Ore genesis *Petroleum geology *Society of Exploration Geophysicists ==References== Category:Geophysics Category:Economic geology ","title":"Exploration geophysics"},{"id":"2561263","text":"Sheep on Drugs are a British techno/Industrial music group, formed by Duncan X ( King Duncan) (vocals) and Lee Fraser (a.k.a. Dead Lee) (guitar/keyboards) and currently composed of Fraser and Johnny Borden (vocals/keyboards). ==Biography== Originally classified as part of the rave movement, the duo emerged in the early 1990s with a string of singles, including \\"Motorbike,\\" \\"15 Minutes of Fame\\" and \\"Track X\\" (later covered by Grace Jones as \\"Sex Drive\\"). \\"15 Minutes of Fame\\" reached the lower reaches of the UK Singles Chart as did \\"From A To H And Back Again\\". Their Gareth Jones produced debut album, Greatest Hits, was released on Island Records in 1993 to some acclaim from the UK music press. However, with their Grand Guignol style stage shows, and a musical mixture of sleazy rock, hard techno and punk nihilism, SoD found themselves pigeonholed as an industrial band. Their 1994 follow-up album, ...On Drugs was a commercial and critical disappointment. > \\"For the 'On Drugs' album, it was basically me and Duncan locked in a room, > with no guidance about what direction we were to take it in, no producer. > Markus Dravs, who did the production for that album, he's a brilliant artist > in his own right, but he wasn't the producer we needed. He was just brought > into the studio to mix, it wasn't like he was an active part of the team, so > they fucked that up. So, no wonder the second album wasn't as commercial as > they were expecting, because they didn't give us any guidance,\\" according to > Lee. After being dropped by Island, the band independently released two EPs: Suck in 1994 and Strapped for Cash in 1995. The band was then signed to Martin Atkins' Invisible Records and headed to the United States. With Invisible, they released the two EPs as Double Trouble in 1996, their third studio album, One for the Money and a remix collection, Never Mind the Methadone in 1997, and a live recording, Two for the Show in 1998. By this time, they had tired of their situation in the States and were unsatisfied with Invisible. Frontman Duncan X departed Sheep on Drugs shortly afterwards to become a professional tattooist (though he does perform live with the band on rare occasions). Fraser continued his relationship with Invisible Records, releasing two more albums as 'Bagman' and was briefly a member of Atkins' bands Pigface and The Damage Manual, usually under the moniker \\"Lee 303\\". Fraser revived the group in 2002 with himself as the frontman and released a new album, F**K, on Invisible in 2005. A best of compilation album called Best of a Bad Bunch was released in 2006. After the release of F**K, Lee Fraser met and began working with Johnny Borden, herself a singer and musician working within similar circles. Johnny was soon brought on board as Lee's partner in Sheep On Drugs' new 21st century incarnation and they began gigging, developing new material which was released on their new album MEDICATION TIME (released digitally on 6 December 2010). The album was to be released by a French record label on physical CDs in 2011 to accompany a tour in February. CLUB MEDS, an album of remixes of trackes from Medication Time followed in 2012. Lee and Johnny continued to perform live until their self released album DOES DARK MATTER on vinyl and download formats in 2019. This album sees an orthaganol shift in Sheep On Drugs sound with melodic and dub sounds. A cassette E.P of remixes 2 light 2 dark followed in late 2019 on cassette. During lockdown caused by COVID_19 Johnny and Lee managed to very creatively release a single Moonlight Man. ==Discography== ===Albums=== * Greatest Hits (Island, 1993) * ...On Drugs (Island, 1994) * Double Trouble (Invisible, 1996) - compilation and re-release of Drug Squad EPs. * One for the Money (Invisible, 1997) * Never Mind the Methadone (Invisible, 1997) - remixes * Two for the Show (Invisible, 1998) - live * F**K (Invisible, 2005) * Best Of A Bad Bunch (Underground, Inc., 2006) - compilation and remixes * MEDICATION TIME (digital, 2010) * Club Meds (Real Recordings, 2012) * Does Dark Matter {Sheep on Drugs, 2019} ===EPs=== * From A to H and Back Again (Smash/Island, 1994) * Strapped for Cash (Drug Squad, 1995) * Suck (Drug Squad, 1995) * 2 Light 2 Dark {Sheep on Drugs, 2019} ===Singles=== * \\"Catch 22\\" / \\"Drug Music\\" (Transglobal, 1991) * \\"Motorbike\\" / \\"Mary Jane\\" (Transglobal, 1992) * \\"Track X\\" (Transglobal, 1992) * \\"TV USA\\" (Transglobal, 1992) * \\"15 Minutes of Fame\\" (Island, 1993) * \\"Let the Good Times Roll\\" (Island, 1994) * \\"Moonlight Man\\" [Sheep On Drugs 2020] As Bagman (Lee Fraser solo) * \\"Wrap\\" (Invisible, 1998) * \\"Trax\\" (Underground, Inc., 2004) ===Tribute Albums=== * \\"Back in Black\\" (with Pigface) on Covered In Black: An Industrial Tribute To The Kings Of High Voltage AC/DC (Cleopatra, 1997) * \\"California √úber Alles\\" on Dread Kennedys: A Tribute To Dead Kennedys / In Dub We Trust (Invisible, 1999) * \\"Wish\\" on Covered In Nails: A Tribute To Nine Inch Nails (Cleopatra, 2000) * \\"Money\\" on Don't Blow Your Cover: A Tribute to KMFDM (Cleopatra, 2000) ===Soundtracks=== * \\"Cathode Ray\\", \\"Uberman\\", and \\"15 Minutes Of Fame\\" on The Young Americans (Island, 1993) * \\"Machine Sex\\" on Prey (2K Games, 2006) ==References== ==External links== *The official Sheep on Drugs site *[ Sheep on Drugs] on Allmusic *Band history *Sheep on Drugs @ Invisible Records *Sheep on Drugs myspace page *bandcamp Category:Musical groups established in 1990 Category:British techno music groups Category:British electronic music groups Category:Electronic rock musical groups Category:Dance-punk musical groups Category:Underground, Inc. artists Category:Rhythm King artists ","title":"Sheep on Drugs"},{"id":"2561265","text":"Thecacoris is a genus of flowering plant belonging to the family Phyllanthaceae first described as a genus in 1821.Jussieu, Adrien Henri Laurent de. 1824.

Beil, (1894 ‚Äì July 29, 1976) was a Canadian sculptor best known for his sculptures of cowboys and the plain Indians of the early West. He was a prot√©g√© and friend of artist Charles Marion Russell. He was born in Germany and left at the age of 11. He worked for some time in South America before making his way to North America, where he discovered his love of the Wild West and the Frontier. It was Russell who encouraged him to start creating art, and inspired him to start working with pencil and clay. Beil moved to Banff, Alberta in the 1930s, where he began to take an interest in casting clay into bronze. His studio was established on Bear Street in Banff above a bakery, and it was there that Beil continued to further his reputation as a Western artist. In fact, his main form of work was to create trophies for the Calgary Stampede, which he did for over 20 years. In 1940, he married a Banff girl by the name Olive Luxton, the niece of famed Banff businessman Norman Luxton, and they moved into a house on Cave Avenue in Banff. Together they had three children; Charles, Lois, and Carol. Charlie Beil was a recipient of many honours and awards over the years, including being made a Member of the Order of Canada in 1973. He also received the Canada Medal, an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Alberta, the Alberta Achievement Award in 1974. He was also made an Honorary Associate Director of the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede and an Honorary Member of the Cowboy Artists of America. ==Art== Charlie Beil's main form of work was with bronze casting, but the artist was well-versed in watercolour, oil, pen and ink, and etchings as well. He cast not only bronze statues, but also sculpted in clay, did woodcarving, and cast in cement. His art focused on the theme of Western life, such as packhorses, First Nations, and cowboys.

Dannat was born in 1853 at Hempstead, New York US Passport Application (William T. Dannat) September 6, 18701880 US Census Records the younger of two boys raised by William H. and Susan (n√©e Jones) Dannat. His father was a successful lumber dealer who, with Charles E.

Later William's older brother David would succeed their father as a partner in the firm.The New York Times November 2, 1889The New York Times October 9, 1897 When Dannat was around the age of twelve his parents decided to send him to Germany to further his education.The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, Volume 12 1904 He would later study architecture at Hanover and Stuttgart before choosing instead to become an artist. Dannat attended art classes at the Munich Royal Academy of Fine Arts and later under Mih√°ly Munk√°csy in Paris. Dannat became an accomplished draughtsman and a distinguished figure and portrait painter. He early attracted attention with sketches and pictures made in Spain. A large composition, The Quatuor Espagnol, that was displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, was one of the successes of the Paris Salon of 1884. Dannat later settled in Paris, where he taught at the Acad√©mie Julian. He was influenced by a number of masters including Carolus Duran and Munk√°csy, though more by the latter as can be observed in his paintings Contrebandier Aragonais and Quatuor Espagnol.Munsey's Magazine vol 13 1892Paintings and Sculpture in the Collection of the National Academy of Design ... By David Bernard Dearinger, National Academy of Design (U.S. 2004)Public opinion, Volume 36 By Progressive Conservative Party of Canada 1904 Though at one time his name was mentioned alongside other great American painters such as Sargent and Whistler, Dannat's popularity was more in Europe than his homeland. As he approached middle age the financially secure artist began to devote more and more of his time to other interests: fencing, boxing and later automobile racing. For nearly twenty years Dannat ceased painting and when he resumed around 1913 his art had adopted a more surrealistic style with illusionary landscapes and bizarre themes. During his hiatus from painting Dannat spent much of his time touring Europe studying the techniques of the great masters while remaining active in artistic circles in Paris where he served at one time as the president of the Society of American Painters.

It was played on 17 June 1970 at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. Italy won 4‚Äì3 after five of the seven goals were scored in extra time, the record for most goals scored during extra time in a FIFA World Cup game. (Four goals were scored in extra time in the 1982 semifinal between West Germany and France.) The result eliminated West Germany from the tournament while Italy would go on to lose to Brazil in the final. ==The match== Italy led 1‚Äì0 for the majority of the match, after Roberto Boninsegna scored in the 8th minute. West German defender Franz Beckenbauer dislocated his shoulder after being fouled, but stayed on the field carrying his dislocated arm in a sling, as his side had already used their two permitted substitutions. Defender Karl-Heinz Schnellinger equalised for West Germany in the second minute of injury time. German television commentator Ernst Huberty famously exclaimed \\"Schnellinger, of all people!\\" (in German: \\"Schnellinger! Ausgerechnet Schnellinger!\\"), since Schnellinger played in Italy's professional football league, Serie A, at A.C. Milan (for whom he had never scored). It was also his first and only goal in a career total of 47 matches for the West German national team. At the end of regulation time, the score was level at 1‚Äì1, forcing the match into extra time. Gerd M√ºller put West Germany ahead in the 94th minute following a defensive error by Fabrizio Poletti who had just come into the game as a substitute, but Tarcisio Burgnich tied it back up only four minutes later, and then striker Luigi Riva put the Italians in front again with a superb goal. M√ºller scored yet again, this time with a header, for West Germany to tie the score at 3‚Äì3. Yet, as the live television coverage was still replaying M√ºller's goal, Italian midfielder Gianni Rivera scored what proved to be the game-winning goal in the 111th minute. Being left unmarked near the penalty area, Rivera had connected perfectly with a fine cross made by Boninsegna, clinching the victory for Italy at 4‚Äì3.1970 FIFA World Cup Mexico. Match report.

It had a population of 2,693 people at the 2001 UK census, rising to 2,728 at the 2011 Census, and the ward covers about . ==Location and context== Tarvin is about east of Chester. The current parish covers Tarvin, Duddon, Clotton, Stapleford, Burton, Hoofield and Oscroft. There are currently 28 listed buildings in Tarvin (one Grade I Listed, two Grade II* Listed, and twenty-five Grade II Listed). The centre of the village is a Conservation Area that was created in 1972, and much of the land surrounding the village is designated Green Belt. == Transport == Tarvin is near the junction of the A51, towards Nantwich and Tarporley, and the A54, towards Northwich and Manchester. These two main trunk roads bypass the village centre on either side. The northerly A54 bypass was constructed in 1933, and the southerly A51 bypass in 1984. The village is served by two bus services operated by Arriva. The 82 service connects Tarvin to Chester and Northwich, and the 84 service to Chester, Tarporley, and Crewe. The nearest railway station is at Mouldsworth, with services to Chester and Manchester. ==Governance== Tarvin has been part of the parliamentary constituency of Eddisbury since its re-establishment in 1983, following its abolition in 1950. The constituency has been represented by Conservative MPs since its re- establishment, apart from a brief period in 2019 when the sitting MP Antoinette Sandbach had the Conservative whip removed and eventually sat as a Liberal Democrat before losing her seat to the Conservative Edward Timpson in the 2019 General Election. The village is in the Tarvin and Kelsall electoral ward as part of the Cheshire West and Chester Council. This ward stretches north east to Oakmere with a total population of 8,217. Tarvin Parish Council consists of 10 elected councillors. The Parish Council has some limited local government autonomy. It represents the village's needs, priorities and objectives to Cheshire West and Chester Council. ==Village amenities== There are many amenities in the village. These include: The George and Dragon Public House, Tarvin == Geology == Green Belt surrounding Tarvin The Cheshire Plain (sometimes known as the Cheshire Gap) is a relatively flat expanse of lowland, which supports agricultural use for dairy farming on the medium-scale pastoral fields that surround the village. Tarvin is west of a sandstone ridge that divides the Cheshire Plain. The River Gowy passes to the south-west of the village at Hockenhull Platts. There are three packhorse bridges, the Grade II Listed Roman Bridges, within an area classed as a nature reserve. ==Early history== thumb St Andrews Church, Tarvin Around 76 AD, the Romans started to build a fortress in Chester. They built a road from Deva (Chester) to Condate (Northwich) which passed Tarvin about a kilometre to the north. The Romans may have used Tarvin, being high ground close to the Roman road, as a Roman coin of Constantius 1 (AD 293‚Äì305) was found in the area and other finds in other nearby villages reinforce the evidence of the Romans' presence in the area. West of Tarvin the Roman road crosses the River Gowy. Apparently, in earlier times, this river was called the Tarvin. It is suggested that the name Tarvin comes from the Brittonic word for boundary, which is still present in the Welsh language as tervyn/terfyn and could have resulted from the Latin terminus being incorporated into Brittonic. The boundary could refer to the eastern extent of the Roman prata legionis, the land annexed by the Romans (from the Cornovii) to support their fortress at Chester. The Gowy was later the boundary between the Saxon land divisions (hundreds) in this area, which was a part of the Kingdom of Mercia known as the Wreocens√¶te. A Saxon cross dating to the 10th/11th century has been unearthed by archaeologists in Tarvin. The find, made in a Civil War trench, is very rare. The Saxon cross may have been broken up before the assault of Chester in 1645 by the Parliamentary garrison.Chester City Council Online Report. Retrieval Date: 9 July 2007. The Old Grammar School, Tarvin Tarvin appears as a substantial manor in the Domesday Book of 1086 (listed as Terve), the largest community in the Hundred of Rushton with 30 households. Tarvin Manor comprises some 2000 acres of cultivable land (22 ploughlands) as well as 'woodland'. The Domesday Book records the Lord of Tarvin Manor in 1066 as the bishop of Chester St John, and the same in 1086 but adds the name William Malbank, who was named as Lord or Tenant-in-Chief across over 100 manors in Cheshire after the conquest. According to Ormerod \\"Tarvin is one of the few Cheshire manors which experienced no change in its proprietor at the Conquest, being the property of the Bishop of the diocese, who retained his former possessions after that event.\\" (The nearby Manor of Burton was also to stay the property of the Bishop of St John's.) Although the manors stayed with the bishops, the bishops changed to Norman appointees. Bishop Peter moved from Lichfield to Chester St John's in 1075, and upgraded St John's to cathedral status (Lichfield was the ecclesiastical centre of the Kingdom of Mercia since 669). He died in 1085 and was succeeded in December 1085 by Bishop Robert de Limesey who moved the bishop's seat to Coventry circa 1102, whereupon St John's became a co- cathedral. Ormerod states that the Domesday Book reports devastation at Tarvin and suggests that this might have arisen due to a stand being taken at Tarvin as the Normans advanced on Chester. The adjacent manor of Barrow, with 8 ploughlands, is listed as having William Son of Nigel as its Lord. Barrow later came to fall within the parish of Tarvin, and was described as a 'free chapel within the prebend of Tarvin' until the 16th century, some time after which it became a separate parish. Although Tarvin was within Rushton Hundred at the time of the Norman conquest, from the end of the 12th century over a prolonged period there was a reorganisation of the hundreds associated with the formation of Lancashire, and transfer of some hundreds to Wales (Atiscross, Exestan, and part of Dudestan), and Tarvin became associated with the Eddisbury Hundred. The hundreds of Cheshire from this time were Broxton, Bucklow, Eddisbury, Macclesfield, Nantwich, Northwich and Wirral. Apart from Terve and the current name Tarvin, the village has also been referred to as Tervyn (e.g. in records of an assault on a monk in 1326) and Terfyn in the accounts of a trip from Chester to London in 1811, in which is it again suggested that Terfyn comes from the \\"British\\" word for \\"boundary\\", though in this case it is suggested this might refer to the boundary of Delamere Forest. In circa 1226 Alexander de Stavenby bishop of Lichfield founded the prebend of Tarvin which, at ¬£26 13s 4d, was the highest endowment of Lichfield Cathedral. The prebend occurs at a similar date to the changes to the borders of Cheshire due to yielding some hundreds to Wales; furthermore Bishop Alexander de Stavenby was a diplomat acting for King Henry III both with France and spent time in Wales trying to renew truces. As the disputed Hundred of Dudestan (Duddeston) included manors only a few miles from Tarvin, such as Christleton, Waverton and Stapleford, the choice of Tarvin for the prebend (apart from it already being an episcopal manor) may have been carefully chosen to be on a boundary, but not as suggested above a boundary with the Forest of Delamere, but on the boundary between England and the disputed parts of the England/Wales border. These were the days of Llywelyn who was reported to have a strong alliance with the 6th Earl of Chester. Ormerod's accounts show that this relationship between Tarvin and the Bishops of Lichfield and Coventry (the two bishoprics were merged in 1228) became long term, and continued until 10 April 1550 (well into the English Reformation), when \\"Richard, bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, granted this manor to Sir John Savage\\". War Memorial outside St Andrews Church Under Sir John Savage, Tarvin was elevated to a market town. Tarvin Grammar School was founded by Randall Pickering junr., a freeman of the Haberdasher's Company living in St Martin Pomary, London, whose father was born in Tarvin. Having given ¬£40 in his lifetime for the building of a schoolhouse, his will of 1641The National Archives, Prerogative Court of Canterbury Registers, written 18 March 1640 Old Style, proved 9 April 1641 (PROB 11/185/476). gave a further ¬£20 for the finishing of it, the first schoolmaster to be nominated and chosen by his two executors, who were also his kinsmen. The will also provided an endowment of ¬£200 for purchase of lands, the rents from which were to support the school: lands were purchased in Tattenhall.Nicholas Carlisle, A Concise Description of the Endowed Grammar Schools in England and Wales Vol. 1 (Baldwin, Cradock and Joy, London 1818), p. 127. See also Read here. The number of children was limited to 20 (of whom 6 to be from the 'towne of Tarvin' and the rest 'in the other townes belonging to the parish of Tarvin'), and there was a house for the master. The ten feoffees for the management of the trust were to be inhabitants of the town. One of the masters (for 36 years) was John Thomasen, described as the finest penman in England, and responsible for translating many works from Greek, notably Icon Basilike for Queen Anne. The grammar school survived until final closure in 1939. Restored in 1997, the building is to the left approaching the entrance to St. Andrew's church, and is used as parish rooms. The endowment survives and individual grants from it are available via the Tarvin Educational Foundation (registered charity 525966) \\"to assist the educational needs of students of secondary school age or older who live in the ancient parish of Tarvin.\\" ==Civil War== During the Civil War, because of its proximity to Chester, Tarvin did not escape. The village changed hands several times. Initially it was occupied by Parliamentarians (Roundheads). On 12 November 1643 there was a skirmish between the garrison and Royalist (Cavaliers) from Chester. In January 1644 there was another skirmish. In July 1644 the Cavaliers occupied Tarvin and they beat off a large Roundhead assault. In September the Roundheads captured the place and occupied it with a strong garrison within strong earthworks. The Parliamentary governor of Tarvin was sufficiently confident in the strength of his fortifications and the size of his garrison that he refused to surrender to the Cavaliers even when it was known that Charles I was in the area with an army. Tarvin remained in Roundhead hands until the end of the war. cites Edward Burghall Diary (Providence improved). The church shows signs of its part in the battles: there are cannonball and musketball holes in the wall of the church tower next to the west door. It has been said that prisoners were shot against this wall, which explains some of the bullet holes. The church was also used as a refuge by soldiers and the tower was probably used as a lookout post. ==Later history== Tarvin Hall On the last day of April 1752 at about noon, the Great Fire of Tarvin broke out in the north-west part of the village. Fanned by strong winds, the fire burned down the greater part of the place within a couple of hours, leaving the timber-framed buildings of Church Cottages and Bull‚Äôs Cottage (opposite Tarvin Hall) standing at its extremities. Remarkably no one died, though several horses were lost, and even the drink in the cellars of some of the inns was destroyed.Country News, Manchester Mercury, Tuesday 8th May 1753 The City of Chester, by way of a collection from house to house, collected ¬£300 to aid the sufferers. Many of the buildings in Tarvin date from the rebuilding and remodelling in the following years, and little is known of the original village layout, though many of the buildings have their foundations directly cut into the sandstone and these foundations may well pre-date the fire. In the 18th century England was progressively being covered with turnpike roads (toll roads), which were created by Act of Parliament. The turnpike from Lichfield direction, via Nantwich and Tarporley, was subject to an act in 1769 that decided it would be re-routed via Tarvin instead of the former route to Chester via Stapleford. At the same time the road from Northwich was also re-routed to go via Tarvin.K. Lawrence, \\"The Turnpike Roads Around Nantwich Cheshire\\", 2013 (http://www.turnpikes.org.uk/Nantwich%20Turnpikes%20-%20Keith%20Lawrence.pdf) Listed building in Tarvin Ormerod lists the populations of local villages in the returns to parliament of 51st year of George III's reign (1811), with 921 in Tarvin, and a total of 2,986 through the parish of Tarvin, which included Ashton, Bruen Stapleford, Burton, Clotton Hoofield, Duddon, Hockenhull, Horton cum Peele, Kelsal (sic), Mouldsworth, Tarvin, and Wildington. From 1875, Tarvin was indirectly served by Barrow for Tarvin railway station more than two miles (3 km) distant on the Cheshire Lines Committee route from Chester to Manchester; the line remains open but the station closed in June 1953, though it still stands albeit in poor condition and is now privately owned. In the 1960s the village was expanded substantially and there was a major influx of the young families of white-collar workers from the major companies in the area. == Present day == High Street, Tarvin The Tarvin Neighbourhood Plan is currently being drafted, with informal consultation due to take place in 2018. Following this, a statutory consultation is required to take place before a Parish referendum. A Village Design Statement has also been produced, which looks to ensure that both buildings and landscape are in keeping with the existing character of the Village. St Andrew's Church is an Anglican, Grade I Listed parish church in the diocese of Chester located in the village. The current vicar is Revd Adam Lyndon David Friend. Church Street, Tarvin The Tarvin Community Woodland runs for about alongside the A51, and covers , with a footpath and a bridleway. In 1997, the land was granted to Tarvin Parish Council as a public amenity by the Highways Agency, as it was at the time. This was the first example of using surplus Highways Agency land for the benefit of the community. The first trees were planted in 1997 to commemorate those who lost their lives from the village during the First and Second World Wars. In 2008, the Community Woodland Trust became a charitable trust. In 2017, the Community Wodland received a Green Flag Award, the mark of a quality park or green space, for the eighth consecutive year. In 2015, the woodland was further extended, and in 2016 the Community Woodland Trust became a not- for-profit company limited by guarantee, taking ownership of both the freeholds from Cheshire West and Chester Council of the existing land, and Taylor Wimpey from the extended woodland.

He was born at East Haddam, Connecticut. Emmons graduated at Yale in 1767, studied theology under the Rev. John Smalley (1734‚Äì1820) at Berlin, Connecticut, and was licensed to preach in 1769. After preaching four years in New York and New Hampshire, he became, in April 1773, pastor of the Second church at Franklin (until 1778 a part of Wrentham, Massachusetts), of which he remained in charge until May 1827, when failing health compelled his relinquishment of active ministerial cares. He lived, however, for many years thereafter, dying of old age at Franklin on the 23rd of September 1840. It was as a theologian that Emmons was best known, and for half a century probably no clergyman in New England exerted so wide an influence. He developed an original system of divinity, somewhat on the structural plan of that of Samuel Hopkins, and, in Emmons's own belief, contained in and evolved from Hopkinsianism. While by no means abandoning the tenets of the old Calvinistic faith, he came to be looked upon as the chief representative of what was then known as the New Divinity. His system declared that holiness and sin are free voluntary exercises; that men act freely under the divine agency; that the slightest transgression deserves eternal punishment; that it is through God's mere grace that the penitent believer is pardoned and justified; that, in spite of total depravity, sinners ought to repent; and that regeneration is active, not passive, with the believer. Emmonsism was spread and perpetuated by more than a hundred clergymen, whom he personally trained. Politically, he was an ardent patriot during the American War of Independence, and a strong Federalist afterwards, several of his political discourses attracting wide attention. He was a founder and the first president of the Massachusetts Missionary Society, and was influential in the establishment of Andover Theological Seminary. More than two hundred of his sermons and addresses were published during his lifetime. His Works were published in 6 vols (Boston, 1842; new edition, 1861). See also the Memoir, by Dr EA Park (Andover, 1861). ==Early life and education== Born in East Haddam, Connecticut, Emmons was the sixth son, and twelfth and youngest child, of Samuel and Ruth (Cone) Emmons.William Buell Sprague, Annals of the American Pulpit: Trinitarian Congregational (1857), p. 693-696. Both his parents were professors of religion, and he was the subject of an early Christian training. Early in his life, his father intended to give Nathaniel a liberal education, and to allow him to enter some one of the professions; but on witnessing his volatile, trifling spirit, he changed-his mind, and determined to sober his views by making him a farmer.David Sherman, Sketches of New England Divines (1860), p. 361-370. Emmons, however, never cared for labor, and intended in some way to escape it if possible. Being indisposed to agricultural pursuits, to which his childhood and early youth were devoted, and having an ardent thirst for knowledge, he gained his father's consent to commence a course of classical study. He studied vigorously, and after ten months he was admitted to Yale College in September, 1763. He graduated in 1767, in the same class as John Treadwell, John Trumbull, and several other of the noted New England natives. Emmons lost his father about three months before his graduated, inheriting only a bequest for defraying the expenses of his education. Emmons devoted a few months to the business of teaching, and then went to reside with the Rev. Nathan Strong of Coventry, Connecticut, as a theological student. However, after a short time, he placed himself under the instruction of the Rev. John Smalley, of Berlin, who had then the reputation of being one of the ablest Divines in New England. Of his early religious history Emmons stated that \\"by reading the life of a pious youth, I was sensibly struck with a conviction of my great guilt and the awful thought of dying unprepared\\", noting that \\"[w]hen one of my sisters died of consumption, my fears about myself were again alarmed, and I had some lively apprehensions of the state of the damned, especially of the lake that burned with fire and brimstone\\". Emmons further described the feelings that led him to pursue a career in the ministry: ==Ministry== Emmons was licensed to preach by the South Association of Hartford County, in October, 1769. The examination which he underwent, on that occasion, was, on several points, unsatisfactory to a part of the Association,‚Äîparticularly on the doctrines of depravity, regeneration, human and Divine agency. Several of the older clergymen voted against his licensure, and one of them, the Rev. Mr. Eells of Middletown, went so far as to throw in a written remonstrance. Emmons may have originally been somewhat inclined to Arminian views. Under the teachings of the Rev. Strong, he embraced Calvinism, as embodied in the writings of theologians like Thomas Ridgeley and Samuel Willard. Subsequently, under Dr. Smalley, he become, in the then popular acceptation of the word, a new-school man. The points which were specially agitated at his examination, came up for discussion, at several subsequent meetings of the Association, and the result was the formation of a \\"conciliatory creed\\" upon the points in question, in which the different parties agreed to unite. Having preached in various places for nearly four years, he accepted a call from the church in Franklin, then the Second church in Wrentham, Massachusetts, to become their pastor, formally begin his pastorship there on April 21, 1773. Emmons was a zealous Whig during the American Revolution. He spoke publicly and without hesitation in favor of independence, which caused some hostility in his congregation, which was considerably divided on the issue. He also went through some financial distress during the war, due to the irregular and partial payment of his salary. Both his prosperity and his popularity rebounded after the conclusion of the war. Emmons considered himself an intellectual theologian, rather than an orator, and sought to influence his parishioners with reasoned arguments rather than stirring speeches. However, he was noted to have \\"a kind of haughty confidence in his own creed ... as though all his tenets were the accredited verities of heaven\\", which \\"caused him to think disparagingly of all other creeds\\". A Universalist once replied to a sermon of his, and published the sermon and reply in the same pamphlet. A friend asked Emmons what he thought of it. \\"It is against the law,\\" said Emmons, \\"for Moses says, 'Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.'\\" In 1798 he received an honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity from Dartmouth College. The New England magazine wrote of him: Throughout his life, Emmons abstained almost entirely from alcohol, seldom drank tea or coffee, and ate simply and in moderate quantities. He studied from twelve to seventeen hours a day, seldom leaving his study for anything but meals, rest, and his parochial duties. He was described as \\"a man of strong convictions and an indomitable will, which gave to his character an aspect of sternness, of chilly dignity\\". ==Personal life== In 1775, Emmons married Deliverance, daughter of Moses French, of Braintree, Massachusetts, who was said to have been \\"a pattern of prudence, condescension, benevolence, and faithfulness\\". However, she quickly fell into a decline, and died in June, 1778. Within two months from her death, his two little sons, the only surviving members of his family, suddenly sickened and died in one day, and were buried in the same grave. His recorded reflections on the occasion show that, while his heart was deeply smitten, it was full of humble trust in the Divine wisdom and goodness. Within about a year and four months from the death of his first wife, he Emmons married Martha, daughter of the Rev. Chester Williams of Hadley, Massachusetts. He found her to be a companion not only distinguished for her excellent intellectual and moral qualities, but of such exemplary domestic habits as to relieve him, in a great measure, from the ordinary cares of his family. By this marriage he had six children, two sons and four daughters. In 1813, Emmons' second daughter died, followed within a few years by another son and daughter. Emmons' second wife, Martha, died in August, 1829, when Emmons was 85. In 1831, Emmons married for the third time, to the widow of the late Rev. Edmund Mills of Sutton, Massachusetts. His health and spirits seemed to revive, so that he was enabled to endure the fatigue of several journeys of considerable length. ==Later life and death== In May, 1827, Emmons fainted at the pulpit, in the midst of his discourse, and had to be carried home. He was able, however, on the next Sabbath, to finish his discourse. It was listened to with uncommon interest, in part because the impression was very general in the congregation that it would prove to be, as it actually did, his last public service. On the next Sabbath he sent a letter resigning his pastoral charge, and requesting that the congregation make immediate provision for the supply of the pulpit. His resignation was accepted with some objections, but Emmons continued ministering in private. After he retired from the active duties of his office, he spent a large part of his time in reading. In the summer and autumn of 1840, his strength began perceptibly to decline, he died at about three o'clock on Wednesday morning, September 23, 1840. His funeral was held the following Monday, and a sermon was preached by the Rev. Thomas Williams, from Ecclesiastes XII, 9; which was published. ==See also== * Seraph Frissell *Herman Daggett ==References== ==External links== *Entry \\"Emmons, Nathanael\\" in New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge Category:Yale College alumni Category:1745 births Category:1840 deaths Category:American theologians Category:People from East Haddam, Connecticut Category:People of Connecticut in the American Revolution Category:American Congregationalist ministers ","title":"Nathanael Emmons"},{"id":"2561316","text":"Jo√´l Marc Abati (born 25 April 1970, in Fort-de-France, Martinique) is a French handball player who has played ten years for SC Magdeburg in Germany until 2007.Focus.de After returning to France and playing two years for Montpellier HB he ended his professional career in 2009, having won numerous prizes for his clubs and his country.

After withdrawal, it was sent to Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, South Wales, where it remained for a number of years before being bought for preservation. It returned to steam in 1989 and has since been certified for mainline running. The locomotive is currently undergoing a 10 yearly major overhaul to mainline running condition. ==GWR/BR Operation== King Edward I at Didcot Railway Centre Built at by the Great Western Railway's (GWR) Swindon Works in June 1930, for most of its working life it was allocated to Plymouth Laira. Transferred to Old Oak Common, London, in March 1959, and finally to Cardiff Canton TMD in 1962. Sent to Swindon Works for breaking up, it had one final unusual task - coupled to its twin, 6023 King Edward II, it was towed over a bridge for weight testing purposes. Resultantly, with them now being closer to South Wales than Swindon, both locomotives survived and ended up being sold to Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, South Wales, where they languished in the company of 300 other locomotives. ==Restoration== Inspired by preserved class- mate 6000 King George Vs 1971 breach of British Rail's steam ban, in 1973 the King Preservation Society wanted to restore a locomotive to mainline condition. Both 6023 and 6024 were available for purchase, but 6024 was preferred, because after a derailment in the Barry yard 6023 had had its rear driving wheels torched through, and at the time was considered beyond repair. No 6024 was bought for ¬£4,000 in 1974, but, like many of the other remaining locomotives, was missing significant components, including: its double-chimney (currently fitted to No. 6000); piston, connecting and eccentric rods; and its slide-bars had been cut through. King Edward I at Didcot in 2011. The 36th locomotive to be rescued from Barry, 6024 was moved to the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre at Quainton Road.Kings at Quainton The Railway Magazine issue 865 May 1973 page 255 After 16 years, including the creation of the Club100 funding initiative, on 2 February 1989, 6024 moved again under its own power. Re-commissioned on 26 April 1989 by the Duke of Gloucester, in October 1989 the engine was moved by low-loader from Quainton Road to the Birmingham Railway Museum, from where it completed its mainline test runs. On 15 April 1990, it resumed its mainline career hauling revenue-earning passenger trains.King Edward I in steam at Tyseley The Railway Magazine issue 1064 December 1989 page 768 In recognition of the high standard to which the locomotive had been restored, 6024 was outright winner of the 1990 British Coal sponsored Heritage Award (for a restoration project using coal), and awarded a ¬£3,000 prize which was put towards the restoration of a British Railways Mark 1 BSK coach, for transporting support crew and equipment for mainline work. ==Mainline tours== High Speed Train while taking water at while working a Torbay Express service. The society was invited by British Rail to provide 6024 to haul the InterCity VIP special on 19 May 1990. In July 1990 it appeared at the National Railway Museum Exhibition On Tour which was held at Swindon Works, where it celebrated its 60th anniversary and was stabled alongside classmate 6000 King George V. Affectionately nicknamed \\"Spud One\\" the locomotive was used for an expanding mainline tour programme, based at either Tyseley, Didcot or Hereford Railway Centre. In late 1991 the locomotive was invited to haul the \\"William Shakespeare Express\\" from London Paddington, its first appearance there for almost thirty years. As open access to the national network brought more routes into play in early 1992, 6024 was increasingly seen hauling passenger charter trains on a number of previously banned routes, including the mainlines to the West of England via Bristol, and South Wales through the Severn Tunnel. Fitted with BR's standard Automatic Warning System (permitting speeds up to 75 mph), 6024 reintroduced steam- hauled express passenger trains to a number of new destinations within western zones for the first time for many years. In August 1992 the locomotive made its promised return to Quainton Road, this time via the mainline, when in the company of 5029 Nunney Castle it hauled shuttles to and from Aylesbury. However, plans to take a train to Plymouth were thwarted by the locomotive's cab height preventing it from passing an over-bridge at Plympton. ==Modifications== After running almost 10,000 mainline miles, in March 1995 the locomotive was withdrawn from traffic for its heavy overhaul at the end of its mainline boiler certificate, and it retired to a secure Ministry of Defence site at Kineton in Warwickshire for the Society to carry out the work. In September 1996 it reappeared with a number of small but significant modifications, incorporated in order to make it more adaptable and to increase its availability. The modifications included the fitting of dual-braking equipment (air and vacuum) to increase flexibility in the use of passenger rolling stock, and the reduction of its chimney, safety valves and cab-roof heights to permit it to fit within the standard loading gauge. This allowed it to make its return to Plymouth, first double-headed in November 1996, and then in April 1997 running solo. This was the first time an unassisted steam locomotive had been entrusted with a passenger train over the route since the early 1960s. In August 2002 6024 broke the record for steam haulage with the fastest modern-day time for the 52 miles from Plymouth to Exeter, in 58 minutes 6 seconds. With a further 15,000 mainline miles on the clock, in October 2002 the locomotive was again withdrawn for its second major overhaul, which was being carried out by the Society within the site of Tyseley Locomotive Works. To keep pace with safety improvements, the locomotive was fitted with standard Train Protection & Warning System, and the society also completed its Water Wagon project for mainline trials. This will enable mainline water-stops to be avoided on certain routes. It returned to the mainline on 7 October 2004, on its third 7-year main line certificate. ==Royal train== Royal Train on the Severn Valley Railway On 10 June 2008, 6024 hauled the Royal Train, with Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall on board, from Kidderminster Town to Bridgnorth on the Severn Valley Railway. Between Bewdley and Arley, the Prince of Wales drove the locomotive. Before leaving the SVR to resume its mainline appointments a broken tender axlebox was discovered that delayed its departure. Once repaired, a further delay was incurred by a defect in the air pump. ==Royal Scot Locomotive & General Trust== Following an internal dispute within the 6024 Society which had owned the locomotive since its preservation, an unsuccessful legal case was pursued in 2010 by the owning Trusts board against the former Chief Mechanical Engineer, which resulted in a loss in the High Court. The resulting requirement to pay compensation and both parties' legal costs totalling over ¬£500,000, resulted in the society becoming deficient in liquid cash funds. Following discussions with various interested parties in December 2010, the society agreed to sell the locomotive to the Royal Scot Locomotive and General Trust, chaired by investor and steam enthusiast Jeremy Hosking. The locomotive is currently undergoing a 10 yearly heavy general overhaul at the West Somerset Railway's workshops at , Somerset, from April 2012. ==References== ==External links== *Official Society website 6024 Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1930 6024 Category:Locomotives saved from Woodham Brothers scrapyard Category:Standard gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain Category:4-6-0 locomotives ","title":"GWR 6000 Class 6024 King Edward I"},{"id":"2561328","text":"Belprahon is a municipality in the Jura bernois administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

Throughout most of its history, Belprahon was part of the lands of Moutier-Grandval Abbey and the Abbey's college of canons. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Belprahon became part of the French D√©partement of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the D√©partement of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Belprahon was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. The village was bypassed by the major roads through the Grand Val and so for most of its history was generally rural and agricultural. In the 1960s many commuters moved into the village and by 1990 three-quarters of the working population commuted to jobs in other towns. A majority of the workers who work in the municipality now work in the services sector. It is the only municipality in the Grand Val that is not part of the parish of Grandval.
