Hailed as the father of China‚Äôs classical music, the Li Delun National Conducting Competition was named after him in honour of his contribution to the development of classical music in China. ==Career== In 1946, with support from Zhou Enlai (who in 1949 became the first Prime Minister of the People's Republic of China) Li Delun took an assortment of donated musical instruments to the city of Yan'an and became the founder, instructor, and conductor of China's first professional symphony orchestra. In 1953, he went to Moscow to further his studies under the celebrated conductor Professor Nikolai Anosov. He returned to China in 1957 after graduating from the Moscow Conservatory and was made conductor of the China Central Philharmonic and was put in charge to provide music at state and diplomatic functions such as entertaining important visitors such as Henry Kissinger on his earlier secret diplomatic missions to Beijing. Towards the end of the cultural revolution, despite of China's political tumult of the late 1960s, when all \\"decadent\\" music was banned, Maestro bravely presented Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in a concert commemorating the 150th anniversary of Beethoven's death. The event broke the ban on public performances of western music and drew worldwide attention and signaled the reemergence of classical music in China. In 1979, Maestro Li joined hands with American violinist Isaac Stern to perform the violin concertos of Mozart and Brahms. This historical musical collaboration was captured in the Academy Award-winning documentary From Mao to Mozart, which offered some of the first glimpses of a newly opening China. In the ensuing years, Li served as a bridge between musicians from China and abroad, performing with artists such as David Oistrakh, Isaac Stern, Yehudi Menuhin, Yo-Yo Ma, Fou Tsong, Liu Shikun, Yin Chengzong and many others. The China Central Philharmonic Society traveled the world performing under his baton, and he guest-conducted numerous international orchestras, including the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and Vancouver Symphony Orchestra in 1986 and 1989 respectively. Maestro Li's professional and philanthropic work earned him rewards and accolades around the world. He adjudicated for the International Tchaikovsky Cello Competition in Moscow in 1990 and the Yehudi Menuhin International Competition for Young Violinists in Paris. Some of his many awards include the Liszt Medal of Decoration awarded by Hungarian government and the Presidential Friendship Medal conferred by former Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Li believed that classical music was not rarefied art for the upper class but rather something to be enjoyed by all. He was a tireless advocate for classical music and spent his free time lecturing on the subject of music enjoyment throughout China, presenting its beauty and sophistication with a simple and humorous delivery to university students and factory workers alike, making it appealing to the younger generation as well as the general public. On October 19, 2001, Li Delun died at age 84 in a Beijing hospital, after having lived a full and meaningful life dedicated to music. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Conductor info *Scholar.ilib.cn *China Culture *Film Credit *Li Delun Conducting Competition Category:Chinese conductors (music) Category:1917 births Category:2001 deaths Category:20th- century conductors (music) ","title":"Li Delun"},{"id":"20497431","text":"Chasing Kangaroos: A Continent, a Scientist, and a Search for the World's Most Extraordinary Creature, is a 2007 book () by Professor Tim Flannery.

Much of it landed outside the perimeter of the camp and was lost. The final attack was to start on July 10, and the LTTE started building up forces around the camp. Reinforcements for the soldiers at the camp were not able to arrive because the routes were blocked. That evening the SLA soldiers were left with only 300 rounds of ammunition. By next morning some 30 soldiers were still alive, half of them seriously wounded. The SLA commanding officer, Lieutenant Aladeniya, was given the order to evacuate, but he refused because he did not want to leave his wounded men. On the evening of July 11, communication with the camp was lost. At 11:45 p.m. the camp was overrun. == Aftermath == All of the 69 officers and soldiers were declared missing in action by the Sri Lankan Army as it could not reach the location. The LTTE destroyed the relay station and tower. Lieutenant Saliya Aladeniya was posthumously promoted to rank of captain and honoured with the highest award for bravery, the Parama Weera Vibhushanaya on 21 June 1994. Kokavil was recaptured by troops from the 57 Division in October 2008 during the Battle of Kilinochchi (2008‚Äì2009).

Prathama Blood Centre is blood bank situated at Ahmedabad, jointly established in 2000, by Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and Advanced Transfusion Medicine Research Foundation as non- profit voluntary organization.Prathama Blood Centre Piramal Prize.org. About 50,000 voluntary blood donors donate blood annually at Prathama which is India's first fully automated blood center. Prathama on World Thalassemia Day 2016, introduced Nucleic acid testing (NAT) of donated blood to reduce the risk of transfusion transmitted infections (TTIs) in people receiving blood. Transfusion of unsafe blood that has not been screened for window period, cases of viral infections could increase the risk of Transfusion Transmitted Infections (TTIs) and at times be life-threatening. NAT has proven effective in detecting such window period infections. Safe blood plays a life saving role in Thalassemia patients who need blood at regular intervals. Thalassemia prevalence in India is 3-4%, with 10,000 to 12,000 reported thalassemia births taking place every year. It is also estimated that there are 30 million thalassemia carriers in the country. With NAT tested blood, these patients live longer and maintain quality of life. The blood centre designed to expand in a modular manner to accommodate 150,000 units of blood per annum.

This diversity has been the source or instigator of conflict for centuries, and remains a major part of Russian political life today. While the Russian Empire, the USSR, and the Russian Federation were each made up of a majority of ethnic Russians, the minority groups have always been present to fight for their own languages, cultures, and religions. There are many different types of ethnic conflict, and the vast majority can only be understood with the help of a historical context. ==Background== Ethnic map of the Soviet Union (1941). The policies of Vladimir Lenin designated autonomous republics, provinces, regions, and districts for groups of non-Russian ethnicity. One of the most prominent attempts at resistance to Soviet control was in the Turkestan region of Central Asia by a Muslim guerrilla group called the Basmachi. The Basmachi Rebellion continued from 1918 to 1924, when the Soviet armies finally crushed the revolt with a mixture of military force, concessionary policies, and elimination of the majority of the region‚Äôs tribal and nationalist leaders. The leadership of Joseph Stalin reintroduced many of the assimilation policies of the imperial period, urging loyalty to the Soviet Union only. He opposed national autonomy to the extent that he replaced the leaders of each republic with ethnic Russian members of the Communist party and regularly removed leaders of ethnic nations from power. This policy continued through to the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev, who replaced the first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan with an ethnic Russian. This initiated the first major instance of ethnic violence, in which riots broke out among demonstrators and ten thousand Soviet troops were deployed to quell the revolt. Other conflicts followed in the late 1980s, including the Armenian‚ÄìAzerbaijani conflict over the Nagorno- Karabagh region, the Uzbek-Meskhetian Turk conflict over Uzbekistan‚Äôs Fergana Valley, and bids by numerous ethnic groups for Soviet republic status. ===Transition=== As the Soviet Union began to collapse, social disintegration and political instability fueled a surge in ethnic conflict. Social and economic disparities, along with ethnic differences, created an upsurge in nationalism within groups and discrimination between groups. In particular, disputes over territorial boundaries have been the source of conflict between states experiencing political transition and upheaval. Territorial conflicts can involve several different issues: the reunification of ethnic groups which have been separated, restoration of territorial rights to those who experienced forced deportation, and restoration of boundaries arbitrarily changed during the Soviet era. Territorial disputes remain significant points of controversy as minority groups consistently oppose election outcomes and seek autonomy and self-determination. In addition to territorial disputes and other structural causes of conflict, legacies from the Soviet and pre-Soviet eras, along with the suddenness of the actual sociopolitical change, have resulted in conflict throughout the region. As each group experiences dramatic economic reform and political democratization, there has been a surge in nationalism and interethnic conflict. Overall, the fifteen independent states that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union face problems stemming from uncertain identities, contested boundaries, apprehensive minorities, and an overbearing Russian hegemony. In particular, the post-Soviet Union territories continue to be especially vulnerable to \\"triadic\\" hostilities. Within this analysis, the newly independent states‚Äînationalizing states‚Äîare in tension with the \\"homeland\\" state of Russia who will attempt to protect Russian ethnic minorities within the new states. Each of the incipient fifteen states except for Armenia had in 1989 substantive Russian minority populations, a cause for conflict between Russia and its former autonomous republics. ==Examples== There are several stages of ethnic conflict, all of which have been present in the years following the collapse of the Soviet Union. These include claims presented in the form of declarations, introduction to and support of these claims by the masses, conflict not resulting in casualties, conflicts involving casualties, and interethnic wars. Of the total number of recorded ethnic conflicts, 40% remain in one of the first two stages, while 15% have reached the third or fourth stage. Conflicts such as the Armenia‚ÄìAzerbaijan, Georgia‚ÄìOssetia, Georgia‚ÄìAbkhazia, Ossetia‚ÄìIngush, and Moldova‚ÄìTransnistria conflicts have escalated to final stage, involving warfare. A predominance of these instances of ethnic conflict is located in the Caucasus and the Central Asian regions as a result of territorial disputes and political unrest. In addition, conflict between Russia and other former Soviet states has accounted for a large amount of present conflicts. Hostilities between Russia and grou that remain a large part of social and political relations both among and within each state. Some minor territorial conflicts occur minimally in current times; but has not escalated to a level of concern. ==Notes== Category:History of the Soviet Union Soviet Union Category:Ethnic groups in the Soviet Union ","title":"Ethnic conflicts in the Soviet Union"},{"id":"20497497","text":"Liberty High School is a comprehensive four-year public high school located in Clarksburg, West Virginia, in Harrison County, West Virginia, United States, that operates as part of the Harrison County School District.

Livengood had blocked the student from leaving the restroom before questioning him on why he was in there instead of the \\"girl's\\" restroom. According to the Associated Press (AP), after the student replied that it is his legal right to use that restroom, Livengood instructed him to \\"prove\\" his male sex by using the urinal in front of him. Upon leaving the restroom, Livengood said to him \\"Not going to lie, you freak me out.\\" According to NBC news, the ACLU's West Virginia chapter stated that it has asked the Harrison County schools superintendent to take administrative action against Livengood. Also according to NBC, the West Virginia ACLU chapter stated that \\"it is seeking best-practice policies and training in the school system for dealing with transgender students and issues.\\" According to the AP, the ACLU West Virginia executive director Joseph Cohen responded to this event, calling it \\"a life or death issue.\\" In their report, the AP cited The American Academy of Pediatrics, which published a study in 2018 showing 51% of trans male adolescents had attempted suicide. As of date of this entry, the superintendent of Liberty High School, Dr. Mark Manchin, has not responded to news media's requests for comment. Livengood has since then regained his status as assistant principal.

Specifically, Consumer Insights is a field that focuses on analyzing market research and acting as a bridge between Research and Marketing departments within a company. Commonly referred to as CI, it is the intersection between the interests of the consumer and the features of a brand. Its main purpose is to understand why the consumer cares for the brand as well as their underlying mindsets, moods, motivation, desires, aspirations, that motivates and trigger their attitude and actions. Another definition of consumer insight is the collection, deployment, and interpretation of information that allows a business to acquire, develop and retain their customers. A customer insight can be more precisely defined as : \\"A non-obvious understanding about your customers, which if acted upon, has the potential to change their behaviour for mutual benefit\\". This latter definition is explained further in an article by Paul Laughlin for the Institute of Direct & Digital Marketing's Journal.Laughlin, P (2015) \\"Holistic Customer Insight as an engine of growth\\", Institute of Direct & Digital Marketing (IDM) Journal of Direct, Data & Digital Marketing Practice Vol 16 Issue 2 The author emphasises four components of this definition: First, such insight is ‚Äúnon-obvious‚Äù, so it does not normally come from just one source of information and often does not come from just analysis or just research; rather there is a need to converge evidence to glean insights. Second, true insights need to be ‚Äúaction-able‚Äù; hypotheses that stay theoretical and cannot be tested in practice are not insights. Third, customer insights should be powerful enough that when they are acted upon customers can be persuaded to \\"change their behaviour\\". Just benefitting from targeting based on analysing past behaviour and assuming people will be creatures of habit does not reveal any depth of understanding them, certainly not insight. Fourth, to be sustainable, the goal of such customer change must be for \\"mutual benefit\\". As Peppers, D. (2008). \\"Rules to Break and Laws to Follow\\". New Jersey, John Wiley & Sons. argues, a key law for marketing today is ‚Äúearn and keep the trust of your customers‚Äù, which is achieved by acting in their best interests as well as the long term value for the organisation. ==Analysis== Firstly, the collected data must be audited to fully understand the quality and opportunity within the database. Once this is done, several different types of analysis can be applied. Impact Assessment will help a business to understand how actions taken by the business affected their customer behavior, and also allow for some predictions of customer reaction to proposed changes. Customers as Assets measures the lifetime value of the customer base and allows businesses to measure several factors such as the cost of acquisition and the rate of churn. Propensity Modelling predicts the future behaviour of customers based on previous actions and helps businesses understand how likely it is that a customer will behave in a given way. Cross-Sell Analysis identifies product and service relationships to better understand which are the most popular product combinations. Any identified relationships can then be used to cross- sell and up-sell in the future. Critical Lag allows a business to deliver specific customer communications based on an individual's purchase patterns, helping to increase loyalty and improve customer retention. The above components only cover the scope of customer analysis or marketing analysis. Best practice is now expanding to including customer data management, behavioural analysis, predictive analytics, consumer research and database marketing. ==References== Category:Customer experience ","title":"Customer insight"},{"id":"20497707","text":"Taisun lifts the 17,100-ton deck box of the Scarabeo 9 semisubmersible. Taisun (; Taishan) is the name of the world's strongest crane which has a safe working load of 20,000 metric tons (22,046 short tons). Taisun is designed and built for the installation of very large modules in semi submersibles and FPSO projects and located at Yantai Raffles Shipyard in Yantai, Shandong Province, China. The crane holds the three heaviest lifts of all time: 20,133 metric tons, 17,100 tons and 14,000 tons. Taisun seen lifting the 14,000-ton deck box of the COSL Pioneer drilling semisubmersible. == Concept == Taisun was built to install very large (up to 20,000 ton) integrated modules on top of a vessel's hull. Traditionally, offshore vessels such as drilling semi submersibles or FPSOs were built from the ground up in modules of 1000 to 2000 tons, which meant that much installation, hook up and commissioning work was left to be done on board where access is limited and efficiency lower. Taisun facilitates simultaneous construction of the lower and upper parts of the vessel which allows for a shorter overall project schedule, manpower improvements of up to two million man-hours while safety and quality levels are improved.

The status, afforded to nationals from some countries affected by armed conflict or natural disaster, allows persons to live and work in the United States for limited times.D'Vera Cohn & Jeffery S. Passel, More than 100,000 Haitian and Central American immigrants face decision on their status in the U.S., Pew Research Center (November 8, 2017). Currently, persons from ten countries--Haiti, El Salvador, Syria, Nepal, Honduras, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan, Nicaragua and South Sudan--have temporary protected status. About 320,000 people have TPS as of 2017, the majority from El Salvador (195,000), Honduras (57,000), and Haiti (46,000). ==History== In 1990, as part of the Immigration Act of 1990 (\\"IMMACT\\"), P.L. 101-649, Congress established a procedure by which the Attorney General may provide temporary protected status to immigrants in the United States who are temporarily unable to safely return to their home country because of ongoing armed conflict, an environmental disaster, or other extraordinary and temporary conditions.\\"Pub. L. 101-649 Immigration Act of 1990\\". United States Department of Justice. March 4, 2009. Retrieved January 8, 2018.Ostrow, Ronald J. (November 30, 1990). \\"Bush signs immigration reform law\\". Austin American-Statesman (Austin, Texas). p. A2. On March 1, 2003, pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Public Law 107-296, the former Immigration and Naturalization Services of the Department of Justice was divided into three different agencies under the Department of Homeland Security, namely U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (USCBP). As of October 2017, the authority to designate a country for temporary protected status rests with the United States Secretary of Homeland Security. TPS beneficiaries and those who are found preliminarily eligible for TPS upon initial review of their cases are not removable from the United States, can obtain employment authorization (with an Employment Authorization Document/EAD), and may be granted travel authorization via Form I-131, Application for Travel Document. By 2017, the temporary protected status program covered people from ten countries, namely El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Liberia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. By November 2017, about 300,000 foreign nationals were recipients of protection under temporary protected status.About 2,500 Nicaraguans to Lose Special Permission to Live in U.S. By Ron Nixon Nov. 6, 2017 Some have been in the United States since the 1990s. Deferred Enforced Departure is a status similar to temporary protected status. It covers those who formerly had TPS from certain countries prior to its termination. It is active for Liberia through March 30, 2020 and covers those who had TPS as of the termination of the second most recent TPS designation of Liberian on September 30, 2007. Liberians covered by DED, as well as some Liberians not covered by DED, may be eligible for permanent resident status (a Green Card) under recently enacted legislation known as Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness (LRIF). , the program had become a source of political controversy, with the administration of President Trump seeking to end protections and advocacy groups instead recommending a pathway to permanent residency status.UCLA Study Recommends Permanent Residence for Immigrants in Temporary Protected Status (September 5, 2020) ==Eligibility== Designation by the Attorney General of a country's nationals for temporary protected status allows all of those country's nationals who are in the United States on the day of the designation to apply for temporary protected status. Anyone from that country who enters after that date is not eligible. When the status comes up for expiration, the Attorney General of the United States may choose to redesignate, allowing that country's nationals who have entered since the original designation to apply, or to extend, which merely allows the previous recipients to maintain their status until the new expiration date. A person who is a national of a country, or a person having no nationality who last habitually resided in that country, designated for temporary protected status is eligible to apply for temporary protected status benefits if he or she: * Establishes the necessary continuous physical presence and continuous residence in the United States as specified by each designation; * Is not subject to one of the criminal, security- related, or other bars to temporary protected status; and * Applies for temporary protected status within the specified time period. If the Attorney General of the United States extends a temporary protected status designation beyond the initial designation period, the beneficiary must timely re-register to maintain his or her temporary protected status benefits under the temporary protected status program. A person is not eligible for temporary protected status if he or she: * Has been convicted of any felony or two or more misdemeanors committed in the United States; * Is a person who ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, or is otherwise subject to one of the bars to asylum; or * Is subject to one of several criminal-related or terrorism- related grounds of inadmissibility for which a waiver is not available. Late initial registration is available for those who did not apply during the initial registration period of a country's temporary protected status designation. In addition to meeting all of the other requirements for temporary protected status in one's own right (residence, physical presence, etc.), a late initial registrant must establish eligibility to file late by showing that one or more of the late initial filing conditions existed during the initial registration period and also within 60 days of filing the late initial temporary protected status application. Children and spouses of temporary protected status-eligible individuals cannot derive continuous residence or continuous physical presence from their parents or spouses for late initial filings. ==Injunctions From Implementing and Enforcing the Terminations of TPS for El Salvador, Nicaragua, Haiti, Sudan, Honduras, and Nepal== The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)'s previously announced decisions to terminate TPS for El Salvador, Nicaragua, Sudan, Haiti, Honduras, and Nepal as of certain dates are undergoing challenges in the court system. At least until the current litigation is resolved, the termination of TPS will not go into effect for these countries. Specifically: * On Oct. 3, 2018, in Ramos, et al. v. Nielsen, et al., No. 18-cv-01554 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 3, 2018), the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California enjoined DHS from implementing and enforcing the decisions to terminate TPS for Sudan, Nicaragua, Haiti and El Salvador, pending further resolution of the case. * The termination of TPS for Nepal and Honduras will also not go into effect until pending litigation is resolved. As required by the court-approved stipulation in Bhattarai v. Nielsen, No. 19-cv-731 (N.D. Cal), USCIS will extend appropriate TPS-related documentation (Employment Authorization Documents; Forms I-797, Notice of Action; and Forms I-94, Arrival/Departure Record) for eligible beneficiaries of TPS Honduras and TPS Nepal similar to the way it has for TPS beneficiaries in Ramos v. Nielsen. The terminations of TPS for Nepal and Honduras will not go into effect while appeals remain pending in Ramos, a case that presents issues much like those in Bhattarai. The \\"Automatic Extension of EADs Issued Under the TPS Designations for El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, and Sudan\\" and \\"Automatic Extension of Forms I-94 and Forms I-797\\" tables in the most recent Federal Register Notices (FRNs) for these countries state whether the validity of current TPS registrants' Employment Authorization Documents (EADs), TPS I-821 approval notices, and/or I-94s has been automatically extended without needing to file a new Form I-821 and/or Form I-765. The \\"Automatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension\\" section of each of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)'s country-specific TPS webpages also states which prior EAD, approval notice, and I-94 end validity dates have been automatically extended without the need to re-file as long as registrants maintain eligibility for TPS. Those whose TPS documents have been automatically extended can show their existing documentation and a copy of the relevant FRN to employers and agencies as verification of their continuing TPS and employment authorization.https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/temporary- protected-status/temporary-protected-status-designated-country-el-salvador Registrants whose EADs, I-821 approval notices, and/or I-94s have been automatically extended do not receive any notification of or documentation concerning the extension of validity other than the FRN itself. ==Impact of the Potential Terminations of TPS for El Salvador, Nicaragua, Haiti, Sudan, Honduras, and Nepal== Registrants who are poised to potentially lose TPS if it is terminated for their country and not continued based on an injunction have a number of options. Salvadorian official Roberto Lorenzana estimates that about half will be eligible to apply for permanent residence. Many are expected to stay in the United States illegally. However, those who do choose to stay in the United States illegally are expected to be much easier to deport than most undocumented immigrants because their home and workplace are known to the government through the application process for temporary protected status. C√©sar R√≠os of the Salvadorean Migrant Institute estimates that, at most, 15% of Salvadorians with temporary protected status will return to El Salvador if their status terminates.\\" Some have considered moving to Canada. The government of El Salvador has been in conversation with the government of Qatar about some of those formerly under temporary protected status working in Qatar temporarily. The United States has made an agreement with El Salvador to limit the number of deportation flights to eight a week, each with a maximum capacity of 135 people. This puts the maximum number of deportations at 56,000 Salvadoreans a year. Business owners and local governments in the United States have expressed concern about the economic impact of possibly enforcing TPS terminations on industries which depend on workers in the United States under temporary protected status. Deportation is expected to cause disruption in El Salvador and increase illegal immigration from El Salvador to the United States. A 2017 study by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center found that removing temporary protected status from Haitians, Salvadorans, and Hondurans would decrease Social Security and Medicare income by $6.9 billion, decrease Gross Domestic Product by $45.2 billion, and incur deportation costs of $3.1 billion over 10 years. Concerns also exist that if TPS is terminated for large numbers of registrants who have now lived and worked in the United States for decades under the program, numerous United States citizen children who currently reside with and depend on their TPS registrant parents or guardians will be impacted. ==Employment authorization== Temporary protected status applicants are eligible to receive an Employment Authorization Document based on temporary protected status only if they have a pending or approved initial Form I-821 (Application for Temporary Protected Status). Category C19 appears on Employment Authorization Documents issued while the initial Form I-821 is pending approval or denial; therefore, receiving a C19 Employment Authorization Document does not mean that an applicant has been granted temporary protected status. Category A12 appears on Employment Authorization Documents issued after the initial Form I-821 has been approved. During the period for which a country has been designated for temporary protected status, temporary protected status beneficiaries may remain in the United States and may obtain work authorization. A person in temporary protected status is considered as being in \\"lawful status as a nonimmigrant\\".\\"Immigration and Naturalization Act, Section 244(f). (8 U.S.C. 125)\\". United States Citizenship and Immigration Service. Temporary protected status does not provide a path to permanent resident status (green card) or United States citizenship. Temporary protected status is typically designated for between 6 and 18 months at a time for each country; once that time is up, the status expires and its beneficiaries revert to the same immigration status they maintained before temporary protected status (unless that status had since expired). Accordingly, if an immigrant did not have lawful status prior to receiving temporary protected status and did not obtain any other lawful status during the designation of temporary protected status, the person reverts to unlawful status upon the expiration of that designation of temporary protected status. However, employment authorization documentation (EADs) and/or TPS approval notices that appear to contain expired validity dates on their face may be automatically extended without the need to file a new Form I-821 and/or Form I-765 per the most recent Federal Register Notices (FRNs) for each country. ==Denial or withdrawal of application== 8 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Section 244.14 lists the grounds based on which USCIS may withdraw TPS. As long as the current designation of TPS for a registrant's country remains active, withdrawal of TPS must be by written notice from USCIS to the former TPS holder. Applicants are not eligible to file a re-registration temporary protected status application if their initial Form I-821 has been denied or if United States Citizenship and Immigration Services has withdrawn its prior approval of their TPS. The automatic validity extension of certain TPS documentation for countries covered by the injunctions/litigation (El Salvador, Nicaragua, Haiti, Sudan, Honduras, and Nepal) also does not apply for anyone whose TPS has been formally withdrawn by USCIS. If temporary protected status has been denied or withdrawn, however, it is possible to file another initial Form I-821. USCIS will treat the new initial Form I-821 as a late initial registration application. The full initial application fees must be paid for all multiple initial Form I-821s, and in Part 1 of the new initial Form I-821, Box A must be selected. If United States Citizenship and Immigration Services approves a subsequent initial Form I-821, the applicant's temporary protected status will be established or restored and she or he may thereafter file re-registration applications. Alternatively, an applicant whose temporary protected status has been denied or withdrawn may follow the instructions provided in the Notice of Denial or Withdrawal for filing a Form I-290B (Notice of Appeal or Motion) or, if applicable, seeking de novo review of TPS eligibility before an Immigration Judge in deportation or exclusion proceedings. ==NationalsNationals of countries that are under temporary protected status as of October 2019=== * -- since March 9, 2001; in response to the 2001 El Salvador earthquakes; temporary protected status of 263,280 Salvadorans was scheduled to end on September 9, 2019 prior to the injunction.Jordan, Miriam (January 8, 2018). \\"Trump Administration Rules That Nearly 200,000 Salvadorans Must Leave, Officials Say\\".

In the early 1990s, along with faux brothers Robbie and Scott, Gavin Hardkiss helped pioneer the American electronic music scene with the record label Hardkiss Music. Hardkiss quickly joined the ranks of the international DJ elite, DJing at raves and clubs in cities throughout the world, eventually reaching legendary status with the release of the classic double album, Delusions of Grandeur. Delusions of Grandeur reached number one on the Rolling Stone alternative charts. Gavin Hardkiss has produced multiple experimental albums under the guise of Hawke, remixing artists such as Youssou N‚ÄôDour, Mazzy Star, Elton John and Michael Franti, and performing alongside Africa Bambaataa, Derrick May, Snoop Dogg and The Buena Vista Social Club. In 2010, the song Mundo Via Afrika was featured on the official Sony World Cup album ‚ÄúHello Africa,‚Äù alongside the best of contemporary African musicians. In 2013, Gavin Hardkiss self-published a novel titled Cubic Lust. == Recordings == Gavin Bieber has recorded four albums and multiple singles under the guise of Hawke. The albums can be loosely described as a series of sound clashes, collaborations and musical experiments that veer off the path of conventional dance music. The first Hawke album, Namaquadisco, was released in 1998 on Sunburn Recordings in the USA and Distance in France. The album was recorded in Hyde Street Studios in San Francisco, CA's Tenderloin district. Heatstroke, recorded in the Hardkiss Studio based at Frisco Studios in the Lower Haight in San Francisco, was released by Six Degrees Records in 2000. The single Party People was a breakout into Billboard Magazine's Dance Charts. Love Won Another was recorded in a farm house in Calistoga California and released on Eighth Dimension Records in 2004. The album spawned two remix albums and several music videos. In 2009, an album titled +++, recorded in San Diego and San Rafael California, was released on Eighth Dimension Records. It was inaugurated with a series of art gallery shows in San Francisco, CA, Los Angeles and Orlando featuring multi-media works inspired by songs from the album. In 1998, Gavin Hardkiss created a three part musical landscape entitled Museo Hypnotica for the Jean Giraud designed Airtight Garage environment at the Sony Metreon in San Francisco. In 2008, Hardkiss worked with the Zukov Ballet Theater on original music production and DJ performance at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. Between 2011 and 2013, Gavin Hardkiss had a weekly radio show on pirate Radio Valencia called In My Boom, which highlighted local San Francisco dance music. In 2017, the Hawke album Love In Stars was released through a PledgeMusic crowdfunding campaign that included a treasure hunt for Gold USBs containing Hawke music which were hidden in the hills around the Bay Area. Insomniac Magazine called it a \\"Willy Wonka-style ... experiment in giving both artistic and economic value to a digital music project.\\" Hardkiss has also recorded music under aliases including The Lower Haight High Hitters, Curious Yellow and Sunburn Kidz. == References  External Links == * Hardkiss Music Website ‚Äì http://www.hardkiss.org/ * Gavin Hardkiss Blog ‚Äì http://gavinhardkiss.com/ * Discography ‚Äì http://www.discogs.com/artist/16473-Gavin-Hardkiss * Soundcloud - https://soundcloud.com/gavin-hardkiss * Facebook ‚Äì https://www.facebook.com/gavinhardkiss Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:South African dance musicians ","title":"Gavin Hardkiss"},{"id":"20497787","text":"The NHM-91 is a semi-automatic civilian development of the Russian Kalashnikov AKM and RPK infantry small arm built by Norinco of China and marketed in the U.S. by China Sports Inc. of Ontario, California (CSI Ont, CA).AK-47.net, Norinco NHM-91 ==Background== A civilian semi-auto variant of the Chinese Type 56 assault rifle, the NHM-91 was built to imitate the appearance of the Russian RPK light machine gun. First imported and marketed in the United States in 1991 by ChinaSports Inc., NHM-91's were modified to meet the requirements of a 1989 Executive Order by President George H. W. Bush prohibiting importation of certain 'assault rifle' configurations of military- style semi-automatic rifles such as the Norinco AKM/AK-47. These modifications included a one-piece U.S.-made thumbhole stock to replace the separate Chinese-made buttstock and pistol grip of the original AKM/RPK rifle and the inclusion of a rivet on the receiver preventing use of standard AK-47, RPK, or AKM magazines. All Chinese rifles were banned under the 1994 Clinton administration or AWB Ban and no Chinese AK variants were allowed to be imported. ==Features== Based on the Russian RPK light machine gun, the NHM features a stronger receiver and a longer, thicker-profile chrome-lined barrel measuring 20 inches (508mm) compared to the 590 mm (23.2 in) of the original RPK, along with a forward-mounted steel bipod. The NHM-91 was equipped from the factory with two 30-round magazines and a 75-round Chinese drum magazine. Like the RPK, the NHM-91 utilizes a heavier-gauge stamped sheet metal receiver built from 1.5mm-thick stamped sheet metal instead of the 1mm thickness typical of a Soviet or European AKM. Other Chinese-made AKM rifles such as the MAK 90 and NHM 90 have thicker receivers as well, resulting in increased rigidity, heavier weight, and improved overall accuracy. The MAK 90 rifles may have either a straight cut stamped receiver or a slant cut stamped receiver. Both were imported after the 1989 ban with thumb hole stocks. The MAK 91 has the long barrel as well, but features a milled, slant cut receiver. The longer, heavier barrel reduces shot dispersion and gives the NHM-91 and MAK 91 rifles a longer sight radius, again resulting in improved accuracy over the typical semi-auto AKM. Trigger pull weight is also lighter than other AK designs, and some users report the rifle capable of 2-2.5 minutes of angle accuracy or better with factory 7.62√ó39mm ammunition. All post ban rifle stocks on the NHM-91 are of a one-piece thumbhole design with integral pistol grip, and are thicker and longer than the standard AKM/AK-47 buttstock. Made by E.C. Bishop or BoydBoyd's Gun Stocks and constructed from birch wood or hackberry, the NHM-91 buttstock lacks a separate pistol grip, though the rifle may be retrofitted with a separate buttstock by simply cutting off the lower portion of the stock and grip with a band saw, then fitting a new pistol grip. Like its RPK counterpart, the NHM-91 does not come equipped from the factory with a bayonet lug. However, on post ban models, the front of the barrel is threaded and capped off with a thread protector welded onto the threads or the threads are deleted altogether. By removing the thread protector, a muzzle brake can be fitted.Guns.net Some factory NHM-91 rifles were manufactured with a rivet in the magazine release button, preventing use of some Soviet or German-made AKM or AK-47 magazines. Instead, special magazines with a modified tang were manufactured by Norinco for the NHM-91. Since the sunset of the 1994 Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, removal of the rivet in the receiver and magazine release allows use of any and all AKM, RPK, or AK-47 magazines.AR15.com ==References== Category:7.62√ó39mm semi-automatic rifles Category:Firearms of the People's Republic of China ","title":"Norinco NHM 91"},{"id":"20497936","text":"A list of windmills in Lancashire, including those now within Greater Manchester and Merseyside. ==LocationsA ‚Äì C=== {  - !

FACT was an acronym for \\"Fully Automatic Compiling Technique\\". It was an influence on the design of the COBOL programming language. Some of the design of FACT was based on the linguistic project Basic English, developed about 1925 by C.K. Ogden. The software was actually designed by Computer Sciences Corporation (Fletcher Jones, Roy Nutt, and Robert L. Patrick) under contract to Richard Clippinger of Honeywell. == Contributions to COBOL == FACT was an influence in the design of COBOL, and is one of three predecessor languages credited in all COBOL manuals. Several elements of FACT were incorporated into COBOL: * Defining data as levels, with group items and elementary items. * Assigning of initial values to data as it is being defined ( clause). * Specifying a limited list of literal values allowed in a specific field ( level data items). * A non-procedural report generator based on specifying the appearance of the desired report (Report Section in COBOL-66). * Qualification of data-names ( or clause). * Group move of like-named items (). * Validity checks on procedural statements ( clause). * Built-in function. == Implementations == It is unclear if a working version of FACT was ever released by Honeywell. The language was designed, and a detailed specification released (see references), but it said that \\"Computer Sciences Corporation also has the contract to implement FACT\\", which implies they were still working on an implementation at the time. About that time, the short range committee began developing COBOL, and Roy Nutt, 1 of the 3 principals of CSC, began working with that committee on COBOL. It's not clear if he ever came back to implement FACT, or if Honeywell concentrated their programming effort on a COBOL compiler. FACT was implemented, however ‚Äì it was being used by Australian Department of Defence in the 1960s and early 1970s. == Sample program == The following code samples from the simple payroll application in the FACT specification show the fixed-form nature of FACT and its similarities with COBOL.

Born in Hillsborough, County Down, McCandless had been a successful motorcycle racer prior to the Second World War. During the war, he worked in the aviation industry. He had been working as a vehicle mechanic when in 1943, he went into business with his brother Cromie McCandless to repair vehicles for the Ministry of Supply. It was at this time that he built his own motorcycle which became the prototype for the successful featherbed frame adapted by the Norton Motorcycle Company. In the following years McCandless worked on the frame design, improving it and calling it the 'Kneeler'. This version went on to break many world speed records. In the mid-1950s he moved into four wheels and he designed two aluminum-bodied racing cars for Harry Ferguson. In the 1960s he turned his attention to aviation and built his own autogyro. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Biography * On BBC * Review of 'To Make A Better Mousetrap - a Biography of the Remarkable Rex McCandless' by R.L.

It is open daily without charge. The conservatory site was formerly a quarry and rubbish dump, purchased in 1971 by the municipality to create open space. The conservatory itself was founded in 1977 with a primary mission of preserving endangered species from the Armorican Massif (including parts of Brittany, Basse-Normandie and Pays de la Loire), France, Europe, and islands around the world, but also including plants from China, Japan, the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. Since 1990 it has been designated a National Botanical Conservation Center to protect endangered and protected plants of the Armorican Massif. Today the conservatory contains a remarkable collection of endangered plants, totaling about 1700 species, of which 20 species have been preserved in large part by the conservatory's actions. These very rare plants include Brighamia insignis, Centaurium favargeri, Cheirolophus massonianus, Cylindrocline lorencei, Dombeya cacuminum, Hibiscus insularis, Hibiscus liliiflorus, Impatiens thomassetii, Limonium humile, Normania triphylla, Ruizia cordata, and Trochetia boutoniana. Additional specimens of interest include Amorphophallus titanum, Asparagus fallax, Astrophytum myriostigma, Angraecum sesquipedale, Commelina rupicola, Geranium maderense, Hibiscus storckii (H. rosa-sinensis), Lavandula pinnata, Limonium dendroides, Monizia edulis, Pachypodium rosulatum, Pelargonium cotyledonis, Tolpis glabrescens, Tournefortia bojeri, and Turbina inopinata. The conservatory includes greenhouses (1000 m¬≤ total area), containing over 200 taxa of which 95% are endangered, which are subdivided into four sections: tropical mountains, dry tropics, humid tropical forests, and subtropical ocean islands. It also contains a herbarium (about 5,000 specimens) and cold storage rooms for packs of seeds. == See also == * List of botanical gardens in France == References == * Conservatoire botanique national de Brest * Mairie Brest: Conservatoire (French) * BGCI entry * Association des Parcs et Jardins de Bretagne entry (French) Category:Buildings and structures in Brest, France Brest, Conservatoire botanique national de Brest, Conservatoire botanique national de Category:Greenhouses in France ","title":"Conservatoire botanique national de Brest"},{"id":"20498141","text":"Rangamatia Union () is a union of Fatikchhari Upazila of Chittagong District. ==Geography== Area: ==Location== * North: Kanchan nagar Union * East: Lelang Union * South: Daulatpur Union * West: Sundarpur Union ==Population== At the 1991 Bangladesh census, Rangamatia union had a population of 15,628 and house units 2,592. ==References== * Details about Rangamatia Union, lcgbangladesh.org Category:Unions of Fatikchhari Upazila ","title":"Rangamatia Union"},{"id":"20498161","text":"Geombongsan is a mountain in the city of Chuncheon, Gangwon-do, in South Korea.

It was released on 24 November 2008 and all proceeds were donated to Great Ormond Street Hospital. ==Production== Simon Cowell initially planned to only release dance videos with Sampson, but after seeing fan responses to Sampson, he wanted to do more. Eventually a video was choreographed by street-dance and Cirque du Soleil star Mukhtar Omar Sharif Mukhtar. Simon Cowell then asked the agent of Take That if he could get Sampson to sing, but it turned out he already liked singing from a young age. ==Reception== The opinion of reviewers was mixed. Music editor Nick Levine from Digital Spy gave the single a 3-star review. He cited the numerous samples in Get Up On The Dancefloor and called it \\"an entertaining piece of pop nonsense\\". He was less impressed by Headz up but summarized the songs by saying \\"Both, whatever their limitations, are more interesting than anything on Leon Jackson's album.\\" CBBC Newsround also gave the single a 3-star review mostly because they considered the songs 'catchy', but they criticized the lyrics' credibility and the fact that Sampson's was hard to hear because of other vocals. Popjustice listed both positive and negative aspects of the single side by side in their review, but was positive saying \\"George Sampson might have made one of the year's most extraordinary pop singles\\". Andy Welch from the Monmouthshire Beacon didn't like the single at all. He said \\"it has no merit of any kind. Britain has got talent, just not here.\\" John Murphy from musicOMH reviewed the track Get Up on the Dance Floor and said \\"It's utterly disposable and completely unoriginal, but there is a sense of fun to it which may well appeal to anyone under about 16 years of age.\\" ==Sales and charts== It debuted and peaked at number 30 on the UK Singles Chart ==References== Category:2008 debut singles Category:Charity singles Category:Syco Music singles ","title":"Get Up on the Dance Floor/Headz Up"},{"id":"20498240","text":"The Jordan Dental Association, founded in 1952, was the first union in Jordan.

Coale, a local rancher, and Hubert Germain-Robin, a native of Cognac, France. Coale, a former Berkeley professor of ancient history and son of Princeton demographer Ansley Coale, Sr., had bought of farmland outside of Ukiah, named Eagle Ridge Ranch, in 1973. By chance, one day in 1981 he picked up Germain-Robin, who was hitchhiking throughout California in search of a location to make brandy. Germain-Robin came from a family that had been making cognac under the name Jules Robin & Company, but had recently sold the business to Martell, prompting Germain-Robin to leave. Ronald Reagan was an aficionado of Germain- Robin brandies and reserved a number of barrels for the White House, which he served as a matter of national pride to visiting dignitaries such as Mikhail Gorbachev and Fran√ßois Mitterrand. The brandy was also served at Bill Clinton's inaugural ball Differing from the Cognac brandies he made earlier in his life, made mostly of the Ugni blanc grape which in the region many found unpalatable as a wine, Germain-Robin used high-quality wine grapes. Initially they primarily used locally produced Pinot noir, and later added Colombard, Semillon, Zinfandel and Viognier to their stocks, exclusively sourced from Mendocino County. In addition to blends, Germain-Robin produces single- varietal and single-vineyard brandies. In 2006 Germain-Robin left the company to become an independent consultant, and run seminars and workshops with the American Distilling Institute. He wrote the book Traditional Distillation, Art & Passion. In August 2017 Germain-Robin was purchased by E & J Gallo for an undisclosed sum. ==Products== Germain-Robin brandy, which is called by some the best in the world, is produced in very small quantities, 3,000 cases per year as of 2017. Sales are low due to poor name recognition, high price of up to $600 per bottle, and the tendency of restaurant patrons to buy well-known mass-market brands from France. Still, the brandies can be found nationwide in most large cities and some small ones as well. Particularly in recent years, the distillery has been experimenting with grappa, eau de vie, liqueur, and other liquors. In 2007 Mr. Corley produced a Syrah/Zinfandel grappa that garnered his first 5-star outstanding rating from Paul Pacult. He has since, seen many of these for his blends. Coale was also a participant in Hangar One Vodka, an artisan vodka made in Alameda, California by St. George Spirits., the interest was sold and now vodkas, gins and whiskies are now made at the Germain-Robin Distillery, with space given to its makers American Craft Whiskey Distillery and Tamar Distillery. ==ReferencesExternal links== *germain-robin.com - official site Category:Distilleries in California Category:Companies based in Mendocino County, California ","title":"Germain-Robin"},{"id":"20498295","text":"Raymond Ray-Jones (31 August 1886 in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire ‚Äì 26 February 1942 in Carbis Bay near St Ives, Cornwall) was an English painter and etcher. == Life and career == Born Raymond Jones, he was the eldest son and second child of Samuel Shepley Jones, a cabinet maker, and his wife Martha Hulme. Leaving St Ann‚Äôs school in Ashton at the age of fourteen, Ray-Jones worked first at the National Gas & Oil Co. Ltd., and studied part-time at Ashton's Heginbottom School of Art under J.H. Cronshaw. He showed enough talent to gain a county scholarship and a place at the Royal College of Art in Kensington, London in 1907 ‚Äì a considerable achievement in those days. At the R.C.A. he studied under Prof Gerald Moira and Sir Frank Short RA, P.R.E., and from May 1911 attended the studio of Jean-Paul Laurens, known as Acad√©mie Julian, in Paris, where he was awarded the Grand Prix and Medal for portrait painting. In 1913, on the advice of his tutors, he changed his name to Raymond Ray-Jones, and by 1914 established a studio at Joubert Studios, 14 Jubilee Place, London SW3, off the King's Road. He became an Associate of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers on 17 March 1914 (now the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers). Ray-Jones served during the First World War (1914‚Äì18) as a clerk or ostler in the Royal Horse Artillery at Woolwich. This was followed by a period of penury in Jubilee Place. Through Frank Short, his talent came to the notice of Edward Holroyd Pearce (later Lord Pearce), who was then an undergraduate at Oxford University. Ray-Jones was an early member of the Society of Graphic Art (now the Society of Graphic Fine Art). He married Pearce‚Äôs sister, Effie Irene Pearce, on 12 February 1926, and they lived at Woodham Walter in Essex. in 1926 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers. Ray-Jones was an etcher and a meticulous draughtsman. Buildings were his main subject, though he also did portraiture and worked in chalk, oil, and watercolour. The demand for etchings that had been good, began to collapse at about the time of his marriage. Ray-Jones had little sympathy with the work of modern artists such as Picasso. Ray-Jones was so concerned with detail and accuracy that his body of work was small. After the birth of Alan in 1931, Ray-Jones and his wife moved to Carbis Bay outside St Ives in Cornwall, where they had two more children ‚Äì Philip in 1933 and in 1941 Anthony (Tony Ray-Jones), who was later to become well known as a professional photographer. He was a member of the St Ives Society of Artists from 1935‚Äì1937, together with artists such as Stanley Spencer, Laura Knight and Frank Brangwyn. Creating a Splash, which records the society at that time, includes a full page reproduction of the self-portrait. In February 2017 a more complete biography of Raymond was published as The Siren, Issue No 12, February 2017 (Special Raymond Ray-Jones Issue), also by David Tovey. The outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 cut him off from the two countries ‚Äì France and Italy ‚Äì that had been the main source of inspiration for his etchings and paintings. This enforced separation, combined with financial worries, led to depression, and he committed suicide at Carbis Bay in 1942. He was buried in the old churchyard at Lelant Church on 2 March 1942. According to the memorial to him on the Tameside website he is best known for his self- portrait The Velvet Hat, which he etched probably c.1910. When exhibited at ‚ÄòModern Masters of Etching‚Äô at the Leicester Galeries in London in 1923 it received great critical acclaim. So far as is known, no complete catalogue exists of his etchings, paintings, and drawings, but they come on to the market occasionally, and are highly sought. ==Exhibitions and Museums== Works by Raymond Ray-Jones have been acquired by the British Museum; the Victoria and Albert Museum, South Kensington; Trinity College, Cambridge; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; Contemporary Art Soc.; City Art Gallery, Manchester; Mappin Art Gallery, Sheffield; Ipswich Art Gallery, etc. Prints of the self-portrait are held by the National Portrait Gallery, the British Museum, and the Victoria and Albert Museum. He exhibited at the Royal Academy, the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers, the Society of Graphic Art; New English Art Club, Bristol, Liverpool etc.; and at International and other exhibitions abroad: ‚Äì in Paris, Venice, Hamburg, Dresden, Zurich, Geneva, Toronto, Sydney, Dunedin etc. British Council: Contemporary British Prints and Drawings from the Wakefield Collection. More recently, a retrospective exhibition was held at the Astley Cheetham Art Gallery from 2 May ‚Äì 3 June 1992. Later still, from 19 February ‚Äì 27 March 1996, a 'father and son' exhibition was held there for Raymond and Tony Ray-Jones. The most comprehensive collection of his work was donated by his eldest son Alan Ray-Jones in 2016 under the Cultural Gifts Scheme administered by the Arts Council England, and is held by the Whitworth Art GalleryWhitworth Art Gallery in Manchester, not far from his birthplace in Ashton-under-Lyne. ==ReferencesExternal links== *The Ray-Jones family website *Blue Plaque, Central Library, Ashton-Under-Lyne, Lancs ‚Äì text by P.R.B.

Strong German resistance resulted in heavy casualties for both sides. The city was captured by U.S. forces and hostilities formally ceased on 22 November; the last of the forts defending Metz surrendered on 13 December. ==Background== Metz is located between the rivers Moselle and Seille. The fortifications of Metz consisted of several forts and observation posts with connecting entrenchments and tunnels. The city had fallen to the German forces when France was defeated in 1940. Following the fall of France, the city was immediately annexed to the Third Reich, as were most districts previously annexed to the Reich that had been lost in 1918.

At that time, the Wehrmacht did not consider it an important location and the city's defenses were reduced with many guns and equipment removed, although the fortifications were still heavily defended and well armed. However, after the Allied \\"break out\\" from the lodgement established by the Normandy landings, the U.S. Third Army raced 400 miles across France, with the German forces retreating in disorder. As Third Army supply lines became stretched, material (especially gasoline) became scarce, and Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower called a halt to the Third Army advance so that supplies could be stockpiled for Operation Market Garden, an attempt to break into the vital (and heavily industrialized) German Ruhr Valley in the north. This pause by Third Army gave the Germans time to reorganize and fortify Metz, in an attempt to contain the Allied advance. By the end of August 1944, German forces in Lorraine had managed to reestablish a defensive line around Metz and Nancy. According to an order issued by Hitler in March 1944, fortress commanders were to hold their positions at all costs, surrendering only with Hitler's approval, which he would never give. Metz was surrounded by forts built by the Germans between 1870 and 1919, then allowed to decay by the French, who possessed the Lorraine region until it was retaken by Germany in 1940. The German commanders of the Metz forts were required to follow Hitler's \\"hold at all costs\\" order when attacked, in September 1944, by the U.S. Third Army led by General George S. Patton, who had reached Verdun before Eisenhower's order to halt the advance and conserve supplies. Hitler understood the pause was due to a supply shortage, and would not last, and he recognized that the Third Army posed a threat to the Saar region of Germany. Hitler ordered his commanders to hold the Allies \\"as far west as possible,\\" to give time for the strengthening of the West Wall, which had been depleted to build up the Atlantic Wall. The defense of Metz was undertaken by the German First Army, commanded by General Otto von Knobelsdorff. The number of German troops positioned in the vicinity of Metz was equivalent to four and a half divisions. ==Battle== German Grenadier with Panzerschreck, on 27 October 1944, near Metz Men of the 378th Infantry, 95th Division enter Metz (17 November 1944). Armored elements of the United States XX Corps, while on a reconnaissance operation in the direction of the Moselle, made contact with elements from the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division on 6 September 1944. On 18 September, U.S. reconnaissance units encountered Wehrmacht Panzergrenadiers again. The U.S. forces had not expected the German forces to be in the area, and had to bring together their units that were spread out. Several small scale attacks were made by the U.S. forces after this encounter. The first U.S. attack was launched by the 95th Infantry Division, in which they attempted to capture a bridgehead to the north of Metz. This attack was repelled by the German forces, as was another attack on the city that followed. In another attack, the US forces captured a small bridgehead across the Moselle to the south of Metz. Troops of 95th Infantry Division conducting a house-to-house search in Metz on 19 November 1944 By the end of September, German forces positioned to the north had moved to the southern area of Metz. Some troops were also withdrawn from Metz. After this development, the XII Corps launched another attack but was countered by the German defenders. In the following two weeks, the U.S. forces limited themselves to small scale attacks and patrolling in the Metz area. During this time, the XX Corps underwent a training program, experimenting with methods of reducing the defenses of the fortress. By this time, the U.S. command had decided to attack Metz from its rear, coming from the east. On 3 November a new attack was launched by the U.S. forces, which resulted in the capture of the outer defenses with the aid of the tactics developed during the training process. On 14 November Generalleutnant Heinrich Kittel was appointed as the new commander of the German forces. By 17 November, U.S. forces had managed to isolate most of the forts, and were attacking the city. German forces had been retreating since 17 November, and U.S. forces pursued them for the following two days. U.S. forces entered Metz on 18 November, and on 21 November Kittel was wounded and subsequently captured. Although the city itself was captured by U.S. forces and hostilities formally ceased on 22 November, the remaining isolated forts continued to hold out. Direct assault was forbidden against the holdout forts in order to preserve artillery ammunition for the XX Corps' advance to the Sarre River and the isolated forts subsequently surrendered one by one following the surrender of Fort Verdun on 26 November. By the end of November, several forts were still holding out. The last of the forts at Metz to surrender was Fort Jeanne d'Arc, which capitulated to the U.S. III Corps on 13 December. ==Aftermath== Although the battle resulted in defeat for the German forces, it served the intended purpose of the German command of halting the advance of the U.S. Third Army for three months, enabling retreating German forces to make an organized withdrawal to the Sarre river and to organize their defenses. The level of casualties for both sides are unknown but high. The Germans were surprised at the American approach on the battlefield. Generaloberst Johannes Blaskowitz, C.O of Armeegruppe G, reviewed Patton's decision to launch a headlong attack straight into the fortifications of Metz by saying: \\"A direct attack on Metz was unnecessary....in contrast a swerve northward in the direction of Luxemburg and Bitburg would have met with greater success and caused our 1st Army's right flank collapsed followed by the breakdown of our 7th Army.\\" The military strategist and historian Liddel Hart remarked: \\"Patton's 3rd Army began to cross the Moselle as early as 5 September, yet was little farther forward 2 weeks later - or indeed two months later.\\" Christer Bergstr√∂m, \\"The Ardennes - Hitler's Winter Offensive\\", p. 28 ==Notes== ;Footnotes ==References External links == *Oral history interview with Frank Niedermayer, an infantryman during the Battle of Metz from the Veterans History Project at Central Connecticut State University Category:Western European Campaign (1944‚Äì1945) Category:History of Metz Metz ","title":"Battle of Metz"},{"id":"20498344","text":"√âlvis Alves Pereira (born 23 August 1977, in S√£o Paulo), is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a defender for Segunda Liga side Desportivo das Aves. ==External links== * Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from S√£o Paulo Category:Association football defenders Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A players Category:Associa√ß√£o Portuguesa de Desportos players Category:Goi√°s Esporte Clube players Category:Clube de Regatas Brasil players Category:Uni√£o Agr√≠cola Barbarense Futebol Clube players Category:Primeira Liga players Category:Leix√µes S.C. players Category:C.D.

Too afraid to tell them he already has a spouse, he acquiesces to his mother's wishes. Tess conceals his crime of bigamy and meanwhile is pregnant.

The New York Times reported Talmadge delivered one of her finest and most realistic characterizations as the benighted Tess.The New York Times Review Variety wrote Talmadge gives the part a touch of realness that carries its own appeal, and never seems to \\"spread\\" herself for solo effects, but rather works toward the collective benefits.The Norma Talmadge Website Review from Variety Like many American films of the time, The Secret of the Storm Country was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards. For example, the Chicago Board of Censors issued an Adults Only permit and cut the intertitle \\"Tessibel's secret is revealed to the eyes of the jealous woman\\". The Board, for general viewing, made additional cuts, in Reel 1, of the entire incident of the man attacking the young woman, in Reel 3, the intertitle \\"The awakening\\", in Reel 4, the three intertitles \\"Tessibel's secret is revealed to the eyes of the jealous woman\\", \\"Help Tessibel to die in the spring\\", and \\"Confronted by the hypocritical pillars of the church\\", the letter to Tess asking her to appear before the church board, and, in Reel 5, the entire incident of Tess's appearance before the church board and all intertitles referring to this. ==References* * lantern slide Category:1917 films Category:1917 drama films Category:American drama films Category:American films Category:American silent feature films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films based on works by Grace Miller White Category:Films shot in New York (state) Category:Lost American films Category:Films directed by Charles Miller Category:Selznick Pictures films Category:1917 lost films Category:Lost drama films ","title":"The Secret of the Storm Country"},{"id":"20498610","text":"Cl√©ber Monteiro de Oliveira (born 23 May 1980 in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais), known simply as Cl√©ber, is a Brazilian retired footballer who played mainly as a defensive midfielder.

Well known for his vibrant impressionist paintings, his work is exhibited throughout Europe and the United States. ==Life and career== Alexandr Onishenko was born in 1957 in Chernihiv (also referred to as Chernigov, Ukrainian) the capital of the Ukrainian province of Chernihiv Oblast. His artistic studies were encouraged and supported from an early age by his father. In 1979, he graduated from the Institute of Art in Kiev and became a member of the Russian Art Union. State regulation of the arts under the Soviet Union encouraged Onishenko and many other young artists to rebel and form an illegal artists‚Äô collective, which was housed in the Yeletsky Monastery. In 1981, Onishenko and several companions moved to the Tevriz district of the Omsk Provence in Siberia. After six years of ‚Äúself-exile‚Äù, he returned to the Ukraine in 1987. Fleeing the increasing political turmoil in the years just before the fall of the Soviet Union, Onishenko moved to Yugoslavia briefly before settling in Prague, Czech Republic in 1991. After years of painting on the famous Charles Bridge, Onishenko met with such success that he opened his own gallery in 1994 (Galerie Jakubska) in Prague‚Äôs Old Town. Alexandr Onishenko's Galerie Jakubsk√° in Prague, Czech Republic Onishenko presently resides in Prague and has become one the city's most accomplished artists receiving both the Franz Kafka Prize and the Masaryk Academy of Sciences Award. ==Artwork== The signatures style of Alexandr Onishenko's Impressionism work includes exclusive use of the palette knife and painting on black canvases. The artist's description of his own work as \\"New Impressionism\\" is not to be confused with the pointillism of Neo- Impressionism. Its own distinction lies in the use of a traditional impasto painting technique wherein paint is applied in heavy, textured quantity and sometimes even mixed directly on the surface of the canvas, while at the same time Onishenko departs dramatically from traditional Impressionism by beginning on a pitch-black surface. This reversal of the painting process - moving from darkness to light - brings with it the high level of contrast and vibrancy of color that the artist's paintings are known for. Alexandr Onishenko portrays a wide variety of subjects in his work. Still Lives, nudes, land and cityscapes are all well represented in his portfolio, but over the years one of his most famous motifs has remained his bird's-eye perspective paintings of the rooftops of Prague. He is very well traveled and continues to be inspired in his work even years after visiting a new location.

The current building dates to the reign of King Henry V of England. It became a parish church in 1826. It was built between 1410 and 1434 as a chapel of ease: St Ives being within the parish of Lelant. The tower is of granite and of four stages (over 80 ft high): the church is large but not particularly high and built in a Devonian style rather than a Cornish one.

(The Buildings of England). Penguin Books; p. 180 The font is of granite and most likely of the 15th century. It is carved with four angels holding shields. In the chancel, there are bench ends of the standard design and two other, complete benches. There is a brass to a member of the Trenwith family, 1463, and a monument to the Hitchens family by Garland & Fieldwick, 1815.Pevsner (1970); p. 180 :The church of St. Ives, a beautiful structure of the age of Henry V, with a lofty tower, is dedicated to St. Ia the Virgin; the edifice is well worthy of the observation of those who are curious in ecclesiastical architecture: the living is part of the vicarage of Uny Lelant, but has lately been endowed, by a grant from Queen Anne's bounty, the maintenance of a perpetual curate; the present incumbent of the parish is Rev.

Agnese was the mother of Bianca Maria Visconti, who succeeded to the title of Duchess of Milan in 1450, despite her illegitimacy. == Family == Agnese was born around 1411 in Milan. She was the daughter of Ambrogio del Maino,Charles Cawley,Medieval Lands, dukes of Milan a Count Palatine and ducal questore or chief of police. Her mother's name and identity is unknown. Agnese had two brothers, Lancillotto del Maino and Andreotto del Maino, who were both courtiers and members of the ducal council. She became the mistress of Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, the last Duke of Milan of the Visconti dynasty, whose wife Beatrice Lascaris di Tenda had been executed for adultery in 1418 and had produced no children. He was the son of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan by his second wife, Caterina Visconti. ==Birth of a daughter== Portrait of Bianca Maria Visconti, Duchess of Milan, illegitimate daughter of Agnese del Maino by Filippo Maria Visconti On 31 March 1425 at Settimo Pavese, Agnese gave birth to Filippo's daughter, whom they named Bianca Maria. When the baby was six months old, Agnese and Bianca Maria were sent to the castle of Abbiategrasso, where lavish apartments were provided for mother and child. In 1426, Agnese bore the Duke a second daughter, Caterina Maria, but the child died shortly after her birth. Filippo, for reasons of state, married secondly, by proxy on 2 December 1427, and in person on 24 September 1428,Cawley, Medieval Lands, Dukes of Milan Marie of Savoy (January 1411 - 22 February 1479), the daughter of Amadeus VIII of Savoy and Marie of Burgundy. The duke's second marriage was also childless, making Bianca Maria his sole heir to the duchy of Milan. On 25 October 1441, Bianca Maria was married, in a magnificent ceremony at the Abbey of San Sigismondo in Cremona, to Francesco Sforza, a renowned Condottiero and member of the Condottieri Sforza family. Agnese was present at her daughter's wedding. The extravagant festivities, which lasted for days, offered a sumptuous banquet, a series of tournaments, a palio, painted carts featuring allegorical scenes, and an oversized cake that reproduced the Torrazzo, Cremona's most prominent tower. Bianca Maria's considerable dowry included the towns of Cremona and Pontremoli. The marriage produced eight children, among these were, Galeazzo Maria Sforza, Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, and Ippolita Maria Sforza, Duchess of Calabria. == Death of Filippo Maria Visconti == Filippo Maria Visconti, Agnese's lover Filippo Maria Visconti died on 13 August 1447; he was not quite fifty-five years old. Bianca Maria was his only direct heir, albeit illegitimate. His death, without legitimate offspring, resulted in the creation of the short-lived Ambrosian Republic. That same year, Agnese convinced Matteo Da Bologna, the condottiero who held the city of Pavia,A History of Milan Under the Sforza, by Cecilia M. Ady, edited by Edward Armstrong, published in New York by G.P. Putnam's Sons; and in London; Metheun and Company, 1907, chapter 41 to restore the city to her son-in-law, Francesco Sforza who had inherited it upon the death of Filippo. Francesco subsequently took the title of Count of Pavia. A revolt broke out in Milan on 24 February 1450, due to a famine in the city which resulted in rampant starvation and brought about much suffering to the populace. One month later on 25 March, after the disputed succession to the duchy was decided in their favour consequent to a meeting of nobles and leading citizens, Francesco Sforza and Bianca Maria made their triumphal entry into the city as the Duke and Duchess of Milan. The Ambrosian Republic had ended and was replaced by the Sforza dynasty which would rule Milan until 1535. Agnese resided with them at the ducal court, overseeing the education of her grandchildren. Extant diplomatic papers record that Agnese was a conspicuous participant in court functions,Nadia Covini. (2006). Princesses and Ladies of Power at the Sforza court. Retrieved on 3 December 2008 until her death on 13 December 1465 at the age of fifty-four years. Her daughter, Bianca Maria died three years later on 28 October 1468. Francesco had died in 1466, and his eldest son Galeazzo Maria succeeded him as Duke of Milan. Painting of Agnese del Maino by an unknown artist == Agnes del Maino in art and drama == There are two contemporary paintings of Agnese which survive to this day; the artists, however, remain unknown. Agnese is a character in the 1833 tragic opera Beatrice di Tenda by Sicilian composer Vincenzo Bellini.

NMU is an alkylating agent, and exhibits its toxicity by transferring its methyl group to nucleobases in nucleic acids, which can lead to AT:GC transition mutations. NMU is the traditional precursor in the synthesis of diazomethane. It has the potentially advantageous property that the stoichiometric byproducts formed are water, carbon dioxide, and ammonia, which are innocuous or easily removed.

For about two decades after World War II, Bosques served as Mexico's ambassador to several countries. Since 2003, international recognition has been accruing to him. In 1944, he described his efforts thus: \\"I followed the policy of my country, of material and moral support to the heroic defenders of the Spanish Republic, the stalwart paladins of the struggle against Hitler, Mussolini, Franco, Petain, and Laval.\\"Turismo Puebla Web site In 2010, a documentary film about him was produced in Mexico, directed by Lillian Lieberman, titled Visa al para√≠so (Visa to Paradise). ==Early years== Gilberto Bosques Sald√≠var was born in Chiautla, a mountain village in southern portion of the state of Puebla, southeast of Mexico City. At the age of 17, he took up arms in the Mexican Revolution under the command of Aquiles Serd√°n Alatriste, the first martyr of the Revolution. Bosques organized the First National Pedagogy Congress (Primer Congreso Nacional Pedag√≥gico), and worked as a journalist with several newspapers and publications. He went on to serve as a state legislator in Puebla and as a federal deputy on two occasions: 1922-1923 and again in 1934-1937. In the latter period, he belonged to a bloc of legislators supporting the new president, general L√°zaro C√°rdenas (from 1934 to 1940).Gonz√°lez Mar√≠n 2006:127 He was the President of the Chamber of Deputies in 1935. In 1938, he was the director of the government owned newspaper, El Nacional. ==Mexican Consul in France during World War II== Bosques was stationed in France from 1939‚Äì1943, coinciding with most of World War II, initially as Mexico's Consul General. Fleeing the German occupation of Paris in May 1940, Bosques was instructed by his government to organize a consulate to represent Mexico in Vichy France, which he set up in Marseille. Once Nazi Germany had occupied France and entrusted much of the governance of the country to Vichy France, he directed consular employees to issue a visa to anybody wanting to flee to Mexico. Under his auspices, visas were issued to approximately 40,000 people, mostly Jews and Spaniards. The Spaniards rescued were refugees from Francoist Spain after the conclusion of the Spanish Civil War in April 1939. Bosques rented a castle and a summer holiday camp in Marseilles to house refugees under the protection of what he maintained was Mexican territory under International Law.Grabman, Bosques War, pp. 15-19 Bosques' courageous initiatives and actions mirror those of two other consuls placed in similar situations in war-torn Europe, i.e. the Portuguese Aristides de Sousa Mendes in Bordeaux and the Japanese Chiune Sugihara in Kaunas. In 1943, Bosques, his family (wife and three children), and 40 consular staff members were arrested by the Gestapo and detained in Germany for a year. He was released under an agreement between the German and Mexican governments after Manuel √Åvila Camacho (then President of Mexico from 1940 to 1946) made an exchange of prisoners with imprisoned German citizens.\\"Gilberto Bosques Biography\\" http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/?en/saviors/diplomats/bosques/gilberto-bosques- biography.801.htm ==Post-World War II== In the decades after his release from German captivity, he served as Ambassador of Mexico in Portugal, Finland, Sweden and Cuba. In 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, Bosques ‚Äî who was both a personal friend of Fidel Castro and the diplomatic representative of a neutral country trusted by the United States, the Soviet Union and Cuba, worked to facilitate communications between the disputants and bring Cuba into agreement with the \\"face-saving\\" agreements worked out between the two nuclear powers.Grabman, Bosques' war, p. 36 Bosques Sald√≠var died just days short of his 103rd birthday.

Initially established in 1945 for former personnel of the Special Operations Executive, members of wartime resistance organisations, the Special Air Service, Special Boat Service and First Aid Nursing Yeomanry, its membership now includes those who had served, or were serving, in organisations and units closely associated with special operations and the intelligence community. ==Foundation and membership== The SFC was founded in 1945 on the initiative of Major General Sir Colin Gubbins, the last Chief of the Special Operations Executive (SOE). The club was intended by its founders to be a meeting place for both those who had served in the SOE and for members of kindred organisations. This tradition has continued, with the club maintaining a close relationship with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS); like-minded groups in Australia, Canada and New Zealand; along with the successors of European and other resistance organisations. Like many other clubs that were open only to men and officers, it was initially open \\"only to ex SOE agents and personnel, and to Resistance members from all over the SOE's areas.\\" The members of the Special Forces Club had a cheap membership card that gave them the right to stay in London at a very modest charge. The SFC has always welcomed all ranks and men and women, reflecting the membership and spirit of the SOE. John Singlaub is the club's honorary vice president. After 1964, the members of the Special Forces Association, such as selected partisans and resistance leaders, started to have a second type of membership card for which there was no fee. During the Special Forces annual dinner in 1964, Colin Gubbins affirmed that the first purpose of the SOE was to \\"establish a Club which would be of direct practical and immediate benefit to the younger members of SOE, men and women who had joined us during the war and who at the end of it had to start a completely new life in a strange and upset world.\\" The second institutional objective of the SOE was to \\"maintain and strengthen even further the intimate links which, through our wartime activities, we had built with men of goodwill in all the occupied countries in Europe and Asia, to the end of trying to foster mutual understanding and create a happier world. In all these countries, men who had been in constant intimate association with us for years, some of them hitherto obscure, came at the War's end into the highest government offices\\". The club's membership is drawn primarily from the intelligence and security communities, both military and civilian, and Special Forces along with other organisations and individuals whose work reflects the ethos of the club such as high threat bomb disposal experts. Great stress is placed on the personal qualities of applicants along with their technical qualifications to ensure that the club maintains its reputation as one of the most discreet locations in London. Current membership includes a number of holders of the Victoria Cross and George Cross. ==Premises== The Club is located in Knightsbridge, London; the building is not owned by the club, but is leased from Cadogan Estates. The Club is famous for its collection of photographs of members of SOE and OSS and those from the post war era. Those members killed in action have their photograph framed in black. There is also a collection of prints and original paintings reflecting the background of the membership. The club has undergone a radical transformation in terms of its business practices to ensure its efficient administration and has a very active programme of guest speakers and events. In 2015 the Club celebrated its 70th Anniversary and 75th Anniversary of the founding of the SOE with a major dinner and reception at the Natural History Museum (SOE Station XVb during the War) attended by the Club's patron Anne, Princess Royal and the Crown Princes of Norway and Denmark plus 850 members and guests including veterans of the SOE and OSS. In recent years the Club has refurbished its bar and dining room and there is a rolling programme of improvements to the bedrooms and other facilities. There is a long-standing tradition whereby overseas members support renovations. The Danes were responsible for a bedroom in memory of , who initiated the armed resistance movement in Denmark, the US created the Donovan Room in memory of William J. Donovan, the wartime head of the OSS, and the Dutch renovating the Prince Bernhard Room. There are also rooms named the Australian Room, the Belgian Room, the Polish Room, and the Canadian Room redecorated by members from those countries. The Norwegians refurbished the Linge Room, named after Martin Linge, the founder of the wartime Norwegian Independent Company 1, and have made other donations. ==See also== *List of London's gentlemen's clubs ==References== Category:1946 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Organizations established in 1946 Category:Clubs and societies in London Category:Military gentlemen's clubs ","title":"Special Forces Club"},{"id":"20499527","text":"Andrew 'Howard' Payne (17 April 1931 ‚Äì 1 March 1992) was an English Olympic track and field athlete.

He was a natural son of A.K. Razumovsky and an uncle of Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy, also a well-known man of letters. During the Patriotic War of 1812 (invasion of Napoleon Bonaparte) he served in the acting army as a volunteer. When living in Germany during his military service Perovsky took a great interest in German romanticism, and Hoffman, in particular, and it had a great impact on his own creativity. After retirement he settled in Petersburg and took care of upbringing and education of his nephew Aleksey. During that period Perovsky came to be one of the most active defenders of Alexander Pushkin, then a beginning poet. After the death of his father in 1822 Aleksey Perovsky settled in Pogoreltsy Estate in Ukraine, together with his sister and nephew and took the penname of Antony Pogorelsky, based on the estate name. Antony Pogorelsky's remarkable set of stories Dvoinik (The Double, or My Evenings in Little Russia) (1828) was closely related to the German fantastic tradition (Serapion Brothers by Hoffman) and anticipated the famous Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka by Nikolai Gogol and Russian Nights by Vladimir Odoevsky. In 1829 Pogorelsky published the book that brought him real fame: it was the fairy tale Black Hen, or Living Underground written for his nephew, the first book about childhood in Russian literature.

The site was shut down on 22 May 2018.Dear Fellow Television Fans. The BuddyTV Team. Retrieved May 24, 2018 ==History== BuddyTV was co-founded in 2005 by Andy Liu and David Niu. The pair graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a Master of Business Administration. They sold their previous company, NetConversions, to aQuantive in 2004. While on a holiday, they realized that television is a \\"very passive or non-social experience\\", and wanted to \\"express ourselves at the time of the show\\". The website is also designed to allow real-time commentary for sports, allowing former players and fans to broadcast their opinions on basketball and baseball games. Niu felt that other Internet companies which were offering online sportscasting tools did not effectively combines audio broadcasts with online comments and forums. In May 2007, BuddyTV received a loan of $250,000 from the Charles River Quick Start Seed Funding Program, at which time it was attracting 2 million unique visitors per month. In a first round financing, Gemstar-TV Guide International invested $2.8 million into the website. In September 2007, paidContent reported that BuddyTV was being acquired by Comcast, at which time it was receiving 3 million unique visitors per month and had hired 20 employees. However, the reports were later confirmed to be untrue. In April 2008, BuddyTV raised $6 million in a second round, with investments mainly coming from Madrona Venture Group. The two rounds saw a total raise of $9 million. Funding was expected to go towards investing in new personnel and technology. BuddyTV has been compared to the television commentary site Television Without Pity. Television Without Pity's co-editor Sarah Bunting said that the website's focus is on in-depth and humorous recaps that appear three or four days after the episodes air. BuddyTV is designed, however, to provide immediate feedback. Liu said that many television networks were interested in partnering with BuddyTV to build online communities around their shows. In September 2010, BuddyTV entered the mobile space with a new app for the iPhone and iPad. \\"We're making a big bet on the mobile and tablet side of things,\\" said CEO Andy Liu. \\"When I watch TV, I've got my iPad open, I've got mobile phones nearby as well, and I think in the next 12 to 18 months this whole movement towards being a lot more social in television is really going to come together, and we just want to get ahead of that. It's amazing how much hardware has changed this space.\\" Soon after its first mobile app release, Seattle entrepreneur and technology executive Bill Baxter joined BuddyTV as its chief technology officer and executive vice president of products. A year later, the app was featured in TechCrunch. On 31 December 2014, Smart TV manufacturer Vizio acquired BuddyTV's parent Advanced Media Research Group, Inc. Three and a half years later on 22 May 2018, the website became offline. ==Business model== BuddyTV made money through online advertising and by offering advanced publishing tools to commentators. The website had a partnership with Windows Media Center, allowing viewers to turn on BuddyTV commentary on their televisions during shows. In 2007, online survey hosting company QuestionPro and Buddy TV created a new way for advertisers to learn about the viewers of television series which featured their ads. BuddyTV used custom online surveys from QuestionPro to gather information and opinion from the community of fans. BuddyTV's analysts compiled the results and produced a report within days for the advertiser. In June 2010, BuddyTV entered an advertising partnership with Flixster and Rotten Tomatoes. \\"This is a terrific partnership that capitalizes on each company's growth in social networking, mobile, and online to reach a huge and influential audience of trendsetting consumers,\\" said Joe Greenstein, co- founder and CEO of Flixster Inc. \\"For us, we now have a large and professional sales force to sell our inventory directly to agencies and advertisers,\\" said BuddyTV's Neal Freeland. \\"We already have some of these relationships, but expect this partnership to grow the volume significantly.\\" ==Impact== BuddyTV has been described as \\"the Web's best entertainment-based community site\\".

Little is known of his first film appearances as they are considered lost. In 1912 he began appearing in a series of mystery shorts directed by L√©once Perret. He then began appearing in a number of films directed by Louis Feuillade for Gaumont studios. At the onset of the First World War, Crest√© enlisted in the French army and actively participated in the fighting. Injured and demobilized, he resumed his acting career at Gaumont studios by the end of 1915. In 1916, Feuillade and writer Arthur Bern√®de began to develop a surrealistic character called 'Jacques de Tremeuse' (aka 'Judex') - a mysterious avenger who sports a signature long dark cloak and wide-brimmed slouch hat. The character's nemesis was the callous banker Favraux, who had carelessly driven thousands of people into bankruptcy.Combustible Celluloid The character of Judex is widely recognized as one of cinema's first superheroes.French Culture: Official Website of the Cultural Services of the French Embassy Ren√© Crest√© was eventually cast as 'Judex' and the serial began production in 1917 and was released the same year in its first installment to critical and public praise.1917 Oscar Chronicle The serial also starred Musidora, √âdouard Math√©, Gaston Michel, Ren√© Poyen, Yvette Andr√©yor and Yvonne Dario. Following the success of Judex, Crest√© appeared in the 1918 serial Tih Minh, directed by Feuillade, then founded his own film production company, Films-Ren√©-Crest√©, for which he produced and directed several ultimately unsuccessful films. ==Death== Ren√© Crest√© died in 1922 of tuberculosis. To support the financial needs of his widow and infirmed daughter, a charity gala was organized by friends of the Crest√© family in February 1929. Three months following the event, his only daughter Ren√©e died. ==ReferencesCategory:1881 births Category:1922 deaths Category:French male film actors Category:French male silent film actors Category:French male stage actors Category:French film directors Category:Male actors from Paris Category:French military personnel of World War I Category:20th-century French male actors ","title":"Ren√© Crest√©"},{"id":"20499694","text":"Edison Mosquera Rebolledo (born 8 May 1990) is a professional Colombian football player who plays as a midfielder for Slovan Liberec. ==Club career== He arrived in Spain in 2007, initially on Mallorca.

He was born at 17 Orde Hall Street, London, the son of Alfred William Hardiman, silversmith, of Holborn, and his wife, Ada Myhill. ==Life== Hardiman won a London County Council Scholarship to the Royal College of Art in 1912, and three years later joined the Royal Academy School. After a period as an engineer's draughtsman in the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War, Hardiman resumed his studies and in 1920 was awarded the British Prix de Rome scholarship, spending two years at the British School at Rome. There he developed his style, a blend of naturalism and classicism influenced by Roman and Etruscan art and early fifth century Greek sculpture. Hardiman's best- known (but also most controversial) work is the Earl Haig Memorial on Whitehall in London. More universally admired are the heraldic lions flanking the main entrance to the City Hall, Norwich, a work which fully epitomises his style. He was appointed consultant sculptor to the building,Eastern Daily Press 21 October 1937 having worked with one of the architects, Stephen Rowland Pierce, on the Haig Memorial. Hardiman also carved three large stone figures for the outside of the council chamber, and worked with other sculptors on the project including James Woodford and Eric Aumonier. Hardiman was elected Associate of the Royal Academy in 1936 and a full Academician in 1944. He became a fellow of the Royal Society of British Sculptors in 1938 and the following year received their silver medal for his statue of Haig. In 1946 he won a gold medal for his bronze fountain figure for the New Council House, College Green, Bristol, which however was never erected. In 1918 he married Violet, daughter of Herbert Clifton White, of London, and had two daughters.

Owned by the Bowes-Lyon family, Earls of Strathmore and Kinghorne, the house was one of the family's three principal seats, alongside Glamis Castle in Forfarshire, Scotland and Gibside, near Gateshead. Streatlam incorporated some of land, along with an estate consisting of some twenty farms. The last occupant was Lord Glamis, who later became the 15th Earl, although the estate was owned by his father, the 14th Earl, at the time. ==History== The House had come to the Bowes family by the fifteenth century. For much of the nineteenth century, it was owned by John Bowes, the eldest son of the 10th Earl of Strathmore who was illegitimate under English law as his parents married after he was born (and under Scottish law as they had no Scottish domicile), but was able to inherit a life interest in the family's English wealth and properties. During his tenancy, Streatlam was described as consisting of twenty-four bedrooms, two oak drawing-rooms, the yellow drawing room, the great dining room, the billiard-room, the study and the gentlemen's room. Following his death without issue, the estate was reunited with the Earldom in 1885. Unlike the fate of other properties which belonged to the Bowes-Lyon family, such as Gibside (which lay within a major coalfield near Gateshead and so was considered spoilt by pollution from the surrounding coal mines), Streatlam sat amid the beautiful countryside of the Durham Dales. ==Decline and demolition== The last occupier was Lord Glamis, heir to the Earldom, who had been living there since at least 1915. The Earl of Strathmore was determined to sell off the house and the land, however, and the bulk of the estate was sold to private tenants, with the remainder fetching ¬£100,000 at auction. Lord Glamis moved to a substantial farm near East Grinstead, where he resided until he succeeded his father as Earl of Strathmore in 1944. Some see it as little surprise that the Earl of Strathmore chose Glamis Castle over Streatlam, the house being considered architecturally \\"awkward and unsatisfactory\\" (as was claimed in Country Life Magazine in 1915). Also, as the aristocratic titles of the last owner and occupant would suggest, Streatlam was less important in historical terms. Another possible reason is that, for much of the nineteenth century, the Scottish and English estates had been split, with Streatlam and Gibside owned by John Bowes and his wife, which meant that the Scottish branch of the Bowes-Lyon family, namely the Earls of Strathmore, had not been in ownership or residence at Streatlam for from 1820 to 1885, thereby becoming more focused on their Scottish estates. The English estates only reverted to the Earl and his descendants when John Bowes died without issue, leaving his fortune to his first cousin once removed, the 13th Earl, in 1885. Although there was no pressing financial need to sell at the time, with the family still earning a substantial income from the estate's coal mining holdings, in the end the house was simply considered superfluous. The Earl also owned Wemmergill in County Durham, St Paul's Walden Bury in Hertfordshire and the Gibside estate in Gateshead. It was also a time when many aristocratic families were seeking to cut back on ostentatious displays of wealth following the destruction of the nobility in the Russian Revolution, plus there was a shortage of domestic servants following the First World War. Lady Strathmore, though ill at the time, hurried down to Streatlam to rescue as many items as possible, many of which were taken to Glamis Castle. The armorial ceilings, installed at Streatlam by John Bowes, were moved to the Bowes Museum, which he had established. After World War II, many country houses were being demolished. Finally in 1959 the shell was blown up as a training exercise by the Territorial Army. Today only Streatlam Park and its entrance lodges (shown above) remain. An exhibition on the history of Streatlam Castle opened at the Bowes Museum in November 2017, and then moved to Glamis Castle in March 2018. It included paintings previously displayed at the property, and scale models of the castle and the estate. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Sunniside local history society Category:Archaeology of the United Kingdom Category:Country houses in County Durham Category:Demolished buildings and structures in England ","title":"Streatlam Castle"},{"id":"20499797","text":"Ryan MacBeth (born 29 April 1991) is a Scottish football midfielder who is who plays for Scottish Junior club Pollok. ==Career== Having been part of the Partick Thistle youth set-up, he was signed at the start of the 2008-09 season on the Modern Apprentice scheme.

At the end of the nineteenth century the sole landowners are given as the Lords of the Admiralty. Geological variations in this area allowed many coal seams to develop, some two feet thick, and were among the earliest coal formations in Britain. There were extensive collieries and manufactories of lime, bricks and tiles around Scremerston, and this, as well as agriculture, were the mainstays for employment for people in the area. The soil is of a clay nature, perfect for the making of bricks and tiles. Crops such as wheat, beans, barley, oats and turnip were grown. The parish is largely agricultural, but the influence of mining is responsible for the growth of the township, though today all of those mines have been closed. == Governance == Scremerston is in the parliamentary constituency of Berwick-upon-Tweed. ==Landmarks== The Devil's Causeway passes the village less than to the west.

The North and South Tyne meet near the village of Warden. There is a pleasant walk from the Boat Inn [later renamed to Boatside Inn] along the bank of the South Tyne to the meeting of the waters. The Boat Inn was formerly the place of a ferry until the toll bridge was built across the river. The toll house still stands, but the old bridge was replaced in 1904 by a County structure. The Newcastle and Carlisle Railway crosses the river by a strongly built iron bridge. Warden is dominated by the old motte, now tree covered, and higher still are the earthworks of a prehistoric fort. The church boasts one of the slender Anglo- Danish towers which are a feature of the Tyne valley. The churchyard appears oval in shape, which reinforces the notion of the great age of these Tyne parish centres. A carved stone stands close to the tower, but nothing more is claimed for it than being a 'market cross'. As, however, there is no record of a market here, inherently unlikely because of the proximity of Hexham market, a better case for its origin may be as one of the boundary crosses marking the sanctuary limits or 'frith' of St Wilfrid's church at Hexham. The socket of one such cross survived near the road at Acomb. From Warden one can see eastwards among the trees which rise on the northern slope of the valley the spire of the Church of St John Lee on high ground at Acomb. It commemorates the hermitage of St John of Beverley, sometime bishop of Hexham (689-705). The present church is no older than 1818-85. From High Warden, on the hillside, a path leads to a large fortified British camp crowning the hill, which gives a fine outlook over the surrounding country. == Governance == Warden is in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham. ==Economy== Warden is situated on a triangle of land between the two Tynes. It had a water mill on the North Tyne and a paper mill on the South Tyne, which started in 1763 and still exists. A century ago a visitor described how the rags were converted into beautiful white paper. The mill employed 63 hands. == Religious sites == St Michael's Church The church at Warden is dedicated to St Michael, and has a fine upstanding Anglo Saxon tower dating back to the eleventh century, and built of Roman stone. Indications are that there was a church earlier than the tower, and in the post Conquest period, another church was added to the tower. The tower arch is built of Roman material, probably from Chesters. Transepts were added in the thirteenth century making the church cruciform in shape. There were alterations in the eighteenth century, and the chancel was rebuilt in 1889. In the chancel is a Norman grave-cover that is the best of its kind in the county. Its shape and tile decoration symbolise a house of the dead. There are a number of incised grave covers in the porch, and a Roman altar that has been carved with Saxon knot-work. It has been split and reversed, possibly \\"to empty out the devils.\\" An 18th century horsing-stool stands at the church- gate. Three of the bells in the church were cast in 1878 by the Newcastle firm of Cox and Sons. There is also a Methodist church built in 1851. In appearance it resembles a barn rather than an ecclesiastical edifice. ==ReferencesExternal links== *GENUKI (Accessed: 28 November 2008) Category:Villages in Northumberland ","title":"Warden, Northumberland"},{"id":"20499997","text":"RollDaBeats (branded in lowercase, as rolldabeats, previously known as Tarzan) is an online music database dedicated to drum and bass and its various stylistic origins. It was launched in February 2005 by the original webmaster Thijs Engels, and web designer Tom \\"Haste\\" Johnson. According to the website, the database holds over 100,000 tracks released by more than 20,000 artists. ==History== RollDaBeats originally started as an offline database stored on Engels' computer, first as plain text and then later as an Excel worksheet. The database grew and after five years Engels decided to make the database available online. In late 2001 he launched Tarzan using the database compiled from his personal music collection. With the help of site visitors through the guestbook and forum, the database continued to expand in both detail and volume. In 2005 the website was redesigned by Haste, one of the contributors from the Tarzan forum, and was relaunched as Rolldabeats in February with its own domain name. It is now co-owned by Engels and Haste and maintained by a small team of site moderators, and has subsequently collected information on over 100,000 tracks released by more than 20,000 artists. The site was nominated twice for Best Website in the Dutch Drum 'n' Bass Awards of 2006‚Äì07, losing to DnBForum.nl on both occasions, and taking joint second with 3VOOR12 in the latter. It has also promoted a series of DJ mixes titled A Decade in the Mix by various members of the site staff which illustrate the development of drum and bass in the 1990s. The site held a fundraiser on 3 November 2007, hosted by London nightclub DiTch, featuring several live sets including DJ Bailey of BBC Radio 1Xtra. ==Content== Rolldabeats provides information on artists, releases and record labels which includes catalogue numbers, track listings, release dates and cover artwork. The site owners are considering incorporating features such as audio clips of tracks, and music videos. The site also has an active Internet forum for announcements and submitting updates. Site content is collected in several different ways. Originally the database was compiled from Engels' personal music collection, and later extended from the collections of site moderators. Some of the data is also gathered from online research by the site staff. The site also gathers much of its information from visitors through a forum, as well as other means including email and instant messaging, which is then confirmed and added manually by a site moderator. Visitors, particularly artists and label owners, are openly encouraged to submit updates on any information that is missing or incorrect. ==See also== *Discogs *List of online music databases ==ReferencesExternal links== * ‚Äì official site Category:Online music and lyrics databases Category:Dutch music websites ","title":"RollDaBeats"},{"id":"20500022","text":"Popular Action may refer to: * Popular Action (El Salvador) * Popular Action (Italy) * Popular Action (Peru) * Popular Action (Spain) * Popular Action (Equatorial Guinea) * Actio popularis ","title":"Popular Action"},{"id":"20500023","text":"Kamala Nagar may refer to: * Kamala Nagar, Bangalore *Kamala Nagar, Hyderabad ","title":"Kamala Nagar"},{"id":"20500030","text":"Early Spring Early Spring is a hanging scroll painting by Guo Xi.

The D3X is the third camera in Nikon's line to offer a full- frame sensor, following the D3 and D700. As Nikon's new flagship model, it augments the Nikon D3S, Nikon's high-speed professional model, and while the D3S retains advantages in terms of high ISO performance and higher frame rate, the D3X offers a dramatic increase in resolution and image detail. The D3S and D3X follow the earlier Nikon D1, Nikon D2H, Nikon D2Hs, Nikon D2X, Nikon D2Xs, and Nikon D3 as the company's top-of-the-line DSLRs intended for professional photographers, which in turn share a lineage with the Nikon F through Nikon F6 series of film SLRs. ==Features== It otherwise offers nearly all the features of the D3S, including robust weather-sealed alloy-body construction and a built-in vertical grip. Its Nikon EXPEED image processor features automatic correction of lateral chromatic aberration, and vignetting (\\"vignette control\\") and lens distortion (\\"distortion\\"), as well as image rotation (\\"straighten\\") via playback (\\"retouch\\") menu and in camera 5:4 aspect ratio cropping. ==Reception== The combination of very high resolution with the option of 14-bit per channel recording and a very sharp anti-aliasing filter (which Nikon claims is a unique design) provides extremely high image quality, with superior dynamic range and color accuracy compared with that of other 35mm-format digital cameras. Reception of the Nikon D3X by independent reviewers has been very positive, with reservations centered on just a few disadvantages, especially its high price. Imaging Resource concludes that the D3X produces the highest image quality of any camera they have tested to date. Digital Photography Review likewise concludes that the resolution and image detail is stunning, probably the best of any digital SLR camera on the market, including the closest competitor from Canon, the EOS-1Ds Mark III. Nikon claims the D3X is a competitor to medium-format digital backs, a claim supported both by testing and by many D3X users who report on their experiences online. On the down side, Digital Photography Review notes that the D3X performs worse than the D3 in terms of speed (frame rate) and high ISO performance. Like many reviewers, they also point out the most obvious disadvantage of the D3X: the camera lists for $8000, though the present market price is much lower.Google product search: Nikon D3X The Nikon D3X has been tested by many other independent reviewers.D3S & D3X SLR review links Nikonlinks Sample images with many cameras at all ISO speeds can be compared.Imaging Resource Comparometer (needs Javascript enabled) In May 2009, the D3X won the TIPA European Photo & Imaging Award, in the \\"Best D-SLR Professional\\" category. ==References External links == * Nikon D3X ‚Äì Nikon USA * Nikon D3X Review at Digital Photography Review * Nikon D3X Sample Photos at Pbase.com D3X D3X Category:Live-preview digital cameras Category:Cameras introduced in 2008 Category:Full-frame DSLR cameras de:Nikon D3#Nikon D3X ","title":"Nikon D3X"},{"id":"20500044","text":"Champika Liyanaarachchi is a journalist, an academic and the first woman to be the editor of a daily newspaper in Sri Lanka.

Some of the diseases were new and treatments were ineffective. Malaria was deadly to many new arrivals, especially in the Southern colonies. Of newly arrived able-bodied young men, over one-fourth of the Anglican missionaries died within five years of their arrival in the Carolinas.Bradford J. Wood, \\"'A Constant Attendance on God's ': Death, Disease, and the Anglican Church in Colonial South Carolina, 1706-1750,\\" South Carolina Historical Magazine (1999) 100#3 pp. 204-220 in JSTOR Mortality was high for infants and small children, especially for diphtheria, smallpox, yellow fever, and malaria. Most sick people turned to local healers, and used folk remedies. Others relied upon the minister-physicians, barber-surgeons, apothecaries, midwives, and ministers; a few used colonial physicians trained either in Britain, or an apprenticeship in the colonies. One common treatment was blood letting.Viets (1935), p.390 The method was crude due to a lack of knowledge about infection and disease among medical practitioners. There was little government control, regulation of medical care, or attention to public health. By the 18th century, Colonial physicians, following the models in England and Scotland, introduced modern medicine to the cities in the 18th century, and made some advances in vaccination, pathology, anatomy and pharmacology.Richard H. Shryock, \\"Eighteenth Century Medicine in America,\\" Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society (Oct 1949) 59#2 pp 275-292. online == Physicians == In Colonial America, local doctors, midwives, healers and even officials administered medical care to the residents in their village or town. There was no distinction between physicians and surgeons; when an emergency occurred the person who was responsible for administering medical care was expected to handle all aspects of the problem. In most places, there were families in which the folk practice of medicine and knowledge of curative drugs was passed down through the generations.Joseph I. Waring, \\"Colonial Medicine in Georgia and South Carolina,\\" Georgia Historical Quarterly (1959) Vol. 59, Supplement, pp. 141-153 [ in JSTOR There were several noted physicians in Colonial America; The practice of the larger cities, especially Philadelphia, New York, Boston and Charleston. The first medical schools were founded late in the colonial era in Philadelphia and New York.Martin Kaufman, American medical education: The formative years, 1765-1910 (Greenwood, 1976). === Thomas Thacher === Thomas Thacher was an outstanding Puritan preacher and physician of his time.Viets (1935), p.393 After coming to America at fifteen, Thacher received his early education under pastor Charles Chauncy. Thacher's education was liberal; he learned elements of medicine. Thacher committed much of his time to the practice of medicine and was a prominent physician in Boston. Shortly before Thomas Thatcher's death in 1677, he wrote a short article on smallpox and measles. It was the first medical paper written that was published in America.Thomas Thacher, A Brief Rule to Guide the Common- people of New-England how to Order Themselves and Theirs in the Small Pocks, Or Measles (First Published in 1677/8, Reprinted in 1702 and 1721-22; new edition Johns Hopkins University Press, 1937) === Giles Firmin === Giles Firmin was a deacon in Boston, who came to America from England in 1632.Viets (1935), p.394. While practicing medicine in Ipswich, Massachusetts, Firmin became the first anatomical lecturer in America. Firmin gave detailed lectures about dried bones stimulating an interest of the General Court in 1647, which recommended that his anatomical lectures be given at least once every four years. Nevertheless, it was not followed and anatomy went untaught. === John Winthrop === John Winthrop was a physician who was in constant communication with England asking for advice on various medical topics and diseases. Winthrop realized the Colony needed trained doctors and received from a physician in England eight pages of notes on herbs and their uses in curing diseases in 1643. Through these notes, Winthrop used the knowledge to advise the people in the Colony. He was untrained in medicine and had little experience in making a diagnosis relying a great deal on the notes from England. Winthrop's recommendations were for various ointments, nauseous remedies, cupping, bandages and baths. His practice was later taken over by his son .Viets (1935), pp.392-393.John Ballard Blake, Public health in the town of Boston, 1630-1822 (1959). == Epidemics == Epidemics of many diseases were reported during the colonial times - particularly smallpox, .Viets (1935), p.396. Malaria was endemic, and especially in the southern colonies everyone could be expected to become infected. === Yellow Fever === Yellow Fever was a disease that caused thousands of deaths, and many people to flee the afflicted areas.Bauer (1940), p.362. It begins with a headache, backache, and fever making the patient extremely sick from the start,Viets (1935), p.363. and gets its name from the yellow color of the skin, which develops in the third day of the illness. At the end of one week, the afflicted person is either dead or recovering. Yellow Fever is transmitted by mosquitoes, when it bites an infected person it carries several thousand infective doses of the disease making it a carrier for life passing it from human to human.\\"Yellow Fever and Mosquitoes\\" (1900), pp.692-693. Yellow Fever made its first appearance in America in 1668, in Philadelphia, New York and Boston in 1693. It had been brought over from Barbados. Throughout the Colonial period, there were several epidemics in those cities as well as Texas, New Hampshire, Florida and up the Mississippi River as far as St. Louis, Missouri. During many of these epidemics, the residents who chose to stay in the area avoided others by shutting themselves in their houses away from friends and jobs. Unemployment and businesses coming to a halt was universal. The death rate was so high the people had to work day and night to bury the dead.Viets (1935), p.362. === Smallpox === Smallpox is caused by the variola virus and is extremely contagious, for it is spread by physical contact and affects children and adults alike. Smallpox was contagious, disfiguring, and often deadly. The epidemics of the disease were recurrent, devastating, and frequent.Becker (2004), p.384. A particularly virulent sequence of smallpox outbreaks took place in Boston, Massachusetts. From 1636 to 1698, Boston endured six epidemics. In 1721, the most severe epidemic occurred. The entire population fled the city, bringing the virus to the rest of the Thirteen Colonies.Ballard C. Campbell, ed. American Disasters: 201 Calamities That Shook the Nation (2008) pp 21-22 Colonists tried to prevent the spread of smallpox by isolation and inoculation. Inoculation caused a mild form of the disease; it was new to the country and very controversial because of the threat that the procedure itself could be fatal, or otherwise spread the disease. It was introduced by Zabdiel Boylston and Cotton Mather in Boston in 1721.Ola Elizabeth Winslow, A destroying angel;: The conquest of smallpox in colonial Boston (1974) The procedure involved injecting the infection into the patient, which resulted in a mild form of the disease. This led to a shorter period a person had Smallpox than if they had contracted naturally.Becker (2004), p.386. Strong support for inoculation came the leading Puritan minister, Cotton Mather, who preached for inoculations during the 1721 smallpox epidemic in Boston. His advice was heeded primarily by well-educated wealthy Puritan families.Robert Tindol, \\"Getting the Pox of All Their Houses: Cotton Mather and the Rhetoric of Puritan Science,\\" Early American Literature (2011) 46#1 pp 1-23. The town of Cambridge and Harvard College combined broad- based inoculation programs with inspection and isolation efforts. They providing a model followed by other New England communities, which increasingly adopted the immunization and quarantine policies by 1800.John D. Burton, \\"The Awful Judgements of God upon the Land\\": Smallpox in Colonial Cambridge, Massachusetts,\\" New England Quarterly (2001) 74#3 pp. 495-506 in JSTOROla Elizabeth Winslow, A Destroying Angel: The Conquest of Smallpox in Colonial Boston (1974) South Carolina resisted inoculation. James Kilpatrick, a British physician vigorously promoted vaccination in the mid-18th century, but failed to convince local medical and political leaders.Claire Gherini, \\"Rationalizing disease: James Kilpatrick's Atlantic struggles with smallpox inoculation,\\" Atlantic Studies (2010) 7#4 pp 421-446. == Other colonial diseases == Although yellow fever and smallpox were two very destructive diseases that affected Colonial America, many other diseases affected the area during this time. During the early days of the colonial settlement, people brought with them contagious diseases. After the importation of African slaves, more serious parasitic diseases came to Colonial America. === Malaria === The cause of malaria was unknown until the late 19th century. Colonial physicians attributed it to \\"miasma\\" or bad air.Karen Ordahl Kupperman, \\"Fear of Hot Climates in the Anglo-American Colonial Experience,\\" William and Mary Quarterly (1984) 41#2 pp. 213-240 in JSTOR In reality this disease is a parasite that is found in certain species of mosquitoes, which bred more rapidly as virgin soil was broken in the Carolina lowlands for rice cultivation.Faust (1955), p.958. The parasite found the slaves as a reservoir for the infection of the mosquito. The mosquito then transmitted the parasite to other slaves and the white population, causing rapid development of highly malarious communities. The disease spread across the South and Northwest. People who newly arrived from Europe were especially vulnerable to the deadly forms, but after the second generation, the colonists typically suffered non- fatal cases, characterized by a feverish season for a few weeks every year.H. Roy Merrens and George D. Terry, \\"Dying in Paradise: Malaria, Mortality, and the Perceptual Environment in Colonial South Carolina,\\" Journal of Southern History (1984) 50#4 pp. 533-550 in JSTOR === Hookworm infection === The Hookworm infections were first seen in 1845 Florida and 1850 Louisiana.Faust (1955), p.959. This disease is thought to have been introduced into Colonial America from the Eastern Hemisphere, caused by a tropical parasite that was distributed throughout the moist soils of the southwest, from a Virginia to Illinois and down the Gulf of Mexico toward Texas. The slaves were the carriers of the disease polluting the soil that they worked, depositing the parasitic eggs. As the eggs hatch, the parasite infects those near the soil where it lives. === Thiamine deficiency === Unlike some diseases, Thiamine deficiency or beriberi, is a treatable, preventable disease caused by the deficiency of vitamin B1.Jones (1963), p.7. First seen in 1642 by the Dutch physician Jacobus Bontius, it was named for the Cingalese word meaning weakness-weakness. Beriberi is seen in two forms: wet and dry. When in the dry form the patient experience pains in their extremities, paresthesias, paralyses, and contractures due to being a paralytic type of disease. When beriberi is in its wet form the patient can expect swelling of the extremities and face along with an effusion of fluid into their joints, pleural cavity, and pericardial cavity. Beriberi in this form can lead to sudden death. New England fishermen first discovered the disease in Colonial America in the 19th century. There have been accounts that beriberi was seen in Jamestown with people experiencing swellings and fluxes and high fevers as well as soldiers in the American Civil War who experienced the same symptoms as the disease beriberi.Jones (1963), p.8. === Typhoid and dysentery === Acute Bacillary dysentery has a shorter duration than Typhoid but both cause bloody flux. These two diseases are deadly in their own right but when a person has both at the same time it is almost impossible to recover.Jones (1963), p.9. The Typhoid Fever causes a prolonged burning fever, is debilitating, and causes death more often than not. It occurs mostly in the hot months of the year but can flare up at any time.Jones (1963), p.10. The first epidemic of the fever was located in Virginia by Reverend Robert Hunt after taking a voyage where Typhoid Fever transpired. Typhoid Fever was a huge component of military operations; because many soldiers would become afflicted with the disease the military had a shortage of men.Benenson (1984), pp.2-3 More men died from Typhoid Fever than in action or from wounds.Benenson (1984), p.3 == See also == * Colonial history of the United States * History of medicine in the United States == Notes  Further reading == * Bauer, J.R., \\"Yellow Fever\\", Public Health Reports (1896-1970) Vol. 55, no.

The current building replaced the brick building in 1883. The current building is 128 feet by 98 feet. It was built with a square tower rising out of the center. The tower was 168 feet tall with a clock on each side. Built of Indiana limestone from Ellettsville, it cost $125,909. During construction there were several problems with the building stone. It was eventually finished at an additional cost $10,000.Neeley, George E.; City of Valparaiso, A Pictorial History; G. Bradley Publishing, Inc.; St. Louis, Missouri; 1989 ==History== The County Courthouse has always occupied this site. The first Courthouse was built in 1837. It was a wooden frame construction at a cost of $1,250. In 1853 it was replaced by a brick building (40 x 60 foot) at a cost of $13,000. An old photograph I the Historical Society of Porter County shows a Greek Revival style building. Rectangular shape with a belfry rising above a pilastered portico. The belfry is three horizontal bands, the second with louvers for a bell and a small domed top.Mullins, Lanette; Images of America; Valparaiso ‚Äì Looking Back, Moving Forward; Arcadia Publishing; Chicago, Illinois; 2002; pg 10 On December 27, 1934, the Courthouse caught fire. The temperatures were below zero degrees Fahrenheit. The fire rose through the 168-foot tall tower sending ashes across the city. It took local fire departments and some from Gary and LaPorte to finally contain the blaze. When it was out, the central structure was severely damaged and the building gutted. The cause was never determined, but many at the time believed that the fire was set ablaze by infamous local racketeer Christopher Mahlmann. At the time, Mahlmann was a leading advocate for having the courthouse turned into a brothel. The building was repaired at a cost of $172,000 by a Lafayette firm. While the profile has been lowered and the tower has not been rebuilt. The current building is much of what was restored in 1937. ==See also== * Valparaiso Downtown Commercial District ==ReferencesSources== * Mullins, Lanette; Images of America; Valparaiso ‚Äì Looking Back, Moving Forward; Arcadia Publishing; Chicago, Illinois; 2002 * Neeley, George E.; City of Valparaiso, A Pictorial History; G.

It is named after astronomer Marc Aaronson, who died in 1987 in an accident while making astronomical observations. He was 36 years old. The lectureship and cash prize are awarded every eighteen months to an individual or group who, by his or her passion for research and dedication to excellence, has produced a body of work in observational astronomy which has resulted in a significant deepening of our understanding of the universe. Any living scientist is eligible for this award without consideration of race, sex, or nationality. Fourteen previous Aaronson Prize winners are returning to Tucson on Apr 3‚Äì4, 2017, for a scientific symposium in Marc's honor. Aaronson came to Steward Observatory as a postdoc after receiving his PhD degree from Harvard in 1977 and became an Associate Professor in 1983. His astronomical research focused on many of the most important problems of observational cosmology: the cosmic distance scale, the age of the Universe, the large-scale motion of matter, and the distribution of invisible mass in the Universe. Aaronson made important contributions to the understanding of stellar populations in the Large Magellanic Cloud. In recognition of his research achievements, Aaronson was awarded the George Van Biesbroeck Award by the University of Arizona in 1981, the Bart J. Bok Prize by Harvard University in 1983, and the Newton Lacy Pierce Prize by the American Astronomical Society in 1984. ==Recipients== Source: University of Arizona {  - !

His fictional tropes and settings are comparable in many ways to those of Rudyard Kipling, a writer whom he self-consciously imitated. == Life == Candler was educated at Repton School and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he graduated in classics in 1895. Candler embarked on a career in India which was to last intermittently for the next twenty-five years. He aimed to finance his literary ambitions by teaching, and was first employed by a school at Darjeeling in the Himalayan foothills. It was on the other side of the great range that he would first achieve prominence as a writer, after gaining an appointment as the Daily Mail correspondent accompanying the expeditionary force led by Sir Francis Younghusband into Tibet in 1903-4. His experiences in Tibet, including witnessing the storming of the Gyantse Dzong, later provided material for his travelogue The Mantle of the East and the short story 'At Galdang-Tso.' His account of the expedition, for which he is today principally known, was published in 1905 as The Unveiling of Lhasa. He returned to teaching in India but resigned his post at Manikpur in Bengal in a heightened atmosphere of political unrest following the Alipore Bomb Case. He claims in his autobiography that he resolved to leave after finding a death-threat lying on his desk. Preferring the politically quiescent atmosphere of a princely state, he took up the post of Principal at Mohindra College, Patiala. He left Patiala to serve as a war correspondent during the 1914‚Äì1918 War, and reported on the British capture of Baghdad for the Manchester Guardian in 1917.The Fall of Baghdad by Edmund Candler, Manchester Guardian, 16 March 1917 On returning to India he was appointed Director of Publicity for the Punjab in 1919, a position which he held until his permanent retirement to England in 1921.See the short biography of Candler in Empire Writing (ed. Boehmer), Oxford University Press 1998, pp.474‚Äì475Mohindra College, Patiala In comparison with most of the British population in India at the time Candler held some startlingly liberal and sympathetic views of Indian nationalism. Although he does regard the political resistance of his Bengali students with a very serious eye, he concedes in his autobiography that put in their position he too would seek a means of overthrowing imperial rule. However the lack of trust in those whom he wished to educate ultimately led him to despair of ever enjoying intimate friendship with Indians and to abandon hope in the British Empire as a civilising project. Disillusioned, he became gradually embedded in the political conservatism of 'Anglo-Indian' club society, and in 1913 his fellow-author E.M. Forster found him in the \\"loneliness and isolation of his life at Patiala\\"From Forster's Indian Diary , quoted by Robin Jared Lewis, E.M. Foster's Passages to India (pp.67‚Äì69) a cantankerous and creatively parched figure. Candler's work, most notably his self-portrait as the schoolmaster Skene in the novel Siri Ram: Revolutionist, registers ‚Äúthe passage from romantic expectations to a disappointed acceptance of the unease which English and Indian generated in each other measures the distance between a traveller‚Äôs fantasies ‚Ä¶ and a white resident‚Äôs experiences.‚ÄùBenita Parry, Delusions and Discoveries: India in the British Imagination, Verso (London, 1998), p.129 ==Writings== In a letter of 1909 to his brother he writes that in his more confident moments he feels that ‚Äúmy stuff reeks of India more than any stuff but Kipling‚Äôs.‚ÄùBenita Parry, Delusions and Discoveries: India in the British Imagination, Verso (London, 1998), p.136 Kipling had left India for the last time in 1891, and his admirer Candler self-consciously follows in his footsteps, literary and literal. The Kiplingesque image of India as a grandiose and irrational land comes naturally to Candler, and when describing locations significant in Kipling‚Äôs own fiction, such as Benares (Varanasi), he applies imaginative treatments and tropes such as the heroic, Romantic or Gothic to some degree pre-fabricated for him by his master. On some occasions he in fact cites Kipling directly. Kipling's fiction forms hence a palimpsest in which Candler, for all his considerable talent, is heavily enmeshed. He shows awareness however that India, which was by his time much further advanced upon its own project of self-definition, is no longer subject to British definitions. His major work of fiction, the novel Siri Ram: Revolutionist, shows a writer caught awkwardly between his great predecessor and his own original and perceptive, if jaded, view of Indian youth. The novel arguably registers the passing of the ‚ÄòHigh Noon‚Äô of the British Empire. ==Works== * Edmund Candler, The Unveiling of Lhasa, E.

Prior to earning a library degree in 1988, Strickler was involved in linguistics, hotel management, entertainment coordination at Walt Disney World and professional gambling. Since 1988, he has been employed as a reference librarian at the University of Southern California, a library automation specialist in Provo, Utah and Emeryville, California, an abstracter/indexer of nursing journals, a motel owner/operator and, since retirement, an editor of financial documents and a lower brass musician. ==WorkCompilation and indexing=== Syndicated Comic Strips and Artists, 1924-1995: The Complete Index, published by Strickler's Comics Access in 1995, is a comprehensive compilation of American newspaper comic strips. Covering more than 4700 syndicated strips and panels, it is the largest single listing of comic strips ever compiled. The alphabetical list of strips gives dates of syndication, along with names of individuals associated with the strips. A separate section displays an alphabetical list of 3300 artists, writers and creators, providing the titles of strips each worked on with dates of their work. Another section offers a translation of nicknames and pseudonyms. Strickler's main source of information was the Syndicate Directory published by Editor & Publisher (with the exception of the World War II years 1943 and 1944). His introduction explains how he began the project in 1992: :Joe Btfsplk is to blame for this whole thing. Joe was the dismal source of woe and depression who slunk through Li'l Abner's Dogpatch, spreading misery in every direction. I was a novice reference librarian at the University of Southern California (USC) in 1992, and pretty cocky about my research abilities when a lady called, wanting to know how to spell Joe's last name. No problem, I thought. Joe's spelling took several hours to track down, however, and in the course of that long, dusty (eventually successful) hunt I realized that no substantive index of comic strips and characters existed, either at USC or anywhere else. USC's library held two well-known encyclopedias on comics but nothing like the exhaustive indexes available in other areas of the humanities. Properly intimidated at the time by the publish-or-perish world of the untenured faculty librarian, I thought that such an index, a compilation of all comic strips ever published in the United States, and their major characters (to assist the next librarian who needed to spell Btfsplk) might make an interesting and academically acceptable publication, not to mention that it would chink up a gap in the reference literature. I was, however, pragmatical enough to realize that a work of this comprehensivity would pretty much take the rest of my life. That project continues on even as we speak, with USC and tenure concerns long forgotten, and is beyond the scope of this work. Give me a few more years. ===Online comic strip database=== Strickler, who lives and works near William Randolph Hearst's castle in San Simeon, California, maintains an online searchable index of comic strips in the Los Angeles Times from 1904 to the present (August, 2011). One can search by title or by artist. Kevin Roderick's influential blog LA Observed described the database in the August 21, 2008 posting \\"Every comic, ever, in the LAT\\": :Dave Strickler, a former USC research librarian, has painstakingly compiled an online database listing the run years and some details of every comic strip to appear in the Los Angeles Times from August 21, 1904 Buster Brown) to the current era. It stands, he says, as the closest thing to a guide to full runs of comics in U.S. newspapers. He's now working on a database of comic strip characters. Strickler explained: ‚ÄúThe United States has five major national newspapers with long back runs widely available nationwide in microfilm. Three of these newspapers have never carried comics (The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Christian Science Monitor), and one has carried comics only sporadically (The Washington Post). That leaves the Los Angeles Times as the only newspaper with comics in the United States with a long back run that is widely available.‚Äù In addition, Strickler maintains a separate but unpublished index of approximately 8100 U.S. comic strips, encompassing the comics from Editor & Publisher, the Los Angeles Times and every other source discovered in 20 years of research. ===Character index=== Strickler has compiled, but not made public, an index of nearly 36,000 comic strip characters. ==See also== *Bill Blackbeard *Allan Holtz ==ReferencesSources== *Harvey, Robert C. \\"Review,\\" Inks, vol. 4, no. 1, p. 41-47.

Smith,Cumberland Evening Times (June 26, 1967):9. a novelist, Emmy award-winning filmmaker,\\"Dinitia Smith Leaves Full-Time Post at NYT\\" Galleycat (December 21, 2006). and journalist, who worked as a correspondent for The New York Times for 12 years.Daniel Nasaw, \\"About\\" They are the parents of twin sons: Peter Caleb Nasaw and journalist Daniel Allen Nasaw, both born in 1980. ==Thoughts== Although he has published three biographies, Nasaw describes himself as an academic historian, rather than a biographer. A historian, he says, \\"sweeps away the fables, the myths, the stories\\" and places scholarly subjects \\"in time and over time\\", while for biographers, the organization of the work is laid out in advance. \\"Writing history is not an art but a craft,\\" Nasaw has said. \\"It requires interpretation and fifty sources and integrating and assembling this material into a story told by an individual voice.\\" ==Books== * Starting Your Own High School, editor (Random House, 1972). * Schooled to Order: A Social History of Public Schooling in United States (Oxford University Press, 1979, 1980). * Children of the City: At Work and at Play (Anchor Press/Doubleday, 1985; Oxford University Press, 1986). In this Nasaw's highly cited history, Nasaw \\"unearthed the long- forgotten story of the Newsboy Strike.\\" The book inspired the Disney film Newsies and the subsequent Broadway musical. * Course of United States History: To 1877, Vol. 1, ed. (Thomson Wadsworth, 1987) * Going Out: The Rise and Fall of Public Amusements (Basic Books, 1993) Going Out \\"unearths fascinating details about everything from the early history of the movies to pre-World War I dance crazes,\\" wrote critic Jackson Lears in the New York Times. Nasaw \\"raises fundamental questions about the web of connections joining commercial play, public space and cultural cohesion,\\" he wrote. * The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst (Houghton Mifflin, 2000) Nasaw's 2000 biography of the American newspaper baron was praised as \\"an absorbing and ingeniously organized biography... of the most powerful publisher America has ever known\\", and for \\"immediacy that almost makes the reader forget that the author himself was not there as the story unfolded\\". In 2001, The Chief won the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize and the Bancroft Prize for American history. It was nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award. * Andrew Carnegie (Penguin Press, 2006) Nasaw's 2006 biography of the American steel mogul, was a finalist for the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for biography. A reviewer praised Nasaw for \\"bringing to life the fascinating world of business moguls, statesmen, journalists and intellectuals in which Carnegie moved.\\" Praising Nasaw's \\"keen all-rounder‚Äôs eye\\", Christopher Hitchens wrote: \\"The great strength of this immense biography is the way in which David Nasaw causes these tributaries ‚Äî capitalism, radicalism, and educational aspiration ‚Äî to converge like the three rivers (the Allegheny, the Ohio, and the Monongahela) whose confluence makes the site of Pittsburgh possible.\\" The book was among The New York Times' 100 Notable Books of the Year, and among the Favorite Books of 2006 by the Los Angeles Times, which praised it as \\"a fresh and thorough assessment.\\" * The Patriarch: The Remarkable Life and Turbulent Times of Joseph P. Kennedy (Penguin Press, November 2012) Following the success of Nasaw's 2000 biography of William Randolph Hearst, Senator Ted Kennedy approached Nasaw to write a biography of his father, Kennedy patriarch Joseph P. Kennedy. Nasaw told the family that as an academic historian, he had no interest in writing an \\"authorized biography\\". \\"I told him I would undertake this project if I had guarantees to see all the documents at the Kennedy Library and elsewhere, and if I were free to write whatever I wanted, with no censorship or interference of any kind,\\" Nasaw said. Senator Kennedy said he had read and admired Nasaw's book on Hearst and believed the historian would make a \\"fair evaluation of his life and contributions.\\" The Kennedy family agreed to sit for interviews and to make Joseph Kennedy's private papers available. After publication, the book was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 2013. * The Last Million: Europe's Displaced Persons From World War to Cold War (Penguin Press, September 2020) ==Selected Other Writings== * \\"Banking on the Future,\\" The Wall Street Journal ‚Äì May 17, 2011 * \\"A Violent Regeneration,\\" American Prospect May 23, 2009 * \\"The Rich Threaten Democracy,\\" Pittsburgh Tribune October 14, 2007 * \\"We Can't Rely on the Kindness of Billionaires,\\" Washington Post September 23, 2007 * \\"Looking the Carnegie Gift Horse in the Mouth,\\" Slate.com November 10, 2006 * \\"Giving back, big time,\\" Los Angeles Times ‚Äì November 2, 2006 * \\"Billionaires to the Rescue,\\" New York Times July 4, 2006 * \\"They Wanted to Shape Up America,\\" New York Times September 27, 2003 * \\"A Real Nice Clamb√©cque,\\" New York Times September 21, 2003 * \\"Hitler, Stalin, O'Malley and Moses,\\" New York Times May 25, 2003 * \\"The Empire Builders,\\" New York Times November 24, 2002 * \\"Earthly Delights,\\" The New Yorker March 23, 1998 ==Awards== * 2013 ‚Äì Finalist, Pulitzer Prize for biography * 2007 ‚Äì Finalist, Pulitzer Prize for biography * 2006 ‚Äì American History Book Prize * 2006 ‚Äì New-York Historical Society American History Book Prize * 2001 ‚Äì Bancroft Prize * 2001 ‚Äì Ambassador Book Award * 2001 ‚Äì J.

On November 11, 1996, the company acquired all of the assets comprising the image mapping services division of Intera Information Technologies Corporation (IITC). Many of the senior members of Intermap‚Äôs original management team were employees of IITC. Intermap originally focused on providing 3D digital elevation maps for customers under specific contract arrangements. Typically, these projects specified areas to be mapped and were generally procured by governmental mapping and/or defense agencies. ==IFSAR Products== Intermap collects elevation data aerially, using aircraft equipped with Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IFSAR) technology. Intermap‚Äôs IFSAR digital elevation model (DEM) and image products include: * Digital surface models (DSMs). A topographic model of the earth‚Äôs surface that includes buildings, vegetation, roads, and natural terrain features. The key benefit of the DSM is that it provides a geometrically correct base map. * Digital terrain models (DTMs). A \\"bare earth\\" topographic model that has had vegetation, buildings, and other cultural features digitally removed, enabling users to infer terrain characteristics possibly hidden in the DSM. * Orthorectified radar images (ORIs), a grayscale image of the earth‚Äôs surface that has been corrected to remove geometric distortions, accentuating topographic features far more than is possible with aerial photography. The data, once processed, is included in nationwide digital elevation datasets called NEXTMap. ===NEXTMap=== In 2002, Intermap commenced its NEXTMap program, which is focused on collecting and processing 3D digital elevation datasets for entire countries, including Great Britain (published 2003), countries in Western EuropeIntermap Technologies Completes NEXTMap Europe GeoConnexion International.

Preiser and colleagues define POE as \\"the process of evaluating buildings in a systematic and rigorous manner after they have been built and occupied for some time\\". The unique aspect of Post Occupancy Evaluation is that it generates recommendations based on all stakeholder groups' experiences of subject buildings' effects on productivity and wellbeing. Preiser, W. F., White, E., & Rabinowitz, H. (2015). Post-Occupancy Evaluation (Routledge Revivals). Routledge. ==Purposes of POE== Post Occupancy Evaluations is used to improve the ways that buildings are used to support productivity and wellbeing. Specifically it is used to: * Account for building quality * Inform planning and briefing (programming) for new buildings and alterations * Troubleshoot building/use problems (such as change management and new work styles) The British Council for Offices (BCO)Oseland N A (2007) British Council for Offices Guide to Post-Occupancy Evaluation. London: BCO. summarises that a POE provides feedback of how successful the workplace is in supporting the occupying organization and the requirements of individual end-users. The BCO also suggests that POE can be used to assess if a project brief has been met. Furthermore, the BCO recommends that POE is used as part of the Evidence-based design process, where the project usually refers to a building design fit-out or refurbishment, or to inform the project brief where the project is the introduction of a new initiative, system or process. POE usually involves feedback from the building occupants, through questionnaires, interviews and workshops, but may also involve more objective measures such as environmental monitoring, space measurement and cost analysis. ==Building interest groups== Post Occupancy Evaluations involve all stakeholder groups with interests in the subject buildings. Stakeholders are typically: * Employees - working in the buildings * Clients, customers, students, prisoners, guests and patients - receiving services in the buildings * Project sponsors, architects, engineers, builders - who produced the building * Maintenance managers, tradespeople and cleaners - who maintain the building * Future generations (represented by architects) - who will live in the environment polluted by the buildings' construction and operation ==Components of POE== The POE process provides value-neutral prompts to stimulate stakeholders to make testable observations about their experiences of buildings' effect on productivity and wellbeing. These observations are clarified and documented by the evaluator. Stakeholders' testable observations will be specific to building design, use and operating conditions and these may involve \\"negotiation\\" of all three dimensions of building evaluation to realize the optimum ways of achieving productivity and wellbeing. Recommendations are based on complete set of stakeholders' observations. Most recommendations are to inform planning and design of future new buildings the operational practices. They also generate some recommendations for modifications to the subject buildings and for changes in the ways that they are used. POE evaluators may recommend monitoring, research, investigation or project management studies. Some POE include other building studies. POE incorporate may include quantitative and qualitative techniques. Most POEs will involve seeking feedback from the occupants of the place being evaluated; this may be achieved through various survey methodology including questionnaire, interview or focus group. The occupant feedback may be supplemented by environmental monitoring, such as temperature, noise levels, lighting levels and indoor air quality. More recently, POEs tend to include sustainable measures such as energy consumption, waste levels, and water usage. Other commonly used quantitative measures include space metrics, for example occupational density, space utilization and tenant efficiency ratio. Cost, either expressed as the cost of the project per square meter or the total cost of occupancy, is considered a key metric in building evaluation and may be compared with the occupant feedback to provide a better understanding of value. ==Certification scheme== Both LEED and WELL consider occupant surveys as part of their certification scheme. === LEED v4 === IEQ survey, as a part of POE, is involved in LEED certification scheme v4. For all LEED O+M projects using LEED v4, one point (EQ Credit: Occupant Comfort Survey) can be awarded to those who intents to assess building occupants' comfort. === WELL v2 === WELL involves the occupant survey in both preconditions and optimization features in the concept of community. Besides, it has a particular feature related to occupant survey on thermal comfort concept.  Occupant Survey  Occupant Survey (Feature C03) is one of the precondition features of the community concept, which means it is mandatory for certification. This feature intends to establish minimum standards for the evaluation of experience and self-reported health and well- being of building occupants. The requirements of this feature are the following two parts: * Part 1: Select project survey. This can be either a third-party survey, or a custom survey; * Part 2: Administer survey and report results.  Enhanced Occupant Survey  Enhanced Occupant Survey (Feature C04) is an optimization feature of community concept, which helps to achieve WELL certification. The purpose of this feature is to evaluate comfort, satisfaction, behavior change, self-reported health and other robust factors related to the well-being of occupants in buildings. A project can have up to 3 points it meets below requirements: * Part 1: Select enhanced survey. This survey can be one of the pre-approved surveys in Feature C03 Part 1 with either additional one to three modules specific to WELL or additional three to six project related topics (1 point); * Part 2: Administer pre-occupancy survey and report results (1 point); * Part 3: Monitor survey responses (1 point); * Part 4: Facilitate interviews and focus groups (1 point).  Enhanced Thermal Performance  Enhanced Thermal Performance (Feature T02) is one of the optimization features of thermal comfort concept. This feature aims to enhance thermal comfort and promote human productivity by ensuring that a substantial majority of building users (above 80%) perceive their environment as thermally acceptable. The maximum points are three, and there are achieved by following parts: * Part 1: Enhanced thermal environment. This is achieved by meeting specific standards (1 point); * Part 2: Achieve thermal comfort. A post-occupancy survey should be administered at least twice a year to check whether regular occupants are satisfied with the thermal performance or not. ==POE at any stage after building occupancy== The term \\"post occupancy\\" can be confusing and simply refers to an occupied building rather than a vacant one. Furthermore, POEs may be conducted at regular intervals to monitor how the building facilities and its operation are currently supporting the occupants. A pre-project POE may be used to: * Document ways in which stakeholders experience buildings * To inform the briefing and design process for proposed buildings and building alterations * To negotiate and resolve new building features and qualities, which compromise productivity and well being * Measure a dimension of project success * feedback and feed-forward * Set a baseline for measurement * Establish benchmark data * Input to the change management programme and to align change management and design * Highlight where future investments may be best placed, and best avoided A POE is often carried out six to twelve months after construction work is complete and buildings are occupied. Post Occupancy Evaluations are also undertaken at any time buildings' \\"lives\\"; particularly to understand stakeholders' experience of them, for briefing alterations and changes. ==Any built environment accommodating people== POE's have been conducted of facilities for schools, universities, technical institutes, kindergartens, museums, offices, courts, corrections, military, hospitals, landscape/civil works, learning environments,Barlex M J (2006) Guide to Post Occupancy Evaluation.

All cephalopods, with the exception of the Nautilidae and the Cirrina (deep-sea octopuses),Hanlon, Roger T. and Messenger, John B. (1999) Cephalopod Behaviour, p. 2. Cambridge University Press. are able to release ink. The ink is released from the ink sacs (located between the gills) and is dispersed more widely when its release is accompanied by a jet of water from the siphon. Its dark colour is caused by its main constituent, melanin. Each species of cephalopod produces slightly differently coloured inks; generally, octopuses produce black ink, squid ink is blue-black, and cuttlefish ink is a shade of brown. A number of other aquatic molluscs have similar responses to attack, including the gastropod clade known as sea hares. ==Inking behaviours== Two distinct behaviours have been observed in inking cephalopods. The first is the release of large amounts of ink into the water by the cephalopod in order to create a dark, diffuse cloud (much like a smoke screen) that can obscure the predator's view, allowing the cephalopod to make a rapid retreat by jetting away. The second response to a predator is to release pseudomorphs (\\"false bodies\\"), smaller clouds of ink with a greater mucus content, which allows them to hold their shape for longer. These are expelled slightly away from the cephalopod in question, which will often release several pseudomorphs and change colour (blanch) in conjunction with these releases. The pseudomorphs are roughly the same volume as and look similar to the cephalopod that released them, and many predators have been observed attacking them mistakenly, allowing the cephalopod to escape (this behaviour is often referred to as the \\"blanch-ink- jet manoeuvre\\"). Furthermore, green turtle (Chelonia mydas) hatchlings that have been observed mistakenly attacking pseudomorphs released by Octopus bocki have subsequently ignored conspecific octopuses. Many cephalopod predators (for instance moray eels) have advanced chemosensory systems, and some anecdotal evidenceMacGinitie, G.E. and MacGinitie, N. (1968) Natural History of Marine Animals, pp. 395‚Äì397, 2nd ed. McGraw-Hill, New York. suggests that compounds (such as tyrosinase) found in cephalopod ink can irritate, numb or even deactivate such apparatus. Few controlled experiments have been conducted to substantiate this. Cephalopod ink is nonetheless generally thought to be more sophisticated than a simple \\"smoke screen\\"; the ink of a number of squid and cuttlefish has been shown to function as a conspecific chemical alarm. Octopuses have also been observed squirting ink at snails or crabs approaching their eggs. Numerous cuttlefish species add a coat of ink to their eggs, presumably to camouflage them from potential predators. == Physical properties == Sepia officinalis ink forms a polydisperse suspension composed by spheric particles with a size between 80 and 150 nm (measured by TRPS and SEM). The particles have a density of , which may be due to the amount of metals that has in its composition (4.7% in weight). ==Chemical composition== Cephalopod ink contains a number of chemicals in a variety of different concentrations, depending on the species. However, its main constituents are melanin and mucus. It can also contain, among other things, tyrosinase, dopamine and L-DOPA, as well as small amounts of free amino acids, including taurine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, alanine and lysine. ==Use by humans== Arr√≤s negre owes its dark colour to squid ink Cephalopod ink has, as its name suggests, been used in the past as ink for pens and quills; the Greek name for cuttlefish, and the taxonomic name of a cuttlefish genus, Sepia, is associated with the brown colour of cuttlefish ink (for more information, see sepia). Squid ink pasta with truffles and pistachios Modern use of cephalopod ink is generally limited to cooking, primarily in Japan and the Mediterranean, where it is used as a food colouring and flavouring, for example in pasta and sauces, and of course calamares en su tinta. For this purpose it is generally obtainable from fishmongers, gourmet food suppliers, and is widely available in markets in Japan Ohigashi, Hajime; Osawa, Toshihiko; Terao, Junji; Watanabe, Shaw and Yoshikawa, Toshikazu, eds. (2013) Food Factors for Cancer Prevention. Springer. p. 336. and Spain. The ink is extracted from the ink sacs during preparation of the dead cephalopod, usually cuttlefish, and therefore contains no mucus. Studies have shown that cephalopod ink is toxic to some cells, including tumor cells. It is being researched in mice for its antitumor activity against Meth-A fibrosarcoma.Ohigashi, Hajime; Osawa, Toshihiko; Terao, Junji; Watanabe, Shaw and Yoshikawa, Toshikazu, eds. (2013) Food Factors for Cancer Prevention. Springer. p. 331. It currently remains unclear however if any of the antitumor activity of squid ink can be obtained from oral consumption, and this is indicated as an area for future investigation. ==ReferencesExternal links== *An article on harvesting squid ink Category:Antipredator adaptations Ink Category:Mollusc products ","title":"Cephalopod ink"},{"id":"20500538","text":"The Canton of Bastia-1 is one of the 15 cantons of the Haute-Corse department, France.

Although initial portions of the route opened in 1926 in other areas of the country, US 62 was not designated in the commonwealth until 1932. The highway connects the small cities of Sharon, Franklin, Oil City, and Warren to larger markets, such as Youngstown, Ohio and Buffalo, New York. ==Route description== U.S. Route 62 enters Pennsylvania from Ohio as part of the Shenango Valley Freeway. Four lanes, winding, and with limited stop lights, the road, which was built in 1958, bypasses the city of Sharon. A business route is signed on the former path of the highway. After passing through Sharon, the road reverts to two lane status, as it travels toward Mercer, the county seat of Mercer County. Here, it briefly joins US 19 through the center of town. The road then turns sharply toward a north-northeast alignment and features an interchange with Interstate 79. After cutting through rural Mercer and Venango counties, US 62 reaches the twin industrial towns of Franklin and Oil City. In Franklin, the highway is briefly cosigned with US 322, as it passes through the west side of town. The road then joins PA 8 to form a four-lane riverfront connector between the two towns. Immediately before entering Oil City, the roads split, with US 62 branching off to cross the Allegheny River over the Petroleum Street Bridge and serve the south side of town. After crossing this 1995 girder structure, which replaced a 1910 truss bridge, the highway remains four lanes until leaving the municipality. The Allegheny River is only rarely out of sight as the highway winds its way through Venango and Forest Counties, crossing from the south bank to the north by way of the Hunter Station Bridge, an unusual 1934 truss design. It crosses the river a third time on the Tionesta Bridge, a 1961 girder structure that set the tone for 1980s-90s replacements of a series of historic bridges along the waterway. While traveling through Forest and into Warren County, the road is oriented in a north-south direction, which is reflected in its guide signs, despite the national route‚Äôs east-west direction. The route passes through the Allegheny Islands Wilderness, crosses the river again via the Irvine Bridge, and subsequently joins with US 6 via a trumpet interchange to form part of the freeway bypass of Warren, which was constructed in 1969.

As part of train passenger operations, a train melody includes a succession of single notes organized to follow each other rhythmically to form a lilting, singular musical thought. In Japan, departing train melodies are arranged to invoke a feeling of relief in a train passenger after sitting down and moving with the departing train. In contrast, arriving train melodies are configured to cause alertness, such as to help travelers shake off sleepiness experienced by morning commuters. Metro systems in several cities, including Budapest,Budapest Metro jingle, Tokyo, Osaka, and Seoul mark train arrivals and departures with short melodies or \\"jingles\\". ==History== Le chemin de fer likely was the first musical representation of train departure and arrival. In 1844, French classical pianist Charles-Valentin Alkan composed Le chemin de fer (\\"The Railroad\\"), a programmatic √©tude for piano designed to depict the happy journey of train passengers from departing a train station to portraying the train pulling into a second station. It is frequently cited as the first musical representation of railway travel. The joyful melody of Le chemin de fer subsequently has been celebrated as a forerunner to Arthur Honegger's famous orchestral work Pacific 231, which also represents a locomotive. In August 1971, the Japanese private railway company Keihan Electric Railway became the first railway in Japan to introduce train melodies. Most of Japan's railway network was owned by the state until 1987. The former Japanese National Railways (JNR) company was privatized at that time, and the network was split between six major companies in the Japan Railways Group and a range of smaller operators. Under JNR ownership, bells were used at stations to mark the arrival and departure of trains; but privatization gave local managers greater autonomy to customize their station environments. The idea of introducing more melodic alarms was developed, and this quickly spread after passengers reacted positively. ==Characteristics== Originally, the melodies used on Japan's railways sounded more like alarms. However, since the 1990s more attention has been paid to creating tunes which fulfil several criteria: clearly marking a train's arrival and departure, encouraging timely but unhurried boarding and disembarking, making passengers feel calm and relaxed, and standing out above announcements and other noise. Railway companies have established that the ideal length of a train melody, based on the typical dwell time of a train at a station, is seven seconds‚Äîso many tunes are designed to fit that length. Hundreds of different melodies‚Äîmost written specifically for the railways‚Äîexist, and many stations or routes have their own characteristic tunes. ==Reception== Train melodies have proved to be popular with many people in Japan. Train carriage and rolling stock manufacturer Nippon Sharyo received permission to use four different train melodies owned by East Japan Railway Company and West Japan Railway Company; and in August 2002 the company released an alarm clock that plays the same lilting melodies heard on Japan's high-speed railway lines. One tune is designed to invoke the relief a train passenger experiences after sitting down and moving with a departing train, and another is intended to reduce sleepiness, such as that experienced by morning commuters. By September 2002, Nippon Sharyo had sold out the first shipment of 2,000 units, priced at 5,800 yen. In view of the success of the product, the company launched a website dedicated to the clock, featuring the Shinkansen train's melodies. Other companies have manufactured keyrings and straps featuring the tunes. There has also been criticism over the use of melodies on trains and at stations. These focus mainly on noise pollution and the tunes' contribution to it; but one author has also claimed that their use is symptomatic of a paternalistic, bureaucratic attitude towards passengers from the railway authorities, similar to the excessive use of announcements and warnings. ==References== Category:Rail transport operations Category:Railway culture in Japan Category:Audio branding ","title":"Train melody"},{"id":"20500672","text":"Michael C.

The Zipper is a highly innovative design that strongly emphasizes portability over speed or carrying capacity.Cliche, Andre: Ultralight Aircraft Shopper's Guide 8th Edition, page E-46. Cybair Limited Publishing, 2001. ==Development== The Zipper was designed in the early 1980s by established Canadian aircraft designer Chris Heintz and put into production by his company Zenair, of Midland, Ontario. Heintz's motivation for the Zipper was the ultralight aviation boom that was occurring in Canada at that time and the introduction of new aviation regulations by Transport Canada legally permitting the operation of ultralights. The Zipper incorporates many unique features, all aimed at making the aircraft more portable. This focus was due to the nature of operations in the early days of the ultralight popularity. Aircraft were not flown great distances to fly-ins or other sites, but were transported by trailer or on car top to be flown locally at remote locations. The Zipper has a quick-folding wing, built around a D-cell leading edge and spar. There are no wing ribs and the trailing edge of the wing is established by a cable which tensions the sailcloth wing covering. The wing is folded by releasing the anti-drag cables next to the nosewheel and folding the wings back along the tailboom, still supported by their struts. The wing is designed to +6 and -3 g. The Zipper features conventional three-axis controls, which was unusual in ultralights designed at this time. The all-metal, one piece, all-flying rudder and the elevator are quickly removable for transport. The tailboom is aluminum and square in cross section. The standard powerplants provided with the Zipper kits were the JPX PUL 425 engine of and the Rotax 277 of . Fuel capacity is . The twin-engined Zipper II used a similar engine configuration to its competitor, the Ultraflight Lazair, placing both engines close together to minimize engine-out requirements. ==Operational history== Zenith Aircraft Company President Sebastien Heintz, son of the designer Chris Heintz, learned to fly in a Zenair Zipper. In December 2008 there were four Zippers still registered in Canada. Consisting of two Zippers, one Zipper-RX and one Zipper II ==Variants== ;Zipper :Powerplant is one JPX PUL 425 or 212 ;Zipper-RX :Powerplant is one Rotax 277 engine of 28 hp ;Zipper II :Powerplants are two JPX PUL 212.

The game is held once every year. The participants of the game are chosen in two ways: the first is via fan ballot, with the leading vote recipients at each position starting the game; secondly the reserves are chosen by a vote among the head coaches of each squad. Coaches are not allowed to vote for their own players. If a player is injured, and cannot participate, the league's commissioner will select a replacement. ==Features== The All-Star Game is played under normal FIBA rules, but there are notable differences from an average game. The player introductions are usually accompanied by a significant amount of fanfare, including lighting effects, dance music, and pyrotechnics. Special uniforms are designed for the game each year, usually green for the Lithuanians, and white for the Time Team (non Lithuanians). A major recording artist typically sings the national anthem, prior to tip-off. Game play usually involves players attempting spectacular slam dunks and alley oops. Defensive effort is limited, and the final score of the game is generally much higher than an average LKL game. The coaches also try to give most of the reserve players some playing time on the court, instead of using a limited rotation, as they would in a normal game. The fourth quarter of the game is often played in a more competitive fashion, if the game is close. Halftime is also longer than a typical LKL game, due to musical performances, by various artists. Every few years, LKL alternates matches from Lietuviai and Time Team (Lietuviai being the All-Star Lithuanian team, and Time Team being the All-Star foreigner team) to Vilkai and Ereliai (two teams of mixed foreign and Lithuanian players). ==Results== { class= style=\\"text- align:center; font-size:90%; width:100%\\" +Summaries !rowspan=2 width=5%Year !rowspan=2 width=13%(Arena), city !colspan=3Result !rowspan=2MVP - !width=15%Champion !width=6.5%Score !width=15%Runner-up - 1994 align=\\"left\\" Panevƒó≈æys  Rytai  99‚Äì88  Vakarai  - 1995 align=\\"left\\" ≈†iauliai  Lietuviai  100‚Äì91  Time Team  Saulius ≈†tombergas (LSU-Atletas), Patrick Jones (BC Olimpas) - 1996 align=\\"left\\" Vilnius  Lietuviai  83‚Äì81  Time Team  Rimas Kurtinaitis (BC ≈Ωalgiris) - 1997 align=\\"left\\" (Kaunas Sports Hall), Kaunas  Vakarai  108‚Äì107  Rytai  - 1998 align=\\"left\\" Vilnius  Rytai  100‚Äì85  Vakarai  - 1999 align=\\"left\\" (Kaunas Sports Hall), Kaunas LKL Rinktinƒó 106-101 ≈Ωalgiris  Valdemaras Chomiƒçius (Kraitenƒó Marijampolƒó) - 2000 align=\\"left\\" (Kaunas Sports Hall), Kaunas  Lietuviai 137‚Äì97  Time Team  Mindaugas Timinskas (BC ≈Ωalgiris) - 2001 align=\\"left\\" (Kaunas Sports Hall), Kaunas  Vilkai 124‚Äì120  Ereliai  Grigorij Khizhnyak (BC ≈Ωalgiris) - 2002 align=\\"left\\" (Kaunas Sports Hall), Kaunas  Ereliai 125‚Äì117  Vilkai  Robertas Javtokas (Lietuvos Rytas) - 2003 align=\\"left\\" (Kaunas Sports Hall), Kaunas  Vilkai 105‚Äì97  Ereliai  Arvydas Macijauskas (Lietuvos Rytas) - 2004 align=\\"left\\" (Kaunas Sports Hall), Kaunas  Lietuviai 131‚Äì113  Time Team  Tanoka Beard (BC ≈Ωalgiris) - 2005 align=\\"left\\" (Siemens Arena), Vilnius  Time Team 86‚Äì74  Lietuviai  Tanoka Beard (BC ≈Ωalgiris) - 2006 align=\\"left\\" (Siemens Arena), Vilnius  Lietuviai 107‚Äì88  Time Team  Simas Jasaitis (Lietuvos Rytas) - 2007 align=\\"left\\" (Siemens Arena), Vilnius  Lietuviai 108‚Äì108  Time Team  Jonas Maƒçiulis (BC ≈Ωalgiris), Kareem Rush (Lietuvos Rytas) - 2008 align=\\"left\\" (≈†iauliai Arena), ≈†iauliai  Lietuviai 110‚Äì109  Time Team  Hollis Price (Lietuvos Rytas) - 2009 align=\\"left\\" (Kaunas Sports Hall), Kaunas  Vilkai 130‚Äì122  Ereliai  Chuck Eidson (Lietuvos Rytas) - 2010 align=\\"left\\" (Cido Arena), Panevƒó≈æys  Vilkai 109‚Äì104  Ereliai  Mindaugas Kuzminskas (BC ≈†iauliai) - 2011 align=\\"left\\" (≈†iauliai Arena), ≈†iauliai  Lietuviai 122‚Äì114  Time Team  Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas (Lietuvos Rytas) - 2012 align=\\"left\\" (≈†vyturys Arena), Klaipƒóda  Lietuviai 115‚Äì100  Time Team  Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas (Lietuvos Rytas) - 2013 align=\\"left\\" (≈†iauliai Arena), ≈†iauliai  Lietuviai 140‚Äì113  Time Team  K≈°y≈°tof Lavrinoviƒç, Darju≈° Lavrinoviƒç (≈Ωalgiris) - 2014 align=\\"left\\" (≈†vyturys Arena), Klaipƒóda  Vakarai 113‚Äì108  Rytai  Justin Dentmon (≈Ωalgiris) - 2015 align=\\"left\\" (Siemens Arena), Vilnius  Am≈æini Prie≈°ininkai  105‚Äì95  LKL ≈Ωvaig≈ædƒós  Travis Leslie (Lietuvos rytas) - 2016 align=\\"left\\" (Siemens Arena), Vilnius colspan=\\"4\\"Replaced by Karaliaus Mindaugo taurƒó } ==Other events== The All-Star Game is the featured event of the All-Star Day, which also includes a number of popular exhibition games, and competitions featuring LKL players.

She was known for her wrestling attire, choosing loose-fitting street clothes similar in style to Homicide, her strike-based style of fighting and her relationship with fellow wrestler JP Monroe. Fighting Spirit Magazine exclusively named her and rival Jetta as \\"spearheading a revolution in British wrestling\\" with regards to serious female wrestling. ==Professional wrestling careerEarly career=== After enjoying the World Wrestling Federation at a young age, particularly Ultimate Warrior, Black became reinterested in the late '90s by the age of 18. After achieving a 2:1 in Journalism and Contemporary History, Black began attending independent shows in Barking town hall, East London and after being inspired by wrestlers such as Robbie Brookside and James Mason, Black turned her own hand at wrestling through the NWA UK Hammerlock school in Kent, where she would wrestle her first matches, mainly battle royals. ===Domestic circuit=== After wrestling for Hammerlock her first significant appearance was part of an Independent Wrestling Federation Ladies Night to benefit Cancer research in 2004. After beating Jade in the first round, she lost to eventual winner Lexie Fyfe By 2006 she began to work in promotions around the UK, as well beating Skye in Irish Whip Wrestling, including appearing on the second televised show of LDN Wrestling, Caesar's Beatings, where she defeated Coventry-born wrestler Jetta beginning a long-standing feud between the two. The feud saw Jetta being inserted into a three way match, also featuring Sweet Saraya, for the vacant Real Quality Wrestling Women's Championship at Summer Brawl where Black won her first title. She was initially successful in the feud winning all her matches until the two competed in an intergender tag team match which Black and partner JP Monroe lost; the second match ended in a no-contest when Monroe turned on Black. ===International Circuit=== Black began 2007 with RQW's No Pain, No Gain event, having to defend her Women's Championship against American wrestlers Cheerleader Melissa and MsChif but went on to lose singles matches against both of them, first to MsChif the next day for 3 Count Wrestling. The day after this was the first ChickFight to be held in the UK where Black advanced to the finals of a three-round tournament after defeating Daizee Haze and Lacey, but coming up short against Melissa. Her feud with Melissa continued at RQW's Taking on the World where she tagged with fellow Melissa enemy MsChif to take on the Cheerleader and her own long-standing rival Jetta. The match also served as a warm up for ChickFight VIII where Black was booked to meet Melissa again to crown the first TransAtlantic Champion; Black came out on the losing end of both matches. Her losing streak to American wrestlers was not exclusive to MsChif and Melissa though. In March she put aside her longstanding rivalry with Jetta to team up against Allison Danger and Sara Del Rey at Ring of Honor's Liverpool show Fifth Year Festival: Finale. Allison Danger used the victory to bid for Black's title, gaining a chance at the Women's Championship during an RQW event; Black would retain the belt after the match went to a fifteen-minute time limit draw. Eden Black then began to make regular appearances at Danger's all-female Shimmer Women Athletes in Chicago eventually picking up a win over an American athlete in the form of Rain, who submitted to her Garden of Eden hold on Volume 9. In June at Shimmer's Volume 11 event, Black was entered into a knock-out tournament to crown the first Shimmer Champion but lost in the first round to Rain's fellow Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew member Lacey; incidentally these two would later team up with Jetta to form The International Home Wrecking Crew. The day after this, at Volume 12 Nikki Roxx pinned her in a four-way match with the Barbie Crusher. On Volume 13, taped that same day, Black had a chance to settle an old score when she fought Lexie Fyfe, who had beaten her early on in her career in 2004. Once again it was her Garden of Eden submission which led her to victory. Black's success continued onto Volume 14 in October, where she again forced her opponent, this time Amber O'Neal, to tap out to the Garden of Eden. In her last Shimmer appearance to date, she teamed with MsChif and Daizee Haze in a six-woman tag team contest in the debut match of the International Home Wrecking Crew. Though Black did not secure the victory herself, she was on the winning team and it was her rival Jetta who was pinned after 25 minutes following Haze's Heart punch/Yakuza kick combination. ===Back in Britain=== Black using the Garden of Eden on Jetta in her final match Although Black was mostly successful in America, months prior to her final SHIMMER appearance she lost her RQW Women's Championship at a 16 June RQW event to German wrestler Wesna, with Jetta and Amazing Kong also competing in the four way elimination match. Her rematch with Wesna, this time in a singles match, took place at ChickFight IX.5 but ended in a controversial manner when Jetta interfered in the match to make it seem as if Black had used a foreign object, thus having her disqualified. Enraged, Black chased Jetta out of the building but the two were booked for a grudge match later on that same night; Giving Jetta a taste of her own medicine, Black attacked her from behind during her entrance leading to a brawl all around ringside that consumed most of the match until it officially began inside the ring with Black eventually losing as Jetta used the ropes for the pin. After Black was on the winning side of the tag team match at Shimmer, it became clear the two needed to settle their feud one-on-one and RQW decided to host the match in October. However, the hotly anticipated bout ended in a double count-out ostensibly due to the fierce fighting between the two, though Black had actually suffered a legitimate shoulder injury during the match and could not carry on. Black would not appear again until April at a ChickFight event where she made an emotional retirement announcement that was interrupted by Jetta who demanded Black explicitly acknowledge she was the reason Black was retiring but rather than ignore her, Black challenged her to what was dubbed a \\"Career vs. Humiliation\\" match at ChickFight XI where, should she lose, Black would have to admit it was Jetta that retired her but if she won Jetta would have to publicly go on her knees and admit Black's superiority. Jetta made her intentions known by squashing Faith LeHaine early on in the evening, wrenching her shoulder with a Japanese stranglehold and spent most of the match against Black working on her shoulder but Black retaliated, applying the Garden of Eden around the ring post and eventually locking it on Jetta in the middle of the ring forcing her to tap out. Following the match Black announced that she didn't need Jetta to go on her knees as she had just proven her superiority in the match. She later announced her retirement from wrestling. ==Championships and accomplishments== *Real Quality Wrestling **RQW Women's Championship (1 time) ==ReferencesExternal links== *Eden Black on Myspace *G.L.O.R.Y.

Denys Darlow retired as Director following the 50th Festival in 2002; the current Music Director is the violinist Adrian Butterfield. The festival has become an entirely professional event and specialises in performances of Baroque music using authentic instruments and orchestration. Many of the leading Baroque musicians and singers have played at Tilford.

That golden ring has the carved inscription: \\"May the Lord help the one who wears it.\\"Jovan Janiƒáijeviƒá, The cultural treasury of Serbia, IDEA Books, 1998 - History, pp. 249 Teodora married Serbian crown prince (later king) Stefan Uro≈° III (called Deƒçanski) on 24 August 1296. They had two children: future Tsar (Emperor) Stefan Du≈°an and Du≈°ica. In 1314 her husband's father Stefan Milutin quarreled with Stefan, and sent him to Constantinople to be blinded. Teodora and the family went with him and established a household there until 1320 when they were allowed to return. She was present at the state assembly of 6 January 1322, when her son Du≈°an was crowned Young king. In this period, Deƒçanski and Teodora were divorced. It is very likely that, between the death of Milutin (29 October 1321) and the crowning of Du≈°an, it was decided that Teodora be divorced from her husband due to the fact that Teodora's father's family had by then been expelled from Bulgaria, and Deƒçanski sought to empower himself by marrying into the Byzantine royal family. He then married Maria Palaiologina. It is still unknown when Teodora died. She was alive on 6 January 1322, and according to M. Vukiƒáeviƒá and S. ƒÜosoviƒá died prior to January 1323. Historian Stojan Novakoviƒá earlier based the death in the winter of 1322‚Äì23 on the talks of Deƒçanski marrying Phillip of Tarento in the beginning of 1323.

In 1876 it was taken over by the London School Board, which moved it to a new site in Silver Street, today the northern end of Kensington Church Street.Survey of London: Volume 37 In 1877 the original site of the school in Holland Park Road was sold by auction for ¬£2,650, and in its place was built the present Nos. 20‚Äì30 (even) Holland Park Road, a group of six two-storey studio residences arranged around a courtyard with an arched entrance, originally called \\"The Studios\\".Survey of London: Volume 37 The school moved a third time in 1937 to its present site on Kensington Place. ===Charles Richard Fox (1796-1873)=== A large new house completed in 1827 and named for a while \\"Little Holland House\\" was first occupied by Charles Richard Fox (1796-1873) (the illegitimate son of Henry Richard Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland, through a liaison with Lady Webster, whom Lord Holland later married) and his wife Lady Mary Fox, illegitimate daughter of King William IV. However this was actually at Number 1 Addison Road, at the north-eastern boundary of the Holland House estate, and it is probable he was persuaded to buy the freehold from his father in order to attract other high society occupants to the new development. He also purchased from his father much land surrounding the house. After his death in 1873 Number 1 Addison Road was mostly demolished and built upon, but part of the house survives as the club-house of Holland Park Tennis Club.'The Holland estate: To 1874', in Survey of London: Volume 37, Northern Kensington, ed.

British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol37/pp101-126 ===Prinsep family=== In 1850 Henry Thoby Prinsep (1792‚Äì1878), a director of East India Company, obtained a 21-year lease on it from Henry Fox, 4th Baron Holland (1802-1859), of Holland House, thanks to the painter George Frederic Watts (1817-1904), a friend of both the Hollands and the Prinseps. Watts, the Prinseps and Henry's sisters-in-law such as Julia Margaret Cameron lived, worked and entertained here for 21 years, making it the centre of their salon. When the lease expired in 1871, the Prinseps moved out and the Hollands demolished the building. Thoby Prinsep then leased a large plot of land on Melbury Road (abutting the leasehold plot of Lord Leighton) from Henry Fox- Strangways, 5th Earl of Ilchester (the heir of the 4th Baron Holland), part of which he gave to Watts. On his plot, Watts commissioned Frederick Cockerell to build a new house which he named New Little Holland House, and in which he lived from 1876 until his death in 1904. The house was demolished in 1964 after failed attempts by the London County Council to place a building preservation order on it. In its place was built a block of flats designed by Austin Blomfield, named Kingfisher House, which continues to occupy the site. ==Notes== Category:Former houses in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Category:Country houses in London Category:Demolished buildings and structures in London Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1964 Category:Dower houses ","title":"Little Holland House"},{"id":"20501141","text":"Baby Ray is a band from Cambridge, Massachusetts that was formed in the 1996 from members of the band Brain Helicopter.

He was later evacuated to the rectory in Ostr√≥w Mazowiecka, where his arm had to be amputated. It was no longer possible to study forestry, so he decided to study art, beginning at the Warsaw School of Drawing with Wojciech Gerson. Rural Landscape He painted with a metal ring of his own devising; attached to his right forearm, with screw-on clips to hold a brush, pen or piece of charcoal.

Previously of Sporting and Braga, he did not break into the first teams of either club, but did so at Rio Ave, helping them to two domestic cup finals in 2014. He also played several seasons in Turkey's S√ºper Lig, making over 100 appearances for Osmanlƒ±spor and Ankarag√ºc√º. Pinto was a Portuguese youth international. ==Club careerEarly years=== Pinto was born in Porto. After receiving his first football lessons at S.L. Benfica, both he and his father joined neighbouring Sporting CP, and the 12-year-old went on to complete his development at the Jos√© Alvalade Stadium. For 2007‚Äì08, Pinto was loaned to C.D. Olivais e Moscavide of the third division, and spent the following campaign with Primeira Liga newcomers C.D. Trofense; On 18 April 2009 he scored his first goal in the competition, as consolation in a 2‚Äì1 away defeat against Rio Ave FC; in September, after cutting ties with Sporting, he signed a four-year contract with S.C. Braga. During his first and only season, Pinto made no competitive appearances as the Minho side finished in second position. ===Rio Ave=== Pinto was released in summer 2010, and joined fellow top-flight club Rio Ave. He arrived to replace Braga-bound S√≠lvio, and had previously failed a medical at Vit√≥ria de Set√∫bal. On 3 September 2012, Pinto was loaned to Spanish side Deportivo de La Coru√±a for one year, without the option to purchase. He was presented before 200 fans at the Estadio Riazor and joined several compatriots at his new team, making his official debut on 1 November by playing the entirety of a 1‚Äì1 home draw with RCD Mallorca in the last-32 stage of the Copa del Rey and also featuring three minutes in place of Juan Dom√≠nguez in the goalless second leg four weeks later, with the subsequent elimination on the away goals rule; between those two cup matches he appeared in his only game for them in La Liga, starting and finishing the 3‚Äì5 loss at Real Zaragoza. On 11 January 2013, as he was only third-choice at his position behind Ayoze and Evaldo, Pinto's loan at Deportivo ended and he moved to Segunda Divisi√≥n's Racing de Santander for the remainder of the campaign. His only goal for the Cantabrians arrived on 23 February, concluding a 2‚Äì0 home victory over CD Mirand√©s, but the club eventually suffered a second consecutive relegation. In 2014, Pinto was an unused substitute as Rio Ave lost the finals of the Ta√ßa da Liga and the Ta√ßa de Portugal to Benfica. He played against the same team in that year's Superta√ßa C√¢ndido de Oliveira, missing in the penalty shootout to hand the opposition the title. ===Turkey=== In July 2015, Pinto signed for Osmanlƒ±spor, newly promoted to Turkey's S√ºper Lig. In his first season in Ankara, the side came fifth and qualified for the UEFA Europa League; on 28 July 2016 he scored his first goal, the only one of a home win against N√µmme Kalju FC in the competition's third qualifying round, and in the play-off on 25 August he netted both of a defeat of FC Midtjylland also at the Osmanlƒ± Stadium. Pinto moved on a three-year contract to another promoted team in the Turkish capital in July 2018, MKE Ankarag√ºc√º. In his second match on 19 August, he concluded a 2‚Äì0 win at Alanyaspor. ==International career== Pinto won 25 caps for Portugal at youth level, including two for the under-21s. He was called up to the full side for the first time on 31 March 2015 for a friendly with Cape Verde, remaining on the bench in the 0‚Äì2 defeat in Estoril. ==Personal life== Pinto was the son of Jo√£o Pinto, whom successfully represented Benfica, Sporting and the Portugal national team. In June 2009, he married B√°rbara Brilhante at the Jer√≥nimos Monastery in Lisbon, and the couple have a son and a daughter together. Pinto's uncle, S√©rgio, competed mostly in the Portuguese lower divisions, also spending a season at England's Bradford City. ==See also== *List of association football families ==References*National team data * Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Porto Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Primeira Liga players Category:Portuguese Second Division players Category:Sporting CP footballers Category:C.D.

Defense industry which had a strong position up until the 17th century, stayed outside the technological developments in Europe since the 18th century and has totally lost its impact starting from World War I. Thus, no significant defense industry infrastructure was present during the first years of the Republic and activities in this domain were limited to the establishment of new facilities near Ankara during the Turkish War of Independence. Having the view that defence industry is a part of the overall industrialization and development, the Republican Administration supported the State's guidance in industrialization and therefore the defense industry during the first planning period. Despite such activities as the in- country aircraft production, a strong ‚Äìinfrastructure could not be established due to internal and external conditions. In the post World War II Period, activities in defense industry initiated during the first years of the Republic were not sufficient due to lack of State support, which came to a halt as a result of the foreign military aid received upon promotion of bilateral relations with the United States and Turkey's membership of NATO. However, regional problems Turkey faced in the 1960s, Cyprus crises in 1963 and 1967, Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 and the arms embargo following the invasion necessitated the development of a defence industry based on national resources. After 1974, Turkish Armed Forces Foundation were established with this understanding and some investments, though limited were initiated. Besides the administrative and financial difficulties in maintaining and improving the national capabilities, limited national resources as well as the procurement policies proved insufficient to fill the increasing gap in Turkish Armed Forces defence equipment. ===1923-1950=== Machinery, craftsmen and workmen transferred discreetly from Istanbul and its surroundings at the end of the First World War played a crucial role in winning the War of Independence. Small scale and simple workshops in Ankara, Konya, Eski≈üehir, Keskin and Erzurum not only provided light weapons and ammunition but also lay the foundation for a sound local defence industry infrastructure. General Directorate of Military Facilities was set up in 1921. Establishing and industry of weapons and ammunition was discussed for the first time during the ƒ∞zmir Congress of Economics. In 1924 a facility for repair of light weapons and artillery and another facility for ammunition and carpenter work in Ankara; in 1924 a new ammunition facility in Ankara; in 1930 a capsule facility in Kaya≈ü; in 1931 a power plant and steel facility in Kƒ±rƒ±kkale ; in 1936 a facility for gunpowder, rifle and artillery; in 1943 a facility for gas masks in Mamak were established. In addition, Nuri KILLIGƒ∞L facility set up near Hali√ß region, ƒ∞stanbul; in 1930 was then one of two private firms producing weapons. Producing pistols, 81 mm mortar and its ammunition, explosives and pyrotechnics, this facility provided support to the Turkish Armed Forces during World War II. In 1924, G√∂lc√ºk Shipyard was set up for the maintenance of Yavuz battle cruiser. In 1941, Ta≈ükƒ±zak Shipyard was reactivated. Turkish aviation industry was initiated through the establishment of Tayyare ve Motor T√ºrk A≈û (TamTA≈û) in 1926. The facilities of TamTA≈û established in Kayseri, started production in 1928; until 1939, a total of 112 aircraft ‚Äì15 German Junkers A-20s, 15 US Hawk fighters, 10 US Fledgling trainers, 15 German Gotha liaison aircraft ‚Äìwere produced. After completion of the maintenance of the aircraft in the inventory of the Turkish Air Force Command, TamTA≈û suspended aircraft production in 1939. 24 Nu. 37 aircraft and many gliders were produced in the aircraft facility founded by Nuri DEMƒ∞RDAƒû in Istanbul in 1936. but this private firm was out of operation in 1943. The first major initiative in the aviation industry was the formation of an aircraft facility by Turkish Aviation Association in Ankara, 1941. Starting production in 1944, this facility produced 80 Miles Magister trainer aircraft, two ‚Äìengine ambulance aircraft THK-10 light transport aircraft, 60 Ugur two- seater trainer aircraft and various types of gliders. The first aircraft engine facility was set up in Ankara, in 1945 and started production in 1948. various facilities were established in Malatya between 1942‚Äì43 in order to repair and maintain the aircraft procured from the United Kingdom during the IInd World War. Foreign military aid that started upon Turkey's membership in NATO and increased within a short period stalled the development of local defence industry which was at its preliminary stage of formation. ===1950-1960=== Instead of improving the local defence industry, foreign aid and foreign procurement were practiced during this period. Because of the Cold War and military and political polarization after the 2nd World War, Turkey met its defence requirements through and in the framework of the NATO. Within the impact of the increasing foreign aid in the post-IInd World War period, efforts for the development of local defence industry slowed down; orders of the Turkish Armed Forces from the local suppliers decreased, thus military facilities became a part of the Machinery and Chemical Industry Corporation (MKEK) which was formed as a State Economic Enterprise on 15 March 1950. Development of, weaponry and equipment in the inventory of the Turkish Armed Forces was kept on the agenda by the Research and Development Department formed in 1954 under the Ministry of Defence in 1970, development studies of defence industry were reactivated. ===1960-1970=== It was a period regional conflicts and the Cyprus issue. Cyprus crises in 1963 and 1967 and the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, the arms embargo imposed on Turkey as a result of this invasion proved the need for a national defence industry. During the crises, Turkey was face with the difficulty of dependence on foreign supply. The deadlock experienced in this period caused to seek ways to reactivate national defence industry. During this period in which investments based on import substitution were common, production of G-3 and MG-3 rifles by the MKEK under German licenses were concrete examples of this policy put into practice. ===1970‚Äì1980=== 1970s have been the period in which solid initiatives were put into force so as to establish a national defence industry. As a result of the national reaction to the arms embargo against Turkey, Armed Forces Foundation were established. Although these Foundations formed enterprises such as Aselsan, Havelsan, Aspilsan thanks to the donations, it was soon realized that the actual need for a defence industry as required by the contemporary age could not be met through the Foundations. ===1980-1985=== In the 1980s, state initiative was undertaken to realize the modernization of the Turkish Armed Forces and the establishment of a national defence industry based on contemporary technology was set as the primary goal. The first step in this direction was taken by the establishment of defence equipment Directorate as a state enterprise. However, the shortcomings stemming from its state-bound status prevented the success and all the properties of that enterprise were transferred to the Undersecretariat for Defense Industries (SSM) which was established in 1985 under the Law No: 3238 ===Today's Turkish defense industry=== One of the main tasks of the Defense Industries is to re-organize and integrate the existing national industry so as to satisfy defence industry requirements, encourage new enterprises and channel them according to the integration and requirements, seek possibilities for foreign capital and technology contribution, guide enterprises and make plans for state participation in this respect. Over the last 21 years since its establishment, and as a result of dedicated efforts, the Presidency of Defense Industries (formerly Undersecretariat for Defence Industries) has made real achievements in the creation of a modern national defence infrastructure in Turkey, with highly successful results in certain vital areas. Key defence industrial institutions have been established to meet the requirements of the Turkish Armed Forces through local sources, each of which fill an important gap in their scope of activity. Additionally, some important capabilities have been obtained in the framework of the projects and industrialization activities. Briefly these are as follows: * Technology infrastructure * Export infrastructure * Strengthening side sectors * Restructuring industry and * Expertise The Turkish defense industry is able to manufacture national and local products, and has a wide-ranging research and development program among which the main supporting organization is T√úBƒ∞TAK. Investment in sub-system producers increased, forming tech centers such as Teknokent, with small and medium-sized enterprises, research institutions and universities. This was further boosted by its growing exports of weaponry. The latest UN figures show Turkey, China and the Czech Republic joining the list of the world's top exporters of small arms, which is led by the United States. ==Companies== * Air platforms **ALP **BAYKAR **GLOBAL **KALE AERO **Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) **Turkish Technic **TUSAS Engine Industries Inc.

EUCIP, which originated with the Council of European Professional Informatics Societies, is offered in a range of European countries through national computer societies. The EUCIP certifications are maintained by ECDL Foundation. == History of EUCIP == The evolution of EUCIP stems from a series of earlier projects in the area of IT competence. These include the EISS (European Informatics Skills Structures) and EICL (European Informatics Continuous Learning) (circa 1995-1999), EPIC (European Professional Informatics Certificate) in 2000, which aimed at providing a basic level of IT professional certification, followed by EPICS (European Professional Informatics Certificate Service) in 2001‚Äì2003, which saw the development of what was soon to become the EUCIP Core syllabus. This EPICS activity involved input from several European Subject Matter Experts. In addition, the EPICS project applied for financial support from the EU, through the TEN-telecom program. As a result of this funding, a market validation project took place to prepare a business plan for a limited market in six European countries. The name was changed to EUCIP in late 2001 and a EUCIP central organisation was created as part of CEPIS. An initial meeting of early adopters was held in Athens in January 2002 and the work of creating the EUCIP product (based on the initial activities from the EPICS) began. During 2002, a test base was developed and extensive piloting activities took place in Italy, Finland, Norway, UK, Estonia and Germany. Later in the year, the working groups which had been involved in designing the product were transformed into a more structured form and EUCIP moved into office space in the BCS (British Computer Society) headquarters in Swindon. The first official tests took place in Italy in July 2003, soon followed by Norway. During 2004 CEPIS decided to hand over operation and maintenance support for EUCIP to ECDL Foundation. The involvement of ECDL Foundation has led to further revision to the EUCIP programmes. == Candidates == The EUCIP certification is available in 8 European countries with testing being administered in competence centres in each these countries for a fee. ECDL Foundation markets the EUCIP programme to practitioners working in industry, government and public organisations. EUCIP aims to create a pan-European skills standard for ICT Professionals, helps to close the IT skills gap, enhance worker mobility, and increases the labour market value of certified practitioners. == EUCIP Core == According to ECDL Foundation, the EUCIP Core provides students with a solid foundation for all types of ICT related work. To achieve a EUCIP certification, the candidate must successfully pass a test in all three knowledge areas. These are: A) Plan Area: The Use and Management of Information Systems This area refers to requirements analysis and planning in the use of ICT within an organisation. It is therefore directly concerned with management processes and defining requirements within a strategic perspective. B) Build Area: Development and Integration of Information Systems This area includes processes for specification, development and testing, and maintenance of Information Systems. It deals with methodological and technological issues related to development processes. C) Operate Area: Operation and Support of Information Systems This area concerns installation, supervision and maintenance of ICT systems. Essential topics include: hardware and software concepts, management of networks, service delivery and support, and security. == EUCIP Professional == EUCIP Professional demands advanced competence in a particular role. The professional level is based on a specialised competence that a candidate may earn by working through a variety of educational modules and by gaining practical experience. There are 21 professional profiles to choose from: * IS Analyst * Business Analyst * Software Developer * Network Manager * Enterprise Solutions Consultant * X-Systems Engineer * Database Manager * Data Centre & Configuration Manager * IS Project Manager * IS Manager * IS Auditor * Logistics & Automation Consultant * Sales & Application Consultant * Client Manager * IT Systems Architect * Help Desk Supervisor * Web & Multimedia Master * Systems Integration & Testing Engineer * Telecommunications Architect * Security Advisor * IT Trainer == EUCIP IT Administrator == IT Administrator is a standalone certification programme that certifies practical and theoretical knowledge of computer technicians. The certification covers a wide range of Hardware, Software and Networks knowledge areas. Syllabus 3.0 consists of the following modules: * PC Hardware * Operating Systems * Networks * IT Security In addition, ECDL Foundation has developed a EUCIP IT Administrator - Fundamentals module that provides a broad understanding of hardware, operating systems, networks and IT Security. == References  External links == * ECDL Foundation * EUCIP programme * CEPIS * EUCIP Norway website * EUCIP Italian website * EUCIP Ireland website Category:Information technology education Category:Information technology organizations based in Europe ","title":"EUCIP"},{"id":"20501277","text":"Florence and the Machine (stylised as Florence + the Machine) are an English indie rock band that formed in London in 2007, consisting of vocalist Florence Welch, keyboardist Isabella Summers, guitarist Rob Ackroyd, harpist Tom Monger, and a collaboration of other musicians.

Welch and Summers performed together for a time under the name Florence Robot/Isa Machine. According to Welch, \\"The name Florence and the Machine started off as a private joke that got out of hand. I made music with my friend, who we called Isabella Machine to which I was Florence Robot. When I was about an hour away from my first gig, I still didn't have a name, so I thought 'Okay, I'll be Florence Robot/Isa Machine', before realising that name was so long it'd drive me mad.\\" In addition to Summers (keyboards and backing vocals), the current band members include musicians Robert Ackroyd (guitar and backing vocals), Chris Hayden (drums, percussion and backing vocals), Mark Saunders (bass guitar and backing vocals) and Tom Monger (harp). In the past, Welch has praised her band for understanding her creative process, claiming, \\"I've worked with most of them for a long time and they know my style, know the way I write, they know what I want.\\" In 2007, Welch recorded with a band named Ashok, who released an album titled Plans on the Filthy Lucre/About Records label. This album included the earliest version of her later hit \\"Kiss with a Fist\\", which at this point was titled \\"Happy Slap\\". ===2008‚Äì2010: Lungs=== Lead singer Welch performing in Singapore in 2010 Florence and the Machine released their first album Lungs in the United Kingdom on 6 July 2009.

Numerous producers expressed an interest in working on the album but Welch rejected the offers because she wanted Ceremonials to be a better version of Lungs with a \\"more dark, more heavy, bigger drum sounds, bigger bass, but with more of a whole sound\\". For the rest of the year work on the album continued only intermittently as the band concentrated on an extensive tour of the US, where Lungs had become popular.

Ephrata Area School District has concurrent agreements for dual enrollment with Franklin and Marshall College, Pennsylvania State University - Berks Campus, Millersville University and Harrisburg Area Community College - Lancaster Campus. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books.2010-2011 Pennsylvania Department of Education - Dual Enrollment Guidelines. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. For the 2009-10 funding year, the school district received a state grant of $6,484 for the program.Pennsylvania Department of Education Dual Enrollment Fall Grants 2009-10.

The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. At Ephrata Area School District the graduation project must be completed in order to attend prom and participate in senior activity day and the graduation ceremony. By Pennsylvania School Board regulations, for the graduating class of 2016, students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, English Composition, and Literature, for which the Keystone Exams serve as the final course exams. Keystone Exam scores count for at least one-third of the final course grade. ==Washington Education Center== Washington Educational Center is on Marshall Street in Ephrata Borough. It opened in October 1999, in the vacant former Washington Elementary School, as an alternative for students who could not complete the requirements of a traditional brick-and-mortar education. In 2011, the school board changed the classification of the school to a second high school in the school district. The new status means that, upon successful completion or requirements, students receive an Ephrata High School diploma. In January 2011, the Pennsylvania Department of Education identified the Washington Education Center as being in the bottom 5% of the state's public schools, for student academic achievement. According to the report, just 7.69% of the pupils were on grade level in both math and reading. For a time, this alternative school permitted students from other school districts to attend, but it terminated that policy in 2010. Washington Education Center graduated 70 students in 2009. It serves as an alternative education senior high school. The school was required by the Pennsylvania Department of Education to revise its programming to comply with the state- mandated 990 hours of attendance for students at public schools in 2010. In 2010, 24 of the school's teachers had emergency teacher certifications. ; 2010 PSSA results: * 11th grade Reading - 14% on grade level, 50% below basic.

He was elected to the Bundestag in the 2005 federal election as a member of the party list in Schleswig-Holstein. Shortly thereafter it was revealed that he had worked for the Stasi (the East German secret police) from 1985 to 1990. Heilmann drew national and international media attention when he caused the website \`www.wikipedia.de\` (not the German Wikipedia, but a search portal for it run by Wikimedia Deutschland) to be blocked by a preliminary injunction on 13 November 2008.Un ex-agent de la Stasi fait fermer le site allemand Wikip√©dia, Le Monde, 17 November 2008. German Wikipedia back online after dispute., Miami Herald, 17 November 2008. His Bundestag term ended in 2009, and he failed to be nominated for a second term. ==Revelation of Stasi work== Following his election in 2005, strong controversy erupted when it was revealed by the magazine Der Spiegel that he had worked for the Stasi (the East German secret police) from 1985 to 1990.Spiegel Online - Biografien: Ein Stasi-Mann spaltet die Linkspartei, 4 December 2005. Heilmann is the only official full-time Stasi employee to be elected MP to the Bundestag; although several other Die Linke politicians have been \\"unofficial\\" Stasi informants. Heilmann narrowly survived an impeachment by the party electorate following his untruthfulness about his Stasi career prior to becoming MP. Heilmann worked in the so-called \\"Hauptverwaltung Aufkl√§rung Personenschutz\\" department of Stasi, a large and important department within the Stasi that was directly subordinated under Erich Mielke. The department was responsible for \\"personal security\\", but also took part in regular oppression activities and employed informants.¬´Wikipedia, die Stasi und der Linken-Politiker¬ª, Die Welt, November 16, 2008 His employment record at Stasi states that Heilmann joined the Stasi because of political motivation and that he identified with his work and saw his future as a Stasi employee. He left Stasi after it was dissolved following the fall of the communist regime. The nomination of Lutz Heilmann as an MP by the Left Party has been strongly criticized by Hubertus Knabe, the director of the Berlin- Hohensch√∂nhausen Memorial. Knabe stated that Heilmann \\"has no business being in parliament\\", and said it is \\"unacceptable for the victims of the GDR communist regime to imagine that a man with such a past should serve in a parliament\\". ==Work history== He attended law school from 1992 to 2004, obtaining an undergraduate law degree (Diplom-Jurist) in 2004. During this time, he worked as a cashier at a filling station and as a carpet salesman. After a period of being unemployed (2004‚Äì2005) he obtained a position as articled clerk (Rechtsreferendar) at the Landgericht (an intermediate court) in L√ºbeckBundestag biography Lutz Heilmann . which he quit after being elected to the Bundestag. In November 2009, he returned to his job as a clerk. ==Political activities== Heilmann took part in the \\"Jugendweihe\\" in 1981. He became a member of the communist party of the German Democratic Republic, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) in 1986, and has remained a member of its successor parties (SED-PDS, PDS, Die Linkspartei.PDS and now Die Linke), although he left the party in 1992 and rejoined in 2000.

He argued for an increase in the LKW-MAUT and against a proposed waiver of the motor vehicle tax for new cars.Lutz Heilmann , page at Die Linke. Retrieved 20 November 2008. He has been involved in a fight within Die Linke, trying to get L√ºbeck party boss Ragnar L√ºttke expelled from the party. Four-year-old photographs showing L√ºttke at a party celebrating Joseph Stalin's birthday were obtained by a Flensburg newspaper in October 2008. In 2009 he failed to be nominated again as a Bundestag candidate. ==Lawsuit against Wikimedia Deutschland== Screenshot of the website \`www.wikipedia.de\` on Sunday 16 November 2008 On 13 November 2008 Heilmann pressed charges against Wikimedia Deutschland e.V. at the Landgericht L√ºbeck, obtaining a preliminary injunction which barred the internet address \`www.wikipedia.de\` (which is controlled by Wikimedia Deutschland) from linking to \`de.wikipedia.org\` (controlled by the U.S.-based Wikimedia Foundation) as long as certain information about him is included in the German Wikipedia in the article Lutz Heilmann. Heilmann also filed legal complaints against one Wikipedia editor and two other online writers. According to Focus Online, Heilmann objected to claims that he had not completed his university degree, and that he had participated in a business venture involving pornography. He did however admit that he had served as \\"youth protection officer\\" for an internet sex shop run by a roommate.Linke waschen Schmutzw√§sche, taz, 22 October 2008. The report also suggests that the Wikipedia article had been repeatedly altered in line with his claims by an anonymous user operating within the Bundestag building, but Heilmann denied having been involved in an edit war.Focus Online - Wikipedia: Einstiegsseite wegen Klage blockiert, 15 November 2008. In October 2008, some German newspapers reported that Heilmann was under investigation for having threatened a former roommate and that the committee on immunity of the Bundestag had lifted his immunity in the matter.Schmutzkampagne in der Linken: Jetzt ger√§t Heilmann unter Beschuss , L√ºbecker Nachrichten, 21 October 2008. Heilmann denied this and had a counter statement published.Gegendarstellung by Heilman, HL-live.de, 22 October 2008. (According to Die Tageszeitung charges were filed due to attempted coercion (\\"versuchte N√∂tigung\\"). Heilmann's response fits this explanation as he states that the committee on immunity of the Bundestag has dealt on 17 October with the matter in question related to short messages he sent to his former roommate.) This matter was reported in Heilmann's Wikipedia article.Bundestagsabgeordneter l√§sst wikipedia.de sperren, Heise Online, 15 November 2008.

It is one of the Central Armed Police Forces under the administrative control of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). As of 2019, it has 94,261 active personnel in 73 battalions. The force was originally set up under the name Special Services Bureau in 1963 in the aftermath of the Sino-Indian War to strengthen India's border areas against enemy operations. The civil wing of the SSB, comprising 1,800 personnel, was transferred to the Intelligence Bureau in 2018.1,800 SSB personnel to move to IB for special ops, Business Standard, 18 December 2018. ==History== The Sashastra Seema Bal was originally set up under the name Special Services Bureau (also abbreviated SSB) on 20 December 1963, following the Sino-Indian War of 1962. The primary task of the force was to provide armed support to the foreign intelligence division of Intelligence Bureau, which later became Research and Analysis Wing (after its creation in 1968). The secondary objective was to inculcate feelings of national belonging in the border population and assist them in developing their capabilities for resistance through a continuous process of motivation, training, development, welfare programmes and activities in the then NEFA, North Assam (the northern areas of the Indian state of Assam), North Bengal (the northern areas of the Indian State of West Bengal) and the hills of Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Ladakh. The programme was later extended to Manipur, Tripura, Jammu in 1965; Meghalaya in 1975; Sikkim in 1976; the border areas of Rajasthan and Gujarat in 1989; Manipur, Mizoram and further areas of Rajasthan as well as Gujarat in 1988; South Bengal (the southern areas of West Bengal); Nagaland in 1989; and the Nubra Valley, Rajouri and the Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir in 1991. Its primary purpose was to counter an act of aggression by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The previous thinking had been that, militarily, the Chinese were \\"superior\\" to India and in the event of a war, the Chinese might attempt to overwhelm Indian forces. So, in 1963, a unique force was created, which would, in the event of such an attempt by the Chinese to invade and occupy Indian territory, merge with the border population, donning civilian attire, working a parallel administration and carry out the war of India with the help of guerrilla tactics. The SSB model proved an enormous success, evident by what it had achieved in training the Mukti Bahini in Bangladesh and other places, COIN Op's in the north-east and in its ability to provide security at high peaks during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 as well as during the Kargil War. From the Cabinet, the SSB was transferred to the Ministry of Home Affairs and assigned the duties of manning the Nepal and Bhutan borders. The SSB was renamed the Sashastra Seema Bal, in accordance with its new role, and would come under the administrative control of the Ministry of Home Affairs in January 2001. This was done after the Kargil War with the adoption of the \\"one border one force concept\\". The SSB claims to have presented a \\"benign face\\" of the government in border areas and that this was appreciated by the people of those areas.Sashastra Seema Bal, india.gov.in. Pursuant to the recommendations of a group of ministers on reforming the national security system, SSB was declared as a Border Guarding Force and Lead Intelligence Agency (LIA) for Indo-Nepal border (June, 2001) and assigned the task of guarding the 1751 km long Indo-Nepal border along the states of Uttarakhand, (263.7 km with 3 districts), Uttar Pradesh (599.3 km‚Äîwith 7 districts), Bihar (800.4 km‚Äîwith 7 districts), West Bengal (105.6 km‚Äîwith 1 district) and Sikkim (99 km). In March 2004, SSB was assigned the task of guarding the 699 km stretch of Indo-Bhutan border along the states of Sikkim- (32 km), West Bengal (183 km‚Äîwith 2 districts), Assam (267 km‚Äîwith 4 districts) and, Arunachal Pradesh (217 km‚Äîwith 2 districts). Since then SSB was re-christened into Sashastra Seema Bal and reached new heights. SSB is the first border guarding force that has decided to recruit women battalions. It is doing excellent job as Border Guarding Force on Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan Border. SSB is also engaged in Counter-Insurgency operations in Jammu and Kashmir and Anti-naxal operations in Jharkhand, Bihar and Chhattisgarh. It is also performing internal security duties i.e. Election duties and law and order duties in different parts of India. SSB celebrated the year 2013 as Golden Jubilee year marking 50 years of its raising. The celebrations have commenced with the Flag-off of a Mount Everest Expedition on 2 April 2013 from Delhi. The team led by Commandant Somit Joshi successfully reached at the peak at about 9:45 a.m. (IST) on 21 May 2013 to commemorate the 50th anniversary. In 2014, the government of India approved the recruitment of women as combat officers in SSB. ==Role== The previous role of the Special Service Bureau was to motivate and mobilise India's border population for national security during times of peace as well as war and to promote a sense of security and brotherhood among the population, in furtherance of national integration. Its present-day role consists of preventing cross-border crime and smuggling as well as other anti- national activities. In pursuit of achieving this mandated task, the SSB has been conferred with certain powers under the Criminal Procedure Code of 1973, the Arms Act of 1959, the NDPS Act of 1985 and the Passport Act of 1967. The Government of India also contemplates conferring additional powers under the Customs Act of 1962. These powers are to be exercised within a belt of 15 km in the states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, running along the Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan borders, as well as in any other area of SSB operation. ==Organisation== The All India Police Hockey Championship, organized by the Sahastra Seems Bal. Above, Sankar Baruah the DG of the Assam Police receives the ceremonial salute. Prior to 2001, the force was known as the Special Service Bureau (SSB). As per its revised role, the uniform wing worked under the operational command of civilian officers. It was in 1985 that a 15% quota of Area Organisers, for promotion to the rank of Deputy Inspector-General, was given to the Commandants of the uniform wing. The civil wing worked in the Area of Operations (AOPs) along the Indo-Tibet and Indo-Pakistan border. Recruitment in uniform wing would be from among Indian youth of the border area who have undergone advanced training in guerrilla warfare and also selected by the respective operational commander such as by the Divisional Organiser, Area Organiser, Sub-Area Organiser and Circle Organiser. The Divisional Organiser was equivalent in rank to that of Inspector-General of Police, specifically earmarked for the respective AOPs to which they belonged and were activated by. The repercussions of the closure of the old role have been debated and deliberated in the defence establishments and now the relevance of the old role of SSB has been realised for the security of the border area, as such a role is likely to be revived. The highest-level headquarters of the force is Force Headquarters (FHQ), also called the Directorate-General of SSB, located in the Indian capital of New Delhi. Force Headquarters (FHQ) is commanded by an officer of the rank of Director-General. The Director-General is assisted by the Additional Director-General. Various Directorates including Operations and Intelligence, Personnel and Training, Administration, Provisioning and Communication, Medical, as well as others, function under the DG. Each Directorate is headed by an IG and assisted by a DIG and other officers. Frontier Headquarters (FTR HQ) is commanded by an officer of the rank of Inspector-General (IG), who is placed next in the chain of command after the FHQ. FTR HQR, in turn, exercises command and control over the sector HQs. The SSB Battalion, is commanded by an officer of the rank of Commandant and who is assisted by officers of the rank of Second-in-Command, Deputy Commandant and Assistant Commandant. The battalion is further divided into Companies and Border Out-Post (BOP). There are seven companies in a battalion, each company consisting of three border outposts. The company is commanded by an Assistant Commandants and the BOP is commanded by Sub-Inspectors. == Ranks == Present rank structure is as follows: ===Combatised wing=== * Gazetted Officers (GOs) # Director-General # Special Director General # Inspector-General # Deputy Inspector-General # Commandant # Second-in-Command # Deputy Commandant # Assistant Commandant * Non-Gazetted Officers (NGOs) # Inspector # Sub- Inspector # Assistant Sub-Inspector # Head Constable # Constable ==Recruitment== # Assistant Commandants‚ÄîAssistant Commandants are appointed (as officers are appointed and personnel below officer are recruited in any government organization) through a Competitive Examination conducted by Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) along with Assistant Commandants(Comn) recruitment conducted by SSB.

It was used for glider operations during World War II and later revived for civilian operations. It is currently disused, though some buildings survive. Today it serves as a visual reference point (VRP) for VFR flights, in particular NW departures from Bournemouth Airport. ==History== Building of the airfield commenced in May 1942, the airfield being intended for the use of airborne forces of 38 Wing. On 17 May 1943 the base was handed over while still unfinished. Glider operations finally started in October 1943 and continued until 1945. Horsa gliders from Tarrant Rushton left for France on the eve of D-Day, to begin Operation Tonga with an action that would later become known as Pegasus Bridge. Among the glider pilots was Jim Wallwork, on a Horsa nicknamed Lady Irene. The Tarrant Rushton gliders landed in occupied France shortly after midnight. Wallwork's aircraft was the first to touch down, but it landed heavily: the force of the impact catapulted both Wallwork and his co-pilot John Ainsworth through the front of the cockpit. Although stunned, this made them the first Allied troops to touch French soil on D-Day. Hamilcar gliders from Tarrant Rushton arrive on Drop Zone 'N' carrying Tetrarch tanks, 6 June 1944. As part of Operation Tonga, a few Tetrarch tanks of 6th Airborne's Reconnaissance Regiment were also flown from Tarrant Rushton in Hamilcar gliders, towed by Halifax bombers, to land on the French coast near the mouth of the Orne river. Bovington tank museum Other gliders were later flown from the airfield to Arnhem to take part in Operation Market Garden. During the closing stages of World War II, aircraft were used for SOE operations. In September 1946 the airfield was placed on Care and Maintenance status until abandoned in December 1947. However, 6 months later, in June 1948, Flight Refuelling Ltd arrived to begin 30 years of occupancy. Almost immediately Flight Refuelling became involved in the Berlin Airlift and, between July 1948 and August 1949, carried out nearly 4500 sorties using Lancastrians and Lancasters. In the following 30 years most activity was centred on conversion of aircraft for in-flight refuelling and drone aircraft development, with FR Aviation refining their \\"Universal Drone Pack\\" on aircraft flown from the air field. The system allowed the test pilot to fly the aircraft from take-off to touch-down using only the push-buttons on a console identical to that of the ground operator of the drone, turning the button pushes into control surface and throttle movements. During this time, Tarrant Rushton was the home of 8 Sea Vixens, among them XP924, (now G-CVIX), the only Sea Vixen to remain in flying condition. In the 70s Flight Refuelling left the airfield and flying operations moved to Hurn. After that, it was only used by gliders and occasionally by light aircraft until it was officially closed on 30 September 1980.

From 1992 he was a full member of Russian Academy of Arts. ==Works== After graduation in 1953, he started a working partnership with fellow student Oleg Savostyuk. Their friendship and collaboration lasted for many years and proved to be a brilliant success, when they made a complete breakthrough in the poster genre by creating a new style inspired by the Russian folk art Lubok ‚Äì brightly coloured stories, sometimes in a primitive style. \\"... The innovative feat of these two artists was that they returned the poster to life as a Work of Art after its death in the 1930s\\" (M. Lazarev).

In the 1960s Uspensky started working with the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, where he was acquainted with the ballet choreographer Yuri Grigorovich and the dancer Vladimir Vasiliev. For the Ballet, Uspensky painted posters and drew illustrations for programmes and libretti, his first poster being Swan Lake for the ballet's tour of France in 1958. Over the next decades he worked on many ballets, including Petrushka, Spartacus, Angara, Ivan the Terrible, Leniniana (after Mayakovsky), Paganini, Chopeniana (les Sylphides), and Romeo and Juliet. This opportunity to see the life of the theatre from the inside, drawing sketches and recording impressions, was decisive in creating a lifelong passion for the artist ‚Äì the ballet. With great enthusiasm he drew and painted ballerinas, danseurs and choreographers in a variety of situations - during and after rehearsals, at the barre, or resting, tired. Uspensky would always return to this theme, working in different media ‚Äì oil, tempera, gouache, pencil, and silk screen prints. The artist also loved the town of Tarusa, his father's birthplace, located on the banks of the river Oka. For hours he would admire the scenery, the vast expanses, the river in fog and rain, and the ancient trees. Uspensky's first wife was prominent Moscow children's book illustrator Marina Uspenskaya. ==Bibliography== * G. Demosfenova, A.

Like other high sheriff positions, it is largely a ceremonial post today. The current high sheriff is Alderman Tommy Sandford of the Democratic Unionist Party, who took office in January 2019. The high sheriff is theoretically the judicial representative of the Queen in the city, while the Lord Lieutenant of Belfast is the Sovereign's personal representative. Today, the office is now largely symbolic with few formal duties other than deputising for the Lord Mayor of Belfast at official events. Irish Nationalists and Republican council members generally do not allow their names to go forward for the nomination as the post is seen as a reflection of the city's imperialist past. Appointments are made on annual basis by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, who asks the outgoing high sheriff and Belfast City Council to suggest the names of three people who are deemed suitable to hold the position. In recent years the council has suggested only one candidate, who is normally a member of the council. The high sheriff's term of office runs from January to December, which is distinct from the term of office for the lord mayor and deputy lord mayor who take up office in May or June each year. Prior to 1900 sheriffs were elected by the city council. ==List of high sheriffs20th century=== * 1900: Sir James Henderson * 1901: Otto JaffeJewishEncyclopedia.com ‚Äì IRELAND * 1902: Samuel Lawther * 1903: Robert Anderson\\"City High Sheriffs\\", Weekly Irish Times, 7 February 1903 * 1904: Henry Hutton\\"City High Sheriffs\\", Weekly Irish Times, 13 February 1904 * 1905: Henry O'Neill\\"New High Sheriff of Belfast\\", Irish Times, 3 February 1905 * 1906: William Frederick Coates * 1907: Peter O'ConnellAnthony C.

He and his younger sister Julie (1793‚Äì1848) received the comital title von Brandenburg in 1794, and were raised with the sons of Hofmarschall Valentin von Massow. His sister married Duke Frederick Ferdinand of Anhalt-K√∂then in 1816. On 18 April 1806, Friedrich Wilhelm joined the Prussian Army by entering the Gardes du Corps regiment and from the next year participated in the Napoleonic War of the Fourth Coalition. In 1812 he achieved the rank of Rittmeister in the staff of Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg, leading the Prussian auxiliary forces in support of the French invasion of Russia. In 1839 he was elevated to Lieutenant general of the VI Army Corps. By 1848, he had distinguished himself in several battles and was a cavalry general. Ministers Brandenburg, Manteuffel, Radowitz During the German revolutions of 1848‚Äì49, in November 1848, King Frederick William IV called him back to Berlin to succeed Ernst von Pfuel as Prussian minister president. The appointment reflected the king's intention to quell the ongoing uprisings. Jointly with Interior Minister Otto Theodor von Manteuffel, he had the revolutionary Prussian National Assembly suppressed and dissolved on December 5, while a reactionary Constitution was decreed. In October 1850, he traveled to the Warsaw Conference to meet with Czar Nicholas and sound out the Russian stance in the Austria-Prussia rivalry. Though he had initially supported the implementation of the Prussian-led Erfurt Union, he shied away from an armed conflict with Austria as State Chancellor Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg was able to strengthen the alliance with the Russian Empire isolating the Prussian side. After his return, Friedrich Wilhelm spoke out against mobilising the Prussian Army as advocated by Foreign Minister Joseph von Radowitz. Shortly afterwards, he took seriously ill and died, it is said from the humiliation of the Czar's abandonment of the Erfurt policy. He was buried in the crypt of Berlin Cathedral. ==Family== Friedrich Wilhelm Count von Brandenburg married Mathilde Aurora von Massenbach on May 24, 1818 in Potsdam (October 24, 1795-March 5, 1885). They had eight children: *Friedrich (1819-1892), Prussian general *Wilhelm (1819-1892), Prussian general *Friedrich Wilhelm Gustav (August 24, 1820-March 9, 1909), Prussian envoy in Brussels and Lisbon *Wilhelmine Charlotte Friederike Julie Alexandrine (November 18, 1821-August 8, 1902), honorary lady in Heiligengrabe *Luise Julie (May 31, 1823-August 24, 1884), honorary lady in Heiligengrabe *Friederike Wilhelmine Elisabeth Mathilde (April 4, 1825-February 26, 1900), she married on May 24, 1847 Maj.

A year later, Meier's parents prompted an investigation into the matter and her suicide was attributed to cyberbullying through the social networking website MySpace. Lori Drew, the mother of a friend of Meier, was acquitted of cyberbullying in the 2009 case United States v. Drew. ==Background== Megan Taylor Meier was born on November 6, 1992, to Christina \\"Tina\\" Meier and Ronald Meier in O'Fallon, Missouri. From the third grade in 2001‚Äì02, after she had told her mother she had wanted to kill herself, Megan had been under the care of a psychiatrist. She had been prescribed citalopram (an antidepressant that has a possible side effect of increasing suicide risk in young people), methylphenidate, and the atypical antipsychotic ziprasidone. She had been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder and depression, and self-esteem issues regarding her weight.Meganmeierfoundation.cwsit.org : Megan's Story She was described by her parents as a \\"bubbly, goofy\\" girl who enjoyed spending time with her friends and family. Meier attended Fort Zumwalt public schools, including Pheasant Point Elementary School and Fort Zumwalt West Middle School in nearby O'Fallon, Missouri. Megan befriended the popular girls so that the boys who picked on her would stop. The girls soon turned on Megan and the bullying got even worse than before. For eighth grade in 2006, her parents enrolled her at Immaculate Conception Catholic School in Dardenne Prairie. Soon after opening an account on MySpace, Meier received a message supposedly from a 16-year-old boy, Josh Evans. Meier and \\"Josh\\" became online friends, but never met in person or spoke. Meier thought \\"Josh\\" was attractive. As Meier began to exchange messages with this person, her family said she seemed to have had her \\"spirits lifted\\". This person claimed to have moved to the nearby city of O'Fallon, was homeschooled and did not yet have a phone number. A 16-year-old male named \\"Josh Evans\\" was registered on the account used for bullying messages to Meier. But Lori Drew, the mother of Sarah Drew, a former friend of Meier, later admitted creating the MySpace account. At the time of the suicide, the Drew and Meier families were neighbors, living four doors apart.Frail egos caught in killer net , The Sydney Morning Herald 30 November 2007. Lori Drew was aided by Sarah and by Ashley Grills, an 18-year-old employee of Lori. Lori and several others ran the hoaxed account. Witnesses testified that the women intended to use Meier's messages sent to \\"Josh\\" to get information about her and later humiliate her, in retribution for her allegedly spreading gossip about Drew's daughter.\\"Exclusive: Teen Talks About Her Role in Web Hoax That Led to Suicide .\\" ABC News.Meganmeierfoundation.cwsit.org \\"Cyber vigilantes on attack ,\\" CNN, December 4, 2007Key events in the Megan Meier case .\\" Associated Press at USA Today. May 15, 2008. Retrieved on August 14, 2009. ===Death and later impact=== On October 16, 2006, the tone of the messages changed. After Megan got home from school, Tina Meier signed onto MySpace for Megan. She was in a hurry because she had to take her younger daughter, Allison, to the orthodontist. Before she could get to the door, Megan was upset. \\"Josh\\" sent troubling messages to Megan, including one that said: \\"I don't know if I want to be friends with you anymore because I've heard that you are not very nice to your friends.\\" More messages of this type were sent, some of Megan's messages were shared with others, and bulletins were posted about her. Tina told her daughter to sign off, and went to the orthodontist. She called her daughter to ask her if she had signed off, and she hadn't. Megan was sobbing hysterically. When her mother got home, she was furious that she hadn't signed off. She was shocked at the vulgar language her daughter was firing back. Megan then told her mother, \\"You're supposed to be my mom! You're supposed to be on my side!\\" and then left from the computer and went upstairs. According to her father Ron Meier and a neighbor who had discussed the hoax with Drew, the last message sent by \\"Josh\\" read: \\"Everybody in O'Fallon knows who you are. You are a bad person and everybody hates you. Have a shitty rest of your life. The world would be a better place without you\\". Megan responded saying, \\"You're the kind of boy a girl would kill herself over.\\" The last few exchanges were made via AOL Instant Messenger instead of MySpace. When she ran upstairs, she ran into her father. She told him about the trouble and went to her room. Ron went downstairs to the kitchen where he and Tina talked about the cyberbullying and made dinner. Twenty minutes later, Tina suddenly froze in mid-sentence, and ran up to Megan's room. Megan Meier had hanged herself with a belt in the bedroom closet. Despite attempts to revive her, Megan was pronounced dead the next day on October 17, three weeks before her 14th birthday.Parents: Cyber Bullying Led to Teen's Suicide: Megan Meier's Parents Now Want Measures to Protect Children Online Nov. 19, 2007 ==InvestigationLocal=== Several weeks after her death, Megan Meier's parents were told that the mother of one of their daughter's friends‚Äîwith whom Meier had had a falling out‚Äîhad created the \\"Josh Evans\\" account. The parent, Lori Drew, who created the fake account, admitted that she and her daughter had the password to the account, and characterized the hoax to a reporter as a \\"joke\\". Initially, Drew denied knowing about the offensive messages that were sent to Meier. She told the police that the account was aimed at \\"gaining Megan's confidence and finding out what Megan felt about her daughter and other people\\". The neighborhood mother who had told the Meiers that Drew had the hoax account said \\"Lori laughed about it\\", and said she had intended to \\"mess with Megan\\". While Drew's name was excluded from most early news stories, CNN disclosed her name through the inclusion of the police report in its broadcast of the story; it was featured on many blogs. It was more than a year between Meier's suicide and the first media report of the Internet hoax. The FBI was investigating the matter and had asked the Meier family to refrain from speaking publicly about it to keep the Drews from learning about their investigation. Shortly after the first anniversary of Meier's death, her aunt, Vicki Dunn, saw an article written by Steve Pokin of the Suburban Journals about Internet harassment. She contacted Pokin to share Meier's story with him. Once the story broke, it quickly spread to national and international news outlets. At a press conference on December 3, 2007, Jack Banas, the prosecuting attorney of St. Charles County, said that Lori Drew's 18-year-old temporary employee, Ashley Grills, wrote most of the messages addressed to Meier and that she wrote the final \\"Josh Evans\\" message addressed to Meier. Grills said she wrote the final message to end the MySpace hoax and get Meier to stop communicating with \\"Josh Evans\\". Banas stated that he did not interview Grills because, at the time, she was under psychiatric treatment for her participation in the Meier case. He did not plan to interview her at a later date. The Meiers criticized the prosecutor's statements, saying that Banas did not interview any party other than the Drews and that Banas was solely relying on the testimony of the Drews. Banas said that the original FBI investigation into the matter, during which Grills was interviewed, established her role in the event. The Meiers have said they do not hold Grills responsible for Megan's death.Collins, Lauren. Friend Game , The New Yorker 21 January 2008. Banas said Sarah Drew, by then 15, was attending a different school and not living in Dardenne Prairie. He said Lori Drew was fearful of telling him where her daughter lives. According to Lori Drew's attorney, she had to close her advertising business in the wake of publicity about her role in the Internet account and messages. Neighbors shunned the Drews following the revelations.. Associated Press at CNN. December 7, 2007. Retrieved on September 8, 2010. Internet webloggers posted photographs, telephone numbers, e-mail details, and addresses of the Drews and the employee on various websites. Businesses that advertised in Drew's coupon book business were also shunned.Hutcheon, Stephen. Net vigilantes target MySpace mum . The Age Sarah Wells, a weblogger who revealed the given and family names of Lori Drew, said, \\"I don't regret naming Drew.\\" After reviewing the case, county prosecutors decided not to file any criminal charges in relation to the hoax. ===Federal=== Lori Drew was indicted and convicted by a jury of violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 2008 over the matter. Her conviction was vacated by a federal judge on a post-trial verdict, on grounds that the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act did not intend to criminalize the conduct of which Drew was accused. The government chose not to appeal this post-trial ruling. ==Reactions== When Megan Meier's story was first reported in the St. Charles Journal, readers were concerned about the unnamed adults implicated in the hoax. Later, the focus was on the decision by the St. Louis Suburban Journals not to print the names of the Drews. In an interview, the reporter said that names had been withheld to protect the minor child in the family. Webloggers learned and reported the names of Lori and Gary Drew, after they found the latter in minutes. Media eventually revealed Lori Drew's name and published her photograph. Banas said he was aware of the national outrage against the Drews, which originated on the Internet in response to the Steve Pokin article in the O'Fallon Journal.\\"UPDATE: No charges to be filed over Meier suicide . Suburban Journals. 3 December 2007. The Drews have had their home and work addresses, phone and cell phone numbers, and aerial photos of their home posted on the Internet. The Drews' property had also been vandalized. Banas said some of these actions against the Drews could constitute Internet stalking. \\"Because we can't prosecute somebody it certainly does not justify violating the law,\\" Banas said. \\"We live in this country by the rule of the law.\\" He described Lori Drew as \\"upset, cautious and guarded\\" when he interviewed her. Banas said that Mrs. Drew felt \\"terrible\\" about Meier's death. A vigil was held for Megan Meier on November 24, 2007. The crowd gathered in a nearby parking lot and walked past the homes of the Meiers and the Drews. A small piece of ground adjacent to the Drews' house was the scene of remembrances by friends of the Meiers. The case has caused several jurisdictions to enact or to consider legislation prohibiting harassment over the Internet. The Board of Aldermen for the City of Dardenne Prairie passed an ordinance on November 22, 2007, in response to the incident. The ordinance prohibits any harassment that utilizes an electronic medium, including the Internet, text messaging services, pagers, and similar devices. Violations of the ordinance are treated as misdemeanors, with fines of up to $500 and up to 90 days imprisonment. The city of Florissant, Missouri also passed a \\"Cyber Harassment\\" law, with other municipalities, counties, and states considering following suit.

Although unsuccessful in her first attempt, Harris performed better than what was expected, coming very close to ousting Flowers. As a result, she tried again for the seat two years later, in 2008. With Flowers out of the seat due to term limits, Harris was seen as a potential victor in obtaining a seat that had been held long by Republicans, including former Republican Speaker of the House Jo Ann Davidson. Harris faced newcomer Brad Lewis, in the general election, in what became a very contested race. The race wasn't decided until a month after election day. After all provisional ballots had been tallied, Harris was announced the winner over Lewis by 735 votes. She went on to take her seat on January 5, 2009. In the House, Harris was often one of the more liberal members of the delegation, supporting labor, anti-bias, domestic violence, children's issues and other Democratic initiatives. As a result, Harris quickly became a top tier target for Republicans for the 2010 cycle. For their candidate, Republicans ran Anne Gonzales a popular mayor of Westerville, Ohio with conservative credentials. Again, Harris was in one of the more contested and closest watched races of the year. Within an overwhelmingly Republican year, Harris was defeated by Gonzales, and the Democrats lost their majority in the Ohio House. As a result, Harris was a one-term Representative.

Rendezvous Shores is a recent development on the lands which were a large grass field between a marine basin and the Rendezvous Tavern, the Tavern was approximately 1150 feet (350.5 m) south from the Lake St. Clair shore and the marine basin, while the adjoining properties were a maximum 800 feet (243.8 m), thus the marine basin jutted out into the southwest corner of Lake St. Clair.

Dislocation creep involves the movement of dislocations through the crystal lattice of the material, in contrast to diffusion creep, in which diffusion (of vacancies) is the dominant creep mechanism. It causes plastic deformation of the individual crystals, and thus the material itself. Dislocation creep is highly sensitive to the differential stress on the material. At low temperatures, it is the dominant deformation mechanism in most crystalline materials.Twiss & Moores (2000), p. 396 Some of the mechanisms described below are speculative, and either cannot be or have not been verified by experimental microstructural observation. ==Principles== Schematic representation of an edge dislocation in a crystal lattice. The yellow plane is the glide plane, the vector u represents the dislocation, b is the Burgers vector. When the dislocation moves from left to right through the crystal, the lower half of the crystal has moved one Burgers vector length to the left, relative to the upper half. Schematic representation of a screw dislocation in a crystal lattice. The yellow plane (Œ£) is again the glide plane, u the dislocation and b the Burgers vector. When the dislocation moves from the back to the front of the crystal, the lower half moves one Burgers vector length to the front, relative to the upper half. ===Dislocations in crystals=== Dislocation creep takes place due to the movement of dislocations through a crystal lattice. Each time a dislocation moves through a crystal, part of the crystal shifts by one lattice point along a plane, relative to the rest of the crystal. The plane that separates the shifted and unshifted regions along which the movement takes place is the slip plane. To allow for this movement, all ionic bonds along the plane must be broken. If all bonds were broken at once, this would require so much energy that dislocation creep would only be possible in theory. When it is assumed that the movement takes place step by step, the breaking of bonds is immediately followed by the creation of new ones and the energy required is much lower. Calculations of molecular dynamics and analysis of deformed materials have shown that deformation creep can be an important factor in deformation processes. By moving a dislocation step by step through a crystal lattice, a linear lattice defect is created between parts of the crystal lattice.Twiss & Moores (2000), pp. 395‚Äì396 Two types of dislocations exist: edge and screw dislocations. Edge dislocations form the edge of an extra layer of atoms inside the crystal lattice. Screw dislocations form a line along which the crystal lattice jumps one lattice point. In both cases the dislocation line forms a linear defect through the crystal lattice, but the crystal can still be perfect on all sides of the line. The length of the displacement in the crystal caused by the movement of the dislocation is called the Burgers vector. It equals the distance between two atoms or ions in the crystal lattice. Therefore, each material has its own characteristic Burgers vectors for each glide plane. === Glide planes in crystals === Both edge and screw dislocations move (slip) in directions parallel to their Burgers vector. Edge dislocations move in directions perpendicular to their dislocation lines and screw dislocations move in directions parallel to their dislocation lines. This causes a part of the crystal to shift relative to its other parts. Meanwhile, the dislocation itself moves further on along a glide plane. The crystal system of the material (mineral or metal) determines how many glide planes are possible, and in which orientations. The orientation of the differential stress determines which glide planes are active and which are not. The Von Mises criterion states that to deform a material, movement along at least five different glide planes is required. A dislocation will not always be a straight line and can thus move along more than one glide plane. Where the orientation of the dislocation line changes, a screw dislocation can continue as an edge dislocation and vice versa. ===Origin of dislocations=== When a crystalline material is put under differential stress, dislocations form at the grain boundaries and begin moving through the crystal. New dislocations can also form from Frank‚ÄìRead sources. These form when a dislocation is stopped in two places. The part of the dislocation in between will move forward, causing the dislocation line to curve. This curving can continue until the dislocation curves over itself to form a circle. In the centre of the circle, the source will produce a new dislocation, and this process will produce a sequence of concentric dislocations on top of each other. Frank‚ÄìRead sources are also created when screw dislocations double cross-slip (change slip planes twice), as the jogs in the dislocation line pin the dislocation in the 3rd plane. ==Dislocation movementDislocation glide=== A dislocation can ideally move through a crystal until it reaches a grain boundary (the boundary between two crystals). When it reaches a grain boundary, the dislocation will disappear. In that case the whole crystal is sheared a little (needs a reference). There are however different ways in which the movement of a dislocation can be slowed or stopped. When a dislocation moves along several different glide planes, it can have different velocities in these different planes, due to the anisotropy of some materials. Dislocations can also encounter other defects in the crystal on their ways, such as other dislocations or point defects. In such cases a part of the dislocation could slow down or even stop moving altogether. In alloy design, this effect is used to a great extent. On adding a dissimilar atom or phase, such as a small amount of carbon to iron, it is hardened, meaning deformation of the material will be more difficult (the material becomes stronger). The carbon atoms act as interstitial particles (point defects) in the crystal lattice of the iron, and dislocations will not be able to move as easily as before. ===Dislocation climb and recovery=== Dislocations are imperfections in a crystal lattice, that from a thermodynamic point of view increase the amount of free energy in the system. Therefore, parts of a crystal that have more dislocations will be relatively unstable. By recrystallisation, the crystal can heal itself. Recovery of the crystal structure can also take place when two dislocations with opposite displacement meet each other. A dislocation that has been brought to a halt by an obstacle (a point defect) can overcome the obstacle and start moving again by a process called dislocation climb. For dislocation climb to occur, vacancies have to be able to move through the crystal. When a vacancy arrives at the place where the dislocation is stuck it can cause the dislocation to climb out of its glide plane, after which the point defect is no longer in its way. Dislocation climb is therefore dependent from the velocity of vacancy diffusion. As with all diffusion processes, this is highly dependent on the temperature. At higher temperatures dislocations will more easily be able to move around obstacles. For this reason, many hardened materials become exponentially weaker at higher temperatures. To reduce the free energy in the system, dislocations tend to concentrate themselves in low-energy regions, so other regions will be free of dislocations. This leads to the formation of 'dislocation walls', or planes in a crystal where dislocations localize. Edge dislocations form tilt walls,Poirier (1976) while screw dislocations form twist walls. In both cases, the increasing localisation of dislocations in the wall will increase the angle between the orientation of the crystal lattice on both sides of the wall. This leads to the formation of subgrains. The process is called subgrain rotation (SGR) and can eventually lead to the formation of new grains when the dislocation wall becomes a new grain boundary. == Kinetics == In general, the power law for stage 2 creep is: \\\\dot\\\\epsilon = A \\\\sigma^m\\\\exp(\\\\frac{-Q_c}{RT}) where m is the stress exponent and Q_c is the creep activation energy, R is the ideal gas constant, T is temperature, and A is a mechanism-dependent constant. The exponent m describes the degree of stress-dependence the creep mechanism exhibits. Diffusional creep exhibits an m of 1 to 2, climb-controlled creep an m of 3 to 5, and glide-controlled creep an m of 5 to 7. === Dislocation Glide === Schematic of internal energy of a dislocation passing through an obstacle when (a) no additional work is provided and when (b) work is provided from the applied stress and thermal energy The rate of dislocation glide creep can be determined using an Arrhenius equation for the rate of dislocation motion. The forward rate can be written as: \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}_{forward} \\\\varpropto \\\\exp(\\\\frac{-(U_0-\\\\delta U)}{kT}) where U_0 is the energy of the barrier and \\\\delta U is the work provided by the applied stress and from thermal energy which helps the dislocation cross the barrier. kis the Boltzmann constant and Tis the temperature of the system. Similarly, the backward rate: \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}_{back} \\\\varpropto \\\\exp(\\\\frac{-U_0}{kT}) The total creep rate is as follows: \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}_{total} \\\\varpropto \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}_{forward} + \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}_{back} Thus, the rate of creep due to dislocation glide is: \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}_{DG} = \\\\varepsilon_0*\\\\exp(\\\\frac{-U_0}{kT})*[-1+\\\\exp(\\\\frac{\\\\delta U}{kT})] \\\\approx \\\\exp(\\\\frac{\\\\delta U}{kT}) At low temperatures, this expression becomes: \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}_{DG} = \\\\varepsilon_0*\\\\exp(\\\\frac{-U_0}{kT})*\\\\exp(\\\\frac{\\\\delta U}{kT}) The energy supplied to the dislocation is: \\\\delta U = \\\\tau b a_s where \\\\tau is the applied stress, b is the Burgers vector, and a_sis the area of the slip plane. Thus, the overall expression for the rate of dislocation glide can be rewritten as: \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}_{DG} = \\\\varepsilon_0*\\\\exp(\\\\frac{-U_0}{kT})*[-1+\\\\exp(\\\\frac{\\\\tau b a_s}{kT})] Thus, the numerator \\\\tau b a_s is the energy coming from the stress and the denominator k T is the thermal energy. This expression is derived from a model from which plastic strain does not devolve from atomic diffusion. The creep rate is defined by the intrinsic activation energy (U_0 ) and the ratio of stress- assisted energy (\\\\tau b a_s) to thermal energy (kT ). The creep rate increases as this ratio increases, or as stress-assisted energy increases more than thermal energy. All creep rate expressions have similar terms, but the strength of the dependency (i.e. the m exponent) on internal activation energy or stress-assisted energy varies with the creep mechanism. === Creep by Dislocation and Diffusional Flow === Creep mechanisms which involve both dislocation creep and diffusional creep include solute-drag creep, dislocation climb-glide creep, and Harper-Dorn creep.  Solute-Drag Creep  Solute- drag creep is characterized by serrated flow and is typically observed in metallic alloys that do not exhibit short-time creep behavior - the creep rate of these material increases during transient creep before reaching steady- state. Similar to solid-solution strengthening, the size misfit parameter between solute atoms and dislocations results in the restriction of dislocation motion. At low temperatures, the solute atoms do not have enough energy to move. However, at higher temperatures, the solute atoms become mobile and contribute to creep. Solute drag creep occurs when a dislocation breaks away from a solute atom, followed by the solute atom \\"catching up\\" to the dislocation. The dislocations are originally pinned into place by solute atoms. After some initial energy input, the dislocation breaks away and begins to move with velocity v. This strain rate, \\\\dot{\\\\epsilon} is : \\\\dot{\\\\epsilon} = \\\\rho b \\\\bar{v} where \\\\rho is the dislocation density, b is the burgers vector, and \\\\bar{v} is the average velocity of the dislocation. When the dislocation velocity is not too high (or the creep rate is not too high), the solute atom can follow the dislocations, and thus introduce \\"drag\\" on the dislocation motion. A high diffusivity decreases the drag, and greater misfit parameters lead to greater binding energies between the solute atom and the dislocation, resulting in an increase in drag. Lastly, increasing the solute concentration increases the drag effect. The velocity can thus be described as follows: v = \\\\frac{D_{solute}\\\\sigma}{\\\\epsilon_{b}^2 c_0} where \\\\epsilon_{b}is the size misfit parameter and c_0 is the concentration of solute. As stress is applied, the dislocation velocity increases until the dislocation breaks away from the solute atoms. Then, the stress begins to decrease as the dislocation is breaking away, so the dislocation velocity decreases. This permits solute atoms to catch up to the dislocation, thereby increasing the stress once more. The stress then increases, and the cycle begins again, resulting in the serrations observed in the stress-strain diagram. This phenomenon is the Portevin-LeChatelier effect and is only observed over limited strain-rate conditions. If the strain rate is high enough, the flow stress is greater than the breakaway stress, and the dislocation continues to move and the solute atom cannot \\"catch up,\\" thus serrated flow is not observed. Schematic stress- strain curve of a material exhibiting serrated flow. The local stress maxima are from the stress required for dislocation to breakaway from the solute atoms pinning them. The local stress minima are from the stress required to move the dislocation with no drag. They are linked by the solute atoms catching up to the moving dislocations by the process described above, resulting in a repetitive motion from local stress maxima to local stress minima. Different types of serrations, dependent on the magnitude of the breakaway stress and flow stress It is also known that \\\\rho \\\\varpropto \\\\sigma^2, which implies dislocation multiplication (an increase in stress increases the dislocation density). Thus, the solute drag creep rate can be rewritten as: \\\\dot{\\\\epsilon}_{SD} \\\\varpropto \\\\frac{D_{sol} \\\\sigma^3}{\\\\epsilon_{b}^2c_0} where it is noted that the diffusion coefficient is a function of temperature. This expression resembles the power law for creep above, with exponent m = 3.  Dislocation Climb-Glide Creep  Dislocation climb-glide creep is observed in materials that exhibit a higher initial creep rate than the steady-state creep rate. Dislocations glide along a slip plane until they reach an obstacle. The applied stress is not enough for the dislocation to overcome the obstacle, but it is enough for the dislocation to climb to a parallel slip plane via diffusion. This is conceptually similar to a high- temperature cross-slip, where dislocations circumvent obstacles via climb at low temperatures. The dislocation motion involves climb and glide, thus the name climb-glide creep. The rate is determined by the slower (lower velocity) of the climb and glide processes, thus the creep rate is often determined by the climb rate. Starting with the general strain rate form: \\\\dot\\\\epsilon = \\\\rho b u_g where \\\\rho is the dislocation density and u_g is the dislocation glide velocity. The dislocation glide velocity is higher than the dislocation climb velocity, u_c. Climb and glide are related via this expression: u_g = (\\\\frac{L}{h}) u_c where L > h L is the distance that dislocations glide in the slip plane and his the separation between parallel slip planes. Considering a model in which dislocations are emitted by a source, to maintain the constant mcirostructure evolution from Stage I to Stage II creep, each source is associated with a constant number of dislocation loops that it has emitted. Thus, to dislocations may only continue to be emitted if some are annihilated. Annihilation is possible via climb, which results in mass transfer between sides of the loop (i.e. either removal of vacancies, resulting in the addition of atoms, or vice versa). Assuming there are Mdislocation sources per unit volume, the dislocation can be rewritten in terms of the average loop diameter L, the climb-glide creep rate is: \\\\dot\\\\epsilon_{CG} \\\\varpropto \\\\frac{ML^3}{h^2} u_c As the microstructure must remain fixed for the transition between these stages, Mremains fixed. Thus, it can be multiplied by the volume per source and remain constant, thus L \\\\cong (Mh)^{-1/2}. The expression for the climb-glide creep rate reduces to: \\\\dot\\\\epsilon \\\\varpropto \\\\frac{ u_c}{h^{3.5}M^{1/2}} As dislocation climb is driven by stress but accomplished by diffusion, we can say u_c \\\\varpropto D_L\\\\sigma where D_Lis the lattice diffusion constant. \\\\sigmacan be expressed in its normalized form, \\\\frac{\\\\sigma\\\\Omega}{kT}, where \\\\Omegais the atomic volume. Thus, the dislocation climb-glide creep rate can be expressed as follows: \\\\dot\\\\epsilon_{CG} = A_{CG} (\\\\frac{D_L}{h^{3.5}M^{1/2}})(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma\\\\Omega}{kT}) where A_{CG} is a constant that encompasses details of the loop geometry. At higher stress levels, a finer microstructure is observed, which correlates to the inverse relationship between \\\\sigma_s and h. If M is independent of stress, which has not be shown yet, the exponent m for this dislocation creep is 4.5 .  Harper-Dorn Creep  Harper‚ÄìDorn creep is a climb-controlled creep mechanism. At low stresses, materials with a low initial dislocation density may creep by dislocation climb alone. Harber-Dorn creep is characterized by a linear steady-state strain rate relationship with stress at constant temperature and as independent of grain size, and activation energies that are typically close to those expected for lattice diffusion.Kumar, Praveen, Michael E. Kassner, and Terence G. Langdon. \\"Fifty years of Harper‚ÄìDorn creep: a viable creep mechanism or a Californian artifact?.\\" Journal of materials science 42.2 (2007): 409‚Äì420. The Harber-Dorn creep rate can be described as follows: \\\\dot\\\\epsilon \\\\varpropto \\\\rho_0\\\\frac{DGb^3}{kT}(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_s}{G}) where \\\\dot\\\\epsilon is the creep rate, \\\\rho_0is the dislocation density, Dis the material diffusivity, Gis the shear modulus, b is the burgers vector, kis the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and \\\\sigma_s is the applied stress. In Harper-Dorn creep, the dislocation density is constant. ==See also== *Creep *Diffusion creep *Dislocations == Notes  Literature == *; 1976: Plasticit√© √† haute temp√©rature des solides cristallins, Eyrolles, Paris. *, 2000: Structural Geology, W.H.

Emilio Guimoye was born in Callao, Peru. His father died when he was 8 years old, his mother when he was 12, which forced him to withdraw from school and work to support his younger siblings. At the age of 14 he decided to go with his siblings to the southern village of Chincha, where he worked to many different trades. In 1915, he rented the Mencia farm in the Pisco Valley and became an agricultural entrepreneur. He undertook agricultural activities in nearly every valley on the country's central and southern coast, and re-invested the profits in other companies, from banking and financial entities to hotels, like the famous Hotel Paracas in Pisco, and real estate investments. In 1954, the Peruvian economy was in crisis. Aware of the country's difficult situation, Guimoye did not hesitate to put his business aside and volunteered as Development Minister for the administration in office at the time, headed by Manuel A. Odr√≠a. By the end of the following year, he had performed very well in office. With a restored economy, and debts paid, he resigned his post. He only yearned to go back to his farming dream: the colonization of the northern Peruvian rainforest. Guimoye was adamant in the belief that the nation's rainforest offered significant economic and social opportunities, and that the nation's future lay in developing this potential. Therefore, instead of retiring, he decided to invest everything he owned in the colonization of Peru's northern rainforest. Guimoye settled in the Bagua area, where he dedicated himself to the cultivation of rice and cotton fields, as well as cattle breeding. However his hopes were frustrated by the Agrarian reform decreed by the left-wing dictatorship of Juan Velasco Alvarado in the 1970s, which paralyzed the initiative he had started. Guimoye died at the age of 97. Not too long after his death, the Peruvian postal service Serpost, printed a limited edition collection stamp, in memoriam and recognition of who was one of the most important pioneers in agricultural property for the Republic of Peru. The Republic of Peru, currently owes to Emilio Guimoye and family members, the amount of US $30'000,000.00 as an indemnification, product of the agricultural reform on which his lands were taken away. ==References== Category:1891 births Category:1988 deaths Category:People from Callao Category:Peruvian Ministers of Economy and Finance Category:Peruvian businesspeople Category:Grand Crosses 1st class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Category:20th-century businesspeople ","title":"Emilio Guimoye"},{"id":"20501609","text":"Takala was a king of Uvea, ruling from 1829 to 1830.

He descended from an ethnic German family on his father's side, but was ethnic Magyar on his mother's side.B√©la K√©ler His father Stefan Keler (17811849) was a principal magistrate of the B√°rtfa city. He comes from the old B√°rtfa burgher's family. His mother Anna B√≥th (17931848) was from the old Hungarian Both de Botfalva noble family. They raised 13 children, Albert's siblings were Frederika, Stefan, Emilia, Antonia, Matilda, Augusta, Apollonia, Ferdinand, Viktor, Josefina, Amalia. The household was German speaking, because the majority of residents of B√°rtfa that time were Carpathian Germans. As a little boy he studied violin with Franz Schiffer in B√°rtfa. He began his school education in 1834 in the Evangelical Lyceum of L≈ëcse. After that he studied in Evangelical College of (, Slovakia), later briefly studied law and philosophy in Debrecen. Soon he left and picked up studies again in Eperjes. After dropping out of law school,p. 458 Lamb (2001) Andrew he worked on a farm where he read a textbook by Johann Georg Albrechtsberger, famous Austrian baroque composer. Than he started practicing the violin. By the time he moved to Vienna, he was good enough to play in the orchestra of the Theater an der Wien. While holding this position, he studied with Simon Sechter. He became leader of the Gungl Band in Berlin in 1854, and the next year succeeded Augustin Lanner in Vienna. From 1856 to 1863, he was Kapellmeister of an infantry regiment in the Vienna garrison. In 1867, he joined the Kur Orchestra in Wiesbaden, where he remained until 1873. In the 1870s, he toured all over Europe. He lived and worked in Eperjes (, where he led a students' orchestra.

Deletionism and inclusionism are opposing philosophies that largely developed within the community of editors of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia. The terms reflect differing opinions on the appropriate scope of the encyclopedia and corresponding tendencies either to delete or to include a given encyclopedia article. Inclusionism and deletionism represent the poles of a spectrum of views, with adherents tending toward either a more relaxed or a more restrictive understanding of Wikipedia's concept of notability. Many users do not identify strongly with either position. \\"Deletionists\\" are proponents of selective coverage and removal of articles seen as poorly defended. Deletionist viewpoints are commonly motivated by a desire that Wikipedia be focused on and cover significant topics ‚Äì along with the desire to place a firm cap upon proliferation of promotional use (seen as abuse of the website), trivia, and articles which are, in their opinion, of no general interest, lack suitable source material for high-quality coverage, or are too short or otherwise unacceptably poor in quality. \\"Inclusionists\\" are proponents of broad retention, including retention of \\"harmless\\" articles and articles otherwise deemed substandard to allow for future improvement. Inclusionist viewpoints are commonly motivated by a desire to keep Wikipedia broad in coverage with a much lower entry barrier for topics covered ‚Äì along with the belief that it is impossible to tell what knowledge might be \\"useful\\" or productive, that content often starts poor and is improved if time is allowed, that there is effectively no incremental cost of coverage, that arbitrary lines in the sand are unhelpful and may prove divisive, and that goodwill requires avoiding arbitrary deletion of others' work. Some extend this to include allowing a wider range of sources such as notable blogs and other websites. To the extent that an official stance existed as of 2010, it was that \\"There is no practical limit to the number of topics it can cover\\" but \\"there is an important distinction between what can be done, and what should be done\\", the latter being the subject of the policy \\"What Wikipedia is not\\". The policy concludes \\"Consequently, this policy is not a free pass for inclusion\\". ==Background== Because of concerns about vandalism and appropriateness of content, most wikis require policies regarding inclusion.Lowell Bryan, Mobilizing Minds: Creating Wealth from Talent in the 21st Century Organization, p. 223, McGraw-Hill (2007), Wikipedia has developed spaces for policy and conflict resolution regarding the disputes for individual articles.Yochai Benkler, The Wealth of Networks, p. 73, Yale University Press (2006), These debates, which can be initiated by anyone, take place on an \\"Articles for deletion\\" page (often referred to by editors as an AfD). Much discussion concerns not only the content of each article in question, but also \\"differing perspectives on how to edit an ideal encyclopedia.\\" At the end of each debate, an administrator judges the quality of the community consensus. Articles that do not require debate can be flagged and deleted without debate by administrators. If the administrator's decision is disputed, then the discussion can be taken to \\"deletion review,\\" where the community discusses the administrator's decision. In controversial cases, the debates can spread to other places on the Internet. A 2006 estimate was that pages about Wikipedia governance and policy entries were one of the fastest- growing areas of Wikipedia and contained about one quarter of its content. ===Positions=== Association of Inclusionist Wikipedians (AIW). Association of Deletionist Wikipedians. The \\"Association of Inclusionist Wikipedians\\" and the \\"Association of Deletionist Wikipedians\\" were founded by administrators. Each has a Wikimedia page listing their respective members, charters and principles. While written in humorous tones, they reveal the perceived importance of Wikipedia held by the members. Inclusionists may argue that the interest of a few is a sufficient condition for the existence of an article, since such articles are harmless and there is no restriction on space in Wikipedia. Favoring the idiosyncratic and subjective, an inclusionist slogan is \\"Wikipedia is not paper.\\" On the other hand, deletionists favor objectivity and conformity, holding that \\"Wikipedia is not Google,\\" a \\"junkyard,\\" or \\"a dumping ground for facts.\\" They argue that the interest of enough people is a necessary condition for article quality, and articles about trivial subjects damage the credibility and future success of Wikipedia. They advocate the establishment and enforcement of specific standards and policies as a form of jurisprudence. According to veteran contributor Geoff Burling, newer members are less likely to have helped delete articles that should have been kept in hindsight, and therefore have learned less about exercising caution in the deletion process. Journalism professor K.G. Schneider has identified the mentality of deletionism as having manifested once the emphasis of the encyclopedia shifted from quantity to quality. ===Responses=== Deletionpedia logo A \\"Wikimorgue\\", in which all deleted articles and their edit histories would be retained, has been suggested as a means to provide greater transparency in the deletion process. A website, Deletionpedia, in fact now has a file of representative deleted pages from February to September 2008. In an effort to promote a middle ground between the two philosophies, the \\"Association of Mergist Wikipedians\\" was created in November 2004, emphasizing the possibility of merging articles together as an alternative to both outright deletion of content and the retention of separate articles for less important subjects. A merge from one article to another is executed by moving the relevant content from the former to the latter, and redirecting the former to the latter. ==Criticism== Documentarian Jason Scott has noted the large amount of wasted effort that goes into deletion debates. Deletion debates may contribute to community disintegration, restriction of information, or a decrease in the rate of article creation that suggests a decrease in passion and motivation amongst editors.Konrad Lischka, October 12, 2007, Wikipedia-Leidenschaft k√ºhlt ab, Spiegel.de Being explicitly called an inclusionist or deletionist can sidetrack the issue from the actual debate. Nevertheless, some have observed that the interaction between the two groups may actually result in an enhancement of overall quality of content. Startup accelerator and angel investor Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham, on a page of \\"Startup Ideas We'd Like to Fund\\", lists ‚ÄúMore open alternatives to Wikipedia‚Äú, in which he laments: > Deletionists rule Wikipedia. Ironically, they're constrained by print-era > thinking. What harm does it do if an online reference has a long tail of > articles that are only interesting to a few people, so long as everyone can > still find whatever they're looking for? There is room to do to Wikipedia > what Wikipedia did to Britannica. Novelist Nicholson Baker recounted how an article on the beat poet Richard Denner was deleted as \\"nonnotable\\", and criticised the behaviour of vigilante editors on Wikipedia in New York Review of Books. The article has since been restored. Such debates have sparked the creation of websites critical of Wikipedia such as Wikitruth, which watches for articles in risk of deletion. Wikinews editor Brian McNeil has been quoted as saying that every encyclopedia experiences internal battles, the difference being that those of Wikipedia are public. In 2009, Wikipedia began to see a reduction in the number of edits to the site, which some called a result of user frustration due to excessive deletionism. ==Notable debates== The notability of the South African restaurant Mzoli's was under scrutiny in Wikipedia as well as outside sources. Specific cases of disputes between deletionists and inclusionists have attracted media coverage. On Valentine's Day 2009, art activists Scott Kildall and Nathaniel Stern created a Wikipedia article called \\"Wikipedia Art\\", which sought to \\"invite performative utterances in order to change\\" what content was acceptable to include in the article itself. If an individual were able to have their remarks regarding the concept of Wikipedia Art published in a source that was acceptable for a Wikipedia citation, it could be cited and included in the article. Deletionists argued that the article's premise‚Äîan art experiment in the form of a Wikipedia article, with the goal of generating controversy among Wikipedia users to legitimize the article itself‚Äîrendered it un-encyclopedic, and inclusionists argued that since the Wikipedia Art article had been referenced by multiple online art journals, it qualified as encyclopedic material. In response, deletionists contended that the sources used to legitimize the article were unreliable regardless of if the article was legitimate in the first place. The article experienced a speedy deletion within 17 hours of creation, in contrast to the normal deletion discussion process that generally takes 7 days. Yale research fellow Claire Gordon called the article an example of the \\"feedback loop\\" of \\"Wikipedia‚Äôs totalizing claims to knowledge\\" in a 2011 Huffington Post report. The article on South African restaurant Mzoli's was nominated for deletion after being created by Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, who said that supporters of deletion displayed \\"shockingly bad faith behavior.\\" The article was kept after a multitude of editors helped work on it. The consequence is that while inclusionists can say the deleting administrator crossed the line, deletionists can say that the process works as notability was established. In February 2007, the nomination of the Terry Shannon article for deletionWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Terry Shannon was ridiculed by The Inquirer. The deletion of the biography of television anchor Susan Peters, the article for the Pownce website and Ruby programmer Why the lucky stiff also sparked controversy. Comic book and science fiction/fantasy novel writer Peter David became involved in a November 2009 discussion on the deletion of actor Kristian Ayre's Wikipedia biography.Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kristian Ayre David took issue with the quality of the discussion and what he perceived as deletionism on the part of some of the project's editors. He wrote about the experience in his \\"But I Digress ...\\" column in Comics Buyer's Guide #1663 (March 2010), remarking that \\"Wikipedia, which has raised the trivial to the level of art form, actually has cut-off lines for what's deemed important enough to warrant inclusion.\\" In attacking the practice in general, David focused on the process by which the merits of Ayre's biography were discussed prior to its deletion, and what he described as inaccurate arguments that led to that result. Referring to the processes by which articles were judged suitable for inclusion as \\"nonsensical, inaccurate and flawed\\", David provided information about Ayre with the expressed purpose that it would lead to the article's recreation.David, Peter, \\"Wiki wha?\\", Comics Buyer's Guide #1663 (March, 2010), p. 82 The article was recreated on January 20, 2010. ===Notable advocates and analysts=== Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger identified himself as an inclusionist, except on certain topics pertaining to sexuality, for his Citizendium project. Wikimedia Foundation executive director Katherine Maher also identifies as inclusionist. Andrew Lih, a deletionist-turned- inclusionist, observes a cultural shift from Wikipedia's initial expansion in that it has become more cautious. He changed his position when an article he created about the social networking website Pownce was speedily deleted by another administrator as advertising. ==Subjects of deleted articles== In July 2006, The Inquirer was offended by claims made by certain Wikipedia editors that it conspired with Everywhere Girl to create her phenomenon. They observed an apparent campaign to remove all references to Everywhere Girl on Wikipedia. Later, they found it contrary to common sense that what became included on Wikipedia was their series of reports on the deletions of the Wikipedia article. In December 2006, writer and composer Matthew Dallman found that Wikipedia's biography of him was under debate, and became drawn to the vote counts. He was deciding to not participate on his own behalf because of Wikipedia's apparent dislike of self-promotion, saying that \\"It's like I'm on trial and I can't testify,\\" though he would not be able to resist the urge. Andrew Klein was disappointed that the article on his webcomic Cake Pony was deleted, despite his claims that the \\"article contains valuable and factual information about a popular internet meme.\\" He conceded that \\"it's their site and you've got to play by their rules.\\" Many other webcomic-related articles were deleted in fall 2006 to criticism by their artists. Slate.com and The Wall Street Journal writer Timothy Noah documented his \\"career as an encyclopedia entry,\\" and questioned the need for rules on notability in addition to rules on verifiability. Also published by The China Post on 2007-03-03. ==Scholarly research== At the 2005 Digital Arts and Culture Conference, the two groups were discussed as examples among \\"Eventualism\\" and \\"Immediatism\\" in a successful large-scale architecture of participation. The Institut national de recherche p√©dagogique (National Institute for Educational Research) in France, in case studies of Wikipedia, reported that while it was difficult to measure the influence of the groups as of April 2006, their existence is indicative of Wikipedia's internal dynamics consisting of multiple identities, and may play progressively increasing roles. Deletion debates over an article on Enterprise 2.0 sparked a study by the Harvard Business School. In the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, a study of Wikipedia's social dynamics called inclusionism and deletionism the two most prominent associations within Wikipedia. They observe that users in the same role (administrator, etc.) may hold different perspectives, and that \\"the diversity of member [information quality] preferences and the low cost of forming or switching associations may encourage schism in an existing association or evolution of new groups.\\" At the same time, the associations may help to better critique existing policies and to find and achieve points of convergence. ==Other language Wikipedias== Since each language Wikipedia sets its own notability standards, these have in some cases diverged substantially. The German Wikipedia is said by one journalist to be dominated by \\"exclusionists\\" whereas the English Wikipedia is \\"inclusionist\\";Kai Biermann, Die Zeit, 23 October 2009, Die Diktatur der Relevanz although it is pointed out that the English Wikipedia has for several years required users to create accounts to create articles, which German Wikipedia does not.Torsten Kleinz, c't, 30 October 2009, Wikipedia: Der Kampf um die Relevanz A debate in late 2009 over inclusion of several articles led to criticism in the German blogosphere of such vehemence and volume that the German Wikimedia held a meeting with several bloggers and German Wikipedia administrators regarding the German Wikipedia's notability criteria, and issued a press statement. ==See also== * * Digital preservation * Systemic bias in Wikipedia * Modern biblioclasm ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * ==External links== * Conflicting Wikipedia Philosophies at Wikimedia Meta Wiki * Deletionism at Wikimedia Meta Wiki * Exclusionism at Wikimedia Meta Wiki * Inclusionism at Wikimedia Meta Wiki * Similar concepts: Immediatism and Eventualism * Keep history * Association of Deletionist Wikipedians at Wikimedia Meta Wiki * Association of Inclusionist Wikipedians at Wikimedia Meta Wiki * Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information, a Wikipedia policy cited by deletionists * Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia, a Wikipedia policy cited by inclusionsists * Watching Wikipedia's Extinction Event From A Distance * 40% of Wikipedia is under threat from deletionists Category:Wikipedia Category:Internet censorship Category:Digital preservation Category:Criticism of Wikipedia ","title":"Deletionism and inclusionism in Wikipedia"},{"id":"20501633","text":"Patrick McCabe Buckley (born 12 August 1946) is a Scottish former footballer, who manages Musselburgh Youngstars 17s and played for Wolverhampton Wanderers, Sheffield United and Rotherham United. ==Career== Buckley began his career at Third Lanark in his native Scotland before joining English First Division side Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1964.

These valleys include Teesdale and Weardale. The area covers roughly one third of County Durham and is its least populous area. ===Settlements=== There are just a few market towns within the area‚ÄîBarnard Castle, Consett, Middleton-in-Teesdale, Stanhope, Tow Law, and Wolsingham,‚Äîthough some also consider the Durham Dales to extend as far east as Bishop Auckland and Crook. There are a number of small villages in the area, which in general tend to be sparsely populated and spread out, in great contrast to much of the rest of County Durham. ===Geology=== Like much of the North Pennines, the Durham Dales form an anticline, with carboniferous limestone exposed at the surface. The Durham Dales, like much of the Pennines, have long been exploited for their rich mineralogical resources, notably lead and ironstone. ===Ecology=== Many of the high hills are occupied by moors with peat-mosses, the higher ground being uncultivable and barely fit for pastures. As with much of the landscape of the Pennines, they are generally upland areas of high moorland indented by the more fertile valleys of various rivers and streams. The Durham Dales constitute the principal watershed for the county of Durham, as well as contributing to those of the neighbouring counties of Cumbria, Northumberland and North Yorkshire. The rivers Wear, Tees and Derwent all rise in the Durham Dales and flow eastward towards the North Sea. The Derwent helps to form County Durham's northerly border, and the Tees traditionally its southern border. Along the course of the Tees are the three attractions of the High Force, Low Force and Cauldron Snout waterfalls. * ","title":"Durham Dales"},{"id":"20501669","text":"Soane-Patita Vaimua Lavelua was a king of Uvea, ruling from 1826 to 1829, and again 1830 to 1858.

It incorporated watercourses for aesthetics by engineering new channels for the canalised Kennet which has its catchment in rural south-west Berkshire and east Wiltshire. ==History== Kennet Island's homes developed by St James' Homes, part of Berkeley Group and the first properties were sold early 2007. Plans included a traffic circle allowing easier access from the A33 dual- carriageway onto the estate itself. The Kennet Island development continued to be financially successful for Berkeley Group during the 2008 recession. The development saw three phases, the last coinciding with an expansion of Prudential plc building offices in a nearby estate. Many homes have been available under a Government-backed initiative: My Choice Homebuy and Part Ownership Scheme aimed at giving first-time buyers a chance to get on the property ladder. There are three Housing Associations managing the social housing and part ownership housing in the Kennet Island Development; Radian, Metropolitan Thames Valley & Sovereign. ==Amenities== Kennet Island has a central Piazza, including social meeting locations, seating and water features. Located around the Central Piazza are a range of local businesses, including; Fidget & Bob a locally run cafe and bar, a local shop and convenience store, Hallmark Property Management's office for the management of the Kennet Island Development, a Little Kingdom child day care and nursery and meeting point room.

Warwick Middle School was opened in 1971, which removed students in grades six through eight, leaving the current ninth- through twelfth-grade configuration. The school district now has four elementary schools for grades K-12: Lititz Elementary, John Beck Elementary, Kissel Hill Elementary, and Bonfield Elementary. The school district has recently renovated the middle school and high school campus, which has provided several new athletic fields for various sporting events. The district is known for its field hockey program, which has produced several Division 1 athletes. ===Fine arts=== The school is known for the strength of its music program, notably its marching band, which won three consecutive championships in the Cavalcade of Bands competition circuit from 2006 to 2008. In addition to success of the high school's curricular music program, many students also participate in a student-run organization called Club for the Integration of the Arts (CIA). Its main event, the coffeehouse, attracts upwards of 200 students (roughly 180 in 2010). The proceeds of this fundraiser are used to fuel art projects and curricula both within the school itself and elsewhere. In 2010 proceeds were donated to Blackfeet Indians in Browning, Montana to help fund their initiative called \\"Sacred Grounds\\", an event similar to the CIA's coffeehouse. ==ControversiesSchool mascot=== The high school's current mascot depicts the profile of a Native American warrior. Since 1999, Lititz residents, teachers, and students have criticized the mascot both for being a racist stereotype and for misrepresenting a Native American religious symbol. The campaign to eliminate the mascot resurfaced during the 2009-2010 school year, as the district renovated the high school's football field; plans called for a spear design in the center of the field. In 2010, the district removed the warrior logo from the school's sign, replacing it with a black- and-red seal featuring the letter \\"W\\". The warrior image has been used less frequently since 1999. Since then, residents have suggested to the school board that the mascot be changed to something representative of Lititz, such as \\"Wilbur Buds,\\" a well-known product of the local Wilbur Chocolate Company. ===2007 racism incident=== Warwick High School received press coverage on October 11, 2007, after three white students allegedly yelled racial slurs at minority students outside of the school building. As a result, the students were suspended, and Confederate flags were banned on school property. Several other incidents also occurred in the following days.

The small elevated residential community occupies a conservation area circled by Earlswood and wooded Redhill Common which is connected along two low to mid rise streets with typically woodland-style gardens to Reigate. St John's is in its wider definition one of the three ecclesiastical parishes that make up Redhill. The area around St John's School and Church had very small beginnings but at one time grew so rapidly it was thought that it was the nucleus of a new town. == St John's School == The history of St John's Schoolhttp://www.stjohns- redhill.surrey.sch.uk began on 21 August 1840 when a decision was taken at a parish vestry meeting to claim compensation from the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company for the loss of grazing and other rights when it built the railway across common land in the Manor. Four years later the churchwardens were holding a meeting to decide what to do with ¬£535.7s thus obtained. The decision was to spend one third of it on the poor rate and two thirds on building a National School at St John's. The Schools (Boys', Girls' and Infants') opened in 1845 and St John's, now in the form of a Community Primary school, is still going strong. More on the history of St John's and the School can be found here, the School's website also provides more information about the school. == Church of St John the Evangelist == The church is Anglican and in the mid-higher category over the standard grade, Grade II*. The first version of the building herehttp://www.stjohnsredhill.org.uk was built, on a prominent site on a spur of the North Downs, to designs by James Thomas Knowles (1806‚Äì1884), father of Sir James Knowles, in 1843. To this aisles were added to designs by Ford & Hesketh 1867. The great change came in 1889, when John Loughborough Pearson was called on to remodel the church. He replaced the original building with a new nave and chancel, retaining the 1867 aisles, and in 1895 he added a new south-west steeple. The Pearson work is faced externally with stock brick with stone dressings, contrasting with the flint facings of the aisles. Pearson's building is typical of his major churches, and shares characteristic features with such buildings as St Stephen, Bournemouth, All Saints, Hove, St Augustine, Kilburn and St John, South Norwood. The nave has five bays with arcades and clerestory. The west entrance is under a stone vaulted gallery and the timber roof is supported on stone transverse arches carried on shafts attached to the older arcade pillars. The three-bay chancel is narrower, the space being occupied by passage aisles for the western two bays, separating the chancel from a chapel on the south and organ chamber on the north. The south-west steeple rises to 185 ft. The tower has shallow set-back buttresses and a short octagonal spire with corner spirelets and single lucarnes. The eight bells are by Mears & Stainbank, 1895, rehung in 1972. The interior is entirely faced with stone. The windows contain an almost complete series of stained glass installed by Clayton & Bell under Pearson's direction. The handsome triptych reredos, designed by Pearson, 1898, with small panel paintings in an elaborate gilded frame, has been recently conserved and regilded. There is a fine iron chancel screen of 1910, and the organ is by Willis, 1897, rebuilt by Hill, Norman & Beard in 1968. The marble pulpit, featuring the raising of Lazarus, and the font, in the form of a kneeling angel, date from 1882. The churchyard wall, of knapped flints, was built in 1867. It is understood that the vestry was erected by F L Pearson after his father's death, but probably following his plans. It stands alongside the organ chamber, which forms an eastward extension of the North aisle, with a three-light window with Geometrical traces, in the east gable. The vestry consists of a western section forming the choir vestry, gabled at right-angles to the aisle. with a three-light window in the north gable, and entered by a doorway in the west wall, and a clergy vestry to the east with a flat roof concealed by a straight moulded parapet with an east window of four small equal arched lights. To the west of the vestry is a small extension housing a boiler room. ==External links== * Official website == References == Redhill Category:Hamlets in Surrey ","title":"St John's, Redhill"},{"id":"20501800","text":"West Hampshire\\" Beach as caricatured by Spy (Leslie Ward) in Vanity Fair, June 1895 William Wither Bramston Beach (25 December 1826 ‚Äì 3 August 1901) was an English Conservative politician, who served in the House of Commons for 44 years between 1857 and 1901, becoming Father of the House of Commons until he was run over by a cab. ==Birth and education== Beach was the son of William Beach of Oakley Hall, Hampshire and his wife Jane Henrietta Browne, daughter of John Browne of Salperton Park, Gloucestershire.

Color proofs are valuable guides, but due to the inherent differences between color proofing techniques and printing itself, proofs will match the printed sheet with varying degrees of exactness. Areas that are commonly evaluated at a press check are: * Flesh tones or corporate logo match colors. * Overall color balance across the sheet. * Paper stock (checking for correct color, weight or texture). * Content (looking for missing elements and confirming copy changes). * Registration (checking sharpness, color overlapping, edges of images and screened type). * Physical defects (checking for broken type, odd scratches, hickeys, spots or ghosting). ==Post press check== While some printing jobs are delivered as printed, most printing is usually not complete until it is converted into a \\"finished\\" product. Post press includes various types of finish work such as trimming, embossing, foiling, die-cutting, scoring, folding and bindery. Post press checking can include: * Embossing: Defects that are commonly checked for are un-sharp edges, pinholes, ruptures and \\"halos\\" (shadows around the emboss). * Foil stamping: Defects to be avoided are feathering, color changes, scuffing, peeling and un-sharp edges. * Die- cutting: Defects that are commonly checked for are clean cutting and correct positioning. * Folding/ Bindery: Before the printed sheets are folded or bound it is common to make and review a trimmed dummy of the finished piece.

Among the key features of an adaptive security infrastructure are security platforms that share and correlate information rather than point solutions, so the heuristics system could communicate its suspicions to the firewall.

Rather than adding security to custom applications after they go operational, security models would be created at the design phase of an app. A major change with this model of real- time adaptive security is shifting authorization management and policy to an on-demand service that contains details and policy enforcement that matches compliance and can adapt to the user's situation when he or she is trying to access an application, for instance. ==See also== *Intrusion-detection system *Network intrusion detection system *Sourcefire *IBM Internet Security Systems ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:Computer network security Category:System administration ","title":"Real-time adaptive security"},{"id":"20501820","text":"Lusiano Aisake was a king of Uvea, ruling from 1904 until 1906.

In additional to historical paintings, he created portraits of eminent townspeople and fashionable ladies and was fond of painting flowers.

While the matter of the Immaculate Conception remained a subject of debate between philosophers and theologians, the depiction of Joachim and Anne Meeting at the Golden Gate was sometimes interpreted as a symbolic representation of the conception of Mary. Anne was revered as the avia Christi (grandmother of Christ), matriarch of the Holy Kinship, a devout lay person and exemplary mother. ==Iconography== Museum M Leuven, Sedes Sapientiae Fourteenth-century images of Saint Anne with the Virgin and Child were often modeled on the earlier Sedes Sapiientiae (Throne of Wisdom) motif.

He has created an alternate version of the \\"GARNET CROW\\" songs \\"Crystal Gauge\\" and \\"Mysterious Eyes\\", the latter of which Okamoto had released under the \\"Super Light\\" name. During live performances as a solo artist, Okamoto sometimes plays \\"Garnet Crow\\" songs, or even invites the other Garnet members to appear as guest musicians. In \\"Garnet Crow\\" live performances, Okamoto provides back-up vocals in addition to playing the guitar. From 2002 until 2009 he was the host of the radio show \\"Pastime Paradise\\", which was regularly broadcast on Sunday on the Japanese radio station Alpha Station (FM Kyoto 89.4). In years 2004-2006 he occasionally performed as the lead singer in THURSDAY LIVE at hills Pan Koujou \\"Okamoto Night\\" where he sang his own solo and Garnet Crow songs. In years 2010-2013 he formed with the vocalist and composer of Garnet Crow, Yuri Nakamura subgroup \\"MINIQLO\\". They released four mini studio albums which were sold in limited copies, during their live performances. The albums consist of re-arranged songs from their previously release studio albums. After disband of the band, he regularly appeared in live performances of Doa and Zard as guest musicians and sometimes provided music compositions for several Giza Studio artists. == Discography Studio albums=== {  !No. !Information !Release !Ranking - !1st align=\\"center\\"A First Fine Day align=\\"center\\"20 March 2002 align=\\"center\\" - - !2nd align=\\"center\\"FF/Rewind align=\\"center\\"17 November 2004 align=\\"center\\"39 - !3rd align=\\"center\\"Now Printing... align=\\"center\\"8 December 2010 align=\\"center\\"74 } === Singles === {  !No. !Information !Release !Ranking - !1st align=\\"center\\"First fine day align=\\"center\\"8 November 2000 align=\\"center\\" - - !2nd align=\\"center\\"Sweet√ó2 Summer Rain align=\\"center\\"20 June 2001 align=\\"center\\" - } === Digital Singles === {  !No. !Information !Release - !1st align=\\"center\\"Mysterious Eyes ~Reason P~ align=\\"center\\"4 May 2011 } === Compilations album === {  ! !Album !Release !Track !Ranking - ! align=\\"center\\"Giza Studio Masterpiece Blend 2001 align=\\"center\\"19 December 2001 align=\\"center\\"DISC2 #10 Sweet√ó2 Summer Rain align=\\"center\\"13 - ! align=\\"center\\"GIZA studio Masterpiece BLEND 2002 align=\\"center\\"18 December 2002 align=\\"center\\"DISC2 #11 STRAY BEAST align=\\"center\\"15 - ! align=\\"center\\"Cool City Production Vol.8 GARNET CROW REMIXES align=\\"center\\"25 January 2005 align=\\"center\\"#2 Crystal Gauge ~hitoshi okamoto mix~ align=\\"center\\"Live venue limited release - ! align=\\"center\\"Christmas Non-Stop Carol align=\\"center\\"1 December 2010 align=\\"center\\"#6 Angels We Have Heard on High align=\\"center\\"71 } === Live DVD === {  !No. !Information !Release !Ranking - !1st align=\\"center\\"Bootleg align=\\"center\\"12 December 2012 align=\\"center\\" Limited sale } ==List of provided worksComposer and arranger=== *Band- Maid: Before Yesterday, Time *Grram: Kimi ja Nai!

Corner to accommodate species of club and coral fungi that were similar to species in the Clavariaceae, but whose context hyphae were uninflated. As well as the genus Aphelaria, Corner included the small genera Corticirama, Phaeoaphelaria, and Tumidapexus within the Aphelariaceae.

The family contains a group of corticioid fungi that form thin, web-like basidiocarps. Some species form asexual anamorphs producing chlamydospores. All are believed to be wood-rotting or litter-rotting saprotrophs. None is known to be of any economic importance. ==TaxonomyHistory=== The name Botryobasidioideae was first introduced as a subfamily of the Corticiaceae in 1958 by Swedish mycologist John Eriksson, but was not fully described and validly published until taken up by Estonian mycologist Erast Parmasto in 1968. Parmasto placed the genera Botryobasidium (together with the anamorphic genus Oidium) and Uthatobasidium within the subfamily, noting that they shared certain \\"primitive\\" characters linking them to the Ceratobasidiaceae and Tulasnellaceae. In 1982 J√ºlich raised the subfamily to the rank of family, as the Botryobasidiaceae, and placed it in a new order, the Botryobasidiales (which also included the family Botryohypochnaceae). A standard 1995 reference work included within the Botryobasidiaceae the corticioid genera Botryobasidium, Botryodontia, Botryohypochnus (considered a synonym of Botryobasidium), Candelabrochaete, Suillosporium, and Waitea, based mainly on similarities in their basidiocarp micromorphology. The family was placed in the order Stereales. ===Current status=== Molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, has confirmed the Botryobasidiaceae as a separate family, but restricted to the genera Botryobasidium and its anamorphs together with Botryohypochnus (if distinct). The family is placed alongside the Ceratobasidiaceae and Tulasnellaceae within the order Cantharellales. Genera previously included within the Botryobasidiaceae have now been placed in the Corticiales (Waitea), Hymenochaetales (Botryodontia), and Polyporales (Candelabrochaete). The disposition of Suillosporium is as yet unknown. ==Habitat and distribution== According to a 2008 estimate, the Botryobasidiaceae contains around 80 species worldwide. Species are assumed to be wood- and litter-rotting saprotrophs and are typically found on the undersides of fallen, rotting branches in woodland leaf litter. Basidiocarps are thin and ephemeral.

George and his wife Barbary Burket were therefore likely the first European occupants of a structure at Lot 17. Presumably this original structure was torn down and replaced by subsequent owners with the current structure dating to 1795. Michael Fouke purchased the property and its improvements in 1773 for ¬£22 and held it through the American Revolution and into the early nineteenth century when he sold his claim to his sons and daughters. Fouke is known to have practiced carpentry in the Shepherdstown area in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century which could indicate he was responsible for the construction of the circa 1795 structure. Beyond his role as a carpenter, little has been recorded of his life, yet one account puts Fouke at the launch of James Rumsey‚Äôs steam-powered boat on the Potomac River in 1787 where he exclaimed, \\"Why, sir, she could navigate through the Strait of Gibraltar.\\" Michael Fouke sold his ownership of the lot and its improvements to his children in 1810, but it is reasonable to assume he maintained residence in Shepherdstown with his children as they later preserved a life estate for him. With the vested interests in the home, George, Charles, John, Frederick, Michael, Christian, Phillip, and Elizabeth decided to sell their claims to the property to Conrad Shindler. One deed on November 29, 1813 retained the aforementioned life estate for George's father, Michael Fouke Sr. This insured a home would be provided for the remainder of the elder Fouke's life. On April 17, 1815, Conrad Shindler gained full ownership of the property when he made a final purchase of claims on Lot 17 from John Fouke for $70. Incidentally, out of the original group of Michael Fouke's children who purchased the property in 1810, Charles and Phillip never sold their portion of the property, likely due to their death or some other calamity. Nonetheless, by April 1815, Conrad Shindler, a coppersmith and the son of a German immigrant, was the rightful owner of Lot 17 for the combined sum of $530. Conrad Shindler's association with the building lasted officially from 1815 until May 8, 1852 when he died of natural causes. ==Conrad Shindler== Conrad Shindler 1840 Conrad Shindler was born in 1778, the son of Georg Conrad Shindler Sr. of York, Pennsylvania who was a Revolutionary War veteran of the York County Militia. His father made the trip from York County to Berkeley County, Virginia in the early part of the 19th century to settle in the region. Less than a decade later, Conrad Jr. purchased property in Shepherdstown on April 27, 1801, identified as Lot 3. Shindler was a coppersmith, working at a yet undocumented forge in the rear of Lot 17. An original Shindler copper kettle is on display at the Historic Shepherdstown Museum in the Entler Hotel. From the 1815 Jefferson County Personal Property Tax lists it is evident that Shindler owned slaves from the outset of his stay at Lot 17. By 1835 these tax records show Shindler owning three slaves of unmentioned value or sex. By his death in 1852, a full assessment of his personal property was performed in accordance with his last will and testament. The assessment shows that Shindler owned seven slaves of varying ages and sex. Whether or not these slaves occupied the building at Lot 17 is not known; Shindler also owned two tracts of farming land outside town where they may have lived and worked. After Shindler died, his property passed to his wife, Elizabeth Shindler, who is recorded in the 1869 Census as a 78-year- old woman living with her eldest son, John. When Mrs. Shindler died in 1869 her property passed to Conrad Shindler's heirs: John C. Shindler, George L. Shindler, Mary E. Bragonier, R.D. and Mary Shindler (of Nacogdoches, Texas), N.F. Hebb, and Eliza Hebb (of Sharpsburg, Maryland). These heirs sold their ownership of the property on October 28, 1869 to the \\"Trustees of the Reformed Church of Shepherdstown.\\" This transaction and sale was never advertised in any local newspaper, and it is assumed that since Shindler's heir Mary E. Bragonier was married to the minister of this church this deal was in the works before Mrs. Shindler's death. ==Recent history== Under the auspices of the Reformed Church of Shepherdstown, later known as Christ Reformed Church, the property was used as a parsonage and, in subsequent years, for tenant dwelling. The property was owned by Christ Reformed Church until 1995 when it was placed on the market for sale by its trustees. Actress Mary Tyler Moore, a descendant of Conrad Shindler, purchased the property to create a permanent home for a Civil War Center to be operated by Shepherd College.Redding, Nicholas, (Historical Context Section ‚Äì Historical American Building Survey (HABS) Report) prepared for The Conrad Shindler House ‚Äì Shepherdstown, West Virginia (2006) Image:Water_Table_Original_House.jpgHistoric Flemish Bond and Water Table at the Shindler House (ca. 1795) ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1795 Schindler, Conrad Category:Georgian architecture in West Virginia ","title":"Conrad Shindler House"},{"id":"20502043","text":"Soane Toke was a king of Uvea (Wallis island, South Pacific), ruling for one day on 11 December 1953 .

Dungey started posting to the blog, using the pseudonym Tanta, a family nickname, because she hoped to return to work in the mortgage business. As Tanta, Dungey used her inside knowledge of the mortgage industry and humor to post corrections and analysis of her own about mortgage financing. December 2006 marked her first post to the blog, criticizing a Citigroup report that was confident that the mortgage industry would \\"rationalize\\" in 2007. Her work for the blog included The Compleat √úberNerd, a series of 13 articles that provided an in-depth summary of the mortgage business from origination and servicing, to mortgage-backed securities, negative amortization and foreclosure, which was called a \\"definitive word on the subject\\" by The New York Times.Tanta.

She was quoted by CBS News in April 2008, emphasizing that the subprime mortgage crisis was not the result of the inherent complexity of instruments like collateralized debt obligations, but was caused by excessive leverage that was part of efforts to \\"goose the yield\\" of mortgage securities to offer higher interest rates to investors by creating \\"complex cash-flow structures hedged by complex rate swaps\\".Dunn, Kevin. \\"Leverage And Exuberance\\", CBS News, April 3, 2008.

Built in 1919, registered with the Icelandic license plate A-2, now in a museum The Dixie Flyer was an automobile built in Louisville, Kentucky from 1916 until 1923. Dixie Flyers were marketed under the slogan of \\"The Logical Car.\\"Kimes, Beverly Rae. Standard Catalog of American Cars: 1805-1942 (Iola, WI: Krause Publications, 1996), p.456. They may be classified as Brass Era cars or vintage cars. The origins of the company can be traced back to 1878, when the Kentucky Wagon Manufacturing Company was established. In 1912, the local Electric Vehicle Company was acquired, which marked the entrance of Kentucky Wagon into the automotive field.Kimes, p.456. An electric car called the Kentucky Electric was planned, but did not come to pass. Erroneously, some lists of old automobiles list the Kentucky Electric from the Kentucky Wagon company in this period. The sole electric automotive product of the company was the Urban Electric truck, produced from 1912 to 1916. In 1914, the Hercules Motor Car Company of New Albany across the Ohio River contracted with Kentucky Wagon to build bodies for their cars. Hercules went out of business in 1915, with its assets acquired by Kentucky Wagon. There appear to have been plans to continue the Hercules name, but the Hercules instead formed the nucleus of the new Dixie Flyer in 1916. All cars had four-cylinder engines,Burness, Tad, Monstrous American Car Spotter's Guide, Motorbooks International Publishers, 1986, p.77 originally supplied by Lycoming and later by Herschell-Spillman. Two distinctive features of early Dixie Flyers were their vertical windshields that were integrated into the curved cowl dash, and the spring-mounted radiators. This latter feature was to reduce vibration, as well as strain on the chassis. The Shadburne Brothers acquired the company for a very brief period in 1917, but ownership quickly reverted to Kentucky Wagon. The Firefly speedster of 1922 was the sportiest Dixie Flyer, unfortunately, it was their last new model as well. The post-World War I recession claimed another victim in the Dixie Car company. Truck production was also discontinued at this time; however, wagons were still produced for almost another decade. Dixie Flyer, National and Jackson, were all merged into Associated Motor Industries and Corporation in 1923. Dixie Flyers and Jacksons were henceforth discontinued. Many of the last Dixie Flyers were converted to Nationals by simply exchanging the Dixie radiator emblems and hubcaps with National ones. In June 2010 a restored 1922 Dixie Flyer was returned from Melbourne, Australia to Louisville, where it will be displayed at Kentucky Trailer, the successor business to Kentucky Wagon.Yetter, Deborah, 'Dixie Flyer back in Louisville -- for good', Louisville Courier-Journal, July 3, 2010 ==NotesReferences== * Kimes, Beverly Rae and Clark Jr, Henry Austin.

De Boever in 1912. Jan Frans De Boever (Ghent, Belgium, 8 June 1872 - 23 May 1949) was a Flemish Symbolist painter. While considered a successful artist during most of his lifetime, his megalomaniac character made him a solitary and isolated individual. Jan Frans De Boever received his training in Ghent at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts under Louis Tytgadt, whose niece he married. Tytgadt provided him with an introduction to important artistic circles in his city, and he became a recognised celebrity at official exhibitions in Ghent, Antwerp, Brussels, and Li√®ge. From 1909 onwards, he modified his style radically, painting women and prostitutes in morbid and bizarre settings, with skeletons, diabolism, subservient men and eroticism dominating his paintings. These paintings were allegorical and mythological, reflecting romantic imagery and depicting the universal struggle of good against evil.https://www.triggison.com/jan-frans-deboever In 1914 he started to illustrate Charles Baudelaire's \\"Les Fleurs du mal\\" for the wealthy art- collector Speltinckx. Up to 1924, he made approximately 157 gouaches for the poems, though only 86 have been recovered. Once he had discovered his style, a form of Symbolism belonging to the decadent movement, he ignored ongoing artistic developments and drew his inspiration from literature, music, and mythology. He was still inspired by patriotism, creating several paintings concerning the World Wars, displaying death and catastrophe in the Symbolist style. His paintings were very successful until 1935 when he suffered a financial crisis. He reduced his prices and continued to paint in the same Symbolist fashion until his death in 1949. ==References== * Achille Cavens J.F.

The championship was contested each year from 2009 to 2012. It was a revival of the former European Formula Two Championship that was previously run from 1967 to 1984. Organised by MotorSport Vision, drivers competed over 16 rounds at eight venues, in identical cars built by Williams F1, with 400 bhp engines developed by Mountune Racing and supplied by Audi. Formula Two was revived due to the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile's concern that the cost of competing in motor racing at a level to progress directly to Formula One was becoming unreachable for many participants, and the category was re-introduced as a lower-cost alternative for drivers. The FIA tender to supply and operate the Championship was awarded to the British MotorSportVision Racing company, owned by former Formula One racer Jonathan Palmer. Compared to rival series such as GP2 and Formula Renault 3.5, Formula Two cost significantly less per season whilst allowing drivers to prove their skill and develop their racecraft, in identical vehicles designed by a six-man team from WilliamsF1, led by Director of Engineering Patrick Head. The F2 vehicles were assembled and prepared between races at MotorSport Vision's Bedford Autodrome facility, prior to each championship event. In December 2012, MotorSport Vision announced that the series would not be run in 2013. ==The carChassis=== Named after both Jonathan Palmer and Patrick Head, the Williams JPH1 chassis and survival cell is of carbon fibre composite monocoque construction. The car was designed to comply with 2005 FIA F1 Safety Regulations. Head protection conforms to the latest 2009 F1 standards. Amongst many other detailed safety features, roadwheel tethers are incorporated. The aerodynamics have been evolved to produce a high level of downforce, yet without losing too much front downforce when following other cars, to facilitate overtaking. To achieve this, about 40% of the downforce is produced from the underside, with full length ground effect tunnels, similar to a GP2 car. The aerodynamics have been developed using the Williams F1 computational fluid dynamics (CFD) computer simulation which enables many different configurations to be tested without the need to actually build the parts and test in the wind tunnel. The car will have over of downforce at ‚Äì compared with, for example, an F3 car which would generate . ===Powertrain=== The internal combustion engine is a new turbocharged petrol engine based on the Audi 1.8-litre 20 valve block and head, as used in Formula Palmer Audi. Whereas the engine in the FPA car primarily uses standard road car components, the Audi F2 engine has been developed as a pure race engine. Prepared and built by Mountune Racing, the crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons, valves and camshafts are all-new components designed for high strength and light weight. The dry sump system has been re-designed so the engine sits lower than in the FPA car. The turbocharger is an all new Garrett GT35 unit featuring roller bearings for improved response, with an external wastegate with high speed closed loop pneumatic valve boost control for absolutely precise automatic boost control. The engine management system is a Pi Research Pectel electronic engine control unit (ECU), the MQ12, which has more capability than the unit in FPA. For its initial 2009 season, continuous maximum engine power was at 8,250 rpm. The F2 car features a \\"push to pass/defend\\" overboost, with being available for a maximum duration of 6 seconds, available ten times during each race. From 2010, continuous base power was increased to , with an even higher gain from overboost to . The transmission is a new unit designed by Hewland specifically for Formula Two, the TMT. It has six forward speeds, and is operated by steering wheel mounted paddle shifters. The performance of the F2 car is behind a F1 car, but faster than a F3 car. Its closest rival in terms of lap time is a Formula Renault 3.5. ==Race weekend== For each race meeting there was 90 minutes of free practice, one hour of official qualifying, with the race distance being approximately . This increased to 2 x 40 minute races in 2011. All drivers had their cars prepared and entered centrally by MSV. Drivers worked with a single mechanic throughout the season, and a rotating group of engineers. This means that a driver's finances had no effect on performance and no one could gain an unfair advantage as every car was operated by the same team. ==Scoring system== For the 2009 season, the scoring system was 10‚Äì8‚Äì6‚Äì5‚Äì4‚Äì3‚Äì2‚Äì1 for the first eight race finisher. In 2010, Formula Two adopted the same scoring system change as in Formula One, with points awarded to the top ten finishers. Points were awarded the same for both races in the weekend, as follows: { !Position1st2nd3rd4th5th6th7th8th9th10th - !Points251815121086421 } ==Champions== {class=\\"sortable \\" style=\\"font-size:85%; text-align:center;\\" - !scope=colSeason !scope=colDriver !scope=colPoles !scope=colWins !scope=colFL !scope=colPodiums !scope=colPoints !scope=colClinched !scope=colMargin - ! 2009 align=left Andy Soucek  2  7  3  11  115  Race 13 of 16  51 - !2010 align=left Dean Stoneman  6  6  6  11  284  Race 17 of 18  42 - !2011 align=left Mirko Bortolotti  7  7  7  14  298  Race 14 of 16  109 - !2012 align=left Luciano Bacheta  3  5  5  10  231.5  Race 16 of 16  21.5 } ==Television== The races were broadcast by the sports broadcaster Motors TV.

As early as 1907, Sons of Abraham leaders discussed implementing changes to make merging with Shaarai Torah possible. The merger finally took place in 1948. From then on, the synagogue was officially known as Congregation Shaarai Torah Sons of Abraham. ==West Side branch== Shaarai Torah WestBy 1957, roughly 74% of Worcester's 9,333 Jews lived on the tonier west side of the city, leaving less than 1,600 living on the east side.http://www.jewishdatabank.org/Archive/C-MA- Worcester-1957-Summary_Report.pdf Additionally, most west side Jews, who were generally younger and more assimilated than those who remained on the east side, attended Reform Temple Emanuel or Conservative Congregation Beth Israel as Orthodoxy fell out of favor with most upwardly mobile American Jews. On September 10, 1959, Shaarai Torah purchased the former home of Beth Israel at 835 Pleasant Street as a west side branch, naming it Shaarai Torah West. The original building became known as Shaarai Torah East. Shaarai Torah West, affiliated with the Orthodox Union, became an independent congregation on November 9, 1964 and continues to operate to this day. ==Final days== The Providence Street building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

He drew portraits of many Jewish writers and artists, among them Uri Zvi Greenberg.The Mendele Review: Yiddish Literature and Language ==Biography== Berlewi was born in Warsaw to an assimilated Polish Jewish family. He studied art in Antwerp and Paris, and was active in Polish art circles. Supported by his mother, Berlewi studied fine art in Warsaw (1904‚Äì1909), Antwerp (1909‚Äì1910), and Paris (1911‚Äì1912), returning to Warsaw in 1913 to study at the school of design. During World War I he discovered Futurism and Dada, and in 1918 he met the futurist Aleksander Wat and the formist Anatol Stern, fellow Jews whose Polish language verse he later illustrated. In 1918-1922 Berlewi focused on Jewish themes. In 1920 Berlewi attended El Lissitzky's lecture in Warsaw, motivating him to move to Berlin, where in 1922‚Äì1923 he abandoned figurative art for pure constructivist abstraction. In 1922 he participated in the Novembergruppe exhibition. Along with Jankel Adler he was chosen to represent Jewish artists from Eastern Europe at the International Congress of Progressive Artists, where he met El Lissitzky, Viking Eggeling (to whom Berlewi devoted an article published in 'Albatross' in 1922), L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy, Theo van Doesburg, Gerhard Richter, Laszlo Peri and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. In May-Sep 1923 he presented his first Mechano-Faktura compositions in the Novembergruppe section of the Grosse Berliner Kunstaustellung. In November 1923 Berlewi returned to Warsaw, where with W≈Çadys≈Çaw Strzemi≈Ñski he founded the constructivist group Blok. In his review of the exhibition which accompanied the International Congress of Progressive Artists, published in Nasz Kurier, he stated that Expressionism was obsolete and was replaced by Novembergruppe's Dada and by constructivism. In March 1924 Berlewi published his theoretical tract (in progress since 1922) Mechano-Faktura, using mechanical means to create texture, prefaced by the writer Aleksander Wat. Its basic premise rejects the illusion of space in favor of two-dimensionality; color is reduced to black, white, and red, and visual equivalents of images are accomplished by mechanical means using rhythmic arrangements of lines and simple geometrical forms such as circles and squares. Along with the publication he organises the first mechanofaktura exhibition at the Austro-Daimler Automobile Salon. In summer 1924 Berlewi was invited by Herwarth Walden, founder of the Der Sturm magazine and gallery to exhibit his mechanofaktura works in Berlin; the German version of his manifesto was published. Later in 1924 he founded the Reklama-Mechano advertising agency with Wat and Stanis≈Çaw Brucz, which obtained a contract for the Plutos chocolate brochure. In 1926 Berlewi quit his research and returned to figurative art, working as a set designer. In 1927 he settled in Paris along with other Polish and Jewish artists. In 1928-1938 he traveled through Belgium and made a few portraits of the political and literary world until he learned that he was seriously ill and stopped working. In 1942 Berlewi left Paris for Nice, and in 1943-1944 joined the French Resistance. In 1947 he returned to painting. Wanting to \\"reintroduce the object\\", he created still lives inspired by the French masters of the 17th century. Rediscovered by a French critic, Berlewi took part in a major Paris show, Precursors of Abstract Art in Poland (1957). Suddenly appreciated again, he held one-man shows in Berlin (1963, 1964), Paris (1965), and Warsaw (1966). After his death more shows were held in Zurich (1974) and New York (1976, 1978). He died in Paris. ==References External links == * Official site Henryk Berlewi Archive * Henryk Berlewi * 18 Most Important Polish Graphic Designers of the 20th Century * Berlewi's works in Central Jewish Library Category:20th-century Polish painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:Jewish painters Category:Jewish socialists Category:Artists from Warsaw Category:Polish expatriates in France Category:1894 births Category:1967 deaths Category:Polish male painters ","title":"Henryk Berlewi"},{"id":"20502309","text":"Murder in Greenwich is a 2002 American television film directed by Tom McLoughlin. The teleplay by Dave Erickson is based on the 1998 book of the same title by Mark Fuhrman. The Columbia TriStar Domestic Television production debuted on the USA Network on November 15, 2002, and was released on DVD on May 6, 2003. ==Plot== The film is narrated by Martha Moxley (Maggie Grace), whose brutal murder sometime between 10 p.m. on October 30 and the early morning hours of October 31, 1975, remains unsolved in 1997. Mark Fuhrman, a former Los Angeles Police Department detective who gained notoriety during the O.J. Simpson's murder trial, is intrigued by the case and travels to Greenwich, Connecticut to conduct an investigation of his own. Local authorities resent an outsider, especially one with a reputation as tarnished as Fuhrman's, invading their turf. They do everything they can to block Fuhrman's access to official reports. The film alternates between flashbacks of the events leading up to the murder and scenes set in the present day, which chronicle Fuhrman's frustration and interactions with Steve Carroll, the original investigator who grudgingly assists him. Their efforts ultimately bring Kennedy relative and former Moxley neighbor Michael Skakel to justice. ==Cast== * Christopher Meloni ..... Mark Fuhrman * Robert Forster ..... Steve Carroll * Maggie Grace ..... Martha Moxley * Jon Foster ..... Michael Skakel * Toby Moore ..... Thomas Skakel * Liddy Holloway ..... Dorothy Moxley ==Critical reception== Michael Speier of Variety said, \\"Investigative techniques give way to genre cliches in USA's exaggerated Murder in Greenwich. Falling into the telepic trap of sensationalism without savvy, [it] delves into the shallow end of the Martha Moxley-Michael Skakel case, which has plenty more politics, intrigue and confounding history than this execution suggests . . . As Fuhrman, Meloni is macho almost to the point of bogus; whether he's playing the disgraced cop as he really is or how he thinks America sees him is hard to discern.\\" Robert Pardi of TV Guide awarded the film two out of four stars and observed, \\"Despite the assured teamwork of Meloni and Forster, Tom McLoughlin's film . . . fails to build upon its inherently suspenseful elements or extract much juice from the gossipy Kennedy allure. But viewers with little prior knowledge of the case may find themselves caught up in this dismaying tale of justice delayed.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:2002 films Category:2002 television films Category:American films Category:Docudrama films Category:Films scored by Don Davis (composer) Category:Films based on non- fiction books Category:Films directed by Tom McLoughlin Category:Films set in 1975 Category:Films set in 1997 Category:Films set in Connecticut Category:USA Network original films Category:USA Network original programming ","title":"Murder in Greenwich"},{"id":"20502315","text":"Frederico Filipe Teixeira Ribeiro (born 5 April 1982 in Felgueiras), known as Zamorano, is a Portuguese retired footballer.
